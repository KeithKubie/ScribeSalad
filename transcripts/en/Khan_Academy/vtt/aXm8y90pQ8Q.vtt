00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:01.094
- [Voiceover] So, we've been talking about

00:00:01.094 --> 00:00:03.347
the Gettysburg Address which was delivered

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:06.847
by Abraham Lincoln on November 19th, 1863.

00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:09.918
And as were saying in the last video,

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:11.838
it's been about three and a half months

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:14.931
since the Battle of Gettysburg
when this speech is given

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.061
and Lincoln himself is
not even the headliner

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.629
at this ceremony of
dedicating this cemetery.

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:25.885
He is just supposed to give
a few appropriate remarks

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:29.195
while the famous orator
Edward Everett gives the

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:33.027
really bombastic, two hour long speech

00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:34.848
that is going to rile up the crowd

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:38.067
and make everyone understand
the importance of the battle

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:42.004
and the importance of the
cemetery that is being dedicated.

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:46.992
But, somehow, the 272 words
that Lincoln says here

00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:49.879
in the Gettysburg Address
has become one of the most

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.189
famous and important pieces of rhetoric

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:54.880
in American history.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.407
So, in this video, I'd like
to just take a little time

00:00:57.407 --> 00:00:59.353
to read the Gettysburg Address

00:00:59.353 --> 00:01:02.049
and to interpret it, line by line,

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.572
to give a better sense of
what it's trying to say

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.261
and why it's so important.

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:09.066
All right, so let's see
if I can do this justice.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.892
Four score and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:15.705
on this continent, a new nation,

00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:18.509
conceived in Liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.272
that all men are created equal.

00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:24.244
Now we are engaged in a great civil war,

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:26.511
testing whether that nation, or any nation

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:30.308
so conceived and so
dedicated, can long endure.

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:33.472
We are met on a great
battle-field of that war.

00:01:33.472 --> 00:01:36.023
We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:40.568
as a final resting place for
those who here gave their lives

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:43.164
that that nation might live.

00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:47.000
It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.977
But, in a larger sense,
we can not dedicate,

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.666
we can not consecrate,

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.193
we can not hallow this ground.

00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:57.750
The brave men, living and dead,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.764
who struggled here, have consecrated it,

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:03.347
far above our poor
power to add or detract.

00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:06.182
The world will little note,

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:08.541
nor long remember what we say here,

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:10.808
but it can never forget
what they did here.

00:02:10.808 --> 00:02:13.967
It is for us the living,
rather, to be dedicated here

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.044
to the unfinished work
which they who fought here

00:02:17.044 --> 00:02:19.635
have thus far so nobly advanced.

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:22.678
It is rather for us to be here dedicated

00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:25.101
to the great task remaining before us:

00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:28.309
that from these honored dead
we take increased devotion

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.463
to that cause for which they gave

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:32.619
the last full measure of devotion

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.637
that we here highly
resolve that these dead

00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:37.739
shall not have died in vain,

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.463
that this nation, under God,

00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:41.615
shall have a new birth of freedom

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:43.356
and that government of the people,

00:02:43.356 --> 00:02:46.238
by the people, for the people,

00:02:46.238 --> 00:02:48.594
shall not perish from the earth.

00:02:48.594 --> 00:02:50.856
Wow, it gives me chills just reading this.

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:53.581
And there's just something
about Lincoln's oratory,

00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:57.337
the way that he puts things,
that just rivets you,

00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:59.323
and this is why he was such a great leader

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:01.041
and such a great politician.

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:05.950
Because, he knew how to
use words to his advantage.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.337
And he knew how to touch people

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:09.850
with what he had to say.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.569
Now, it's more than 150 years
later and we still read this

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.201
and memorize it in
school and think about it

00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.916
on kind of a regular basis,

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:21.768
because we frequently quote
the words the he said here.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.253
So, how did this get to be so important?

00:03:24.253 --> 00:03:25.790
Well, let's read it line by line

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.321
and see what he's really saying.

00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:29.557
All right, so, Four
score and seven years ago

00:03:29.557 --> 00:03:31.390
our fathers brought
forth on this continent,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.309
a new nation, conceived in liberty,

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:34.987
and dedicated to the proposition

00:03:34.987 --> 00:03:37.132
that all men are created equal.

00:03:37.132 --> 00:03:40.314
All right, well, this in
case you're wondering,

00:03:40.314 --> 00:03:41.564
means 87 years.

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:44.321
Four score, a score is 20.

00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:46.976
In fact, some of the newspapers
that printed the text

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:50.346
of this speech, just said 87 years ago,

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:52.629
So, why doesn't Lincoln just say 87?

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.334
Well, I think this fourscore
and seven years ago

00:03:56.334 --> 00:04:00.501
has this really strong, I
would even say Biblical ring,

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.008
right?

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:06.713
It has this importance
and eloquence of oratory.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.656
So, he's already setting
the tone to say here,

00:04:09.656 --> 00:04:14.557
in this nation, we are
measuring time almost Biblicaly.

00:04:14.557 --> 00:04:16.366
Like this is a sacred mission,

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:18.942
and it's been a sacred amount of time

00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:21.343
since the founding of the nation.

00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:23.193
And I think it's really
interesting to note

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:25.110
that it's only 87 years

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:27.797
between 1776 and 1863.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.141
I know this is just basic math,

00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:35.466
but between the founding
of the United States

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:37.590
and the Civil War,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.246
when the union fought
for its very survival,

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:42.488
was less than 100 years.

00:04:42.488 --> 00:04:44.620
It's a very short period of time.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.372
Now, Lincoln as a young man,
would have known older men

00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:50.628
who had fought in the Revolutionary War,

00:04:50.628 --> 00:04:52.385
Andrew Jackson for example.

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:53.890
So, Lincoln starts out by saying

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.646
that less than 100 years ago,

00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:57.771
the United States was founded

00:04:57.771 --> 00:05:00.548
and it was founded on this principle,

00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:02.795
that all men are created equal.

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:05.014
Now, if you contrast this
with the system of slavery,

00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:07.517
which the South is fighting to preserve,

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:10.406
that is definitely in contradistinction

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:13.134
to the concept that all
men are created equal.

00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:16.053
So, Lincoln reminds his
audience immediately

00:05:16.053 --> 00:05:19.238
that the founding principles
of the United States

00:05:19.238 --> 00:05:21.608
were equality and liberty.

00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:23.608
All right, so he moves on to say

00:05:23.608 --> 00:05:25.694
Now we are engaged in a great civil war,

00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:27.625
testing whether that nation,

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:30.057
or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated,

00:05:30.057 --> 00:05:32.007
can long endure.

00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:34.337
So in less than 100 years

00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:38.537
the idea that held the
United States together

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:40.755
is now being tested,

00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:44.974
and he's reminding people
that the world is watching.

00:05:44.974 --> 00:05:48.490
They're saying, all right,
there's this upstart democracy

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.373
in the Americas saying that monarchy,

00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:55.540
which has been the rule of
Europe for more than 1000 years

00:05:56.662 --> 00:05:59.226
is a silly proposition
and they can do better.

00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:00.329
Well, now look at them.

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:02.977
They're fighting a civil
war because some folks

00:06:02.977 --> 00:06:05.133
want to be the masters of others

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:07.222
and some folks don't
think that's all right.

00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:10.003
So, in a way, what Lincoln
is reminding people here

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:14.289
is that they're engaged
in this grand experiment.

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.658
Right, this grand experiment
of liberty and equality,

00:06:18.658 --> 00:06:21.368
where no one is the master of anyone else,

00:06:21.368 --> 00:06:24.016
where any person, like Abraham Lincoln,

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.478
born in a log cabin,

00:06:25.478 --> 00:06:27.978
less than a year of
school in his entire life

00:06:27.978 --> 00:06:29.377
can become president.

00:06:29.377 --> 00:06:32.312
So, if the democracy of
the United States fails,

00:06:32.312 --> 00:06:34.156
if this union falls apart,

00:06:34.156 --> 00:06:36.977
then it will have proved
the doubters right,

00:06:36.977 --> 00:06:38.878
that democracy doesn't work.

00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:40.148
And then he continues:

00:06:40.148 --> 00:06:43.642
We are met on a great
battle-field of that war.

00:06:43.642 --> 00:06:45.723
We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field,

00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:47.749
as a final resting place

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:50.413
for those who here gave their lives

00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:52.988
that that nation might live.

00:06:52.988 --> 00:06:56.258
It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this.

00:06:56.258 --> 00:06:58.422
I think there are two
important things here.

00:06:58.422 --> 00:07:02.005
So, he talks about the
concept of a nation.

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.453
And this is really interesting

00:07:04.453 --> 00:07:07.999
because prior to the
civil war, it was frequent

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.166
that people might say things
like these United States

00:07:13.343 --> 00:07:14.176
right?

00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:17.259
The idea that the states are the most

00:07:18.426 --> 00:07:20.343
prominent portion

00:07:20.343 --> 00:07:24.116
of the country and that
the individual states

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:28.088
plural, were together in a union that was

00:07:28.088 --> 00:07:31.671
secondary to the idea of statehood.

00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:34.657
But, midway through the war,
Lincoln starts to use the word

00:07:34.657 --> 00:07:36.091
nation more and more.

00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:38.951
And afterwards, it will
always be known as The

00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:40.118
United States.

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:43.810
So, Lincoln is signaling here that

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.977
this is one united nation,

00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:50.495
not just a collection of
states and that is what

00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:53.354
the American forces are fighting for.

00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:55.957
That is what the forces
of the United States

00:07:55.957 --> 00:07:59.062
are trying to achieve, a united nation,

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.695
not a united set of states.

00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:04.385
The other interesting thing
here is that he mentions

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:08.899
it's altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this.

00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:11.815
Why wouldn't it be proper
to dedicate a cemetery?

00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:14.044
Well, a lot of people
thought that it wasn't proper

00:08:14.044 --> 00:08:17.151
for Lincoln to be speaking
at this ceremony dedication.

00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:19.513
They thought that it was kind of a

00:08:19.513 --> 00:08:21.555
cheap political maneuvering.

00:08:21.555 --> 00:08:25.722
Imagine today if the president
went to a soldier's funeral.

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:29.526
Many people might say it's not
appropriate for the president

00:08:29.526 --> 00:08:33.463
to be there because it's
just a political opportunity,

00:08:33.463 --> 00:08:34.296
right?

00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:36.422
That you're trying to get votes

00:08:36.422 --> 00:08:38.386
from somebody else's tragedy.

00:08:38.386 --> 00:08:41.451
And it's kind of ironic,
because Lincoln's speech here

00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:43.951
is very sacred, very funereal,

00:08:45.286 --> 00:08:48.528
whereas Everett's speech
was very political,

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:52.041
saying this was a great battle,
we have to remember that

00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:54.359
the Confederates are our enemies.

00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:56.554
But Lincoln's speech is much gentler,

00:08:56.554 --> 00:08:59.215
much kinder, much more
appropriate actually

00:08:59.215 --> 00:09:02.658
to a funeral perhaps
than Everett's speech.

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:04.814
But, he feels it
necessary to remind people

00:09:04.814 --> 00:09:08.178
that it is appropriate
to gather here together

00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:11.405
to mark the dedication of this cemetery

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:13.730
even though many might decry it

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.867
as just political grandstanding.

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:17.523
Now, I think it's this next paragraph

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:20.676
that makes the Gettysburg
Address so powerful.

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:21.509
So, let's read it.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:23.933
In a larger sense, we can not dedicate,

00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:27.078
we can not consecrate, we
can not hallow this ground.

00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:30.284
The brave men, living and
dead, who struggled here,

00:09:30.284 --> 00:09:33.770
have consecrated it,
far above our poor power

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.026
to add or detract.

00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:38.223
The world will little
note, nor long remember

00:09:38.223 --> 00:09:39.484
what we say here

00:09:39.484 --> 00:09:41.730
but it can never forget
what they did here.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.916
So, he's drawing attention

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.974
to the importance of the battlefield dead.

00:09:45.974 --> 00:09:47.776
He says this is not about us.

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:49.001
It's about them.

00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:50.193
They have sacrificed.

00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:52.677
They have become martyrs for this cause,

00:09:52.677 --> 00:09:54.791
so we can not consecrate the cemetery,

00:09:54.791 --> 00:09:57.776
they have already consecrated
it with their blood

00:09:57.776 --> 00:09:59.332
and with their sacrifice.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:02.999
So, he's reminding
everyone of the sacrifice

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:05.892
and the martyrdom

00:10:09.115 --> 00:10:11.763
of the battlefield dead.

00:10:11.763 --> 00:10:15.418
Now, here's the real power
of the Gettysburg Address.

00:10:15.418 --> 00:10:16.882
The last couple of sentences.

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.110
Let's read them all together.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.994
It is for us the living, rather,

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:22.873
to be dedicated here
to the unfinished work

00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:27.040
which they who fought here have
thus far so nobly advanced.

00:10:28.053 --> 00:10:30.997
It is rather for us to be here dedicated

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.685
to the great task remaining before us

00:10:33.685 --> 00:10:37.862
that from these honored dead
we take increased devotion

00:10:37.862 --> 00:10:40.556
to that cause for which they gave

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:43.261
the last full measure of devotion,

00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:45.100
that we here highly resolve

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.890
that these dead shall
not have died in vain

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.855
that this nation, under God,

00:10:49.855 --> 00:10:51.456
shall have a new birth of freedom

00:10:51.456 --> 00:10:55.100
and that government of
the people, by the people,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.812
for the people, shall not
perish from the earth.

00:10:58.812 --> 00:11:01.444
Well, what Lincoln does
here is so powerful

00:11:01.444 --> 00:11:04.263
because it's kind of a
rhetorical switcher-roo.

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:07.621
He says we're not here
to dedicate the cemetery.

00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:11.000
The cemetery is here to dedicate us.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.231
Men have died here and we
must honor their martyrdom.

00:11:15.231 --> 00:11:18.166
We must honor their sacrifice

00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:22.480
for the experiment of liberty and equality

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.378
by taking renewed
dedication to that cause.

00:11:26.378 --> 00:11:29.071
So, come to the battlefield of Gettysburg.

00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:31.065
Come to this cemetery

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:34.148
and take renewed heart in the mission

00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:39.299
of continuing democracy,
continuing equality

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:43.466
and continuing to fight for
a United States of America.

00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:47.469
And how the rest of
those battles play out,

00:11:47.469 --> 00:11:49.203
we'll get to in the next video.
