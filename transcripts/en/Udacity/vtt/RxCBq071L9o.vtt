00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Why was there no work done in the previous example? What happened?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Well, our definition of work, this is the product of a force and Δx, a distance.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well here, while I'm holding my 5 kg bucket, I'm definitely exerting a force of 50 N

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and I exerted over a distance of 4 m.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Why is the answer not 50  4? Well, the reason is I was dishonest with you.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I need to give you a little more instruction on how to use this equation.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Noticed that when I write force, I have to write 50 N  that's the size

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but I write an up arrow to represent the direction.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When I write Δx, 4 m is the distance, but that distance was to the right.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Both of these quantities have both a size 50, 4,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the direction upward to the right, associate with them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
When I make this multiplication, I have to very careful on how I do it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Specifically, I have to take what I'm going to call  the parallel component of force with the distance.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now, this idea of parallel component is a little hard to explain and a little hard to understand at first.

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Why don't we go ahead and do an example and I think you'll see what I mean.
