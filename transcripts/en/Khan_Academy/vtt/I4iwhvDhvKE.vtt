00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.410
 

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.750
There's a very popular, and
I thought, good movie out,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.720
based on the play, which
is based on the novel

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.872
by Victor Hugo, Les Miserables.

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:09.330
And I'm sure I'm
mispronouncing it.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.118
It means "the
miserable," for those

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:13.747
for whom it was not obvious.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.830
And what I want to give
is a little bit of context

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.990
because in that
book, play, movie

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.910
there is an
attempted revolution.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.800
And sometimes people
try to associate it

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.510
with the French Revolution.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.900
But that is not depicting
the French Revolution

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.560
that people talk
about when they talk

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.910
about the French Revolution.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.230
And so I thought I would
give a little bit of scaffold

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.400
of French history in the
late 1700s and all the way

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.570
through the mid-1800s to
give a little bit of context

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.930
on the matter.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.760
So let's start off in 1789.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.520
That's when you have
the French Revolution.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.240
The First French
Revolution, we could

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.522
say, or the French Revolution,
which is the French Revolution

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:55.980
that people talk
about when they're

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.780
talking about the
French Revolution.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.670
It was all about deposing
Louis XVI and his wife, Maria

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.170
Antoinette.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.530
This is her body there.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.252
I think she just
got guillotined.

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:06.960
This is her head.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.520
It was very bloody revolution.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.700
This is the storming of the
Bastille right over here.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.500
And that starts the beginning
of the First Republic in France.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.840
The First Republic.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.830
So there were all these
dreams and aspirations

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.740
that France would now be
a country of the people.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.960
Not too dissimilar
to the United States.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.780
But revolutions are not so
easy, or so clean, or so fast.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.380
And France had to go through
a long period of pain

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.960
before it could really establish
itself as a real republic.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.961
But let's keep going on
further off in history.

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.460
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.650
I'll do the timeline in white.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.610
So let's fast forward.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.530
Let's fast forward to 1799.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.200
This is when Napoleon
Bonaparte comes to power.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.811
So when people talk
about Napoleon,

00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:04.560
they are talking about
Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.030
We'll see that there
are other Napoleons.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.490
But if people just say, hey,
Napoleon did this or that,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.520
they're talking about
Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.400
So this is, Napoleon
comes to power.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.530
Napoleon.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.410
And he officially ends
the First Republic in 1804

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.640
because he declares
himself emperor.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.722
But let's fast forward.

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:23.680
There's many videos on
the Khan Academy dealing

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.390
with the Napoleonic Wars
and the French Revolution.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.560
But let's fast forward to 1815.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.790
So let me do that
in white again.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.289
So you get to 1815.

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.830
So let's see.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.860
That was about 10 years.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860
I need to go about 16 years.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.330
So that would put us at
1815 right over there.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.310
1815 is, essentially,
Napoleon faces

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.470
his Waterloo, which was
literally at Waterloo.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.810
That's why people talk
about facing your Waterloo.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.160
So he was banished for
a little bit to Elba.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.260
He was able to come back.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.900
He had 100, actually
111 days in power.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.270
But then he was
finally defeated.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.840
And then he was
finally put into exile

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.910
at Saint Helena, where he died.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.460
In 1815, you essentially
have the restoration

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.860
of the Bourbon monarchy.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.160
So Louis XVI's younger
brother comes to power.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.730
And they call him Louis XVIII.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.560
So this is Louis XVIII, which
raises a very good question--

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.440
What happened to Louis XVII?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.520
Louis XVII was
Louis XVI's son, who

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.380
died in prison at the age of 10
in 1795 during the Revolution

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.770
or during the revolutionary
period, I guess we could say.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.370
So this right over here.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.660
This right over here.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.035
Napoleon ends -- let me draw.

00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:50.930
This is Napoleon's-- let me do
this in the same color I did

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.430
Napoleon in.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.295
So 1799 to, actually, 1814 is
when Napoleon's reign ended

00:03:58.295 --> 00:03:59.920
but then he came back
for a little bit.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.270
So I'll draw a little bit
of a dotted line here.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.820
A little dotted line.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.270
And then 1814 was the
formal restoration

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.312
of the Bourbon monarchy.

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:11.520
And, but of course, Napoleon
comes back a little bit.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.029
But after Waterloo, it's
really firmly established.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.269
So you have the restoration
of the Bourbon monarchy.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.709
So this is Louis the XVIII.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.150
And then in 1824 he dies.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.095
And he dies childless.

00:04:25.095 --> 00:04:27.900
 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.534
1824.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.075
So let's see.

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:30.080
It's about nine years.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.960
So that will put us
about right over there.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.160
1824.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.350
He dies childless.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.220
And so his younger brother,
Charles X comes to power.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.560
So then you have
Charles X. Charles.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.960
I'll do all the
Bourbons in purple.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.830
Charles X. And this is
Charles X right over here.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.370
And so let's go a little bit
further off into history.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.620
You fast forward
all the way to 1830.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.370
You fast forward to 1830.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.740
A lot of discontent.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.642
And now you have the
Second French Revolution.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.100
You might say, oh
hey, this must be

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.930
what Les Miserables
is all about.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.990
No, we're not there yet.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.730
Les Mis is not about the
Second French Revolution,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.250
sometimes called
the July Revolution.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.570
July Revolution.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.330
And this revolution actually
did not-- it was successful--

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.870
but it did not establish
a republic at this point.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.620
It instead installed--
and this whole time there

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.320
was a liberalization.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.300
The monarchy, even when
it was put in power,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.420
had a gradual decline in
how much power it had.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.950
But after the July Revolution,
they put in Charles X's cousin.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.486
Charles X's cousin who
was the Duke of Orleans.

00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:48.700
 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.820
Who was this guy, this
guy right over here.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.490
Louis Philippe I. So
let me write that.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:06.490
So this is Louis Philippe I.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.340
And so you're saying,
Sal, you started off

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.290
this video talking
about Les Mis.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.480
You haven't mentioned
Les Mis yet.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.010
Give me a little bit of context.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.760
So now I will give you context.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.740
So if you watch the movie, it
starts off with Jean Valjean.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.660
He's at a shipping
place where they're

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.330
repairing ships of some sort.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.260
That was in 1815 after Waterloo.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.020
So it was under
Louis XVIII's regime.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.370
So that's right over here.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.036
Let me see where the
start of the movie.

00:06:35.036 --> 00:06:40.640
The start of the movie
is right about there.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.530
And then the real climax of the
movie, which is this rebellion.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.100
There's these barricades
being set up in Paris.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.050
You have all these
young idealistic folks

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.480
who are trying to
overthrow the government.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.640
This does not happen until 1832.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.050
This is 1832.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.360
I'll do it right over here.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.250
1832.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.940
And what catalyzed
that-- there were

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.742
several things that
was catalyzing that.

00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:08.200
And, actually, most
revolutions are

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.420
catalyzed by just
economic discontent.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.440
If people are rich, and
happy, and have jobs,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.000
and aren't getting
sick, most people

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.930
aren't in the mood to revolt.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.040
But in 1832, as
you could imagine,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.060
the economic situation
was not good.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.800
There was also a very
nasty outbreak of cholera.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.710
And what really catalyzed
the events in Les Mis,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.220
and they even refer
to it in the movie,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.260
is the death of this
chap right over here.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.180
Jean Maximilien Lamarque.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.300
Let me write the name down.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.720
Jean Maximilien--
and I'm sure I'm

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.460
mispronouncing it-- Lamarque.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.730
And he dies in June of 1832.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.980
And he was very sympathetic
to the plight of the poor,

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.590
to the plight of the common man.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.630
And the average folks
said, hey look, he's

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.770
our guy in government.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.740
And he had an influential
role in government.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.080
When he died, they
were like, look,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.150
we don't have anybody else
in a high position who

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.640
can speak for us.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.570
Let's use his funeral as
a catalyst for revolt.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:25.210
And you saw that happening
in the movie Les Mis.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.540
So Les Mis, that
climactic moment,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.470
that is the June
Rebellion of 1832.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.919
And it's not-- you don't have
to have amazing comprehension

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.730
of watching movies to realize
that this was unsuccessful.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.610
So this right here, didn't work.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.900
Didn't work.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.520
If it did work,
It might have been

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.940
called the Third
French Revolution.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.040
But it was not.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.790
It was an unsuccessful
revolution

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.310
or unsuccessful
rebellion, really.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.220
And it was that Victor
Hugo observed it.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.120
And that's why he's able to
recount it in so much detail.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.720
The barricading,
the young people,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.170
the shooting in the
streets, all the rest.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.130
So this is a little
bit of review.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.530
When people talk about
the French Revolution,

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.420
they're usually talking
about the French Revolution.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.650
1789.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.600
Begins to establish
the First Republic.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.760
It was a successful revolution.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.150
The Second French Revolution.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.220
This is the July Revolution.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.090
This is in 1830.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.880
This puts into power Louis
Philippe I, the person

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.810
that they're trying to
overthrow in Les Mis.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.040
And they don't establish the
Second Republic after this.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.260
For the Second Republic,
we have to go all the way

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.240
to the revolution
of-- let me make

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.560
sure I can scroll properly.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.570
Go all the way.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.000
So let me continue my timeline.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.280
So this is Louis
Philippe to go 18 years.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:10:06.020
18 years to 1848 where you have
the Third French Revolution,

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.630
which leads to the popular
election of Napoleon

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.230
Bonaparte's nephew.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.570
Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.080
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.820
This guy right over here.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.820
But France is still not done.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.940
It still can't establish itself
as a long-lasting republic.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.890
In 1851, this character
declares himself emperor.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.730
So 1851, he too declares
himself emperor.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.260
And France is not finally
freed of kings and emperors

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.590
until 1870.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:49.260
So let's do this run all the
way to 1870 where France,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.030
essentially, loses the
Franco-Prussian War.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.220
And this character, this
character right over here,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.570
is deposed.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.660
And you have the establishment
of the Third French Republic.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.371
