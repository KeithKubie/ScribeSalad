00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.760
It's a fairly natural question. If you're looking at the sequence of prime numbers, so, P1 is 2, P2 is 3, and so on,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.480
how big do these gaps get?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.840
And we know that, actually, the gaps can get pretty big. So there's a very high school argument, that if you take the numbers 1

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.180
times 2 times 3, up to, say, times 100, and then you look at this number

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.389
plus 2, this is going to be a multiple of 2,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.029
because 2 is a multiple of 2, and

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.419
this first big number of product of numbers between 1 and a hundred is multiple of 2. Another way that mathematicians might write this is

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.718
100 exclamation mark plus 2.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.648
So this is, multiply all numbers up to 100 together, and then add 2.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.680
But then exactly the same argument means that

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.149
100 factorial

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.628
plus 3 is going to be a multiple of 3.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.459
And so, 100 factorial plus 2 can't be prime, because it's a multiple of 2, and it's bigger than 2.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
100 factorial plus 3 can't be prime,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.430
because it's a multiple of 3 and bigger than 3. And similarly, you can go all the way on to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.119
100 factorial

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.320
plus

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.389
100, and this can't be a prime, because it's a multiple of 100 and bigger than 100. And so this is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.909
99 consecutive numbers, none of which can be prime numbers. And so you know that

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.049
there has to be this gap between prime numbers of size at least 100.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.199
But, obviously, you can replace 100 here with any number you like, and that shows that there are

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.485
arbitrarily large gaps between prime numbers.

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:39.209
Brady: "It feels to me you've alrea-, it feels to me you've done a proof, there.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.950
"You've proven that they are..."

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.880
Right. So this is completely a rigorous mathematical proof, that whatever number you like, take a million,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.030
take a billion,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.689
there exists a prime gap which is

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.298
bigger than a billion, or bigger than a million, or bigger than a billion billion billion, or bigger than the number of atoms in the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.959
universe. And so there are these really huge gaps between prime numbers,

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.469
but the prime numbers where these gaps occur may be

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.630
really huge themselves.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.479
And then there's this question as to, okay,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.659
if I have a prime number of about a million digits, how big can the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.709
gaps between prime numbers be? For example, if you're trying to find a prime number,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.269
let's say, I challenge you to find, find a prime number that's size about a million.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.669
One way you might try and go about it is,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.349
take a million, try and test if it's prime, if it's not prime,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.769
and a million's not prime, test a million and one, test a million and two, test a million and three, until you find a prime number.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.319
And, this is actually, we believe, a pretty good way of finding prime numbers, that it's completely deterministic,

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.319
you can do it quite quickly on a computer.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.429
Maybe takes you a while by hand when they, after the millions, but a computer can do this very quickly.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.840
However,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.200
mathematically, our theoretical understanding of this is

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.429
pretty poor at the moment, and it could be the case that you have to go on

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.980
ages and ages before you find a prime number, if there were these really large gaps between prime numbers.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.010
Brady: "So you want to make sure that

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.960
"random dart you threw at the number line didn't happen to land in the middle of an awesome prime gap."

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.840
Exactly. Yeah. So if there was some awesome prime gap, this would completely

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.679
screw up your attempt to find a prime number quickly by just testing each number in turn, and it might take heat death of the universe

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:30.298
before your computer pr-, actually finds a prime number, which could be a pretty big problem. So mathematicians are very interested in saying,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.979
given primes of about this size, of size about a million, or about a billion, how big can the prime gaps be?

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.759
And, in particular, can we do constructions that are maybe better than this

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.230
factorial plus two, factorial plus three type constructions, to try and understand the large gaps between prime numbers.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.829
So I guess this is the large gaps between primes problem, when you're asking

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.790
how large can gaps can be.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.799
But, it really became famous because Paul Erdős very much popularized this problem. Paul Erdős is this very charismatic

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.999
mathematician. He used to put challenge prizes, so he put numerical bits of money on different problems.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.630
So he would say, if you can solve this problem that I don't know to solve, I'll give you $50. Here's a $20 problem.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.280
Here's a $100 problem.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.229
And he used to do this as a great way of encouraging mathematics amongst the community.

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.289
The largest amount of money he put on any problem was

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.910
$10,000.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.209
He put it on precisely this large gaps between primes problem.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.500
He didn't want someone to completely solve all we could possibly ask for about large gaps between primes, because that'd be too ambitious.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.700
However, he, and a few other mathematicians, notably, Robert Rankin and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.380
Westzynthius, had a method of doing slightly better than this,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.480
multiply all the numbers up to 100 and then, add two, add three, add five. But it was only slightly better.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.580
And, somehow that's the

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.140
only way we knew of constructing what were really larger than expected gaps betwen prime numbers.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.240
It was kind of frustrating for mathematicians that we had this one

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.260
way of

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.649
constructing large gaps between prime numbers, and we had

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.740
no other ways that did any better than random. Erdős' problem was just to try and do better than what they'd done.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.560
So, independently, there were two different proofs of this Erdős challenge problem, using rather different techniques.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.679
But both based on similar ideas to work that had been done previously,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.740
on consecutive days.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.580
It came out on consecutive days.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.440
I worked on this problem.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:42.980
And also, there was a collaboration between Terry Tao, Ben Green, Kevin Ford and Sergei Konyagin, who came up with a different way of getting,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.640
of solving Erdős' problem, and getting large gaps between prime numbers. So we knew about each other,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.029
but I was the slow one. They got there ahead, one day ahead of me.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.369
We have this website where we put up new papers, and yeah. They got in one day ahead of me.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.591
I was the second one.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.277
So there are different ideas.

00:05:59.277 --> 00:06:01.500
So as I said before, to improve on what

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.390
Erdős and his collaborators had done, you really needed to get some new arithmetic

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.380
understanding about the prime numbers.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.220
In my work, it turned out that you could use some new arithmettic understanding about the prime numbers

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.029
that was a generalization of some of the ideas that had been used to work on bounded gaps between primes.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.140
So, somehow, bizarrely, if you reinterpreted the whole ideas behind small gaps between prime numbers,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.720
they could be useful to get a tiny improvement in our knowledge about large gaps between prime numbers, if you took a different

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.580
understanding of the whole thing.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.900
Whereas the other paper used ideas based on Ben Green and Terry Tao's previous work on long arithmetic

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.620
progressions in the primes.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.520
Quite famously,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.840
around 2005, Ben Green and Terry Tao proved that you get arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the primes.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.449
So if you just take one prime, you can

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.280
add a constant amount, add a constant amount, add a constant amount, add a constant amount, and you get these strings of prime numbers.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.000
And they showed you can, if you choose those starting prime correctly, and you choose the difference correctly, you can get arbitrarily long

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.460
strings of prime numbers. And, again,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.090
reinterpreted in a rather different way, they were able to use this

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.840
extra arithmetic information about the primes in the proof of

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.459
the ideas of large gaps between prime numbers to solve Erdős' challenge problem,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.250
and do better than what Erdős and his original collaborators had done.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.000
Brady: "Who gets the 10,000 bucks?"

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.720
Ah. So.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.260
Um. Uh.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.340
The 10,000 bucks,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.729
is slightly complicated, I think, because Erdős is deceased, but Ron Graham was in charge of it,

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:35.460
and I think he's decided to split it between

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.140
the group of us.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.940
Brady: "What's the new state of play?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.720
"What do we now know about the gaps between...?"

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.109
So it's a slightly technical statement,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.210
but I'll try and write it out for you.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.430
So, if you look at primes less than x,

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:53.430
so I'm thinking of x as being some huge number, like a billion, or the number of atoms in the universe,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:08:00.479
then there is a gap of size, and now we have some big messy expression

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.300
involving lots of logarithms.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.260
So log x times log of log of x times

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.729
log of log of log of log of x

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.140
divided by

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.560
log of log of

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.380
log of x times

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
some small constant c

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.180
if x is large.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.820
And so this is a slightly complicated and slightly messy mathematical expression for,

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:41.790
if I'm looking at primes of size x, how big a gap can I actively construct?

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:49.259
But this is the current quantity. It's some quantity that gets bigger and bigger and bigger as x gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.860
And this is the current state of the art.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.520
So, if you want to try and beat our work,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.580
I guess I think you'd need to come up with some new arithmetic information and understanding about the primes.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.069
So the challenge is to do better than this function that's growing very slowly in x.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:10.040
...but it turns out that that's completely false. That we really don't understand these

00:09:10.589 --> 00:09:17.509
guys at all. We really have the most limited theoretical understanding of them. And despite being the most fundamental objects,

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:21.709
most of the most simple questions that you could possibly ask about prime numbers

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.480
have been open for thousands and thousands of years, and the most famous mathematicians are...
