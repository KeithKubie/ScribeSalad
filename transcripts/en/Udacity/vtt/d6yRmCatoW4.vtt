00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.760
As developers, both you
and I use HTTP everyday.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:05.500
We issue GET and
POST requests when

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.990
using Firebase's JavaScript
SDK, or just when

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.210
using the browser on our
tablet's or mobile phones

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.680
to look at web sites.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.500
To be a good front-end engineer
creating web apps, merely

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.149
using HTTP is not enough.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.650
You will need a
deeper understanding

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:19.750
to see why certain
techniques are being used

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.079
and why others either don't
work, or aren't recommended.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.759
In this lesson, we'll
start with a look

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.890
at the first version of HTTP.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.897
We'll examine the GET
and the POST methods

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.729
and a few other useful
methods you might not

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.253
be as familiar with.

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:33.670
We'll look at a
variety of headers

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.730
and how APIs are designed
to work well with the web.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:38.169
By the end of this
lesson, you'll

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.380
be able to debug HTTP request
response pairs on the wire,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.000
and will understand
what a RESTful API is.
