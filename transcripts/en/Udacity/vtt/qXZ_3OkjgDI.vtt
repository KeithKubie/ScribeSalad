00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.170
Let's add the dastardly
robot enemies to Gigagal.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.380
Ugh, they're so evil with their floating
around and their slight buzzing noises.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.640
Anyway, each any will patrol
the top of a particular platform.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.395
And if they hit Gigagal, we'll send
her flying with both tricky jumps and

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:16.765
robots in her path.

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:19.165
It's also time to give GigaGal
something to strive for.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:22.085
So we'll add an exit
portal to our levels.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.665
Let's get started by setting
up the assets for the enemies.
