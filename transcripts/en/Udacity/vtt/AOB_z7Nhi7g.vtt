Okay, so the design of our class Movie, is

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.410
here on the top right, [SOUND] and I'm going

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.410
to begin, with a blank programming file. I have

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.570
named it, media.py, and it is saved inside a

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.165
folder called, movies. Now, to write a new class,

00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:17.370
[SOUND] I will used the Python keyword, class. And

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.000
I will name it, Movie. You've probably notices, that

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.380
the first letter of the name of the class M,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.900
is in uppercase. Now, this letter doesn't necessarily

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.710
need to be in uppercase, but, the Google style

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.260
guide for Python suggests that it should be.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500
Now, what is this thing called the Google style

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.960
guide for Python you ask, Well, let's Google

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.580
it. The first link here looks good to me.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.370
Now, this Style Guide, provides conventions to programmers all

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.530
over the world. On how to write their programs.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.360
If you scroll down a bit You will notice

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.120
that there are conventions on everything, from how to name

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.110
things, to how to write comments. By the way,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.640
the link to this webpage, is available in the instructor

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.660
notes. I recommend that you read through this document.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.150
If you click on this link called Naming, you will

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.980
notice that, when defining a class name, Google recommends that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.700
the first letter of that name be in capital letters.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.060
Okay, back to the code. Now, thus far, we've

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.040
encountered one new key word, called class. In fact, we

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.360
are going to come across several new words in this

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.220
lesson, and I want to list them all, in one

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.710
place for handy reference. The word class, is the first

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.470
one on that list. We will review, all the words

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.270
on this list before we end this lesson. So, you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.550
may have noticed that our class, is empty thus far.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.500
Now, to figure out what I want to do next

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.150
with it, I will go back to my design. So,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.470
here I am, back with my class design. Now, I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.790
know that eventually, I would want to create multiple instances

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.190
of the class movie. Instances like, Toy Story and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.760
Avatar. I also know that I have previously created instances

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.930
of class Turtle. Instances like Brad, and to do that,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.265
I had to write a piece of code that read,

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:09.960
turtle.Turtle, so I guess I will have to write a piece of code like

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.270
this, to create Toy Story, an instance of class Movie. Let's do that next.
