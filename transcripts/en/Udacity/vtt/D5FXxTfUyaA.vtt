00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.543
Let's continue solving the system and see what happens. If I add the x terms

00:00:05.543 --> 00:00:10.971
together I get 0, if I add the y terms together I also get 0, and then 6 and 5

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:16.297
make 11. Hm, this is weird, 0 equals 11. This can't be a true statement, we know

00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:20.636
this isn't right. So something else is going on with these 2 equations. If we

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:25.124
remember that the solution to a system of equations is a point of intersection,

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:29.601
then we know that this doesn't make sense. There's actually no point that works

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:34.142
as the intersection for both of these 2 lines. If I solve each equation for y, I

00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:38.838
would wind up with these 2 equations. These parallel lines will never intersect.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:42.984
So whenever we connect this math to the graph, we can tell that there's no

00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:47.368
solution here. There's no ordered pair, x and y, that will make both of these

00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:52.090
equations true. And that makes sense, because there's no point of intersection.
