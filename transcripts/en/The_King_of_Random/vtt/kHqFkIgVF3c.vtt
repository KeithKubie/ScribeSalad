Hey, what's up guys welcome back to the workshop for this video

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.380
We're doing a very cool step-by-step tutorial on how to make your own mystery puzzle box like this one

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.960
You could use in a mystery escape room. This project was inspired by Lowes who flew me out to Ohio,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.700
Locked me in a room for 60 minutes and gave me some power tools to create mechanisms to get my way out.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.210
I put a link in the description where you can go see the video of how that went down. But for this video

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.390
I'm going to be taking you through the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.880
Measurements, the mechanics, and step-by-step build on how to create one of these puzzle boxes for yourself.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
It's made of very simple materials, and you don't need a lot of tools to do it

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.769
Let's jump right in. The material I used to prototype this project are two packs of paint sticks,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.079
You can get these ten paint sticks per pack,

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.209
I'm using some hot glue, a toothpick, and a small dowel. Now aside from that a few of the accessories

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.579
We're gonna be using are two small magnets, and then a nail and a small screw that you can pull out of your spare parts

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.890
bin.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.459
And to give our box a nice finished look we're gonna keep it really simple by using some red chestnut wood stain and some polycrylic

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.159
protective finish. Now to jump right into making our puzzle box,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.439
We're gonna start off by chopping up these paint sticks in a very strategic manner to optimize the amount of wood we get out.

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.749
Now honestly it is a bit overkill to use a 12-inch miter saw to cut paint sticks,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.959
But I'm using this because Lowes sent it to me as a gift, and it would be rude not to.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.440
Then that's it. At this point all of our wood pieces are cut and should be ready for assembly.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.660
That's where the hot glue comes in.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.339
Now while our hot glue is warming up, I just want to mention that if you have a belt sander

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.220
It's gonna make this project a lot easier for you. It's not required,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.559
You could just get away with sandpaper, but a belt sander is gonna make things work a lot faster and make your project look awesome,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.979
So thanks again the Lowes for sending me one of these. And since we've got a couple of minutes,

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.399
We can use that time to build one of these locking pins for the secret compartments.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.459
We're using a dowel, a toothpick, and a nail from the spare parts

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.689
Bin. The first thing we want to do is take our nail and a sledgehammer and on a really hard to surface you're gonna

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.899
Pound that until it's flat, and you can see if we use the belt sander we can actually grind that, almost into an improvised

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.850
Flat head screwdriver, which is really cool. If we use a hacksaw we can cut that off the sides,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.229
I'm thinking probably about half an inch should be sufficient. And now if we grab a drill bit

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.300
That's a comparable size to the nail itself

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.829
We can drill straight down into the center of our dowel, about half an inch as well,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.429
we don't want to go too deep, and then we can use a little bit of hot glue, or

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.779
Superglue if you've got that, to secure our screwdriver head into the dowel itself.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.429
And this is where the toothpick comes in. We're gonna take our drill bit, about the same size as our toothpick,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.780
Drill through the end of the dowel,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.739
And then we need some superglue to secure the toothpick into that hole and then just very gently break off the ends and use some

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.979
Sandpaper or a belt sander just to smooth those over. And that right

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.340
There is the essence of our locking pin that you'll see come into play in just a couple of seconds.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.040
So we got our little screwdriver mechanism and finished now

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.099
We can jump into actually assembling the box itself and to do that

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.679
We're gonna be using four of our eight and a half inch paint sticks

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.600
And we're also gonna be using the seven and a half with one-inch pieces as well now if your paint sticks have any markings on

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.679
Them like these ones do you want to set them down on the table with the markings facing upward and we're gonna stack them

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.280
so we have two of our regular sticks on the right side we're gonna take the shorter stick and

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.459
Set it on the left side so that leaves a gap on the lower left area

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.340
One important thing to keep in mind with the shorter piece is make sure that the slits line up so that the grains look normal

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.500
if you put it in the wrong way or put the paint stick the wrong way around it's gonna look really awkward so double-check your

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.809
Stick is facing the right way before you glue it together now

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.169
We're going to do is simply glue these together using our hot glue gun we're going to take one of the paint sticks

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.169
We're gonna lay a bead glued down the side

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.929
We're going to take another one of the sticks, and we're gonna press it into it firmly and hold it for about 10 seconds

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.769
They're gonna set it down on a piece of paper so that it can set as flat as we can get it and we're gonna

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.769
Leave that for at least a couple minutes

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.209
If you've got too much glue seeping up through the cracks use a scrap piece of wood just to scrape that off with a glue

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.750
still hot

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.510
After a couple of minutes the glue should be hardened

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.569
So go ahead and peel it off the paper if you have any bits of paper stuck on the back

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.569
Don't worry about it because we're gonna sand these off

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.389
All right, we got these things glued together sanded they're looking great now

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.370
We're going to do is flip them over so the smooth side is facing up mark free and we're gonna get these eight

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.160
Pieces that we cut to three and three quarters of an inch

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.420
Basically these are going to be our strappings for the box, and we're gonna glue them into place right now

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.359
We can actually use the paint sticks themselves as spacers to make them look very tightly spaced

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.110
So we just got our wooden straps assembled, and they're looking really good

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.869
They're spaced very evenly if we set them down the table and push them side-by-side

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.950
You can see they line up

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.650
Absolutely perfectly which is great so now choose your least favorite one the one that you want to go on bottom

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.629
And we're going to set that down with the wooden straps facing down now. This is where things start getting fun

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.980
We're using the last eight and a half inch piece as the side wall for the right side of the box

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.460
We're gonna glue that down a straight line then we're gonna grab one of the 3-inch pieces

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.390
But before we glue it down we want to measure

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.029
This is going to be the inside back of the box when you lay it up next to that side wall you want to be

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.010
Able to see a gap at least the same width as a paint stick on the other side if it's a little bit longer just

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.340
Use your belt sander or some sandpaper to sand it down so you have the right width

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.480
It's also a good idea to use another paint stick as a square

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.119
You can set that in and use it to help level the wall

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.339
Removing excess glue is good because we want to leave a nice clean finish when we glue this piece

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.970
We want to glue it like a number seven so we're hitting the right side as well as the bottom

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.890
So quick update guys we got the long sidewall on

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.059
We've got the back piece on as well, and we've made sure that there's enough of a gap there

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.089
Then when a paint stick lies down beside it it fills it in perfectly

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.210
Now all the time we get to build our first secret compartment

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.369
And we're gonna start with a small one right down here at the back

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.510
Alright guys, here's the deal

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.200
I just went ahead and made our first small

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.630
Compartment this uses the two and a half inch pieces with the 1 and 3/8 inch piece

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.410
You can see we just put three of them together

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.649
Gluing them to the outside of one of the paint sticks

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.829
And now this is basically designed to fit perfectly at the bottom of our base plate here. You'll notice

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.190
There's a little bit of a gap here at the back and that's ok because we're gonna be filling that gap

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.229
When it comes time to use our magnets which actually brings up really good point because we want to make sure our magnets will fit

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.440
So before we go any further

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.749
Let's put the compartment down in place and take our magnets and just make sure there's enough of a gap for them

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.319
We want the gap at the back to be slightly larger than both magnets stuck together

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.350
And you'll see why in a bit

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.269
You can see that when I extend the gap from my magnets my compartments actually a little bit too long

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.650
So let's go ahead and mark the part. That's hanging over. Then use our belt sander to grind it down

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.460
Now while I was at the belt sander

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.859
you can see I actually just ground down the sides and the bottoms as well so that everything is nice and flush and smooth and

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.050
That way when we put it into the puzzle box

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.680
It's going to slide very very nicely, and if we line it up now

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.250
You can see these edges are absolutely perfect so we take our other three-inch piece of wood and line that up to match you can

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.369
see where it's going to connect to that little hidden compartment and

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.359
Double checking that there's enough space in the back for the magnets, and it looks like we're good

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:08.420
So our mini compartment is complete when we tuck that into the bottom the next step is going to be to build the largest compartment

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.509
That goes on top the larger compartment uses these six and a half inch

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.430
Sidewalls a three inch front and back and then underneath for support using two and a half inch pieces

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.029
So our large mystery compartment is now complete

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.079
You can see how I put the side walls on the inside of the front in the back

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.270
And that's so there's enough space that when it slides down to the box

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.069
It will move freely in and out I also reinforced using the two-and-a-half inch pieces on the inside

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.279
That gives it a little bit more stability and now for a floor

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.769
We're just gonna find some cardboard from something like a cereal box cut that out and lay it down as a bottom and now you

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.780
Can see our small compartment slides in really nicely

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.860
We can take our five and a half inch piece and lay that down to complete the side wall

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.879
At this point we're just about ready to put the top on

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.080
There's just a couple things we need to do first first of all take your drawers and slide them all in and out you want

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.449
To make sure that they're extremely smooth. There are no rough edges

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.490
There's no hot glue. That's gonna bind it down

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.759
We need these things to just glide on top of the wood and secondly

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.020
It's time to add our magnets to the back of the smaller drawer by using two opposing magnets

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.370
It's going to give this drawer an effect like a spring so it pops out when the catch is released

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.469
Now when you glue in your magnets if you find out you're a little overzealous with how wide you made this gap at the back

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.649
You can easily solve that challenge just by adding one more magnet to the back

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.140
That's some good force there, so we've got both of our secret compartments complete

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.240
We've got our magnets added and everything's looking good so at this point we can go ahead and add the lid the thing that's important

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.019
To keep in mind is there is a notch missing out of the top so when you go to hot glue around the edges glue

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.139
Everything except where that notch is gonna go or you are gonna make a sticky mess

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.629
Now once you put the lid on there's gonna be some dynamics that change the lid may have an arch in it also some hot

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.620
Glue may seep so it's important to take your large drawer fit it back in there

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.810
to see if there's any parts we're tight and in this case there are so we're just gonna use the belt sander once again to

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.269
Grind this down until it slides back and forth seamlessly

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.510
Alright so our box is just about done

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.140
There's just a few holes that we need to fill in in the front and the back so we're gonna do that next

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.490
Then we're gonna move on to filling in these side strappings except for two of them two of them

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.759
We're gonna be very strategically placed and require a little bit of special attention

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.490
I

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.320
do want to mention that when you add these pieces to the top and the bottom it is helpful to cut a

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.899
45-degree angle off of the inside that way when they slide into the box, there's less tendency for them to hang up on the edges

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.110
So the time is coming to finish our box that means we're gonna add the

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.490
Mechanisms that allow the mystery compartments to open and the first one starts with a small screw

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.529
Start by taking the small drawer and pressing it all the way in making sure that it's balanced when you feel like it's locked in

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.120
Place we're gonna drill a very small hole in the back and center of the box itself

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.540
Very small pilot hole to accommodate one of these small screws

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.810
Now go ahead and put in your screw and use something like a small precision

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.570
Screwdriver to tighten that all the way what that's gonna

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.969
do is go inside and grab the side wall that compartments that it doesn't push out and now it is locked in place and

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.560
Now it might start to make sense

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.109
Why we made that little screwdriver originally see where this is going

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.659
We're also gonna be bringing back our small dowel because we're gonna be cutting off and using two small sections of it as well

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.690
We want to be able to drill a couple holes the same diameter as our dowel

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.519
And I found a 3/16 inch bit seems to be about the perfect fit our first hole needs to be drilled very

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.920
strategically into the smallest compartment

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.550
it's gonna go right on the edge near that seam line and

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.959
Needs to happen so that when we put this flap on it's covered up

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.480
And there's no evidence whatsoever and it's gonna be most accurate if we drill a hole right now while everything's locked up nice and tight

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.440
And now pushing the dowel in it's a very snug fit

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.690
it's perfect and we're actually gonna leave that in there now and flip over to the other side and with a small mystery compartment in the

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.519
Back you can see if we rotate the box the panel that I have missing is the second one from the left and it is

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.560
Important to put this panel piece into place

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.290
Before we drill the hole once you got a position correctly go ahead and drill a hole straight through it you should penetrate three layers

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.040
Which is exactly what we want so next up. We're gonna take a little piece of this dowel

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.040
We're gonna push it through this hole and we're gonna glue it in place

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.359
and make sure that it never comes apart now the hole for the panel and the mystery compartment need to be as tight to the

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.389
Dowel as they can be because we're gonna glue these together and the two will become one

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.700
The holes going into the box though

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.860
They can be opened up a little bit wider because we don't necessarily need those to be extremely tight it actually helps a little bit

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.339
Better if there little bit loose, so let's use our drill bit and get back inside there and open them up just a touch

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.129
We want the Dowel to go through the whole freely we don't want it to be very tight that's perfect

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.629
So with the small compartment I added some hot glue and I push the dowel through so that it leaves about a little

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.040
Under half an inch on the inside the purpose of that is that when that drawer fits into place

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:46.350
That dowel will go into the pull and prevent the large drawer from pulling out until this one's remove first

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.480
Now obviously we have a quite a bit of overhang here, but that's easy to chop off and use the belt sander to grind flat

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.279
With our dowel sanded flat and everything put back in place we can go ahead and glue the panel on we want to make sure we

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:08.109
Glue it to the side of the mystery compartment itself that way when we undo the screw to the whole compartment can fly out

00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:10.719
We're gonna do something similar with this secret side panel

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.540
The only problem is we don't want it to be obvious that there's a dowel in the center

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:19.449
So we're gonna put the dowel in then we're gonna grind this piece till it's half the thickness that it was originally we're gonna take

00:14:19.449 --> 00:14:22.119
Another piece glue it to the top and grind that down

00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.689
halfway

00:14:22.689 --> 00:14:25.809
As well that way it almost creates a veneer effect on top

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.049
So you don't know that there's anything hidden inside the panel at all so here

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.550
We have a guy's the last puzzle piece is now in place so the only thing left to do to finish this box is

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:38.620
Sand everything so it's nice and smooth and even then give it a paint job with some stain to finish it off

00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:48.519
Now this is the part where we bring back our mini screwdriver

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:53.138
We made earlier you want to drill a 3/8 inch hole on the same side as your mini compartment

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:58.599
but it's gonna be on the right-hand side in the first gap there drill the hole down just so your dowel fits snuggly and

00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:00.849
Now as your person is tinkering with the box

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.680
They'll have something to fidget with find the screwdriver which should tip them off to undo the screw at the back

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.110
So I got these pieces fully stained and finished with varnish, so it's got a protective coating

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.190
And I think it's looking really really good. These are all the different pieces that make up our mystery box

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.440
It's almost time to put it back together, but first

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.169
I'm gonna burn some clues into the wood using a soldering iron

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:48.150
Because etching the clues into the wood with heat is gonna last even longer than if we use ink alone

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.829
I am proud to present our finished puzzle box guys. I hope this is one that you make as well

00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:32.109
It's now got all the clues inserted into it and it's completely ready for use these things are so much fun

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.329
My kids love to use them every one that I've handed it to

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.579
That's tinkered with it has loved to use it as well

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:42.339
and the coolest thing that is just made of very simple materials cost about three dollars of materials paint sticks hot glue and

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:48.939
Some miscellaneous parts this was inspired by the spirit of DIY that came to me from Lowe's Home Improvement Center

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.480
They flew me out to Ohio

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.690
Locked me in the DIY escape room with some power tools and gave me 60 minutes to create mechanisms

00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.490
To escape if you want to see the video of how that went down click the link at the top of the description

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.870
Because it was a real adventure

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.439
And it wasn't just me Bob from I like to make stuff was there as well

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:09.939
So go check us out link at the top of the description or click the end card at the end of this video

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:13.899
Hey, thanks for joining me for this project guys. I'll be looking for you. The next one talk to you then

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:21.129
Next things next I'm going to show you how to build the box hot glue and sandpaper don't seem to work very well

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.280
Hey guys before you go click right here to go see Bob

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.280
And I take on the Lowe's Black Friday

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:37.299
DIY escape room it was an amazing experience we had no idea what to expect once we got locked inside

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.040
So did we make it out in time you can go see for yourself by clicking right here
