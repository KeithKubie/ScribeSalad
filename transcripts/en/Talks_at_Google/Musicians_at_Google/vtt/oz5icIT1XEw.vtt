Male Presenter: I want to welcome
Rana June today to Google New York.

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.733
Rana is known as the iPad DJ.

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:11.233
But we invited her here today because
her stories are so much deeper than that.

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:13.267
She started off as a developer 

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:16.900
and through good decisions and risks

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.933
she's kind of evolved into
her current role as an iPad DJ.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.533
She played TED a few nights ago 

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:26.467
so we just thought it was a great
match to get out the geek crowd

00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:27.700
and have her come down
and talk at Google.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.767
So without further ado, Rana June.

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:32.533
Rana June: Thank you.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.700
It's such a pleasure to be here
talking to you guys

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.033
 because lately I play a lot of shows where,

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.633
it's like in a nightclub or whatever.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:43.800
But really my roots are more on
the analytics and engineering side.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.233
And, and, so I just want to tell you
a little bit about who I am

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:54.633
and I guess why I'm the iPad DJ
and maybe a professional DJ isn't.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:58.600
So I grew up in Virginia and
Steve Case was my neighbor.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.133
So I've been using kind of this new
generation of web if you will for,

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.300
for my whole life.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.767
And my school, elementary school
actually beta tested AIM.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:12.700
It was like really cool to see
how that whole community now,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.000
the DC area is really, has created a lot
of the products that we use nowadays.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.767
But I thought that
I wanted to go into politics.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.200
And I went down that path

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.200
and I actually worked doing political lobbying
and grass roots stuff for a couple years.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.133
And I realized very quickly
that that's not for me.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.833
But if you could take those same principles
of getting communities together

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:40.400
and communications and really just gathering
people who are like-minded together,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.267
if you applied that to business,

00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:43.767
you could call that communications;

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:47.300
and suddenly now people aren't
so mad at you. [laughs]

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.600
And so I decided to kind
of shift roles a little bit.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.333
And so I, I started a couple companies

00:01:53.333 --> 00:02:00.233
and I realized that there was this amazing
opportunity to help entrepreneurs in the DC area

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:02.467
learn how to take their products to market.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.733
Because there's all the AOL
layoffs were happening

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:08.333
and there were all these brilliant
engineers running around

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:12.000
with like 50,000 dollars in severance
and they all had ideas for start-ups.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.667
And this was in the early 2000's.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.567
And so people, 
they just didn't know how to,

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:21.100
how to take those ideas and help other
people understand what they were building.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.033
And I, I started this company

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:28.667
and I got like five clients in three weeks
or something like that.

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.567
And a few weeks later,

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.400
I basically got acquired
[laughs]

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.100
and so that was really
short-lived endeavor for me.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.900
But I got a talent acquisition kind of thing
with a venture fund in New York, in DC I mean.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.800
And so what happened was I was forced
to think about all these different verticals.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.867
I was thrust into learning how to
take all those messages to market.

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:55.400
And it was 13 different companies
operating under a Keiretsu model.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.200
So each company within our fund was basically
there to help support the other companies.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.133
And I mean, I'm sitting here like,
oh, my God.

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:03.267
I know nothing about telecomm.

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:04.733
I know nothing about infrastructure.

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:06.200
I know nothing about any of these things.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.800
But I had to learn.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.667
So a few years later, fast forward to 2007
and the iPhone comes out.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:15.700
And I am geeking out beyond belief 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.467
because I was like this is a--
this is a huge paradigm shift

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:23.600
and I was really excited about it and none of my
colleagues were really sharing that enthusiasm.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.300
Except for one of my partners
and we were both kind of,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.500
we had ja+ilbroken in our phones

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.200
and we realized there was this whole
development community forming

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.100
and that there was a great opportunity to build
a company around what was happening there;

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.900
so this kind of like just
an idea or whatever.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.167
But then in, on June 1st, 2008,
we actually created the company.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:48.333
We decided to leave the fund
and start this business

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:51.833
and 41 days later,
we'd actually built the product.

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:56.533
So on Day One of the App Stores launch,
we had a product in the market.

00:03:56.533 --> 00:04:01.100
And so I have data from Day One about
application usage, patterns, behaviors,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.167
all that stuff.

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:05.133
And again, coming
from an analytical background,

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:06.733
it's kind of the way my brain works, 

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:08.300
I started to really understand

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.100
how people were gonna start incorporating
these devices into their daily lives.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.400
And this is the first iteration;
at that point, it was the 3G.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.300
But the 2nd version of the phone
so it was very early on;

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.900
so fast forward now a 1000 days later.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.100
We have 10 billion application downloads.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.233
So it's amazing to see
how quickly this has all changed.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:30.767
But that book that's on your,
on your chairs right now

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:35.900
I decided last year to write a book
about the first 500 days of the

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.467
and kind of look back and see
what had happened prior to that

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:44.033
in terms of other people's attempts
to reach the mobile consumer

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.000
and sort of where those things had,
had fallen short.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.967
And then also what Apple had done well

00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:52.900
and tell stories of different developers and
former Apple employees and all of that.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.900
So, I don't know if any of you guys know about
what the process for writing a book is.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.267
But you submit it.

00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:00.700
You work really hard 
and then you submit it

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.033
and then you have to just basically sit around
and wait and that's really boring. [laughs]

00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:10.967
So my background as a musician
is actually, it's-- it's not that new.

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:16.333
I was sort of playing music
when I was six and I played piano, violin.

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:20.833
Viola was my main instrument
and I was pretty good at viola.

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:23.000
And I picked up guitar at age 15.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.967
And I also learned about
computer recording at 15

00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:28.733
around the same time that I started
to get into electronic music.

00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:33.233
So it was a really amazing
point of intersection there.

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:36.067
And so here I was,
I was in college.

00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:38.067
And I was pretending to listen to lectures

00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:43.067
but really I was making beats on my
math book or Power Book at the time.

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:46.167
And so when I built my career in business,

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:48.433
I'd always had a studio in my house

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:53.300
but it just never had an opportunity to
become something that I actually pursued.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.433
And so I turned the book in and I thought,

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:59.133
Well, I have a few months now
where I don't really have much going on.

00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:02.833
So why don't I just go to Guitar Center
and just buy a bunch of gear

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:06.667
and just get myself back up to speed
with what's going on in this space?

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:13.133
And so I went and I spent like 4000 bucks
buying midi-controllers and Ableton, Logic;

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:15.333
got all the tools, all the plug-ins.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:21.400
And I sat down at my computer and I was like
what am I going to do with all this stuff?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.800
It was really overwhelming just because
you have so many possibilities and it's just,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.533
it can be a little bit cumbersome.

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:31.967
So that was really interesting time

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:37.000
because I had those little experiments
a week before the launch of the iPad.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.167
So I was already kind of thinking
about music and how to,

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:45.200
how to take these new paradigms
and incorporate them.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.600
And I was looking at things like the Lemur
which is a touch screen controller

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.867
and there were some really amazing things
happening with iPhones controlling laptops.

00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:58.767
And so when I was sitting in line,
I actually, I live close by.

00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:03.367
I went to the meat packing district
Apple Store at 2:00 in the morning

00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:05.333
because [laughs] why not?

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:07.300
So I'm sitting there and
there's nobody else in line.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.433
And I guess something just clicked
and I realized, Oh my God.

00:07:11.433 --> 00:07:14.000
I can fuse what I know about mobile.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.967
And I can fuse what I know about music.

00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:20.033
And maybe there's something I can do in
the middle of those two passions of mine?"

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:25.400
So I raced home and the reason that I have
two iPads is actually also a funny story.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.167
I had preordered my iPad and all
of my friends on Twitter were like,

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:33.433
"Steve Wozniak's in line with us".

00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:35.633
"Everything's awesome."'
"Everyone's in line."

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:37.900
And I thought, "'Damn it.
I'm missing out. I gotta go."

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.000
So I like actually leapt out
of bed and went to sit in line.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.500
So [laughs] now I had two iPads, right?

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.967
So I get home and I start kind
of messing around with them.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.633
And I just, I discover
that there were,

00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:53.200
there were some really incredible
instruments that had been built

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.733
that were specifically around the--
the notion of using a touch interface.

00:07:57.733 --> 00:08:01.433
And the problem that I faced
at the time was that

00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:06.700
I was using beta software or
maybe even alpha software.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.633
All these apps had not been tested
on the actual device yet

00:08:09.633 --> 00:08:13.967
because the developers at the time
didn't have, didn't have the access to,

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:15.500
to the iPad to test on.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.267
So I had the buggiest, 

00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:22.033
worst experience and that's
why I incorporated the DJ mixer.

00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:23.667
It wasn't originally my intention.

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.800
I actually just wanted to have two tablets.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:33.133
And then I realized that this was actually
a real hindrance to my ability to perform.

00:08:33.133 --> 00:08:36.667
So this is how, this is the genesis
of this set up.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:41.133
And to give you a little bit of color
into what's happened since then,

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:47.133
I made a video and put it up on YouTube and
got almost a million views in two weeks.

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:50.533
So suddenly, this girl
who's like a data geek

00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:54.400
is now the face of touch screen
mobile music making.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:01.367
And I had to again learn very quickly
how to incorporate all the--

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:02.200
all of my background

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.800
and then also keep pushing
the boundaries of what's possible with,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.967
with just two touch screen interfaces
and no computer as you can see.

00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:12.233
I'm not; this is the processing
power that I have.

00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:17.667
So these are my kids,
Alpha and Beta. [laughs]

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:22.100
And I hope with iPad 2 I don't
have the same problems but I,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:28.500
I basically figured out a way to hack a version
of Ableton Live which is very popular,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.400
it's called a 'Da'. 

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.933
But in music, it's like an interface for
a lot DJ's use it for live performance.

00:09:34.933 --> 00:09:36.933
And so what I've done is I've created, 

00:09:36.933 --> 00:09:41.100
like the set I'm going to play for you
probably took me about 30 hours to make.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.567
It's not an easy process.

00:09:42.567 --> 00:09:44.700
When I play shows that are 3 hours long, 

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.133
it takes me weeks and months
to make the sets

00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:52.500
because everything is done by hand
and it's, it's frustrating.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.767
But I think that at this point, 

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:56.367
I've played 90 shows since last April

00:09:56.367 --> 00:10:01.667
for over 100,000 people and
every day I learn something new.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:04.067
And again, coming back
to the beginning of the talk.

00:10:04.067 --> 00:10:05.967
I mean I'm so excited to sit with you guys

00:10:05.967 --> 00:10:08.667
because I really feel like everyone
in this room can help me

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:11.967
think about what the future of this is.

00:10:11.967 --> 00:10:14.200
Because I think about this in the context of,

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.100
'Yeah, it's great. 

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.800
I'm making music on an iPad.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.100
But what does it really mean?' 

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.567
Well, when I was a child,

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:22.100
playing music was my favorite
part of the day.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.300
And my niece is 12.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.400
And she doesn't have
a music program in her school.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.267
So what if with a tablet, a child can learn 
a chord progression on a piano.

00:10:32.267 --> 00:10:35.067
Or they can learn rhythm
or they can learn music theory.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:40.267
So if you can, if you can take this out beyond
just the fact that I'm an iPad DJ

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:42.267
which I didn't even name myself that.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.100
I was actually given that name so it stuck.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.800
But I kind of, I really think it's bigger
than just playing dance music.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.900
And so I'm going to play a short set
for you guys.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.933
And then afterwards feel free
to ask me questions.

00:10:55.933 --> 00:10:57.833
And it's just really a pleasure to be here.

It has problems 
but it's entertaining as hell.

00:33:31.933 --> 00:33:35.800
So I think that's one of the things
that's really important to me as a musician

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.933
and kind of, I'm veering more into the--
the artist's realm now

00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:42.300
than in the analytic space just nowadays.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:47.933
And one thing that is really important to me is
when I see my favorite electronic musicians,

00:33:47.933 --> 00:33:50.767
I'm like 'Dude are you checking
your e-mail right now

00:33:50.767 --> 00:33:53.667
or are you playing music right now
because I can't really tell

00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:56.100
and I think this really injects

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.500
a lot of creativity and an audio and
visual connection with an audience.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.367
So I'm sure you guys can imagine like
when I play for 5 or 6,000 people, it's crazy.

00:34:04.367 --> 00:34:09.433
Because I can like bring people up on stage
and I can swing the iPads around.

I can, you've never seen
a DJ pick up a turntable.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.433
So this is definitely, 

00:34:14.433 --> 00:34:20.200
it's just, it's forcing people to think
about electronic music in a different way

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.367
because one of the things that makes
electronics so interesting for composers

00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:30.967
is that you have unlimited
processing power, right?

00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:34.800
Like the human mind can't do
as much as a computer can.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.200
But what you lose is that now
you have a machine, right?

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.400
But if you have an organic touch manipulating
sound that's processed by a computer,

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.667
that's super exciting.

00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:47.733
Especially for someone like me and--
and so I really hope this is the beginning.

00:34:47.733 --> 00:34:50.400
And it hasn't even been a year
that I've been doing this.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.367
So I hope when I come back and
play for you guys this time next year,

00:34:54.367 --> 00:34:55.467
it'll be like crazy.

00:34:55.467 --> 00:34:58.433

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.500
Come.
There's the mic.

00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:10.133
male #1: Do you sell your loops?

00:35:10.133 --> 00:35:11.467
Rana June: Oh, that's a great question.

00:35:11.467 --> 00:35:13.033
So, okay.

00:35:13.033 --> 00:35:15.200
Well, you know, I'm in the company
of friends, right?

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.167
So here's what happened to me.

00:35:18.167 --> 00:35:21.233
I started doing this and everyone's like, WTF?

00:35:21.233 --> 00:35:23.633
And then they were like, no,
that's actually very cool.

00:35:23.633 --> 00:35:28.367
So I have just been commissioned
for my first two remixes

00:35:28.367 --> 00:35:33.567
and so I'm really kind of demonstrating
what I am doing as a producer

00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:35.867
now a lot more than ever
and that's really what I am.

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:38.533
I'm a producer and DJ is not the right word.

00:35:38.533 --> 00:35:43.200
But people, when you say, iPadDJ to anyone,
like walking around in Times Square,

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.133
they can understand what I'm doing.

00:35:45.133 --> 00:35:48.200
And so it's really, like from a marketing
standpoint or whatever,

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.833
it gets me in the door a lot easier
than if I was like,

00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:54.133
I'm a producer 
who uses touch computer.'

00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:56.400
I don't know, 
like it doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.900
My mom understands
what an iPad DJ might be.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.567
So I think as I start to do
a lot more production work

00:36:04.567 --> 00:36:06.467
and people know what my sound is,

00:36:06.467 --> 00:36:12.000
I have a really distinct sound , then
I will probably make my own app.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.900
Because one of the things that's been
really tough for me and this is;

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.200
that's why it's a great question.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.467
When I started doing this, 

00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:20.567
I made a decision on Day One that I wasn't,

00:36:20.567 --> 00:36:23.567
even though I could just fire up X Code
and write something;

00:36:23.567 --> 00:36:27.400
it's like I didn't want anyone to say
that I was using the iPad

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.133
because I was trying to sell something.

00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:31.100
I really do believe in this platform.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.000
I really do believe in what this means.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.367
And so I wanted to just remove
that level of doubt.

00:36:36.367 --> 00:36:39.133
So I only use apps that are available
in the App Store.

00:36:39.133 --> 00:36:43.600
When I make my loops, when I do everything,
everything's only done on the, on the iPad.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.733
It's all done with readily available software;
nothing proprietary.

00:36:46.733 --> 00:36:49.800
However, as you guys can see,
it's kind of clunky for me.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.100
I'm making this fit my work flow
and not the other way around.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:00.167
And that's not ideal when you're a professional
entertainer or whatever and you're like,

00:37:00.167 --> 00:37:01.100
Oh my God.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.867
Is my thing gonna crash?

00:37:03.867 --> 00:37:06.900
So I-- I just, now that so much time
has gone by,

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.967
I think it might be time for me
to start doing that

00:37:08.967 --> 00:37:11.767
and of course, it will come preloaded
with loops and kind of.

00:37:11.767 --> 00:37:16.000
I'll probably do tutorials about how I've
figured out how to make this work.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.333
But that's the beauty of it, right?

00:37:17.333 --> 00:37:20.667
If I hand this iPad to you with my set, 

00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:22.867
you'll probably figure out a different way
to perform it than I do

00:37:22.867 --> 00:37:27.667
and that's what's so beautiful about it
'cause it's so personal.

00:37:27.667 --> 00:37:33.300
But I mean it's just, it's, I'm kind of in this
strange position because people are like,

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.900
they find it hard to believe that I could
be the girl on the cover of that book

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.800
but then also the girl with red hair.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.167
I mean, I think you guys probably
get that better than anybody.

00:37:44.167 --> 00:37:46.700
I mean you can be creative
and technical at the same time

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:51.333
and it actually makes both sides better.

00:37:51.333 --> 00:37:52.533
Does that answer your question?

00:37:52.533 --> 00:37:53.700
Sorry.
Long answer.

00:37:57.767 --> 00:38:01.000
male #2: So this is somewhat farfetched;

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.967
electronic music in the 70's and 80's
especially in Europe.

00:38:04.967 --> 00:38:07.667
Musicians built a lot of their own instruments

00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:12.600
because they didn't exist and
they didn't do what they wanted.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:19.567
What do you think is missing from the
platform to enable people to do that?

00:38:19.567 --> 00:38:23.433
Rana June: Knobs.
[laughter]

00:38:23.433 --> 00:38:25.967
Seriously, I was praying.

00:38:25.967 --> 00:38:28.633
I was watching the announcement
for iPad 2 and I was like,

00:38:28.633 --> 00:38:34.667
Please be a USB port because if I could
have some element of hardware control,

00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:36.700
like this mixer is, you guys see.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.400
I don't touch it.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.867
It's just here as a redundancy.

00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:43.367
But I'm a big fan of circuit bending.

00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:47.833
Like I've been, I've been messing with Speak
and Spell since I was a teenager.

00:38:47.833 --> 00:38:48.833
That's so fun.

00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:51.667
And that's the thing.

00:38:51.667 --> 00:38:52.600
I listen to Alltecher.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.500
I listen to Kraftwerk.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:58.667
I love what those guys do that
is so unique and different

00:38:58.667 --> 00:39:03.600
and I think the challenge here is that
you have Apple sandbox, right?

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.000
But if you look in the STK,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.433
you'll see there are certain things that
you should technically be able to do

00:39:08.433 --> 00:39:10.633
but you will get rejected
if you try and do that.

00:39:10.633 --> 00:39:13.400
And I was saying like seven
or eight months ago

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.067
that there was definitely going
to be GarageBand on the iPad 

00:39:16.067 --> 00:39:18.667
because it just doesn't make sense
for them not to do it

00:39:18.667 --> 00:39:21.267
considering what they were
withholding from developers.

00:39:21.267 --> 00:39:24.167
But what I thought was
very surprising is that

00:39:24.167 --> 00:39:27.167
like there are certain hardware
developers and manufacturers

00:39:27.167 --> 00:39:30.467
that have created these amazing controllers

00:39:30.467 --> 00:39:34.700
where you can put an iPhone inside a
keyboard or an iPad inside a keyboard.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.433
And now the iPad or the iPhone
serves as the brain.

00:39:37.433 --> 00:39:40.100
And it's just triggering midi
or whatever and that's great.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.633
It's like moving in the right direction.

00:39:41.633 --> 00:39:44.133
So when I can have a 49-key workstation

00:39:44.133 --> 00:39:48.967
and it saves everything to my Garageband
session and I've got eight tracks going.

00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:56.167
And then I can connect that or sync it
with my Logic Instance at home

00:39:56.167 --> 00:39:59.400
and compose something on a plane
and finish it at home in the studio.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.900
That's really cool.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.867
We're just not there yet.

00:40:01.867 --> 00:40:03.900
And so for me, that's, it's kind of like,
Oh my God.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.833
I have five billion answers
to that question because it's,

00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:11.767
I mean the most frustrating thing
about this to me

00:40:11.767 --> 00:40:17.267
is that I know if I'm at home on
my tricked out Mac Book Pro,

00:40:17.267 --> 00:40:21.300
the thing that I'm trying to do
that is taking me six hours,

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.700
literally six hours,

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.333
would take me like 3 1/2 minutes to do.

00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:26.967
So those kinds of frustrations,

00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:29.800
I think that's why you're not seeing
a lot of iPad DJ's out there.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.733
Because it's really a frustrating
experience to even--

00:40:32.733 --> 00:40:36.100
to just do the most rudimentary things and--

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.800
But like I said, it's a labor of love
because I really do think,

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.833
once everything catches up with
what you can do on a laptop,

00:40:42.833 --> 00:40:48.267
this will be so much more valuable
than that experience will be.

00:40:48.267 --> 00:40:49.300
male #3: So to follow that up,

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:54.167
we might have some Android developers here
interested in what's missing from that.

00:40:54.167 --> 00:40:57.033
Rana June: Show yourselves.
[laughs]

00:40:57.033 --> 00:41:00.467
male #3: But outside of that
as a follow-up question to,

00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:04.367
when you were talking earlier
about your workflow,

00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:07.567
getting to watch how you work,

00:41:07.567 --> 00:41:11.833
it seems like there's almost
no real need for the DJ mixer.

00:41:11.833 --> 00:41:13.700
You don't use the DJ mixer.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.567
You just use it to sum the two outputs
more than anything?

00:41:16.567 --> 00:41:17.333
Rana June: Yes.

00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:18.867
male #3: Okay.
So everything's happening on the iPads.

00:41:18.867 --> 00:41:21.067
You don't use the DJ mixer
as a DJ mixer at all.

00:41:21.067 --> 00:41:21.667
Rana June: Exactly.

00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:26.267
However, it's one of those things
where it's like life insurance.

00:41:26.267 --> 00:41:27.767
You keep paying every month
and you're like,

00:41:27.767 --> 00:41:29.667
why am I paying for this?

00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:31.800
Health insurance, better example.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.633
That's how I feel about it because I did
my thing at TED and oh my God.

00:41:37.633 --> 00:41:39.067
What just happened?

00:41:39.067 --> 00:41:40.600
My effects aren't working.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.933
I'm touching the chaos pad and it's not doing
anything and I'm messing up all my transitions.

00:41:44.933 --> 00:41:46.200
The audience doesn't know.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.333
I know.

00:41:47.333 --> 00:41:50.667
I had to just literally be like,
'I'm gonna reboot this now.

00:41:50.667 --> 00:41:52.367
Let me just make it look
like I'm doing something'.

00:41:52.367 --> 00:41:54.300
But that's really sucky.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.100
So I'd like to, when I do
the more high pressure shows,

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:03.267
I'll just put my, this sounds crazy
but I think you guys will understand.

00:42:03.267 --> 00:42:04.733
Like why I do this.

00:42:04.733 --> 00:42:08.367
I'll have an iPhone or something
or like an iPad touch

00:42:08.367 --> 00:42:13.433
and I'll just randomly play music at 128
beats per minute on a loop, whatever.

00:42:13.433 --> 00:42:14.767
And I don't even care what it is.

00:42:14.767 --> 00:42:19.967
But in the event that I might need,
if everything just dies,

00:42:19.967 --> 00:42:21.900
and I just need something just to be playing,

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.800
I try to do that when I know
that there's the potential

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.833
for that kind of catastrophic failure.

00:42:26.833 --> 00:42:28.167
But its things like that.

00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:31.900
I mean my problems are so different
than other people's problems.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.600
Like, I'll tell you guys an anecdote
that sucked so bad.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:43.500
I played a huge show for a big client of mine
and it was like their holiday party, right?

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.867
So it was all their advertising
clients were there.

00:42:46.867 --> 00:42:48.500
And I mean they had blown it out.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.333
It was in L.A.

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:53.233
at this huge venue and
I'd had a really lovely day.

00:42:53.233 --> 00:42:56.900
I had gotten a massage that day
and I was just chillin' in L.A.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.967
and the 70 degree weather
got to me in December.

00:42:59.967 --> 00:43:02.800
And I get to my sound check like super late.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.100
I normally do my sound check early
in the day just in case. [laughs]

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.633
And so I get there and
I checked everything else:

00:43:10.633 --> 00:43:12.800
I checked power, 
I checked the cables.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.767
I didn't turn my iPads on until like maybe
15 minutes before the show started.

00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:21.833
So I go and load my Looptastic.

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:23.867
The provisioning license expired.

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:24.800
[audience members chuckle]

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.433
I'm like, Oh, my God.

00:43:26.433 --> 00:43:29.067
So here I am in Xcode trying to fix it.

00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:33.833
I'm calling the developer who's three hours
in different time zone than me.

00:43:33.833 --> 00:43:35.767
It's like ten minutes, five minutes
before the show

00:43:35.767 --> 00:43:38.633
and I'm like, Dude you gotta fix this.
I'm freaking out.

00:43:38.633 --> 00:43:41.700
And it got resolved like a minute
before the doors opened

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.433
but I mean these kinds of frustrations you
just don't anticipate and that's the problem.

00:43:46.433 --> 00:43:49.600
If you could read a book about
what touring musicians experience,

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.600
none of my challenges are in there.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.767
So it -- [laughs]
I've learned a lot.

00:43:54.767 --> 00:43:56.067
It's really tested me.

00:43:56.067 --> 00:44:00.200
The fact that I am still doing it
is insane to be honest.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.933
But that's kind of,
I just, it's comfortable.

00:44:02.933 --> 00:44:05.633
I'm familiar and that's the only thing
that I have control over right now

00:44:05.633 --> 00:44:08.333
is that I can get this mixer everywhere I go.

00:44:08.333 --> 00:44:12.567
And so it just helps me understand
what I'm doing.

00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:14.533
That's the other thing too.

00:44:14.533 --> 00:44:22.367
Because these are, I try;
I practice like five hours a day total.

00:44:22.367 --> 00:44:26.367
Not just physically performing
but making stuff.

00:44:26.367 --> 00:44:27.833
I treat it like an instrument, right?

00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:32.933
So I'm constantly importing new songs or
whatever and doing all this stuff with it

00:44:32.933 --> 00:44:39.400
and like I have six iPads right now
that are all kind of synched.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.767
It's like okay, so there's
a lot of movement there.

00:44:42.767 --> 00:44:44.867
The reason that I use the DJ M or whatever,

00:44:44.867 --> 00:44:48.200
a five channel mixer is that like when I do
shows that are longer than an hour,

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.133
I need to have four iPads.

00:44:50.133 --> 00:44:53.067
And I was explaining earlier like
when I do three hour shows,

00:44:53.067 --> 00:44:55.833
sometimes I'll have all six plugged
in ready to go.

00:44:55.833 --> 00:44:57.833
And then just helps.

00:44:57.833 --> 00:44:59.200
It just helps.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.333
male #4: I have a couple of questions.

00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:02.533
Well, actually one question.

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:03.733
A couple of comments.

00:45:03.733 --> 00:45:07.467
First of all, I sort of feel like
it's not truly mobile

00:45:07.467 --> 00:45:10.133
unless you don't have wires
attached to your gadgets.

00:45:10.133 --> 00:45:13.033
So have you considered Bluetooth
Audio for your setup?

00:45:13.033 --> 00:45:18.333
Rana June: Bluetooth synched right now
which is already for me like a huge gamble.

00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:20.067
I tried; 
that was the thing.

00:45:20.067 --> 00:45:21.000
I'm with you.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.600
Look.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.633
I mean I can roll into my gig
with these in my purse.

00:45:26.633 --> 00:45:28.967
Like that's how mobile it is on that end.

00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:30.367
But I do have to deal with this.

00:45:30.367 --> 00:45:31.833
So I think it's one of those things where, 

00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:38.133
at first what I tried to do was get a third iPad
with there's an app that's really gorgeous,

00:45:38.133 --> 00:45:39.333
Controls Surface.

00:45:39.333 --> 00:45:40.067
I tried doing it all.

00:45:40.067 --> 00:45:41.933
It just sucks.

00:45:41.933 --> 00:45:43.833
It's not there yet.

00:45:43.833 --> 00:45:46.767
Maybe, maybe iPad 2 will solve
some of those audio problems.

00:45:46.767 --> 00:45:48.467
But for me, I couldn't get it.

00:45:48.467 --> 00:45:50.467
There was so much latency involved

00:45:50.467 --> 00:45:55.233
when I was doing things with Bluetooth
or using wireless of any kind.

00:45:55.233 --> 00:45:58.500
With this, 
this is so blasphemous anyways guys.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.033
Sometimes some of my shows,
are there any audio geeks in here?

00:46:02.033 --> 00:46:05.833
Really, the DJ gods are
like frowning on me so much

00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:09.667
because I have an eighth inch
cable to an XLR.

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:10.800
It's so wrong.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.767
It's so wrong.

00:46:11.767 --> 00:46:14.133
And that's kind of the other thing.

00:46:14.133 --> 00:46:18.700
I mean it's not like this is good audio signal
but at least it's reliable.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.733
So if you know of any way that
I can make that work without wires,

00:46:21.733 --> 00:46:23.667
I would be totally down.

00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:26.500
male #4: Actually I figured you would say you
don't have a good answer for that question.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.767
Rana June: [laughs]

00:46:28.767 --> 00:46:31.867
male #4: [laughs] Anyway,
I can't resist a shameless plug here.

00:46:31.867 --> 00:46:32.567
Rana June: Yeah.

00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:37.600
male #4: So I recently thought up
a media Bluetooth interface

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.667
that would be a way for your knobs
to talk to your gadgets.

00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:42.633
Rana June: That's such a--
that's such a problem for me.

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:43.067
You guys see.

00:46:43.067 --> 00:46:45.267
Sometimes I'll miss something.

00:46:45.267 --> 00:46:49.733
I'll literally have to loop back 16 bars because
I couldn't move my fingers fast enough.

00:46:49.733 --> 00:46:52.967
Or it says 16 inputs for multi-touch.

00:46:52.967 --> 00:46:54.733
It doesn't mean it actually works for 16.

00:46:54.733 --> 00:46:56.333
I don't have 16 fingers anyways.

00:46:56.333 --> 00:47:00.200
But it's like, if I do four or five things
at a time, things get screwed up.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.933
So having a physical controller
would be awesome.

00:47:02.933 --> 00:47:07.033
male #4: You may hack me soon
though because it works.

00:47:07.033 --> 00:47:08.333
It works with Android

00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:12.300
and unfortunately Steve Jobs may not
let you access the API that you need.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.633
Rana June: Do you know what?
Look.

00:47:13.633 --> 00:47:15.567
I'll say this no matter where I am.

00:47:15.567 --> 00:47:19.800
If I could do this on whatever,
whatever, I would do it.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.133
It just so happens that right now
this is what's working.

00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:26.367
I'm really open to ideas here
because that's the thing.

00:47:26.367 --> 00:47:29.300
I'm getting to the point
where I'm trying to get a little stuck.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.000
'Cause there's certain things
that I just can't do.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.500
So that's the thing you know.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.700
I'm really, really open.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.833
Maybe I'll incorporate one Android tablet.

00:47:37.833 --> 00:47:42.100
And I'll have three or maybe,
I'm sure that there's things I can do.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.700
It's just a matter of getting that to work.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.467
Thank you guys, I appreciate it.

00:47:47.467 --> 00:47:50.633
[applause]
00:47:50.633,00:00:00.000
