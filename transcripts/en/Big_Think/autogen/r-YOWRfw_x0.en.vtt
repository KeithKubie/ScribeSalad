that human beings are complicated and
 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.259

human beings are best understood in
 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.409
human beings are best understood in
their complexity and if only we had more

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419
their complexity and if only we had more
 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.110
their complexity and if only we had more
of that in our day-to-day I've been

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120
of that in our day-to-day I've been
 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.730
of that in our day-to-day I've been
thinking a lot about what it means to be

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.410
thinking about what are the
transferrable properties in what are the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420
transferrable properties in what are the
 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.830

empowerment we think about sharing not

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070
empowerment we think about sharing not
 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.690
empowerment we think about sharing not
just to impose knowledge but rather to

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700
just to impose knowledge but rather to
 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.359
just to impose knowledge but rather to
share knowledge in a dynamic way that

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369
share knowledge in a dynamic way that
 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.599

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609
again is about the self empowerment that
 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.810

expanded mind for having sharper tools
for being able to evaluate contradiction

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640
for being able to evaluate contradiction
 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.300
for being able to evaluate contradiction
and hold contradiction aloft sometimes I

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310
and hold contradiction aloft sometimes I
 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.130

great and powerful things and I think
that to have courage inform our thinking

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090

where that takes us to not stay safe in
 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.340
where that takes us to not stay safe in
our own position but to make it safe for

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350
our own position but to make it safe for
 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.850
our own position but to make it safe for
