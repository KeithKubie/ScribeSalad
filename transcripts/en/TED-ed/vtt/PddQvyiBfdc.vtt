00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:09.270
Tens of millions of years ago,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.605
a force of nature set two giant masses
on an unavoidable collision course

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:18.036
that would change the face of the Earth

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:22.510
and spell life or death 
for thousands of species.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.615
The force of nature was plate tectonics,

00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:29.369
and the bodies were 
North and South America.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.963
And even though 
they were hurdling towards each other

00:00:31.963 --> 00:00:35.703
at an underwhelming 2.5 cm per year,

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:39.937
their collision actually did have massive
biological reprocussions

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:46.209
by causing one of the greatest episodes of
biological migration in Earth's history:

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:49.448
The Great American Biotic Interchange.

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:54.910
Our story begins 65 million years ago,
the beginning of the age of mammals,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.419
when what is now North and South America

00:00:57.419 --> 00:01:00.722
were continents separated 
by a marine connection

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:03.366
between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:07.306
During this time, South America
was the home of fauna

00:01:07.306 --> 00:01:12.164
that included armored glyptodonts
as large as compact cars,

00:01:12.164 --> 00:01:15.183
giant ground sloths
weighing more than a ton,

00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:20.581
opossums, monkeys,
and carnivorous terror birds.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.886
North America had its own species,

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:26.683
such as horses, bears,
and saber-toothed cats.

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:30.975
Over 20 million years, the shifting
of the Farallon and Caribbean Plates

00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:36.636
produced the Central America Volcanic Arc,
a peninsula connected to North America,

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:41.393
with only a very narrow seaway
separating it from South America.

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:45.301
As these plates continued
to surf the Earth's magma layer

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:47.588
far beneath the Pacific Ocean floor,

00:01:47.588 --> 00:01:50.095
the Caribbean Plate migrated eastward,

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:52.114
and about 15 million years ago,

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:57.088
South America finally collided with 
this Central American Arc.

00:01:57.088 --> 00:02:01.493
This gradually closed the water connection
between the Pacific and the Caribbean,

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:02.869
creating a land bridge,

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.431
which connected North America 
to South America.

00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:10.160
Terrestrial organisms could now
cross between the two continents,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.880
and from the fossil records,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.529
it's evident that different waves
of their dispersals took place.

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.159
Even though plants don't physically move,

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.462
they are easily dispersed 
by wind and waves,

00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:25.579
so they migrated first,
along with a few species of birds.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.924
They were followed 
by some freshwater fishes

00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:29.401
and amphibians,

00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:33.310
and finally, various mammals
began to traverse the bridge.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.837
From South America, mammals like
ground sloths and glyptodonts

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:40.348
were widly distributed in North America.

00:02:40.348 --> 00:02:44.291
Moreover, many South American
tropical mammals,

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:49.202
like monkeys and bats,
colonized the forests of Central America,

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.380
and are very abundant today.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.782
South American predator marsupials
went extinct 3 million years ago,

00:02:55.782 --> 00:03:00.806
at which point North American predators,
such as cats, bears and foxes,

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:05.878
migrated south and occupied 
the ecological space left behind.

00:03:05.878 --> 00:03:12.197
Horses, llamas, tapirs, cougars,
saber-toothed cats, gomphotheres,

00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:16.845
and later humans also headed
south across the land bridge.

00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:20.489
But what happened on land
is only half the story.

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.276
What had been one giant ocean
was now two,

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:29.052
creating differences in temperature
and salinity for the two bodies of water.

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:32.683
The isthmus also became a barrier
for many marine organisms,

00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:38.115
like mollusks, crustaceans, foraminifera,
bryozoans, and fish,

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:41.908
and separated the populations
of many marine species.

00:03:41.908 --> 00:03:45.986
It also allowed the establishment
of the thermohaline circulation,

00:03:45.986 --> 00:03:48.492
a global water conveyor belt,

00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:51.345
which transports warm water
across the Atlantic,

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:55.016
and influences the climate
of the East Coast of North America,

00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:58.537
the West Coast of Europe,
and many other areas.

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.613
It's a challenge to track all of the ways

00:04:00.613 --> 00:04:04.085
the collision of the Americas 
changed the world,

00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:08.258
but it's safe to say that the ripples
of the Great American Biotic Interchange

00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:12.269
have propagated through
the history of life on the planet,

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.549
and that of mankind.

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.455
What if these species hadn't gone extinct,

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:19.400
or if there were no monkeys 
in Central America,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.386
or jaguars in South America?

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.827
What if the thermohaline circulation
wasn't flowing?

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:27.746
Would the East Coast of North America
be much colder?

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:32.363
It all goes to show some of the most
impactful transformations of our planet

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.544
aren't the explosive ones
that happen in an instant,

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:39.149
but the ones that crawl towards
irreversible change.

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:41.840
We are the product of history.
