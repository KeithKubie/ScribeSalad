00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.310
a plus b times open
parentheses c plus d is

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.120
equal to a plus bc plus
bd represents which

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.656
of the following properties?

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:15.030
So to get from the left-hand
side to the right-hand side,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.490
it looks like what they did
is they multiplied the b times

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.400
the c plus d.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.732
In fact, they
distributed the b. b

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:25.680
times c plus d is b
times c, plus b times d.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.910
So this is clearly the
distributive property.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.550
Let's do another one.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.000
4 plus open parentheses
10 plus 6, they're saying,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.144
is the same thing as 4
plus 10 first, plus 6.

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:39.560
So on the left-hand side, we're
doing the 10 plus 6 first,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.920
and then we're adding the 4.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.296
On the right-hand side, we're
adding the 4 plus 10 first,

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:44.461
and then we're adding the 6.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.380
And we're saying they're
equal to each other.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.084
It doesn't matter how we
associate these numbers.

00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:51.000
Here we're associating
the 10 and the 6 first,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.224
and then we're adding the 4.

00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:54.140
Here we're associating
the 4 and the 10 first,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.590
and then we're adding the 6.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.905
So this is the associative
property for addition.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.990
Let's do several more.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.300
a plus b is equal to b
plus a represents which

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.697
of the following properties?

00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:09.530
So it doesn't matter
which order I'm adding.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.150
It doesn't matter if I
do a plus b or b plus a.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.431
This is the
commutative property.

00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:17.360
Do another one.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.450
Which one of the
equations on the right

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.830
represents the associative
property of addition?

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.750
So remember,
associative property--

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.960
we're talking about
it doesn't matter

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.567
how we associate the numbers.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.900
So we might do the operation
on two of the numbers first

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.480
and then on the third, or on
maybe two of the other numbers

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.100
and then on the one
that's left over.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.910
So let's see what over
here looks like that.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.810
So this right over here, this
is the commutative property.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.280
This right over here is
the distributive property.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.700
This one right over here--
on the left-hand side,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.450
we add b plus c first.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.625
On the right-hand side,
we add a plus b first.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.500
And these two things
are equal to each other.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.400
It doesn't matter
how we associate it,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.080
if we associate b plus c
first or a plus b first.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.030
So this is the associative
property of addition.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.140
Let's do-- which one of
the equations on the right

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.660
represents the
distributive property

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.700
of addition over multiplication?

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.460
So let's see.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.140
This first one, they're just
changing the associations.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.260
Here, this is commutative,
this last one.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.705
Here, they're actually
distributing the b

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:17.090
over the c plus d.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.260
So b times c plus d is the
same thing as bc plus bd.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.424
So it's that one
right over there.

00:02:23.424 --> 00:02:24.590
Maybe do a few more of this.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.870
This is a lot of fun.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.910
a plus b plus c is equal
to a plus b plus c,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.820
so this once again, they're
re-associating the numbers.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.360
But it doesn't matter which
order we associate them in.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.596
So this is the
associative property.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.220
Which one of the
equations on the right

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.020
represents the commutative
property of addition?

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.930
So commutative-- we don't
care about the order

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.700
in which we're
doing the operation.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.460
So a plus b is
equal to b plus a.

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:56.010
Which one of the
equations on the right

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.099
represents the commutative
property of addition?

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.640
Well, that's what
they just asked us.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.940
a plus b is equal to b plus a.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.920
And we are done.
