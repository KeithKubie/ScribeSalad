Your body has billions of cells, and if every one was six feet at any given

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.470
point, you would be the biggest organism ever. So cells can't expand like that,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.510
but DNA is

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.580
actually quite thin. In fact it's 0.000000002 meters

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.900
thick and it's also highly organized by proteins into individual units

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.118
called chromosomes.
