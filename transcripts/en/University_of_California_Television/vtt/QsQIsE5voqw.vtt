00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:13.973
- Dr. Leslie Rubin who is accomplished

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:18.610
in so many fields I hardly
know where to begin,

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.060
but he is professor of pediatrics

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.747
at the Morehouse School of Medicine,

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:28.164
and the Southeast Pediatric Environmental

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.515
Health Specialty Unit at Emory University,

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.512
the medical director of
developmental pediatrics specialist

00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:37.438
in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:39.833
and president of Innovative Solutions

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.624
for Disadvantage and Disability.

00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:44.530
We'll hear more about that from Dr. Rubin

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.250
later on this afternoon, so Dr. Rubin.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.750
- Thank you, Lucy.

00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:52.675
Hello everyone.

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.682
Thank you Lucy for inviting me here,

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:57.765
and nice to meet you all.

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:03.968
My task is to look at
the pediatric aspects.

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:08.355
The fact is that those of
you who deal with children

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:09.938
might have to face.

00:01:11.327 --> 00:01:13.160
Right, my disclaimers.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:20.717
The head of CDC said
that never in the history

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:24.884
has there been such a
dramatic effect on the fetus

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.568
from a mosquito, and I just thought

00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:35.038
I'd tell you what thoughts
went through my head

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:36.929
is we're dealing with the Zika virus.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.744
Zika virus comes from Africa,

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:40.393
from the Zika Forest in Uganda,

00:01:40.393 --> 00:01:44.799
but we've dealt with these
African viruses before

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.998
with HIV is another one of those viruses

00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:49.928
that comes from Africa through primates

00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:54.184
and so has Ebola, so we're
gonna have viruses come and go,

00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:56.273
and they're each gonna
pose different problems

00:01:56.273 --> 00:01:57.926
for us, different challenges,

00:01:57.926 --> 00:01:59.875
and as long as we can tackle them

00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:01.982
in the way we are with
incredible investment

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:04.565
in labor at CDC, I can tell you

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:07.829
'cause I live in Atlanta,

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.053
and all the CDC people
I know are not doing

00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:11.120
what they were doing before.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.736
They're all like doing CDC stuff,

00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:16.077
and the people who are not doing CDC stuff

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:18.252
are doing the stuff the
people who are doing,

00:02:18.252 --> 00:02:19.617
are doing Zika stuff,

00:02:19.617 --> 00:02:21.976
the people who are not doing Zika stuff

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:23.374
were doing the stuff that the people

00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:26.685
who were doing other
things are doing for Zika,

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:28.102
so crazy, anyway.

00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:32.887
Zika is not the only virus,

00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:35.330
or the first virus, that
we've become aware of

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.785
that caused problems in the fetus,

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:40.367
and I just wanted to alert you to

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:44.464
or remind you of the
fact that in the 1960s

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:47.623
there was a massive epidemic of rubella.

00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:50.069
Now rubella in kids produces a rash,

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.309
but rubella in pregnant women

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.578
result in major outcomes for the fetus,

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:59.617
and in the mid 60s, there
was a massive epidemic

00:02:59.617 --> 00:03:03.254
with about 20,000 women who were infected

00:03:03.254 --> 00:03:06.277
during their pregnancies,
and these resulted

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:10.225
in a condition which is called
Congenital Rubella Syndrome.

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:13.850
The kids who were born
with the most severe cases

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.754
were called, and I hesitate to say this,

00:03:16.754 --> 00:03:17.957
but this was the term used,

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:20.728
blueberry muffin baby because they had

00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:23.284
these little spots that were petechiae

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:27.439
on their bodies, but the main problem was

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.015
it affected the central
nervous system, the brain,

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:32.923
and I can tell you because I took care

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:36.409
of many of the kids in the later stage,

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:37.597
and most of their problems

00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:39.492
were intellectual disabilities,

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:43.887
seizure disorders, visual
and hearing impairment,

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:47.007
but also autism, so that's very ironic

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:51.007
that autism was a part
of the clinical spectrum,

00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:56.349
so the lessons we learned from then,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.510
these are lessons that
are being recapitulated

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.494
in the Zika age is that pregnant women

00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:04.724
who are infected with these,

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:06.326
even if they have mild infections

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:10.314
can affect the fetus to
a significant degree,

00:04:10.314 --> 00:04:13.775
and as was mentioned by Kristin before,

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:16.394
the other viruses we're aware of

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:19.237
that can cause similar
effects on the fetus

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:22.928
such as toxoplasmosis, citomegalovirus,

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:26.738
herpes, HIV, and now, the other lesson

00:04:26.738 --> 00:04:29.361
we learned is that we
should give vaccines,

00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:32.956
and I put this in the
entrance in a dramatic way

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:35.740
because the irony is so many people

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.140
are avoiding MMR vaccines

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.991
because they say it causes autism,

00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:42.309
when the vaccines are
preventing conditions

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:46.476
that could potentially cause
autism, so there you go.

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.146
This is fascinating to me
in that the Zika viruses

00:04:53.118 --> 00:04:56.136
live and reproduce in other cells.

00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:58.464
They're just pieces of DNA or RNA,

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:00.951
and they have to get into cells

00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:03.219
in order to replicate, so
when they do get into cells,

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.058
they have a predilection
for certain cells.

00:05:06.058 --> 00:05:07.691
Each virus has its own character,

00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:11.216
and these Zika virus seem to like neurons

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:14.615
and gets in and just messes things up,

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:16.388
so it messes up mitosis,

00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:20.293
and what happens then is
not only messes up mitosis,

00:05:20.293 --> 00:05:22.757
if it hits the neural stem cells,

00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:24.397
and the neural stem cells we know

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:28.230
produce neurons, astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes,

00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:33.036
and what happens then is because the virus

00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:35.972
just destroys the reproductive capability

00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:38.843
of the cell, it sort
of leads to apoptosis,

00:05:38.843 --> 00:05:41.726
and you don't get all these cells,

00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:42.897
and if you don't get all the cells,

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:45.535
then you don't get all the
differentiation of the cells,

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:49.018
you're gonna have many
less cells in the brain,

00:05:49.018 --> 00:05:52.518
and that's what happens in Zika infection.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:55.752
You get less cells,
and you get less cells,

00:05:55.752 --> 00:05:56.838
you get a smaller brain,

00:05:56.838 --> 00:06:00.550
and then hence the micro, which is small,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.053
cephaly which means head,

00:06:02.053 --> 00:06:04.686
so it's the small head.

00:06:04.686 --> 00:06:07.253
So the Congenital Zika Syndrome

00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:09.880
like the Congenital Rubella Syndrome

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.452
has certain characteristics,

00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:13.925
and it's defined by the fact

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:17.056
that there is some history
of infection in the mother,

00:06:17.056 --> 00:06:20.156
and at birth, the kids have
certain characteristics

00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:22.060
which is small head circumference

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.129
and often eye pathology.

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.527
It's very interesting because
one of the first findings,

00:06:28.527 --> 00:06:32.048
or reported findings on congenital rubella

00:06:32.048 --> 00:06:34.881
was in fact cataracts and uveitis,

00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:40.251
so that's not unusual that these viruses

00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:41.950
that attack the central nervous system

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.617
will affect the eye, but also,

00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:48.845
here's a picture, also
because it affects the brain,

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:51.298
it affects what the brain does,

00:06:51.298 --> 00:06:54.320
and what the brain does
is controls function,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.397
motor function, cognitive
function, social function,

00:06:57.397 --> 00:07:00.121
and so these kids will
have limited responses,

00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:03.665
abnormal muscle tone,
limited limb movements,

00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:07.832
joint contractures, they will
be neurologically involved.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.050
So what do we need to do

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.189
in the initial newborn period?

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:16.431
The most important thing, if
you're evaluating the infants,

00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.623
is obviously to do the typical

00:07:19.623 --> 00:07:22.695
newborn neurological examination,

00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:25.062
and particularly look at the eye,

00:07:25.062 --> 00:07:27.673
and you might need an
ophthalmologist do to that,

00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:30.168
and then do an auditory
brainstem response,

00:07:30.168 --> 00:07:33.835
the standard newborn
screening is inadequate

00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:38.901
according to the CDC, and the
thing about this eye problem

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.327
is that these two is that it's so similar

00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:47.391
to congenital rubella,
the eye and the hearing,

00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:49.550
so these are neurological impairments

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.424
in the sensory system.

00:07:51.424 --> 00:07:55.651
The CDC also recommends
that blood test be taken,

00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:57.714
serological testing for Zika,

00:07:57.714 --> 00:08:01.028
and we heard about some
of the kind of limitations

00:08:01.028 --> 00:08:02.759
on what that will reveal,

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:05.077
but also blood count, metabolic panels,

00:08:05.077 --> 00:08:09.307
did it affect the liver,
head ultrasound is helpful,

00:08:09.307 --> 00:08:11.893
and the MRI if necessary,

00:08:11.893 --> 00:08:14.354
so I don't know, I was trying to work out

00:08:14.354 --> 00:08:16.457
what the CDC was trying to get at

00:08:16.457 --> 00:08:19.695
with consider MRI which is their language,

00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:20.935
and I wasn't quite sure,

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:24.435
so I just leave it in there, consider MRI.

00:08:30.657 --> 00:08:33.416
In addition, when you
see the newborn infant,

00:08:33.416 --> 00:08:36.229
you need to say okay,
what is going on here,

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:37.871
and what do we need to do?

00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:40.527
So what they say is that
if the clinical features

00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:44.027
are uncomplicated, then
you definitely need

00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:48.182
to refer for early intervention
and for physical therapy,

00:08:48.182 --> 00:08:50.205
if necessary, that's for the multi-system.

00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:54.232
However, obviously, if
there are any complications,

00:08:54.232 --> 00:08:57.566
and they list these in this document,

00:08:57.566 --> 00:08:59.352
which I recommend for any of you

00:08:59.352 --> 00:09:00.415
who want to look at

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:03.531
what the comprehensive recommendations are

00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:05.653
over the CDC, it's a wonderful document.

00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:09.820
You can get it online,
MMWR, from the CDC, August,

00:09:11.664 --> 00:09:14.664
and I'm sure there's a newer report,

00:09:15.971 --> 00:09:18.916
but this is the comprehensive document.

00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:21.555
Anyway, so you refer as necessary,

00:09:21.555 --> 00:09:24.419
and they comment on
possible joint contractures

00:09:24.419 --> 00:09:27.846
because of the muscle spasticity,

00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:30.661
and they also comment on
because you're having the fact

00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:34.591
of the virus affecting
brain and brain cells,

00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:37.346
you can have some hypothalamic,
pituitary dysfunction,

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:39.679
refer to an endocrinologist,

00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:43.379
and obviously, if there's
a question of diagnosis,

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:45.850
they recommend you
consult with a geneticist

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.399
or anybody in infectious disease

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:53.095
to tell you whether this
is the Zika effect or not,

00:09:53.095 --> 00:09:55.327
or Zika is involved.

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:57.678
As far as breastfeeding's concerned,

00:09:57.678 --> 00:10:01.946
the statement is that the
benefits of breastfeeding

00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:03.762
outweigh the risks of Zika,

00:10:03.762 --> 00:10:07.688
and both the CDC and
WHO strongly recommend

00:10:07.688 --> 00:10:10.696
that you continue with
breastfeeding regardless,

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:11.817
so there you go.

00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:15.400
If there's any concern
about breastfeeding.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.538
The nice thing about what
the CDC has done as well

00:10:20.538 --> 00:10:22.784
is that they address the needs of parents

00:10:22.784 --> 00:10:25.701
because you heard Dr. Semin, right,

00:10:28.474 --> 00:10:32.316
tell you about the anxiety of parents

00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:35.185
and most of the counselings to parents

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:36.181
who are anxious,

00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:38.869
and I just cannot imagine for the parents

00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:42.369
to have an infant who has such a condition

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:47.409
where you have this kind
of long term commitment

00:10:49.095 --> 00:10:53.139
to helping the child and whatever
the consequences might be,

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:54.484
the uncertainty and the consequences,

00:10:54.484 --> 00:10:58.732
and this is the CDC says this
is particularly important

00:10:58.732 --> 00:11:00.355
for the low-resource families,

00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:01.703
the low-income families

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.500
because they're already overburdened.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.919
They already have a
whole host of pressures

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:10.836
and limitations to their resources.

00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:18.003
So they recommend that
we use the local, state,

00:11:18.003 --> 00:11:21.408
regional resources because
they've been built into place

00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:24.870
from decades ago from
laws that were passed

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.517
that include the early
intervention programs.

00:11:27.517 --> 00:11:31.648
They also recommend
that we tell the parents

00:11:31.648 --> 00:11:33.505
to look at the CDC website.

00:11:33.505 --> 00:11:37.096
There's a specific site for families

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:39.728
who have newborn affected by Zika,

00:11:39.728 --> 00:11:40.863
so we can tell the families

00:11:40.863 --> 00:11:43.196
to have a look at that site.

00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:47.105
In California, you have
a wonderful program

00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:49.427
called California Early Start,

00:11:49.427 --> 00:11:52.677
which will provide services to children

00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:56.162
with any children birth to three

00:11:56.162 --> 00:11:58.333
who have developmental delays,

00:11:58.333 --> 00:11:59.403
developmental disabilities,

00:11:59.403 --> 00:12:02.228
and that's the main stand.

00:12:02.228 --> 00:12:03.859
I will tell you in Atlanta

00:12:03.859 --> 00:12:08.026
when I deal a lot with
low-income minority families,

00:12:08.884 --> 00:12:11.717
whenever we have any difficulties,

00:12:12.656 --> 00:12:17.001
we go straight to our version
of this California Early Start

00:12:17.001 --> 00:12:20.237
which is called Babies
Can't Wait in Georgia,

00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:23.964
and they provide in-home counseling,

00:12:23.964 --> 00:12:28.180
in-home therapies, and it's
not intense, necessarily,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.514
but it's something, and it's helpful,

00:12:30.514 --> 00:12:33.597
so I strongly recommend you use that.

00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:36.851
And then of course for
the long term follow up

00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:39.257
for the infants, there's
some standard issues,

00:12:39.257 --> 00:12:41.086
so standard things you need to do,

00:12:41.086 --> 00:12:44.023
routine healthcare measure,

00:12:44.023 --> 00:12:46.074
monitor growth and development,

00:12:46.074 --> 00:12:48.657
test development at each visit,

00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:53.163
refer for therapies and
specialty services as necessary,

00:12:53.163 --> 00:12:54.743
provide support for families,

00:12:54.743 --> 00:12:56.805
establish a medical home.

00:12:56.805 --> 00:12:59.698
This medical home concept
is a very important one

00:12:59.698 --> 00:13:02.136
for kids with disabilities, and in fact,

00:13:02.136 --> 00:13:06.303
the medical home concept
was developed specifically

00:13:07.463 --> 00:13:11.193
for kids with disabilities
because of the multiple services

00:13:11.193 --> 00:13:14.103
they needed and their families had

00:13:14.103 --> 00:13:17.333
for some degree of coordination of care,

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:18.982
and that's the medical home concept,

00:13:18.982 --> 00:13:22.628
and ideally, an interdisciplinary team,

00:13:22.628 --> 00:13:24.508
if there is one, and I'm sure

00:13:24.508 --> 00:13:27.417
that this would be more relevant in areas

00:13:27.417 --> 00:13:31.226
where the Zika virus
is much more prevalent,

00:13:31.226 --> 00:13:34.309
and so it's Texas and Florida so far,

00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:39.283
so you know but stay tuned,

00:13:39.283 --> 00:13:40.645
and I think the more we're on top of it,

00:13:40.645 --> 00:13:41.868
and I think the very fact

00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:44.150
that there was such a mobilization

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.491
of resources internationally has resulted

00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:50.978
in that sort of limitation
in the spread of the virus,

00:13:50.978 --> 00:13:53.279
so the fact that we're talking about it,

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.938
and you might say well I don't know

00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:57.734
if I'm ever gonna see
anyone with it is good

00:13:57.734 --> 00:13:59.388
because hopefully you won't,

00:13:59.388 --> 00:14:01.858
and in California, and hopefully,

00:14:01.858 --> 00:14:06.025
we've contained it, and it
will kinda begin to recede.

00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:11.499
The CDC also recommends
additional evaluations

00:14:11.499 --> 00:14:14.749
for kids who have the
diagnosis of congenital Zika,

00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:18.739
and that is that comprehensive
neurological exam

00:14:18.739 --> 00:14:21.106
at age one and two months,

00:14:21.106 --> 00:14:23.484
and then as needed after that.

00:14:23.484 --> 00:14:27.716
Definitely routine eye
exams at three months,

00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:30.566
and also hearing, again, assessment

00:14:30.566 --> 00:14:32.385
at four to six months.

00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:34.337
They also recommend thyroid screen,

00:14:34.337 --> 00:14:38.094
and again, because of the
hypothalamic pituitary effect

00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:42.011
that might take place in
the more severe cases.

00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:46.903
Also, as mentioned, that there
have been some fetal deaths,

00:14:46.903 --> 00:14:49.872
and obviously, there's a
great range of severity

00:14:49.872 --> 00:14:53.705
in the expression depending
on when the mother

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.671
had the infection, which trimester,

00:14:57.671 --> 00:15:00.566
the degree to which she has a viremia,

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:05.094
and so this is another
statement made by the CDC

00:15:05.094 --> 00:15:08.975
based on a finding where
they reported in November

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:11.558
that there were 13 infants born

00:15:12.488 --> 00:15:16.636
who had congenital Zika
without microcephaly at birth,

00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:19.588
but who may have later problems,

00:15:19.588 --> 00:15:24.412
and if you bear in mind that
with the congenital Zika

00:15:24.412 --> 00:15:27.261
you've got the virus, if
the infant has the virus,

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:29.599
then the virus is still in the body,

00:15:29.599 --> 00:15:31.856
it's in the brain, it's
going to affect cells,

00:15:31.856 --> 00:15:35.673
so there will be some later consequences,

00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:39.673
so even if the infant is
born with a, let's say,

00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:44.050
average sized head, you do
need to follow these infants

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.694
according to the criteria of the CDC.

00:15:47.694 --> 00:15:49.994
Now, they don't know what
the long term outcome is

00:15:49.994 --> 00:15:51.712
because it's only been discovered

00:15:51.712 --> 00:15:53.862
on the last couple of years,

00:15:53.862 --> 00:15:57.665
but I think we can take our lessons again

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:01.297
from the congenital rubella epidemic

00:16:01.297 --> 00:16:04.065
where we had developmental delays,

00:16:04.065 --> 00:16:07.078
sensory disturbances, visual disturbances,

00:16:07.078 --> 00:16:08.976
clinical picture of cerebral palsy.

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:13.187
Also, who knows even the
clinical picture of autism

00:16:13.187 --> 00:16:15.689
as happened with congenital rubella,

00:16:15.689 --> 00:16:19.056
feeding problems with the more severe

00:16:19.056 --> 00:16:21.803
oral motor difficulties,

00:16:21.803 --> 00:16:23.230
and some behavior challenges,

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.428
and these, we have no
idea what they might be,

00:16:26.428 --> 00:16:28.653
and I think you also
had something like this

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:29.882
up in one of your slides,

00:16:29.882 --> 00:16:31.882
but I left it in anyway.

00:16:33.563 --> 00:16:36.304
It doesn't hurt to repeat some
things that are important,

00:16:36.304 --> 00:16:38.722
and these are important things.

00:16:38.722 --> 00:16:42.223
Also, Zika is a notifiable condition,

00:16:42.223 --> 00:16:44.222
that if you do see a case of Zika,

00:16:44.222 --> 00:16:48.005
you do need to notify
your local health district

00:16:48.005 --> 00:16:49.505
or whatever it is,

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:53.614
public health department,

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:57.697
and depending on, regardless
of whether the child

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.951
had any infection or not,

00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:04.426
so if there is any history
of Zika, potential Zika,

00:17:04.426 --> 00:17:07.919
you do need to notify
your health department.

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:10.836
Alright, so in summary, number one,

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.100
you need to know about Zika,

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.805
and you need to know about
Zika in your community,

00:17:16.805 --> 00:17:18.783
and even if you don't
need to know about it

00:17:18.783 --> 00:17:20.888
in your community, and
there isn't any Zika,

00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:23.469
you need to know about it in the world

00:17:23.469 --> 00:17:28.014
because just in case you
just need to be aware.

00:17:28.014 --> 00:17:30.917
Secondly, if you see an
infant who has a small head,

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:32.814
and in your work up you're looking for

00:17:32.814 --> 00:17:35.361
any of the other causes, the genetic,

00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:39.163
or the intrauterine infections,
the ToRCH infections,

00:17:39.163 --> 00:17:43.137
or as mentioned, tobacco and alcohol also

00:17:43.137 --> 00:17:45.163
result in small head circumference,

00:17:45.163 --> 00:17:47.996
you should just bear in mind Zika.

00:17:49.157 --> 00:17:53.621
Thirdly, you really need to
have a very systematic approach

00:17:53.621 --> 00:17:56.347
to these infants because
you need to monitor

00:17:56.347 --> 00:17:58.551
their development, you
need to try to encourage

00:17:58.551 --> 00:18:01.033
a more positive development
with the therapies

00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:02.839
and interventions, and most significantly

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:06.400
from my standpoint is the
support of the families

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.087
because they have to
deal with the realities

00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:11.956
as well as the anxiety,
so there are realities

00:18:11.956 --> 00:18:14.977
and anxieties, and they
have to deal with both,

00:18:14.977 --> 00:18:19.178
so it's important for
us to have that mind,

00:18:19.178 --> 00:18:20.639
so that's the support for the families,

00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:25.360
and then of course, notify
your public health department,

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.975
so that's it, and of course,

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:32.184
as Kirsten mentioned,
we are still learning.

00:18:32.184 --> 00:18:33.386
We're learning all the time,

00:18:33.386 --> 00:18:36.211
and it's very helpful if you just keep up

00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:37.552
with what's going on,

00:18:37.552 --> 00:18:39.919
and it's at the CDC website,

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:43.866
so I thank you for the
opportunity to present.

00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:47.116
(audience applauding)
