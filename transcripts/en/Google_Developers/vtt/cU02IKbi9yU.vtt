LINDSAY JEAN THOMSON:
Before I tell you

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.630
what I'm about to tell you,
a little bit of context.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.850
I grew up in a very small
and conservative town,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.160
and I was the girl who wore a
"this is what a feminist looks

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.210
like" T-shirt to school.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.110
So knowing that about me,
one day, many years later,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.950
I'm hanging out in the park
with my best friend Kim.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.560
We are flying kites and
drinking beers, like we do.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.540
And seemingly out of
nowhere I say, hey,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.750
would you want to start like a
monthly women's speakers series

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.229
with me?

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:38.770
And because Kim is
the kind of person

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.480
who is such an
enthusiastic yes to life,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.410
she was in, and that's how
Women Catalysts was born.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.530
How many of you
have heard of us?

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.980
Or been to an event?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.930
Great.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.150
We are on a mission to inspire
the catalyst in every woman

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.010
through powerful storytelling,
lasting community, and the best

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.370
resources.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.130
We started Women Catalysts
for a lot of reasons.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.060
And I'm going to talk about
one in particular today.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.930
The power of shifting the
storylines that hold us back.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.770
These are actual headlines
from around the time

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.907
we started Women Catalysts.

00:01:15.907 --> 00:01:16.990
Or they're supposed to be.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.880
But things happen, right?

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.110
Lean in.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.410
Don't lean in, lean out.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.300
Ask for what you want, but
make sure you do it just right,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.110
and you're probably not
going to get it anyways.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.950
How do you feel when you
hear stories like these?

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.260
Yeah.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.620
They're problematic for
a lot of reasons, right?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.200
I feel really frustrated,
but worse than that,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.260
I feel disempowered.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.660
Like, I could try to follow all
of that contradictory advice,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.555
but would it even matter?

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:51.430
So what would matter?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.040
What can I do?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.440
I can start with the
stories that I tell myself,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.790
and that I share
with my community.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.710
And the reality is, I know
a lot of amazing women

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.170
who defy those headlines.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.520
I'm guessing you do too.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.300
Women who start
companies and nonprofits.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.840
Women who make art
and write books.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.220
And who do all of these
incredible things,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.830
not out of some
trite dated notion

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.030
of having it all,
but because they care

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.640
and because they have something
of value to offer the world.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.770
Over the past year I've
gotten to interview

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.550
many of these women for our
speaker series, Catalyst

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.300
Conversations.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.060
Women like Zakiya Harris, who
not only started Hack the Hood,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.100
but is also a mom, a musician,
an educator, and so much more.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.950
Really, I have no idea
how she does it all.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.250
Women like Elle Luna, who left
her job in tech to make art,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.380
and inspired millions of
people around the world

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.310
with her story, "The
Crossroads of Should and Must."

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.480
I'm guessing some of you
have heard of that one.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.980
Yeah.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.190
These are the kinds of
stories that I want to tell,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.460
because they make me feel
like I can do it too.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.490
How do you feel when you
hear stories like these?

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.810
Yeah, they're a lot
more empowering, right?

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.070
I'm really honored to say
that over the past year

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.130
we have accomplished so much.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.030
And it was just a dream.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.290
And I'm sharing all
of this with you

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.640
because, where might
you be in a year?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.570
What story will you
tell, and who will you

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.654
inspire with your words
and with your actions?

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.310
In the last year, we have
gone from doing events in San

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.850
Francisco, to New York, and LA.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.300
With the help of our
small but mighty team

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.320
we've raised over
$15,000 for nonprofits

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.770
doing really important
work in our communities.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.420
And most recently we launched
the Catalyst Collective,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.290
our online community and
group coaching program

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.705
for aspiring change makers.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.705
So again, where might
you be in a year?

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.060
What story will you
tell, and who might you

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.600
inspire with your words
and with your actions?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.680
Because the stories
we tell matter.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.640
What you do matters.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.200
You matter.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.480
What change do you want
to see in the world?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.370
Take fierce action with great
love, and be a catalyst, too.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.175
Thank you.

00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:50.420
