going out and buying this item we can
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.020
going out and buying this item we can
look through that list we see there's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
look through that list we see there's
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.000

local stores in our neighborhood as well
as a local library that we could go and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579
as a local library that we could go and
 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.729
as a local library that we could go and
borrow the item in this case we can also

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
borrow the item in this case we can also
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709
borrow the item in this case we can also
map those local stores to look at all of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
map those local stores to look at all of
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.150
map those local stores to look at all of
the different options if I know I'm

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
the different options if I know I'm
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740
the different options if I know I'm
going down to a neighborhood later today

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
going down to a neighborhood later today
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420

they have in this case I'm interested in
this store I can tap on that and I can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
this store I can tap on that and I can
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.529
this store I can tap on that and I can
look at see driving directions to the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
look at see driving directions to the
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.209
look at see driving directions to the
store location or I could call them to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
store location or I could call them to
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.619
store location or I could call them to
make sure that they actually have it in

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
make sure that they actually have it in
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.900
make sure that they actually have it in
stock I can also look at lists of items

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
stock I can also look at lists of items
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.000
stock I can also look at lists of items
so let's say like a shopping list as I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
so let's say like a shopping list as I
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590
so let's say like a shopping list as I
walk through the store if I know I need

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
walk through the store if I know I need
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.149
walk through the store if I know I need
to pick up a certain number of items I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
to pick up a certain number of items I
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.789
to pick up a certain number of items I
can easily cross those items off my list

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
can easily cross those items off my list
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.649
can easily cross those items off my list
as I buy them as I walk through the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
as I buy them as I walk through the
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.460
as I buy them as I walk through the
store so I got the idea for this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
store so I got the idea for this
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.140
store so I got the idea for this
application a couple years ago as I was

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
application a couple years ago as I was
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.480
application a couple years ago as I was
watching a documentary I saw an employee

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
watching a documentary I saw an employee
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.550
watching a documentary I saw an employee
in a store scan a barcode and be able to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
in a store scan a barcode and be able to
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.929
in a store scan a barcode and be able to
check the inventory that they had in the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
check the inventory that they had in the
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.520
check the inventory that they had in the
back room as well as the pricing they'd

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
back room as well as the pricing they'd
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.710
back room as well as the pricing they'd
had over the past couple years I thought

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
had over the past couple years I thought
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570
had over the past couple years I thought
to myself why couldn't people everywhere

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
to myself why couldn't people everywhere
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100
to myself why couldn't people everywhere
have that kind of functionality on their

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
have that kind of functionality on their
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.859
have that kind of functionality on their
phones as they walk through stores so to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
phones as they walk through stores so to
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.960
phones as they walk through stores so to
build this application I use several

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
build this application I use several
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.450
build this application I use several
different api's pieced together I use

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
different api's pieced together I use
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.800
different api's pieced together I use
the camera that's built into the phone

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
the camera that's built into the phone
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.510
the camera that's built into the phone
along with the zebra crossing library

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520
along with the zebra crossing library
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.980
along with the zebra crossing library
which is an open-source library written

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
which is an open-source library written
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.350
which is an open-source library written
by several people at Google I to decode

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
by several people at Google I to decode
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.719
by several people at Google I to decode
the barcodes I also used the Google Maps

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
the barcodes I also used the Google Maps
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.700

API to be able to show the local stores

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
API to be able to show the local stores
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950
API to be able to show the local stores
in a person's area and finally I used

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
in a person's area and finally I used
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.719
in a person's area and finally I used
the location manager to make sure that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
the location manager to make sure that
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.730
the location manager to make sure that
we always select local stores that are

we always select local stores that are
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.310
we always select local stores that are

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320
around the user in all using those API
 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.899
around the user in all using those API
is it only took me about two white two

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
is it only took me about two white two
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.420
