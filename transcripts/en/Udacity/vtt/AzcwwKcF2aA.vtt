00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.180
In order to complete this first
challenge, I must first import

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.180
the classes I use to execute my
CRUD operations from lesson one.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.450
I will import Base, Restaurant, and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.790
MenuItem from my database_setup
file as well as create_engine and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.560
sessionmaker from my sqlalchemy,
and sqlalchemy.orm libraries.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.630
Along with my imports,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.920
I must also add these four lines
of code to connect to my database.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.070
Once again just copying
code written in lesson one.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.145
Now, I will add another if statement to
my do get method, such that landing on

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:33.660
/restaurants lists out all of
the restaurants in my database.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.250
Let's look at this new if statement.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.417
Where I once looked for/hello, or

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:41.290
/hola, I am not looking for
the /restaurants path.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.840
I then execute a query to get all
of the restaurants in the database.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.720
My response codes are the same as with
my previous do_GET if statements.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.840
But here, I execute a for-loop, and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.650
add all of the restaurant menu
items to my output string.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.590
Separate it with break lines, and
enclosed in my HTML and body tags.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.990
I write the output to my wfile,
and send it off to the client.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.340
When I save my code, and restart my
web server, I get an output like this.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.240
When I visit local host
port 8080/restaurants,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.720
it lists out all
the restaurants in my data base.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.350
Objective one, complete.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.220
See the instructor notes if you'd like
to see my code for objective one.
