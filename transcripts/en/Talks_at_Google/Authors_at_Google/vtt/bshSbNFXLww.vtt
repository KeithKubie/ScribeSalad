[ELECTRONIC MUSIC]

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.244
SPEAKER: I give
you Steven Kotler.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:11.613
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:12.654
STEVEN KOTLER: Thank you.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:17.830
Hi, everyone.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.550
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.980
Thank you, guys,
for inviting me.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.271
It's good to be back at Google.

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:27.010
I think it's been four or five
years since I've been here.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.100
As [INAUDIBLE] said,
I am an author.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.992
I am a journalist.

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:31.950
And I'm the Co-Founder
and Director of Research

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.660
at the Flow Genome Project.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.550
And what we study at
the Flow Genome Project

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.410
is ultimate human
performance-- or what

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.152
does it take to be your
best when it matters most?

00:00:40.152 --> 00:00:41.610
And what we're
really interested in

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.950
is what does it take for
individuals, organizations,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.750
sometimes institutions
to sort of level

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.820
up their game like never before?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.830
What does it take to
achieve paradigm shifting

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.413
breakthroughs, "nothing is ever
the same again" breakthroughs?

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:54.972
And kind of in a phrase, the
heart of the work that I do,

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:56.430
is really the
question of what does

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.370
it take to do the impossible
and at a serious level,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.590
if you can sort of get
past the hyperbole built

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.430
into that question.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.870
We are in the middle--

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.180
oh, it works-- we
are in the middle

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.370
of a giant revolution in our
ability to do the impossible.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.320
And it's a strange revolution.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.290
It is extremely
counter-intuitive.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.020
It's overturning a lot
of conventional wisdom

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.670
about high performance.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.250
And it's going to be the subject
of what I talk about today.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.800
And it's sort of
this revolution is

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.590
sitting at the intersection of
two smaller revolutions and two

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.850
overlapping ones.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.031
One is a revolution
in peak performance,

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:36.780
that if you've seen
my other Google Talks,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.620
I talked about then.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.390
We're going to cover a little
bit of the same ground.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.556
And the other is a revolution
in what you could call

00:01:41.556 --> 00:01:42.942
the science of spirituality.

00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:44.400
And I'm using the
term spirituality

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.610
in the most secular possible
definition of the term.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.560
And these two things
are colliding.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.020
And the collision is
all really, really

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.410
overturning almost everything
we knew about human performance.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.990
And as a way of
introducing this topic,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.750
I thought I'd start
where I started.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.101
I came to the
question of how do you

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.350
accomplish the impossible
through a really weird door.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.165
I walked in through
the door of journalism.

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.520
I become a journalist
in the early 1990s.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.790
And back then, action sports--
surfing, skiing, rock climbing,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.940
and whatever-- were
getting a lot of attention.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.180
And the X Games were
starting, the Gravity Games.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.490
And there was a lot of work.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.000
If you could write and ski,
and write and rock climb,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.730
or write and surf there
was a lot of work.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.070
And I couldn't do any of
those things very well,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.480
but I needed the work.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.920
So I lied to my editors.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
And I was lucky enough
to spend about 10 years

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.440
chasing professional
athletes around mountains

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.970
and across oceans.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.090
And I will tell you, if you're
not a professional athlete,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.550
and you spend all your time
chasing professional athletes

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.410
around mountains and
across oceans, you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.610
tend to break things.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.250
I broke a lot of
things, as you can see.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.220
And what this meant is I ended
up taking a lot of time off.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.095
So I'd be hanging out,
I'd snap this or that,

00:02:52.095 --> 00:02:54.261
and I'd have to take three
months, four months, five

00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:54.960
months off.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.080
And when I came back,
the progress I saw

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.560
was really amazing.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.170
It was leaps-and-bounds
kind of stuff.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.211
It didn't make any sense.

00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:04.440
Stuff that was absolutely
impossible, never

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.270
been done, never
going to be done

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.850
just three or four months
ago wasn't just being done,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.740
it was being iterated upon.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.070
And this caught my attention
for a lot of reasons, not just

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.970
the obvious.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.560
If you go back to
the early 1990s,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.220
action adventure sport athletes
were a rowdy, punk rock,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.164
irreverent bunch of
people without a lot

00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:23.080
of natural advantages.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.170
So most of the people I
knew in this community,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.670
they didn't have a
lot of education.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.680
They had very little money.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.370
And most of them had horrific
childhood experiences.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.540
And yet here they were on a
semi-regular basis reinventing

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.160
what was possible
for our species,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.710
right-- expanding the limits
of physical possibility.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.410
And I wanted to know how
the hell was this possible.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.780
But I had also broken about
80 bones at that point,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.700
and I knew-- wait,
wait, one example.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.150
Sorry, we'll come back to that.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.410
One example, I always
forget to give this.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.660
So I want to give you
one example of what

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.951
I was looking at if you
haven't read "Rise of Superman"

00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:55.076
or aren't familiar with it.

00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:57.450
And if you saw my earlier
talk, and I'm repeating myself,

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.140
I apologize.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.990
We're going to burn through this
stuff and get to the new stuff.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.210
Surfing, 1,000-year-old sport--

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.480
480 to 1996 progress
is really slow.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.940
25 feet is the biggest
wave anybody can surf--

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.380
above that, totally impossible.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.838
There are physics papers written
about how you can't paddle

00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:14.540
into a wave above 25 feet.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.980
As you can see from this
slide, today, surfers

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.360
are routinely
paddling into waves

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.510
that are almost 100
feet tall in 20 years.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.880
And this was happening
all over action sports.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.380
So of course, I did want to
know what the hell was going on.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.560
And I also knew that if I
didn't take my question out

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.226
of action sports and
into other domains,

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:31.570
I was going to kill myself.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.090
And so that's what I did.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.530
And that's what I did in kind of
all the next eight of my books.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.360
For example in
"Tomorrowland," that

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.920
was about those
maverick innovators

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.680
who took science fiction
ideas and turned them

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.570
into science fact technology.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.260
"Bold" was wild business
entrepreneurs, your own Larry

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.110
Page, Jeff Bezos,
Richard Branson--

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.220
folks like that, Elon Musk,
who invented incredibly world

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.870
changing businesses in near
record time against crazy odds

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.740
in abundance.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.680
I teamed up with Peter Diamandis
who co-founded the XPRIZE

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.180
and Singularity University.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.080
And we looked at
innovators tackling

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.020
impossible global challenges--
poverty, water scarcity, energy

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.660
scarcity, and making dents here.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.550
And what we discovered--
what I discovered

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.370
after all this-- is it doesn't
actually matter where you look.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.470
It doesn't matter what
domain you look in.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.260
Wherever you see
people performing

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.110
at their best, whenever you see
people tackling the impossible,

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.719
you see a state of consciousness
known to researchers as flow.

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.260
And you may know flow by lots
of other names-- runner's high,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.620
being in the zone, the forever
box if you're a stand-up comic.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.160
If you played basketball,
it's being unconscious.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.771
Flow is a technical term.

00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:43.770
And it's technically
defined as an optimal state

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.200
of consciousness, one
where we feel our best

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.060
and we perform our best.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.520
And we just get so focused
on the task at hand,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.010
everything else just disappears.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.730
Action and awareness will merge.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.380
Sense of self will vanish.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.350
Time will dilate-- fancy way
of saying it passes strangely.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.017
It'll slow down.

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:00.266
You get a freeze frame effect.

00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:02.280
As soon as that it
speeds up, and five hours

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.920
go by in like five minutes.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.790
And throughout, all
aspects of performance,

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.140
mental and physical,
go through the roof.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.780
Flow science is really old.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.200
It dates back to like
the late 1870s, 1880s--

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.260
very birth of kind of what
became psychology, what

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.960
became cognitive neuroscience.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.340
A lot of this work was being
done on peak performance way

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.296
back then.

00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:29.160
It got a huge jump forward in
the 1970s and '80s when this

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.710
guy, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,
often called the godfather

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.420
of flow psychology--

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.420
he was the chairman of
the University of Chicago

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.410
psychology department--
did a giant, enormous study

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.210
on optimal psychology,
positive psychology,

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.160
went around the world
asking people what

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.868
times in their lives
they felt their best

00:06:45.868 --> 00:06:47.160
and they performed their best.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.640
And he taught us four really
fundamental things about flow

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.730
that are worth knowing.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.850
The first thing is the
state is definable.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.610
It's got core characteristics.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.020
And I named some of these
for you a second ago--

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.436
absolute concentration
in the present moment,

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:02.310
the merger of action
awareness, the vanishing

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.590
of self, time dilation.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.240
Because it is definable,
it's measurable.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.750
We have really well-established
psychometric instruments

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.641
for measuring flow.

00:07:11.641 --> 00:07:13.890
Over and over and over and
over they've been examined.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.127
They're really solid.

00:07:15.127 --> 00:07:16.710
So it's definable
and it's measurable.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.580
It's also universal.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.570
Csikszentmihalyi discovered
that we are all biologically

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.620
hardwired for flow.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.930
This is how we
perform at our best.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.290
So the state shows up
anywhere in anyone,

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.880
provided certain initial
conditions are met.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.970
He also named flow.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.482
And it's for a very
specific reason.

00:07:34.482 --> 00:07:36.690
So when he was running around
the world asking people

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.400
about the times in that
they'd perform their best,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.733
people would say the same thing.

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:43.440
They'd say, well, when I feel
this way, I'd end up in a state

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.630
where every action,
every decision,

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.320
flows seamlessly, effortlessly,
perfectly from the last.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.570
So flow is a
phenomenological description.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.980
It describes how the
state makes us feel.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.150
Interestingly, if you'll look
under that phenomenology,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.640
you see something really neat.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.200
For flow to feel floaty--

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.890
for every decision
or action to proceed

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.060
seamlessly and fluidly and
effortlessly from the last--

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.050
you are looking at high speed,
near perfect decision making.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.690
And near perfect, I
need to emphasize--

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.220
not perfect decision
making at all.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.120
That's a fallacy.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.580
Scot Schmidt, who was one
of the early extreme skiers

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.920
had a great phrase--

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.390
flow used to make me
feel like Superman up

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.860
until the moment I'm not--

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.820
key important safety tip
when it comes to this stuff.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.400
The last thing he discovered
is that flow is fundamental.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.670
It is fundamental to
well-being, to meaning,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.570
to overall life satisfaction.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.919
When we do studies of overall
life satisfaction and meaning

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.010
and well-being, people who have
the most flow in their lives

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.320
are the people who
score off the charts.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.704
And this is another extremely
well-established finding.

00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:54.120
The next question that people
kind of turn their attention

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.060
to after Csikszentmihalyi's
foundational work is OK,

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.190
this is optimal
performance, how optimal?

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.690
What the hell are
we talking about?

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.070
The answer is pretty optimal.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.950
In sports and athletics, we
now know that flow pretty much

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.380
is at the heart of any gold
medal athletic championship

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.700
that's ever been won.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.330
Significant progress in
science and technology.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.090
I said earlier I
studied paradigm shift

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:15.847
in breakthroughs.

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.180
Whenever you tend to see
paradigm shift in breakthroughs

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.400
in science and technology,
you tend to see flow.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.620
The same thing with massive
progress in the arts.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.710
In business, we have some
really compelling data.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.960
McKinsey took a look at flow
and the peak performance.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.420
And they found that
after a long study,

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.019
the top executives report
being five times more

00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:33.810
productive in flow.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.730
That's 500% more productive.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.764
All right, that means
you go to work on Monday,

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:39.180
spend Monday in a
flow state, then

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.016
take Tuesday through Friday off
and get the same amount done.

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:43.890
All right, two days a
week in flow and you're

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.310
1,000% more productive
than the competition.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.060
And I will tell you,
even though we're not

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.810
going to talk about
business today at all,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.785
I will say my organization and
a lot of other organizations,

00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:54.910
we're training up a lot of
different organizations,

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.701
including you guys.

00:09:55.701 --> 00:09:57.930
And we'll talk about the
work we did with you guys

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.470
at Google a little bit later.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.580
But what I wonder is, when
you look at those numbers

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.672
and those numbers
are pretty solid,

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:08.130
how the hell do you keep up if
you're not doing this stuff?

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.550
That's just an open question.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.320
And we're not going
to linger there.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.620
The next thing that happened
after we figured out

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.280
that flow is at the heart of
all this optimal performance

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.220
is there's been a revolution
in neuroscience, right.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.000
Biotechnology right now is
moving at five times the speed

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.170
of Moore's Law.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.720
And this is doubling the power
roughly every four months,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.630
and it is dragging
neuroscience along,

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.350
and it is dragging
flow science long.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.760
And this is, by the way, one
example of flow research.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.180
So this is an
experiment designed

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.120
by Stanford neuroscientist
David Eagleman

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.620
back when he was at Baylor.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.500
And I've been hoisted 150
feet into a circus net.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.570
I'm wearing a perceptual
chronometer on my wrist.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.195
And we're trying to
figure out why time

00:10:47.195 --> 00:10:48.540
passes so strangely in flow.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.560
So I've been dropped.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.320
I'm free-falling 150 feet and
trying to keep track of time.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.080
And I will tell you, we did make
some progress on that question.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.820
I'll talk about
that in a second.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.460
It also-- like 6 and 1/2
months of chiropractic work

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.770
till I could walk straight.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.830
So I want you to
know that I suffered

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.234
for this information, people.

00:11:04.234 --> 00:11:05.150
That's all I'm saying.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.790
So what we've learned in a
lot of this new neuroscience

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.910
is that our old ideas
about high performance

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.122
had things exactly backwards.

00:11:12.122 --> 00:11:13.830
The old idea, you guys
are familiar with.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.960
It's the so-called
10% brain myth.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.120
This is the idea
that any one time,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.020
we use a small portion
of our brain, say 10%.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.320
So flow, aka
ultimate performance,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.450
must be the full brain
on overdrive, right?

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.049
Turns out we had it
exactly backwards.

00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:32.590
In flow, we're not using more
of the brain, we're using less.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.380
Technical term--
transient hypofrontality,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.550
transient meaning temporary.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.260
Hypo is the opposite of hyper--

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.292
H-Y-P-O-- it means to slow down,
to shut down, to deactivate.

00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:43.000
And frontality is this
part of the brain,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.242
the prefrontal cortex.

00:11:44.242 --> 00:11:45.700
The portion of your
brain that does

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.140
a lot of your
executive functions,

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.260
higher cognitive functions,
complex logical decision

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.467
making, your sense of
morality, your sense of will,

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:54.550
long-term planning, this
is all prefrontal cortex.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.290
It burns off in flow.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.320
It's an efficiency exchange.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.070
But as a result, we see
some really cool things

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:03.920
for performance.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.730
For example, what happens
when your prefrontal cortex

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.400
turns off?

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.190
Well, that's what
happens to time.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.104
Time is actually a
calculation performed

00:12:11.104 --> 00:12:12.520
by a bunch of
different structures

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.240
all over the prefrontal cortex.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.120
And when they start
to wink out, we

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.670
can't separate past
from present and future.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.530
We're plunged into
this space people

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.050
talk about as the eternal
present, the elongated now,

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.530
the deep now.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.860
So that's why time passes
so strangely in flow--

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.270
huge impact on performance.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.080
Why?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.137
Most of our fears, stuff
we're scared about,

00:12:31.137 --> 00:12:33.220
is either horrible stuff
that happened in the past

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.416
that we'd like to avoid
happening in the present,

00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:37.540
or it's scary stuff that
might happen in the future

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.730
and we'd like to avoid
from the present.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.680
But right here, right
now, unless you're

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.810
facing moral combat,
there's not a whole hell

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.430
of a lot to be afraid of.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.030
So when we drop into flow, when
we drop into this deep now,

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.310
anxiety plummets.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.660
Stress hormones literally
leave our system.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.820
The same thing happens
to your sense of self.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.870
Self is a network effect.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.760
It's produced by a bunch
of different structures

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.843
in the prefrontal cortex,
a couple different parts

00:12:59.843 --> 00:13:02.020
of the brain talking to
each other like any network.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.760
A bunch of nodes
start collapsing,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.070
a whole network goes
down, we lose our ability

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.550
to create our sense of self.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.210
Again, huge impact
on performance--

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.120
when our self goes
away, our inner critic,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.690
that nagging, always on,
defeatist voice in your head,

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.380
goes away as well.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.550
So what do we see?

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.710
Risk taking goes
up, creativity--

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.170
because you're no longer
doubting all your neat ideas--

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.490
goes through the roof.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.340
And we experience this
as liberation of freedom.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.000
We are literally
getting out of our way.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Simultaneously, we see a
big shift in brainwaves.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.840
Normally, where we are right
now, we are all in beta.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.090
It's a fast moving brain wave.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.006
It's where we are when
we're paying attention.

00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:41.250
We're awake, alert.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.270
Flow actually takes
place on the borderline

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.280
between alpha and theta.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.660
These are much slower waves.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.070
Alpha is daydreaming mode.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.230
It's the brain going
from idea to idea

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.160
without a lot of
internal resistance.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.580
It's often the signature
brainwave for creativity,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.030
though that research
needs more work.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.397
Theta is where we
are in REM sleep.

00:14:01.397 --> 00:14:02.480
It's the hypnagogic state.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.700
So instead of moving
from thought to thought

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.950
without a lot of resistance,
there is zero resistance.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.840
The green turtle, becomes
the green sweater,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.490
because the green planet.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.420
It's the hypnagogic.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.280
Flow is on the borderline.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.800
Now, what's interesting about
this particular borderline

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.680
is when you're in
theta, you also

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.210
get another wave called gamma.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.430
It's a very fast,
sharp, spiking wave.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.010
It is the signature
of the "aha!" moment.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.080
Gamma only shows up
in the brain when

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.970
the brain is combining new ideas
together for the first time.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.370
It's what's known as binding.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.690
So it's the signature
of the "aha!" moment.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.140
Gamma and theta
are coupled waves,

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.760
which means you can only
get one with the other.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.990
So what this technically means
is from a creativity boosting

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.990
perspective, flow
puts you on the edge

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.270
of "aha!" insight at all times.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.770
If you really want
to understand how

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.300
flow helps you to
do the impossible,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.310
you need to know that
the state cocktails

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.190
five of the most potent
neurochemicals the brain can

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.320
produce.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.910
Flow appears to be the only
time we get all five at once.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.240
All of these boosts
physical performance.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.830
They speed up muscle
reaction times,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.570
increase strength,
increase dexterity,

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.921
heighten our threshold to pain.

00:15:08.921 --> 00:15:10.420
More importantly,
if you really want

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.250
to know how they
impact our ability

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.040
to tackle impossible
problems, it's

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.080
their impact on the three
sides of what I call

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.330
the high performance triangle.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.720
This is motivation,
learning, and creativity.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.700
And I'm going to sort of break
them down one at a time for you

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.950
because I think it's critical.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.300
So motivation goes
through the roof in flow.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.270
Why?

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.920
Besides being
performance-enhancing

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.680
chemicals, the five chemicals
that show up in flow

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.364
are all pleasure drugs.

00:15:37.364 --> 00:15:39.280
In fact, they're the
five most potent pleasure

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.561
drugs the brain can produce,
and flow gives you all five

00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:43.060
at once.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.020
It is a huge high.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.600
So when McKinsey finds that
top executives are 500% more

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.600
productive in flow, it's
addictive neurochemistry

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.187
that's underneath that
huge spike in creativity.

00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:57.520
But it's why psychologists
talk about flow as the source

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.590
code of intrinsic motivation.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.870
We see something
similar with creativity.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.910
So we've made a lot
of progress recently

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.320
in kind of the
neuroscience of creativity.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.220
And one of the things we always
know at a really simple level,

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.044
it's always a
recombinatory process.

00:16:11.044 --> 00:16:13.210
It's what happens when the
brain takes in some novel

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.480
information, combines it
with older ideas to create

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.340
something startlingly new.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.620
Flow and these neural
chemicals, more specifically,

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.820
surround that process.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.360
So when we're in flow, we take
in more information per second.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.115
So data acquisition goes up.

00:16:27.115 --> 00:16:29.240
We pay more attention to
that incoming information,

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.030
so salience goes up.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.660
We find faster
connections between

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.410
that incoming information
and older ideas,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.205
so pattern recognition goes up.

00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:37.780
We find farther
flung connections

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.863
between that incoming
information and older ideas,

00:16:39.863 --> 00:16:41.440
so lateral thinking goes up.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.290
And then, since
creativity also requires

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.240
you to take your
cool innovative idea

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.030
and make it public, on the
back end of the whole thing,

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.150
we see risk taking
spike in flow.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.030
So flow sort of surrounds
the creative process, which

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.060
is why in studies done by my
organization, the Flow Genome

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.560
Project, some stuff
done at Harvard,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.730
and some stuff done at
the University of Sydney,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.764
we see creativity in flow
spikes some 400% to 700%.

00:17:05.764 --> 00:17:07.180
And that sounds
like a huge spike.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.290
It's crazy.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.042
We just finished a
big creativity study.

00:17:10.042 --> 00:17:11.583
We got some interesting
data, and I'm

00:17:11.583 --> 00:17:12.791
going to talk about it later.

00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:14.680
But for now, we'll
just stop there.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.391
But that spike is
not out of line

00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:18.849
with what we see
with productivity.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.460
And nor is it out of line in
what we see with learning.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.859
Learning also has a huge impact.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.720
These neurochemicals,
quick shorthand

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.671
for how learning and
memory work in the brain.

00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:29.170
The more neurochemicals
that show up

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.360
during experience, the
better chance that experience

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.410
is going to move from short-term
holding to long-term storage.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.940
Flow is a huge
neurochemical spike.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.640
As a result, studies run
by the DOD and our friends

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.510
at advanced brain monitoring,
found that soldiers in flow

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.810
can learn 430%
faster than normal--

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.377
huge number, again.

00:17:48.377 --> 00:17:49.960
And what it suggests
is like we've all

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.950
heard about the fabled
10,000 hours to mastery--

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.230
which are not accurate, but
that's besides the point--

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.450
what the research does
show is that the flow

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.070
can cut them in half.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.340
And all of this is amazing.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.947
All of this is kind of the
foundation for the revolution

00:18:03.947 --> 00:18:04.780
in high performance.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.863
We're going to come back
to the stuff in a minute.

00:18:06.863 --> 00:18:10.430
But I want to jump, jump
towards the second half,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.900
and I want to re-tell
you the same story,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.156
a few different players,
from a different perspective.

00:18:16.156 --> 00:18:17.530
I lied to you
earlier when I said

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.600
it was going to be about
the science of spirituality.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.016
It's really going to be more
technically about the science

00:18:22.016 --> 00:18:24.020
of mystical experiences.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.640
And that science also dates
back to roughly the same person,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.050
William James.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.670
So I'm going to
retell the same story.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.730
William James was not
just interested in flow.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.520
He was interested in essentially
the entire ecstatic spectrum.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.120
These are all the
experiences, the kind

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.570
of upper range of human
experience-- flow states,

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.590
states of awe, trance
states, meditative states,

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.670
contemplative states,
psychedelic states.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.800
Back then, by the
way, flow was treated

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.060
as a mystical experience.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.020
James wrote about it.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.837
He pointed out that it has a
huge impact on performance.

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:00.670
But he thought it was
a mystical experience.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.370
That's what he thought
he was looking at.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.800
And William James was looking
at all of these experiences,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.410
sort of what's known as
the ecstatic spectrum,

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.620
and he said, wow,
you know, whatever

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.770
you feel about the context--

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.520
they may come out of
religious traditions,

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.310
they may be spiritual--

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.280
he said, that's fine.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.637
But if you get past that
and look at the data,

00:19:20.637 --> 00:19:21.970
the data shows you three things.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.440
It says that all these states,
interestingly, they all

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.370
make you feel roughly the same.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.040
And we'll come back
to that in a second.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.620
But they're phenomenologically
very similar.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.230
They all seem to
impact performance.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.410
And even though they may
be based on religions

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.140
that I, as a scientist,
don't believe in,

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.900
they have psychologically
real impacts.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.240
People on the other side
of these experiences

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.100
are definitely different.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.720
Their lives are more meaningful.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.680
They're more fulfilled.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.400
And for those reasons alone,
you have to take them seriously.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.624
Freud came along and said,
no we don't, not at all.

00:19:56.624 --> 00:19:58.540
We're not going to take
those ideas seriously.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.590
You're out of your mind.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.240
Freud agreed with Marx.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.297
He thought religion was
the opium of the masses.

00:20:04.297 --> 00:20:05.630
He wanted nothing to do with it.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.870
And more importantly,
Freud said, no, no, no.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.320
Psychology is about solving
pathological problems.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.620
We are not interested in
psychological possibilities.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.490
That's not what we do here.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.280
Flow got away with it
because in the 1950s,

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.040
Abraham Maslow, who is
also back on this list,

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.900
was studying success.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.629
And he found flow as this kind
of giant secret to success,

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.920
and everybody was doing this,
studying Albert Einstein,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.040
and Eleanor
Roosevelt, and people

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.831
like that wanting to
know how they achieved

00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:37.010
what they had achieved.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.120
And they had all found ways
to produce flow and use

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.500
it to amplify performance.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.050
But everybody in his study
group was an atheist.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.380
So mystical experiences, what
James called it, was out.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.900
And peak experiences was
the more secular term

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.980
that Maslow used.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.674
That's when the split occurred.

00:20:52.674 --> 00:20:54.340
But there was another
lineage, which was

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.590
the science of spirituality.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.730
It didn't really do much.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.690
But in the 1950s, this guy--
this is Wilder Penfield.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.480
He is one of the
great neurosurgeons

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.410
of the 20th century.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.450
He was an epilepsy expert.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.890
And back in the 1950s, he was
doing all these procedures

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.040
where he would open up
people's brain skull--

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.924
which you can do.

00:21:15.924 --> 00:21:17.590
There's not a whole
lot of nerves there.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.173
So you can do it
with local anesthetic

00:21:19.173 --> 00:21:20.140
and keep people awake.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.050
And he was stimulating different
portions of people's brains

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.110
in epileptics trying to
produce, not a seizure,

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:31.240
but an aura, which is often
a violent shift in perception

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.160
that precedes a seizure.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.320
People see colors
or smell things,

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.140
the smell of burnt
toast is really common.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.740
Anyways he was going through
people's brains trying

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.864
to produce these reactions.

00:21:39.864 --> 00:21:42.610
Once he found a spot,
he would scoop it out.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.500
And that was brain
surgery for epilepsy.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.310
But when he started stimulating
people's right temporal lobe

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.200
and the temporoparietal
junction, where

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.500
those lobes come together,
weird stuff started to happen.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.000
People had out-of-body
experiences.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.250
People heard visions.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.790
They had hallucinations.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.190
They had sense
presence, which is

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.200
the feeling of a god
or a ghost or a demon

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.340
in the room with them.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.130
And for the first time, somebody
went, hey, wait a minute,

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.350
there's biology
underneath our mythology.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.320
Whatever else is going
on, there's biology there.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.920
Now real science, of course,
doesn't study this stuff.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.000
And they didn't until
this man, Andy Newberg

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.100
came along in the late 1990s.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.710
And Andy is an
incredibly brave man

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:27.160
who risked his career to ask
a really interesting question.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.172
Andy was really interested
in consciousness.

00:22:29.172 --> 00:22:30.880
He was at the University
of Pennsylvania,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.370
and he felt that if you were
interested in consciousness,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.920
you absolutely had to account
for the phenomenon known

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.844
as unity, or cosmic unity,
becoming one with everything.

00:22:39.844 --> 00:22:41.260
And the reason you
have to account

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.300
for it is oneness
with everything

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.180
shows up in every single
mystical tradition on earth.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.980
It's in every religion on earth.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.930
And it's there long before
there was mass communication.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.170
So if it's everywhere
and it's there

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.790
before there was
mass communication,

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.762
there is probably
biology underneath it

00:22:56.762 --> 00:22:58.720
because it doesn't seem
like the whole world is

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.610
having a mass hallucination.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.075
It doesn't make sense, right?

00:23:02.075 --> 00:23:03.700
So there's probably
some biology there.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.490
He wanted to know what is the
biology, and he took a look.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.370
So he took a bunch of
Tibetan Buddhists and a bunch

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.500
of Franciscan nuns,
who both experience

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.050
absolute unity through
their meditation practices.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.290
For the nuns it's unia mystica,
oneness with Jesus is love.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.500
For the Tibetan Buddhists it's
absolute unitary being oneness

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.060
with the universe.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.020
And what he discovered is more
hypofrontality, but not quite.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.050
What he discovered is this
portion of the brain down

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.780
here-- it's known as
the orientation area--

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.280
gets very, very quiet.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.580
It's another efficiency
exchange in the same way

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.970
the pre-frontal
cortex turns off.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.345
And this portion of the brain
is the right parietal lobe.

00:23:39.345 --> 00:23:41.410
It's right at the
temporoparietal junction,

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:45.730
at the same spot Wilder Penfield
noticed all this activity.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:48.730
And what Newberg discovered is--

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.810
this portion of the
brain, by the way,

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.050
he calls it the orientation
area because it helps us

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.370
orientate ourselves in space.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.160
What it does is
it basically draws

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.420
a boundary around the body
and says at this point,

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.810
this is where you end and
the rest of the world begins.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.184
And you need this
boundary so you

00:24:03.184 --> 00:24:05.860
can walk across a crowded room
without bumping into people.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.295
Or people who have a stroke
or brain damage to this area,

00:24:08.295 --> 00:24:10.420
they can't sit down on a
couch, because they're not

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.690
quite sure where their leg
ends and the couch begins.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.450
During intense
concentration in meditation,

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.680
when the brain needs
extra energy for focus,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.650
it takes it away from this area.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:22.330
This area shuts down--

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.880
no energy in, no energy out.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.850
As a result, because you
can no longer separate self

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.010
from other-- the
brain has to conclude

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.550
at this particular moment
you're one with everything.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.030
So this is where the
stories come back together.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.010
Newberg did this research
in the early 2000s.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.240
I was, at that point,
studying surfers

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.230
who were doing amazing things.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.780
And they kept
coming to me saying,

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.029
hey, man, when I'm out there,
when I'm surfing a tube,

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:51.160
I am one with the ocean.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.520
And it kept happening.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.439
And I was a surfer.

00:24:53.439 --> 00:24:55.480
And I knew what they were
talking about because I

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.800
had had that experience.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.720
And I just wrote
it off and never

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.400
talked about it out
loud because what

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.380
could be flakier than a
surfer running around talking

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.730
about being one with the ocean.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.990
It's terrible, and yet it
was all over the place,

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.920
everywhere in surfing.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.350
And I looked unto Dr.
Newberg and I said,

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.446
Andy, is it possible we're
looking at the same thing?

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:15.820
Could the oneness
with everything

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.220
the surfers are looking at be
the oneness with everything

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.261
the Buddhists are looking at.

00:25:20.261 --> 00:25:22.510
And we did some work on it
and thought about it a lot.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.940
And the answer is
yes, of course,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.110
the amount of concentration
you need to ride a wave

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.750
is the same amount
of concentration you

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.820
need for prayer and meditation.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.050
Now, it seems so obvious.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.110
Back then it was a
big step forward.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.360
It was also the first
of a bunch of step

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.580
forwards along similar lines.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.880
So over the past 20
years, neurotheology--

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.800
since Dr. Newberg
discovered oneness

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.600
with everything-- we
have looked at pretty

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.430
much every altered state
you can possibly imagine

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.390
and every so-called mystical
state you can possibly imagine,

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:55.200
prayer states, contemplative
states, states of awe,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.810
trance states, psychedelic
states, et cetera, et cetera.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.940
And what we discovered
is that William James

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.870
was totally right.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.110
I mean he was so ahead of
his time, it was crazy.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:07.500
From a neurological perspective,
from a phenomenological

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.040
perspective, all these states--
and these are some weird

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:10.680
states--

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.800
so what you're saying is
a surfer in flow riding

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.160
a wave is experiencing the
same thing as a Zen Buddhist

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.740
meditating in a
monastery, is experiencing

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.300
the same thing as somebody at
Burning Man on a psychedelic.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.040
That's pretty odd.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.110
But that is exactly,
it turns out,

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.080
what we seem to be discovering.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.230
The neurobiological of this
entire ecstatic spectrum,

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.070
we see the same three things.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.080
We see the prefrontal
cortex de-activate.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.930
And then, if the state
is really intense,

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.960
we see activation
and deactivation

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.610
at the temporoparietal junction.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.280
We see brainwaves drop down
to the alpha-theta borderline,

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:53.010
and we see some combination of
these big five neurochemicals.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.980
We also see a lot of
phenomenological overlap.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.054
All of these states--

00:26:57.054 --> 00:26:58.470
it doesn't matter
if we're talking

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.850
meditative states,
states of awe,

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.400
psychedelic states,
flow states--

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.930
selfless is consistent
in all of them.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.260
By the way to get at this list--

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.770
I should back up.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.590
I wrote Stealing Fire
which is the book

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.140
that I'm talking about with my
partner Jamie Weil in the Flow

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.130
Genome Project.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.296
And one of the bits of research
that we did is everybody

00:27:17.296 --> 00:27:19.170
and their mother, from
William James forward,

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.080
has a way of defining
altered states

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.024
and measuring altered states and
thinking about altered states.

00:27:25.024 --> 00:27:26.565
The problem with
most of them is they

00:27:26.565 --> 00:27:28.180
are very context dependent.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.780
So when Buddhists talk
about what they experience

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.490
in meditation or
in trance, you get

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.347
very Buddhist interpretations.

00:27:34.347 --> 00:27:36.180
And the same thing with
Christians and blah,

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.787
blah, blah.

00:27:36.787 --> 00:27:39.120
If you go back to the '60s,
and even if you were dealing

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.760
with '60s psychologists,
there was all kinds

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.320
of rebirthing stuff coming up.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.360
So you have versions of
altered state spectrums

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.970
that have neonatal
this and that.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.820
We wanted something that
was context independent.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.310
We're just interested in
how it makes you feel,

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.330
how it shifts feelings,
and that's it.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.270
And this is what
we've come up with.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.190
It has not completely validated.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.690
We've run it by
tons of researchers.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.440
A lot of people find
it very, very useful.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.524
It has not been validated.

00:28:03.524 --> 00:28:05.064
There may be something
we're missing.

00:28:05.064 --> 00:28:06.630
But we're certain
about this stuff--

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.838
selflessness because the
prefrontal cortex turns off,

00:28:08.838 --> 00:28:11.460
timelessness because the
prefrontal cortex turns off.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.060
Effortlessness is this feeling
in mystical experiences.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.240
We talk about this as being
propelled by gods or ghosts

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.070
or forces beyond our control.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.190
And in flow we talk about
this as effortless effort.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.410
And what it really is
is it's five of the most

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.000
addictive
neurochemicals the brain

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.830
can produce showing
up in your system

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.140
and making things feel
amazing, and you obviously

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.010
want more of it.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.770
And the richness refers
to information richness.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.676
And the idea is quite simple.

00:28:36.676 --> 00:28:38.550
In the same way that
creativity is amplified,

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.561
it's amplified in
all these states

00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:42.810
because all these states
surround the creative process

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.900
and amplify, and we get
lots and lots of data.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.540
And we are seeing--

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.090
this is where the revolutions
come together-- we're actually

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.800
seeing both sides of the coin.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.640
So Freud said psychology has
to be about curing the sick,

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.410
and that's what we're seeing.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.830
And we're seeing-- because these
states are very, very similar,

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.600
because they're
neurobiologically similar,

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.880
they're similar in impact.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.430
So I want to talk about what
we're seeing in PTSD research.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.839
So I said earlier that flow
can be useful treating anxiety

00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:13.380
because it resets
the nervous system.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.100
PTSD is the most extreme
anxiety disorder we have.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.010
And we suck at
treating it generally--

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.040
SSRIs the only kind of
known treatment for PTSD.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.970
25 million Americans,
by the way,

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.000
are suffering PTSD
at any one time.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.890
So it's an epidemic.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.050
And all we've got
for them is SSRIs

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.400
which A, you have to take
for the rest of your life, B,

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.980
they don't work on everyone.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.365
There's a ton of
treatment-resistant depression

00:29:37.365 --> 00:29:38.760
in PTSD.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.260
They rarely work in women.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.100
They're not great drugs.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.369
So about 10 years
ago, Rick Doblin

00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:47.910
and the Multidisciplinary
Association

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.160
for Psychedelic
RESEARCH said hey,

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.290
let's try psychedelic therapy.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.820
And psychedelic therapy combines
a psychedelic and talk therapy.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.110
It blends it together.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.140
And they tried MDMA therapy
on soldiers returning

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.830
from Afghanistan and Iraq with
PTSD, victims of child abuse,

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.360
and victims of sexual abuse.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.780
And what they discovered
is one to three sessions

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.350
of MDMA therapy, so using the
same psychedelic MDMA that's

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:18.780
inside of Ecstasy or Molly was
enough to significantly reduce

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.290
or completely cure PTSD.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.870
It's been six years since
those studies have been run,

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:28.095
and we know that
it's persistent.

00:30:28.095 --> 00:30:29.270
It stays gone.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.070
Nobody has had to go back
for further treatments.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.760
So exciting is this to the FDA
that they fast tracked MDMA

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.520
as a treatment for PTSD.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.470
It's already in phase
3 trials, and we're

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.530
going to see it as
a medicine by 2020.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:45.630
In fact, the FDA
was so impressed

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.180
with MDMA and its
ability to treat PTSD

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.100
that they're now looking
at it as a treatment

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.260
for regular depression
and anxiety.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.140
So that is moving forward.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.210
Not everybody wants
to do a psychedelic

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.070
to deal with their PTSD.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.480
OK, said the DOD.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.540
At Camp Pendleton, they
reran the exact same study.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.550
This time they swapped
out the psychedelic.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.510
They put in flow.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.255
They used surfing
and talk therapy.

00:31:08.255 --> 00:31:11.250
They put over 1,000 soldiers
through this protocol,

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.720
and what did they discover?

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.300
Because the neurobiology
is very similar,

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.610
five weeks of surfing
and talk therapy

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.030
was enough to significantly
reduce or completely cure

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.980
PTSD in returning soldiers.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.990
Then the DOD said,
OK, that's cool.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.210
Let's try it again
with meditation.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:27.930
They did.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.630
Four weeks of mantra-based
meditation, 20 minutes a day

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.420
was enough to
significantly reduce PTSD.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.920
And when I say
significantly reduce,

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.500
I mean they're off their
meds, or significantly

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.940
off their meds, or
it's completely gone.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.519
So three different approaches,
three different altered states

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:45.810
that you would not normally
associate with one another,

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.790
yet very similar impacts.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.170
And we see this on the
curing side of the equation.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.330
We also see it on the
high performance side.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.640
We talked earlier about
flow's impact on creativity.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.460
Well, there's some
really cool research

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.030
that was done in
the Netherlands,

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.140
for example, where they
were looking at open senses

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.730
meditation.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.595
This is where you're
taking in information,

00:32:07.595 --> 00:32:09.610
and you're not judging
it too harshly,

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.940
but it's not
mantra-focused meditation.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.100
Open senses meditation
tends to be very, very good

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.120
for divergent thinking.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.040
Focus meditation is good
for convergent turns out.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.860
But they're seeing
in the studies

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.630
they run, three 45-minute
open monitoring meditation

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.920
sessions enough to significantly
increase fluency, flexibility,

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.810
originality, and
elaboration, which

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:35.010
are four key characteristics
of creativity.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.250
And micro-dosing, which
are sub-perceptual doses

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.600
of psychedelics--

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.450
so you're taking small,
small doses of psychedelics.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.850
Micro-dosing, James Fadiman's
research has found on average,

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.530
you're getting a 200%
boost in creativity.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.020
The original micro-dosing
creativity study

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.472
was done here in Silicon Valley.

00:32:56.472 --> 00:32:57.680
It was done back in the '60s.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.960
It was the last legal study
done before they shut down

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.890
LSD research.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.810
Literally, they shut
it down the next day.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.940
But they took a bunch of
people from the Valley

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.652
and they said,
OK, all you guys--

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:10.110
it was people who were selected
because they'd spent months

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.840
trying to solve a hard
technical creative challenge--

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.840
and they gave them micro-dose,
sub-perceptual doses

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.830
of a hallucinogen.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.600
This is a list of
some of the stuff that

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.270
came out the other side
that was incredibly useful--

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.030
improvement to a magnetic
tape recorder, math theorem

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.820
regarding NOR gates, new
model of a photon, space

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.830
probe to measure solar
properties, new building

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.350
design, on and on--

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.842
so huge practical
boost in creativity.

00:33:33.842 --> 00:33:35.050
We are seeing the same thing.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.230
In fact, you saw
earlier on that list

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.720
technologically mediated states.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.060
Really crazy study done at
the University of Australia

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.590
on creativity and flow.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.440
They took a bunch of
people and they gave them

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.982
the 9-dot problem to solve.

00:33:47.982 --> 00:33:48.690
You've seen this.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.060
Connect 9 dots with
4 lines in 10 minutes

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.640
without lifting your
pencil from a paper.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.480
Under normal conditions, less
than 5% of people can solve it.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.340
In their study
group, nobody did.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.850
Then they use transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.470
They artificially knocked
out the prefrontal cortex

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.690
by sending a weak
magnetic pulse, so it's

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.120
artificially-induced
transient hypo frontality,

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.030
artificially produces 20-
to 40-minute flow state.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.510
50% of their study group solved
that problem in record time.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.440
So we're seeing on all these
wildly different states

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.199
same impact on both
sides of the spectrum.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.600
They have the potential
to really treat

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.739
intractable conditions.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:28.710
And they have the potential to
massively improve performance.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.747
This by the way, just
in case you're curious,

00:34:31.747 --> 00:34:33.330
the one thing I
haven't talked about--

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.190
we talked about neural
anatomy, neurochemistry,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.199
and neural electricity, which
are three of the things you

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:39.360
need to talk about to
talk about brain stuff--

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.100
we did not talk about networks.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.110
But just so you have
some idea of where

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:46.739
that heightened creativity is
when you're on psychedelics.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:49.659
This is work done by
Robin Carhart-Harris.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.290
He's at Imperial College
doing really great imaging

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.790
studies on psychedelics.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:56.610
We have teamed up with them
to do the very first flow

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.640
and psychedelic side by side
comparative contrast altered

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.790
states study that we're going
to be launching, I think,

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.130
the first week of
June, so coming up.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.980
But anyways, on
the left side, this

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.030
is your brain connectivity
under normal conditions.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.780
On the right side,
that is what your brain

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.670
looks like in psilocybin.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.360
It is the most
network connectivity

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.070
we see in the brain.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.850
That is why creativity is
going through the roof.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.359
This is also why
we're now seeing--

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:26.900
this in the cover
of "The Economist,"

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.050
and it still makes my brain
explode to look at it.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:32.900
"Tune On, Turn On, and
Drop by the Office."

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.970
It is about
micro-dosing at work,

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.010
and it's the cover
of "The Economist."

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:41.560
So yeah, this stuff is really
starting to go mainstream.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.260
And the best news of all
is that this consciousness

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.540
is incredibly, incredibly,
incredibly hackable.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.960
And you don't actually have to
take a psychedelic substance.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.349
So on the flow side--

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:53.140
we talked a little bit
about psychedelics--

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.690
I want to jump back to flow.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.210
One of the things that we've
discovered very, very recently

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.050
is that flow states
have triggers.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:02.810
These are preconditions
that lead to more flow.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.710
So if you're interested in kind
of hacking your consciousness

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:10.120
with this stuff, these 20
triggers are your toolkit.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.470
And we have individual triggers.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.450
There are 10 or 11
of these that will

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:14.967
drive an individual into flow.

00:36:14.967 --> 00:36:16.300
And then we have group triggers.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.280
This is the product of
Keith Sawyer's research.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.290
He's at the University
of North Carolina.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:21.820
And there are 10 group triggers.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.760
And group triggers will
drive a team into flow,

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.530
produce a collective, shared
flow state known as group flow.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.280
You've taken part in
a great brainstorming

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.720
session where the ideas
are flying off the wall.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.980
That's group flow in action.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.646
If you've seen a
fourth quarter comeback

00:36:35.646 --> 00:36:38.095
in football or basketball,
that's group flow in action.

00:36:40.942 --> 00:36:43.070
We can talk a little bit
more about these triggers

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:43.570
in a second.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.000
But the one thing I want to
tell you just so you know

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.350
is flow follows focus.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.000
It only shows up when all our
attention is on the right here,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.631
right now.

00:36:50.631 --> 00:36:51.880
That's what these triggers do.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.730
They drive our attention
into the present moment.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.490
More specifically, not all
of them, but most of them,

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.760
tend to drive norepinephrine
and dopamine, which

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.750
are our main focusing
chemicals, that's really

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:04.190
what's going on under the hood.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:07.420
Now I don't want to
leave you hanging.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.460
I want to give you
some practical advice.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.859
So I said we just did a giant
study on creativity and flow.

00:37:13.859 --> 00:37:14.650
It was interesting.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.270
About 2,100 people took part.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.440
And what we were looking
at is, among other things,

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.870
what triggers are
most associated

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.850
with heightened creativity.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:27.160
First we wanted to look at
the big numbers that created

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.290
this 400% to 700% spike.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.165
We were like, what
the hell is that?

00:37:32.165 --> 00:37:33.415
What do we mean by creativity?

00:37:33.415 --> 00:37:35.470
So we broke creativity down.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.150
We looked at the process
portions of creativity.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.030
And so we found that idea
generation, for example,

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.010
goes up 40%.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.660
Problem solving goes up 40%.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.300
And so you start to see
where those big numbers come

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.860
from because these things
start to stack on one another.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.810
We also found three triggers are
most associated with creativity

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:55.809
across the board in
knowledge workers,

00:37:55.809 --> 00:37:57.850
so what everybody in this
room does for a living.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:00.140
The first is obvious--
complete concentration.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.300
Flow follows focus.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.610
It only shows up when we're
in the right here, right now.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.940
But what that means, by
the way, is the research

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.920
shows is us that you
need 90 to 120 minutes

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.010
of interrupted concentration
to really maximize flow.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.800
So that means you need 90 to
120 minutes where your office

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.190
door can be shut, where
your phone is off,

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.630
where email is off,
where Facebook is off,

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.860
where Twitter is off.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.639
It means if you're
running a team,

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:24.430
right, and you're
telling your team members

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.810
that they have to email
you back in a half an hour,

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.220
you're literally locking that
team out of the very state

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.140
of consciousness they need
to maximize performance,

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:33.640
for example.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.560
It's why when I go
into organizations,

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.080
I always tend to say,
if you can't hang a door

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.770
sign on your door that
says, beep off, I'm flowing,

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.726
you're sunk.

00:38:43.726 --> 00:38:45.100
Next thing we see
with creativity

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.560
is it requires the challenge
skills balance, often called

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.680
the Golden Rule of flow, most
important of flows triggers.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.080
The idea is that we pay the
most attention to the right

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.970
here, right now
task at hand when

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.620
the challenge of
the task at hand

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.080
slightly exceeds our skill set.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.580
So you want to
stretch but not snap.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.440
Emotionally, this
means flow sits

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.590
not on but near the
midpoint between boredom--

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.530
not enough stimulation,
I could give a shit--

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.970
and anxiety, whoa, way
too much stimulation.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:13.510
In between is this sweet spot.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.290
Finally, immediate feedback--
this should come as no surprise

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.310
here at Google.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.800
But you know, this is one
of the reasons why we saw

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.496
so much flow in action sports.

00:39:22.496 --> 00:39:24.370
In action sports you
have immediate feedback.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.129
You're a skier, you
don't set that edge

00:39:26.129 --> 00:39:28.420
at the top of the run, and
you're on a face first death

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.350
slide to the bottom.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:30.790
It's really obvious.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.100
Same thing happens in
software, of course.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.010
Agile software, the
entire agile movement,

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.150
was about tightening
up feedback loops.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:42.490
And one of the reasons is
maximizes creative flow.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.500
So obviously, in
business, for example,

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.617
if you've got quarterly
reports or annual reports

00:39:47.617 --> 00:39:49.450
and that's the only
feedback you're getting,

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:53.044
it's a disaster for this stuff.

00:39:53.044 --> 00:39:55.210
The last thing I want to
tell you about the triggers

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:59.350
is they're remarkably
easy to train.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.020
And if you would have come to
me five years ago-- in fact,

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.450
the last time I spoke
here, maybe two times ago,

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.240
and said what do you believe
about flow, what would you

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.170
bet your house on.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.690
I would have bet my house
that this stuff is massively

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:14.010
hard to train, absolutely.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.360
It turns out we were
deadly wrong about that.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.330
The example is two
or three years ago,

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.030
thanks to Adam Leonard,
we teamed up with you guys

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.730
and ran a six-week
joint learning exercise.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.120
And over a course of six weeks,
we took about 70 Googlers from

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.190
all over the company--
so facilities,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.800
and sales and marketing,
and coding, and engineering,

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.790
take your pick--

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.670
and we trained people
up, about an hour's worth

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.130
of homework a day, in for
high performance basics.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.972
I mean basics like
sleep hygiene--

00:40:42.972 --> 00:40:44.430
get enough sleep
at night, and then

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.130
put yourself on a sleep
monitor to take care of it.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.820
And the use of really what
amounted to four flow triggers.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.670
And on the back end of that--
we tested flow pre and post--

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:59.580
we found a 35% to 80%
increase in flow here.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.520
Now, it's a little high
because people self-selected

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.530
to be in that class.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.280
They were already
interested in the topic,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.230
so those numbers are
probably a little skewed.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.605
But I will tell you, we have
a digitally delivered course

00:41:09.605 --> 00:41:11.340
called Flow Fundamentals.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.824
And it's the same thing,
same similar structure.

00:41:13.824 --> 00:41:15.990
We were a little more intense
with what we did here.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.670
But again, we
measure pre and post.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.870
And on average some
thousands of people

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.390
have taken this
course by now, we're

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.150
seeing a 70% increase in
each of flow's metrics.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.150
And this doesn't mean our
Kung Fu is exceptionally bad

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.770
ass, which is.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.500
What it really means is that
this stuff is really easy.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.680
We're all biologically
hardwired for it,

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.177
which is really, really cool.

00:41:36.177 --> 00:41:37.260
And we're getting options.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.134
This is the transcranial
magnetic stimulation

00:41:39.134 --> 00:41:40.590
I talked about.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:43.440
Because pattern recognition
is so heightened in flow,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.750
radar operators-- this is
a radar operator in the US

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.510
military-- are using it
before they go on shift.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.000
Stockbroker's, because you
can see so much more patterns

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.070
in Wall Street, are
doing this before they're

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.870
going onto the trading floor.

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.930
We're seeing similar
things in EEG development.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.940
Back in the 1990s,
at the same time

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.304
Andy Newberg was doing
his really brave work,

00:42:02.304 --> 00:42:03.720
another guy named
Richard Davidson

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.060
started recording the
brainwaves of monks,

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.920
Tibetan Buddhists, who had
30 years of meditation time.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.870
And he discovered some
really cool things

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.244
that their brainwaves
essentially

00:42:14.244 --> 00:42:16.300
sit on the edge of
flow at all times.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.030
And that there's a
huge amount of gamma,

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.790
which you want for extra
creativity in their brainwaves.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:24.570
But who the hell has 30
years, let alone 30 hours?

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:25.689
So what do we do?

00:42:25.689 --> 00:42:27.480
Well, we recorded those
brainwaves and now,

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.750
using neurofeedback and
EEG, we are training people

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:35.760
to move in the same direction in
three weeks, three months, very

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.820
compressed time frames.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.750
In fact, if you want
more flow in your life,

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.416
the same technology
is available to you.

00:42:42.416 --> 00:42:45.010
Go to the flowgenomeproject.com.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:49.819
There is a free flow profile
there under the Learn tab.

00:42:49.819 --> 00:42:51.360
It's a diagnostic,
it's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.985
It says if you are
this kind of person,

00:42:52.985 --> 00:42:54.990
you're likely to find
flow in these directions.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.850
It's become one of the largest
studies on optimal performance

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.010
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.099
Killed another
longstanding darling,

00:43:01.099 --> 00:43:02.640
we thought when we
started this work,

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.610
flow absolutely must show up the
most in action and better sport

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.180
athletes and in sort
of performing arts,

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.580
people in bands, people on
stage, that kins of stuff.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:12.390
It turns out no.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.730
The vast majority of
our study subjects,

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.030
like 80,000 people have taken
the study at this point,

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.190
are knowledge workers.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.910
They do what everybody in
this room does for a living.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.670
The most flow tends to
show up in knowledge work.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.280
All right, to wrap
this all up, I

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.580
want to give you one sort of big
picture look at all this stuff.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:33.210
So "Stealing Fire"
origin story--

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.210
I was writing a book called
"Rise of Superman" about flow,

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.950
and I was talking to Salim
Ismail, who was at that point

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.640
the Executive Director of
Singularity University.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.050
And Salim, former director
of innovation at Yahoo,

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:48.030
really interested in
flow and innovation.

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.950
And we were talking,
and he pointed out,

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.390
he's like, you know, Steven,
if you think about it,

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.067
every time you go
to a sporting event,

00:43:54.067 --> 00:43:55.650
if you go to a
basketball game, you're

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.800
playing to see players in flow.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.532
And he said, if you
go to see a movie,

00:44:00.532 --> 00:44:01.990
you're going to
see actors in flow,

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.150
and you're hoping to
get a director who

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.010
was in flow when they shot
the movie, or a poetry reading

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:05.600
and on.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.610
He said, I'll bet it's a
large portion of the GDP.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.960
And that caught our attention,
that caught my attention.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.550
And I started thinking about it.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.510
And when we started doing the
research for stealing fire

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:18.120
and figuring out that,
hey, wait a minute,

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.690
flow, meditative
states, contemplating,

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.060
state psychedelic states,
et cetera, et cetera, all

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.110
these things are very,
very similar, we said,

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:27.600
well, let's try to measure that.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.820
Let's measure the
altered state economy.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.360
How much money do
people spend chasing

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.210
this experience of selflessness,
timelessness, effortlessness,

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.980
and richness?

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.720
And I'm not going to walk
you through the calculation.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.390
It is in the footnotes
to Stealing Fire.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:46.480
Please-- hammer on it--
run your own calculations.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.540
I spent a year working on it.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.670
I want to get as
rigorous as possible

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.707
because it's mind blowing
in what it tells us.

00:44:52.707 --> 00:44:54.540
And the first thing I
also want to point out

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.350
is not all of this
stuff is positive.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.850
When I'm talking
about selflessness,

00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:59.640
and effortlessness, and
information richness, and all

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.590
this stuff, some
people seeking it out,

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.170
they're going and doing
meditation reheats,

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.860
or developing a yoga practice,
or they're pursuing flow.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.300
And a lot of people are
just taking a lot of drugs.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.320
There's a negative downside,
dark side to all this as well,

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.550
and we measured that as well.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:17.550
But when we were done, in our
very conservative calculation,

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.850
we came up with a figure
that is $4 trillion a year.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.420
It is 1/16 of the
global economy that we

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.430
spend trying to get
out of our head,

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.840
trying to shift our
consciousness in this way.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.097
And as you can see from the
stuff I'm talking about,

00:45:31.097 --> 00:45:33.180
those numbers, because
we're getting very precise,

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.274
we're getting better
at this, we're

00:45:35.274 --> 00:45:37.690
being able to tune this in
ways like we never could before

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:40.170
and being able to get some
more of the positive benefits

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.790
and less of the
negative benefits.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:45.520
This is only going
to grow over time.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.180
And I think the last thing
I want to tell you today

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.520
is that I think all
of this information

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.340
puts kind of a wonderful,
and yet really terrible,

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.100
burden on each and
every one of us--

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.840
because you've got
to ask yourself

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.310
what kind of
impossible challenges

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:02.370
are you going to go after
If you can be 500% more

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:06.510
productive, if you could be 600%
more creative, if you could cut

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.030
your learning times in half?

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.350
The science is
pretty overwhelming

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:15.840
that that's exactly what
is available to each

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.460
and every one of you today.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.490
As Alice Walker pointed
out so many years ago,

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.920
we are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.290
But what we choose to
do with that information

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:27.425
remains entirely up to us.

00:46:27.425 --> 00:46:28.800
But thanks for
listening, and I'm

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.372
happy to take some questions.

00:46:30.372 --> 00:46:35.292
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.910
AUDIENCE: So I'm
wondering if there's

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.570
any limits in age for flow.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:43.620
And I'm asking-- I'm coaching
my 10-year-old's baseball team

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.520
and I'd like to hear
your thoughts on this.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.500
STEVEN KOTLER: That's
a great question.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.110
So as you were talking, I don't
know if there are upper limits.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.070
I really don't.

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:55.830
Age-related limits, I
realized as you were talking,

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:57.550
I was like, God, I've never
even asked that question

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:58.760
or even thought about that.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.750
So there may be upper limit
stuff that I don't know about.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.600
Kids are actually very flow
prone because developmentally

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.370
their prefrontal
cortex doesn't finish

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:09.122
developing until you're 25.

00:47:09.122 --> 00:47:11.080
That's why your nose is
the last thing to grow.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.560
It's space for your
prefrontal cortex.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.120
So they're
developmentally geared

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.680
towards transient
hypofrontality,

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.360
and their brainwaves
are actually

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.040
naturally closer to alpha.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.110
Adults are in beta.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.140
Kids tend to be closer to alpha.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.600
So kids are flow prone.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.090
In my book Rise of Superman, we
talked about the crazy places

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:32.350
it's showing up.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.110
Flow coaching has gotten
into action sports early.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.570
We saw it in
skating, for example.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:41.120
You routinely see 12- to
14-year-old kids win the X

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.030
Games, beating 25 to 35--

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.470
like professional athletes.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:49.180
And one of the reasons is
because flow coaching has been

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.730
in action sports for longer.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:53.920
In mainstream
sports, it popped in.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.400
Jimmy Johnson said the Dallas
Cowboys won the Super Bowl back

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.860
in the '90s and he
credited Csikszentmihalyi.

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.210
So flow has been in sports for
a while, but not at the level--

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:05.950
those traditional
bat and ball sports

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:08.470
are little more conservative.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:12.040
And action sports, they weren't
even sports back in the '90s,

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.450
right?

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:15.760
So there's been a lot
more flow coaching.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.200
We're seeing
interesting results.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.940
A friend of ours--
we are working

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:23.380
with a guy in Minnesota who
is doing a bunch of flow

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.550
work in grade school.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.680
And they're using
the flow profile

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.100
with kids, trying to figure
out what's their dominant flow

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.980
area, and then having them do
a lot of independent studies

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:33.620
over the years.

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:35.440
And their idea is that
if they can get them

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.930
into high school already
knowing what produces the most

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.346
flow in their life and what
they're most passionate about,

00:48:40.346 --> 00:48:42.010
they'll have a leg up.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:43.497
So we're doing
some of that work.

00:48:43.497 --> 00:48:44.330
We're looking at it.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:45.310
But there's a ways to go.

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:46.143
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:46.143 --> 00:48:48.280
STEVEN KOTLER: Sure.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.020
Great topic.

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.270
Thinking about this, I'm sold.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:54.580
I want to be in flow all the
time-- very productive, very

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.270
great, awesome.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:49:00.340
But thinking about the chemicals
that have heightened levels,

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.870
isn't there supposed
to be a crash?

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:02.597
Like I know--

00:49:02.597 --> 00:49:03.430
STEVEN KOTLER: Yeah.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.857
So yeah, let me--
let's stop there.

00:49:05.857 --> 00:49:07.690
Because if you were
going to say that nobody

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:09.444
gets to be in flow all the time.

00:49:09.444 --> 00:49:11.110
People come up to me
about once a month,

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.026
and are like, [WHISPERING]
dude, Steven, psst,

00:49:13.026 --> 00:49:14.340
I'm in flow all the time.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.890
You should study me.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:18.047
And this has been
happening for years.

00:49:18.047 --> 00:49:19.880
In the beginning, I
didn't know what to say.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.670
And now I'm just honest.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.420
I'm like, absolutely.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:24.980
You know, we have
a term for that--

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.560
we call that schizophrenia.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.300
Sometimes we call
that mania, depending.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.770
But it's an either/or.

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:30.820
Flow is a cycle.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.070
Herb Benson did a lot of the
foundational neuroscience

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.330
on this.

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:35.500
And it's a four-part cycle.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.360
And as you pointed out,
those neurochemicals

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.820
that show up in the flow
are expensive for the brain

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.470
to produce.

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:41.980
They require minerals.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.065
And some of them
require sunlight.

00:49:44.065 --> 00:49:45.940
And some of them require
vitamins, and foods,

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.000
and blah, blah, blah.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.950
So there's a recovery time.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.810
Norepinephrine and
Dopamine, for example,

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:54.850
why are Ted Talks
20 minutes long?

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:57.220
Because these are you two
principal focusing chemicals,

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.560
and they are mostly
exhausted after 20 minutes

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.890
at peak concentration.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:02.852
So if you've ever seen
a James Bond movie,

00:50:02.852 --> 00:50:04.810
everything blows up for
the first half an hour,

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.455
and then you're bored to death
for the rest of the time.

00:50:07.455 --> 00:50:08.830
It's because you've
exhausted all

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.230
you're focusing feel-good
drugs, and now you've

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:13.720
just got bad popcorn
in your stomach.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.760
I mean, literally,
like that feeling.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.400
So yes, on the
backside of flow there

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.500
is a recovery period for sure.

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:21.460
It's built in.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:26.460
So nobody gets to live in
flow as far as we can tell.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.540
There's some really
interesting work--

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:32.440
some people often
misconflated enlightenment

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.210
with permanent flow.

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.160
There's an idea out
there that enlightenment

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.720
might be permanent flow.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.570
We've actually made some
really interesting progress

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.984
on studying so-called
enlightenment.

00:50:42.984 --> 00:50:44.650
And the one thing
that we're pretty sure

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.400
is it doesn't appear
to be permanent flow.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.880
It seems that it takes
the shift in perspective

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.580
that you get from flow,
that expansive oneness

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.440
with everything that
allows you to access it

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.260
under normal conditions,
but it doesn't seem

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.520
to be a permanent flow state.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.769
I don't think that's possible.

00:50:58.769 --> 00:51:01.606
Outside a manic episode, I
don't think that's possible.

00:51:01.606 --> 00:51:02.520
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.353
STEVEN KOTLER: Sure.

00:51:03.353 --> 00:51:05.087
Thanks for asking.

00:51:05.087 --> 00:51:06.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
this fantastic talk.

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.770
So what you essentially talked
about is meditation 101.

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:14.630
A lot of the concepts
are very similar.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:19.280
There are these
gadgets these days.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.260
They call it the
brain balancing.

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.930
Apparently they can induce
you into your flow state.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.280
There are certain
devices, EEG-based,

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.160
which people with
ADHD use to train.

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.110
And that is nothing
but attention training.

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:35.480
So you look at a certain
pattern on the screen,

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.900
and you focus your
attention there

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:40.010
by trying to do
something repeatedly

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:43.260
and you slowly get into your
flow state by doing this.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:44.430
So this is well known.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:47.720
But the other kind
of devices, the claim

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.440
is that you don't
need to do anything.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.530
You don't need to
focus your attention.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:56.300
But it plays some signals,
some sounds in your ears.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.420
And apparently it's supposed
to divert your state

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.010
to what's the flow state.

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:02.840
I don't know how much it is.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.290
STEVEN KOTLER: I call bullshit.

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:05.604
AUDIENCE: It's BS, OK.

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:11.100
STEVEN KOTLER: What
I've found consistently

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.610
is there a lot of
people out there

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:17.210
who have a device that measures
one thing or does one thing,

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:19.220
and they want to call it flow.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.700
So we've got this EEG device
that drives your brainwaves

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:23.130
to the alpha-theta
borderline, and it's

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:23.980
going to put you into flow.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.730
Well no, it's going
to drive your brain

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.460
waves to the alpha-theta
borderline, OK.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.000
But flow is changes in
network structures, changes

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.410
in neural anatomical function.

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:33.910
It's changes in neurochemistry.

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:35.980
It's a bunch of
physiological reactions

00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.200
that we're just now
starting to maybe measure.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.630
And nobody's put it all together
in one physiological flow

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:43.450
detector at this point,
though we are working on one.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:46.000
But anytime I hear a single
correlate hypothesis--

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.140
it takes your brain
waves, it does this--

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.655
and calling it flow, to me,
I don't understand that.

00:52:51.655 --> 00:52:53.030
I don't understand
why people are

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:57.140
doing that when we know flow has
total shift in brain function.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.940
So that's first of all.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.080
When it comes to sound,
though I have friends Will

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.870
Henshall at Focus
Will, Brain FM,

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:06.850
there are some really
interesting groups

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:10.060
doing really good work
on sound and flow.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:13.390
My friend Kris Berkner who
runs Advanced Brain Monitoring

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.730
in Carlsbad, California,
she is the person

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:19.600
who teamed up with the DOD to
do the flow in the accelerated

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.837
learning stuff.

00:53:20.837 --> 00:53:21.670
She give a Ted Talk.

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:22.990
You can find that online.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:25.990
One of the things they did is
they looked at binaural beats.

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.680
There were 400 companies doing
sound with binaural beats.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.763
And it's supposed to put
you in flow and whatever.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:36.220
They make just about
the best EEG measurement

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.970
device in the world,
I think, and they

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:42.130
took every binaural beats
program they could find

00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:45.100
and looked for any consistent
neurological shift, found

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.580
nothing that was consistent.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:50.020
So I'm not saying that there
is this technology out there--

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.900
sooner or later, somebody is
going to crack that, right?

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:57.280
We know from Apple's work with
Sonos that the power of music

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.990
is really amazing in terms of
its ability to shift conscious.

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.400
So there's definitely
something there.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:09.952
But we're not there yet, I
don't think, nothing I've seen.

00:54:09.952 --> 00:54:11.410
There are probably
people out there

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:14.116
would breakthrough technology
that tell me I'm lying

00:54:14.116 --> 00:54:14.740
and don't know.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.900
But I haven't seen
anything that I'm

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.910
comfortable with that
I think does that yet.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:20.410
I think we're getting
closer though.

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:23.740
And I think all this stuff is
on exponential growth curves.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:27.520
So you know what seemed
absolutely ridiculous

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.080
three years ago,
you are going to get

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.337
in two years, three years.

00:54:31.337 --> 00:54:32.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.616
STEVEN KOTLER: Sure.

00:54:34.616 --> 00:54:36.240
AUDIENCE: All right,
thanks for coming.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.115
From your comments, it
sounds like you're not

00:54:38.115 --> 00:54:40.980
a big fan of open office plans.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:44.550
But open office plans are a
super big fad around here.

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:48.420
So my request to you
is please rescue us.

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.580
What can you do for us?

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:50.470
STEVEN KOTLER: Yeah.

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:53.040
It's a fair point.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.270
And you're not the only one.

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:56.310
A couple of years ago,
when Facebook decided

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:58.200
they were going to do away
with desks entirely and put

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.616
everybody on walking desks,
facing each other in a circle.

00:55:00.616 --> 00:55:03.033
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:06.650
I don't know if that's
true or not, by the way.

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:10.270
But I just heard it, and I was
like what a disaster for flow.

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:14.830
That said, open office plans can
be really good for group flow,

00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:15.820
depending.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.770
They have their purpose.

00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:21.010
The companies that I'm
seeing that are doing this

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:22.660
are building--

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:26.402
any of the co-work spaces
that you're seeing pop up,

00:55:26.402 --> 00:55:28.360
they have little phone
booth rooms that anybody

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.130
can go into and shut
the door, and it's

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:31.580
a private little office.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.570
So I'm seeing a lot of companies
that like open office plans

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:37.840
start to build in silence
pods, where you can just

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.110
close yourself in and
lock yourself off.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:45.310
And equally important is you've
got to have your conversations

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:47.680
about this.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.200
If you've got a
manager, and they're not

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.951
into this whole idea
of what you're doing.

00:55:51.951 --> 00:55:54.158
And suddenly you're going
off from 90 to 120 minutes,

00:55:54.158 --> 00:55:56.560
and you're coming back with
something like I was in flow,

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.690
you're going to be fired.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.300
So it's got to be
done loud, I think.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.700
People have to understand
why this is mandatory.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.710
But I think open office
plans, ultimately,

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:10.030
I think we're going to
start to see them go away.

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:12.520
And I think some of
this is just that we're

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.350
going to be 3D printing
office buildings,

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.390
and we get complexity for free.

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:18.670
So suddenly it's not
going to be cost efficient

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.350
to put everybody in cubicles.

00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:21.700
We're going to being able
to build whole offices,

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.637
and I think the problem's
going to get solved.

00:56:23.637 --> 00:56:25.970
I think it's a money issue
less than an open office plan

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:27.040
issue at this point.

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.280
But yeah, they are
disasters for flow.

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:38.940
AUDIENCE: So you talked
about the psychedelic drugs.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.090
But I'm curious.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:44.310
Are there studies seeing
how different drugs simulate

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.060
the flow state, like
cocaine, marijuana.

00:56:50.582 --> 00:56:52.540
STEVEN KOTLER: The
neurochemicals, the big five

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:58.090
neurochemicals, every time
you have a neurochemical--

00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:02.080
you have an endogenous
and exogenous chemical,

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.800
so the body produces endorphins.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.800
These are our natural opiates.

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:14.680
So flow is essentially
dopamine, which is cocaine.

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.960
Whenever you use
cocaine, all that happens

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.270
is the brain releases
a bunch of dopamine,

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:22.210
and it blocks its re-uptake.

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:23.680
You get a little serotonin.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:28.640
That's ecstasy at one
pathway or LSD in another.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.680
anandamide, which,
as you said, is THC.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:35.290
Norepinephrine is
essentially speed.

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:37.307
I don't know what
I'm forgetting here.

00:57:37.307 --> 00:57:38.890
But the point is you
actually couldn't

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:40.540
cocktail those drugs
on the street, which

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:41.360
is really interesting.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.400
Some of them counteract.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.010
You're going to end up dead
or in a coma if you try.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.120
What's cool is the brain can
cocktail them all naturally

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.405
and you don't tend--

00:57:52.405 --> 00:57:54.370
I mean, you know,
flow has a dark side.

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:55.850
It's a very sticky state.

00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:59.140
It's very addictive.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.972
Csikszentmihalyi said flow
is different than most

00:58:01.972 --> 00:58:02.680
other addictions.

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.840
Most other addictions
lead backwards.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.727
Flow, because you're always
extending your skills,

00:58:07.727 --> 00:58:10.060
because you're walking up
that challange skills balance,

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.020
is an addiction
that leads forward.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:15.010
But if you have a
high flow lifestyle--

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:18.760
the Navy SEALs, who we do some
work, when the Navy SEALs stop

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.070
being Navy SEALs, when an
action sport athlete stops

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:24.340
being an action sport
athlete, when a rock star

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:26.240
stops being a rock star--

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.820
These are massively difficult
transitions to handle.

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.029
And a lot of what we're
seeing, for example,

00:58:33.029 --> 00:58:35.320
in soldiers returning from
combat and things like that,

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.410
is these are such high flow
environments, that compared

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:40.750
to regular life, it's
really difficult.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.989
And that's a big portion
of the difficulty.

00:58:42.989 --> 00:58:44.530
And we're doing some
work around that

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.540
to try to see what
we can learn there.

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.875
There's a long way to go,
but we're poking at it.

00:58:50.875 --> 00:58:53.202
Anybody else?

00:58:53.202 --> 00:58:55.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, two more
questions both from the Dory.

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:59.832
The first one is about
the concept of flow hike--

00:58:59.832 --> 00:59:01.040
STEVEN KOTLER: [LAUGHING] OK.

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.320
AUDIENCE: --that was
addressed on our podcast.

00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.170
How can we translate
flow states that we

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:12.260
achieve through athletic
pursuits to everyday life?

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.016
STEVEN KOTLER: So
part of that answer--

00:59:15.016 --> 00:59:18.679
do they want me to break down
the flow hike or was that--

00:59:18.679 --> 00:59:20.720
AUDIENCE: Basically, if
I understand the question

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:28.350
correctly, how we can sort
of use the flow hike online.

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:29.100
STEVEN KOTLER: OK.

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:34.940
So there's a couple
of different answers.

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:39.470
The first answer is flow is
a focusing skill essentially.

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:42.430
Whoever said it was
like meditation 101,

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:44.220
there's a lot of
fundamentals there.

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.270
We train people in mindfulness
because flow follows focus.

00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:52.219
So you want to drive that
focus into the present tense.

00:59:52.219 --> 00:59:53.010
How did I get here?

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:54.311
What did you ask me?

00:59:54.311 --> 00:59:55.310
I totally lost my place.

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:55.976
I looked at you.

00:59:55.976 --> 00:59:57.770
I did the meditation thing.

00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:59.002
What was the question?

00:59:59.002 --> 01:00:01.210
AUDIENCE: Flow hike or flow
through athletic pursuits

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:01.918
in everyday life.

01:00:01.918 --> 01:00:05.470
STEVEN KOTLER: Flow
through athletic pursuits,

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:07.070
it tends to translate.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:11.480
so the flow training that
I get while skiing helps me

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.470
as a writer.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:14.240
It's the same kind of focus.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.600
So whenever you're training
that, you're training that--

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.820
one is the athletic pursuits
will just naturally bleed over

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.610
into your everyday life.

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.420
So in other words, the more flow
you get, the more flow you get.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.920
That's across the boards.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.310
The flow hike is not an
athletic pursuit hike.

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:32.840
It's actually a daily flow.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.060
Like you asked about
the neurobiology, right.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.070
So this is a hike
I use every day.

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:38.730
I wake up.

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:40.563
I start writing at 4
o'clock in the morning.

01:00:40.563 --> 01:00:41.990
I write from 4:00 till 8:00 AM.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.390
And at 8:00 AM, I take
my dogs for a hike.

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:48.194
And it's a hike specifically
designed to put me into flow.

01:00:48.194 --> 01:00:50.360
Meaning if my writing session
was really unpleasant,

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.830
if I was struggling
a bunch, this

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:53.710
is going to put me into
flow on the back end.

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:56.480
And so when I come back to
work, I'll feel refreshed.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.360
And [INAUDIBLE] flow state is
a good way to reset my system.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.750
But what I do is I start off
and I walk uphill very slowly

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.670
for 20 to 25 minutes.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:07.730
Low grade physical activity
for about 20 to 25 minutes

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:10.302
will produce exercise-induced
transient hypo-frontality.

01:01:10.302 --> 01:01:12.260
It's going to deactivate
the prefrontal cortex.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.100
We all know this, right?

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.000
You go to the gym.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.860
You workout for
about 20, 25 minutes.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.795
It gets quiet upstairs.

01:01:17.795 --> 01:01:19.790
I then run uphill.

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:20.850
I run up cliff faces.

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:22.940
Or you could just
sprint if you want.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.440
And I do it for
about five minutes

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.630
or until I'm in pain basically.

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:29.450
And then I sort of slow it down.

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:32.150
And you will get
endorphins and anandamide,

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:35.150
which are pain relievers
among other things.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.390
And then, I turned around
and I run back downhill,

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.850
trying to move my feet faster
than they would normally

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:42.260
move without gravity.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.960
So they are big leaps
down that mountain.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.140
Whenever you take a
risk, you get dopamine.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.590
And so by the time I'm
back down on my path

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:55.270
and I'm walking home, I've
mimicked essentially a bunch

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:56.680
of the neurobiology of flow.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.790
It's not 100%.

01:01:57.790 --> 01:01:59.750
It doesn't work all the time.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.840
But pretty much it'll put you
into a low grade flow state.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.330
And I do this between
work sessions.

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.180
And it takes about 45 minutes.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.027
And I try to do my problem
solving on the way home

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.610
because I'm in a low
grade flow state,

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:15.068
and I've got heightened learning
and creativity and pattern

01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:15.641
recognition.

01:02:15.641 --> 01:02:17.140
And so if there was
something that I

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.940
wasn't doing in my writing--

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.620
I got stuck somewhere--

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.660
that's when I try to
solve it because I

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:24.790
know I'm going to be in
a low grade flow state.

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:26.620
I think that's a
great place to end.

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.760
Thanks, guys.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.510
