00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.043
Graph D matches this new equation. Note that the vertex hasn't changed, since

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:07.941
the values of h and k haven't changed. Well if you plug in values now, since D

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:12.058
is the only other curve besides C that has this vertex, that must be the answer.

00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:15.339
You could, of course, also plug in other points to verify this.
