PRERNA GUPTA: After
selling my last startup,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.710
my husband and I traveled
around the world,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.580
and it was during our
travels that we came up

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.630
with the idea for Hooked.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.390
This is the bench
in Costa Rica where

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.020
I loved to write and
think of new ideas.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.290
Hooked is an app that tells
short stories in the form

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.659
of chat conversations.

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:22.950
SARAH ABDULLAH: I love writing.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.217
I grew up reading beautiful
literature in Arabic

00:00:26.217 --> 00:00:28.050
and I really wanted to
share that experience

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.040
with the children.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.040
And the only way to reach them
is to speak their language.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.400
I decided to create
Makooky World after years

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.080
of dreaming about it.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.380
Makooky World is an interactive
offering stories, songs,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.750
and games all in Arabic.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.670
KIM TAY NAYLOR: Koi symbolizes
perseverance, hardship,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.186
and attaining the highest
goal that you can have.

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:55.380
Zen Koi shows the journey
of a koi from a baby koi

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.750
to a dragon.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.170
Which koi are you playing with?

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.146
SPEAKER 4: I'm playing
with the yellow koi.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.410
MARIA MARTINA SANTORO:
My mother and my aunts

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.270
told me that no matter
what challenges you face,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.265
learn how to fall
so you will just

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.570
stand up again and keep trying.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.217
And I think that's
influenced the way I work.

00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:20.050
SARAH ABDULLAH: The
beginnings were not easy

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.060
because it's a completely
new medium for me,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.190
but they were worth it.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.230
I did not have any investments.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.070
That meant that I needed to
put my time, my own money,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.525
and have a very small team.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.150
MARIA MARTINA SANTORO:
When we started,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.810
we didn't have experience
in the game industry.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.630
We are people from film and
animation and comic books.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.860
We have really
different backgrounds.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.720
We learned a lot
working for others,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.240
but what we really wanted
was to make our own games,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.690
tell our own stories.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.260
And it was kind of
difficult to get support.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.180
KIM TAY NAYLOR: Creating Zen
Koi was a hard journey for us,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.110
and we decided to go ahead
with it even though we didn't

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.560
have much money to complete it.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.740
The launch of Hooked
was definitely scary.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.780
I had a lot of doubts.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.747
You know, my biggest doubt was,
am I just a one hit wonder?

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:11.580
MARIA MARTINA SANTORO:
After all these years

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.800
of struggling and
learning, it was amazing

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.690
when we finally got to work
in our own game, Realms

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.920
of the Void, a
turn-based strategy game.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.050
KIM TAY NAYLOR: With
the first 20k installs,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.770
we were really relieved
and happy that it finally

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.290
came through and that
players are playing our game.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.164
Right now, Zen Koi has a total
of nine million installs.

00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:33.330
PRERNA GUPTA: We kept going.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.570
And after a year of
iteration and testing,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.327
we translated the app in
seven different languages

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:41.910
and launched all over the world,
and Hooked was the number one

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030
app in over 25 countries.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.472
We had over 13.5 million
installs on Android.

00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:49.680
SARAH ABDULLAH: What gets
me out of bed every morning

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.920
is knowing that I'm going
to go and create something

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.379
that I wished to
create my entire life.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.920
KIM TAY NAYLOR: Zen Koi was made
possible with a little luck,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.110
lots of perseverance,
and support

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.110
from family and friends.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.984
SARAH ABDULLAH: It's a
very important message

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.940
to pass onto my
daughters that they can

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.410
do whatever they want to do.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.840
As their parent, I
have a responsibility

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.120
to show them that I am
achieving my own dreams

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.319
so that they know they
can achieve theirs.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.860
MARIA MARTINA SANTORO: I'm very
lucky to have found our team.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.030
No matter what the
future will bring us,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.837
we will just keep working hard
and keep doing what we love.

00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:23.670
PRERNA GUPTA: When
you're building a product

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.086
that you love and that you
want to see out into the world,

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:27.240
it really keeps you going.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.400
This is the way you want to
have an impact in the world.
