00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.380
If you watched our last episode --
and really, if you haven’t, you should.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.000
...you now know all about derivatives, and how to use them, to describe the way an equation is changing.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.440
Which means that now we can talk about the
other main part of calculus -- basically,

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.609
the inverse of derivatives, called integrals.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.310
Integrals are useful because they also tell
you a lot about an equation: if you plotted

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.170
an equation on a graph, the integral is equal
to the area between the curve and the horizontal axis.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.880
Finding an integral is a little less straightforward
than finding a derivative, but, as with derivatives,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.930
there are shortcuts we can use to make things
a little easier.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
We’ll even be able to use integrals to talk
about how things move -- specifically, the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.520
equation we’ve been calling the displacement
curve, and why it looks the way it does.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.900
So let’s get started.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:52.400
[Theme Music]

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.540
Say you want to know how high your bedroom
window is above the ground outside below.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.720
But you don’t have anything to measure it with --

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.499
just a ball, the stopwatch app on your phone, and your impressive knowledge of physics.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.159
The force of gravity is what makes the ball fall,

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.439
so you know that its acceleration is small g
9.81 ms^2, downward.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.340
But you’re trying to find its change in
position -- how FAR it falls.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.960
We’ve spent a lot of time talking about
the connection between the qualities of motion:

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.160
position, velocity, and acceleration.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.940
But so far, we’ve been describing that connection in a particular direction: velocity is the derivative of position

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.700
-- that is, a measure of its change --
and acceleration is the derivative of velocity.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.000
To figure out how far the ball falls, you
need to use the reverse of that connection.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.540
Expressed mathematically, that means that
velocity is the integral of acceleration,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.530
and position is the integral of velocity.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.140
In other words: if you draw these equation
on a graph, velocity is equal to the area

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.720
under the acceleration curve, and position
is equal to the area under the velocity curve.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.000
Finding that area is the tricky part.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.850
There are simple ways to find the area of
pretty much any shape, as long as that shape

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.200
is made of nothing but straight lines and
corners.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.240
And when you think about it, a curve is just
a set of infinitely tiny lines.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.140
So the area under a curve can be divided into
a set of infinitely tiny rectangles.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.540
Integrals tell you what happens when you divide
the area under a curve into those infinitely

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.800
tiny rectangles, take the area of each of
them, and add up those areas.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.600
So, how do you find that integral?

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.170
Well, you start by using the fact that integrals
are basically the OPPOSITE of derivatives.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.870
If you know that your velocity is equal to twice time, for example, then you know that’s the derivative of the position.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.500
So, to find the equation for your position,
you just have to look for an equation whose DERIVATIVE is 2t … like x = t^2, for example.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.480
It’s kind of a roundabout way of doing things, compared to the neat equation we were able to use to find derivatives.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.660
But there is no tidy equation that we can
use to calculate any integral we want.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.000
But! As with derivatives, there ARE shortcuts
for finding certain, useful ones.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.340
For instance, you can take the power rule
that we used for derivatives, and run it backward.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.000
Basically: you add one to the exponent, then
divide the variable by that number.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.530
So the integral of 2t -- which is written like this -- becomes t^2.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.640
In the same way, the integral of 42t^5 is 7t^6.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.200
You can take the trigonometric derivatives
that we talked about, and do those backward, too.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.800
The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), and
so on. And the integral of e^x is just e^x.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.460
But there’s one complication that we haven’t talked about yet -- maybe you’ve already spotted it: constants.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.560
A constant is basically just a number. It can LITERALLY be a number -- like 2, or a half, or negative 4.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.380
Or it can be a placeholder for a number, like the small g, we’ve been using to represent the acceleration caused
by gravity.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.280
And constants pose a problem when it comes to integrals because: the derivative of a constant is just 0.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.629
A derivative is a rate of change, after all,
so a constant, which by definition DOESN'T

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.610
change, will always have a derivative of zero.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.400
Which means that lots of different equations - an infinite number, in fact - can all have the same derivative.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.409
Like, the derivative of t^2 is 2t. But you
can add ANY number -- or a letter representing

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:10.709
a number -- to it, and the derivative will
STILL be 2t. So the derivative of t^2 + 1

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.340
is also 2t. And the same is true for t^2 - 7.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.120
Which means: If you’re looking for the INTERGRAL
of an equation like x = 2t, you have INFINITE

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.260
CHOICES, all of which are equally correct.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.100
t^2 would work, but so would t^2 + 1 … or
t^2 - 7 … or t^2 + 0.256.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.200
In these cases, we might know what the SHAPE
of the integral should look like on a graph

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.880
-- like, whether it’s a straight line, or how it curves -- but we don’t know where to put it along the vertical axis.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.340
So we need to know what the constant is, in
order to know where to start drawing its integral.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.540
Whatever the constant is equal to, that’s
where the curve will intersect with the vertical axis.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.820
So t^2 would intersect at 0, but t^2 - 7
would intersect at -7. You get the idea.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.550
Mathematicians had to figure out how to get
around the problem of having infinite integrals

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.350
to choose from, so they came up with a way to represent ALL of them: just add a C at the end of the integral.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.140
That C stands for all of the constants that
we know we COULD put there.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.260
So if we say that the integral of 2t is t^2+ C,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.880
then we’re including t^2 + 1 and t^2
- 7 and all those other infinite options --

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.200
every equation whose derivative is 2t.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.540
But sometimes you don’t need the C at all,
because you CAN figure out where your integral

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.870
is supposed to be on the y axis. Like if you
have what’s known as the initial value.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.180
In the case of a position graph, for instance,
the initial value would be where you started out,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.320
so you’d know to draw the rest of
the graph’s shape from there.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.660
If you started at the 2 meter mark, say, and
moved one meter every second, you’d put

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.700
the graph here. But if you started at the
4 meter mark, you’d shift it up a little.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.200
Basically, it gives you the point where your integral intersects the vertical axis -- which is the value of C.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.480
Let’s try it, and at the same time, we might
as well figure out the height of your bedroom window.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.720
You’re standing in your room, holding a
tennis ball out the window with your arm resting on the sill.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.740
Now you drop the ball and start your
stopwatch app at the same time.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.380
Turns out that the ball takes 1.7
seconds to hit the ground.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.860
Like we said earlier, we know the ball’s acceleration -- 9.81 ms^2 -- and we know the time involved.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.560
Somehow, we have to get from
there to the equation for the ball’s position.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.380
So, first, let’s find its velocity -- the
middle step -- by taking the integral of its acceleration.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.100
Take a look at this graph of the ball’s
acceleration over time.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.340
It’s just a flat line, which means that it should be pretty easy to find the area between it and the horizontal axis.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.640
It’s a rectangle! And the area of a rectangle
is just its base times its height.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.380
In this case, the base is t, the amount of
time the ball took to fall.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.660
And the height is a, the acceleration.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.400
So, the area between the acceleration graph and the horizontal axis is just (a) times (t).

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.940
And the integral is (a) times (t), plus that constant
we add -- C.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.000
For now, we need the C, because we know the
general shape of the velocity graph:

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.720
It’s a diagonal line slanted in such a way that every second, it rises by an amount equal to the acceleration.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.760
But still we don’t know where to PUT that
line on the vertical axis. Not yet, anyway.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.060
Now, we could have figured out the integral
of acceleration just as easily by using the power rule:

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.100
The acceleration, a, is a constant, but we
could also say that it’s (a) x (t^0) --

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.960
because anything raised to the power 0 is just 1.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.330
So, according to the power rule, the integral
of acceleration -- which is the velocity -- would

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.860
be equal to the acceleration, multiplied by
time, plus C.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.680
That’s the same answer we got earlier!

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.800
Now, here’s where the initial value comes
in. The velocity graph tells you what the

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.430
velocity is for each moment in time. But we
had to add the C, because we didn’t know

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.790
where to place it on the vertical axis -- when
time equals zero.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.500
So, the integral of the acceleration COULD
have just been (acceleration) x (time), or

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.240
(a)(t). But it could also have been (at) +
4. Or (at) - 6.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.680
So we put a C in the integral instead, to
represent all those options.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.980
But we can get rid of that C if we can figure
out the velocity, when time equals zero --

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.260
what we’ve been calling v(0).

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.480
And if we write our equation with that v(0)
in it, as a placeholder for the velocity when

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.190
time equals zero, we end up with the the full
equation for velocity.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.550
That should look familiar, because it’s one of our kinematic equations -- the definition of acceleration!

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.590
Neat how everything works out like that.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.580
This equation tells us that the final velocity
of our falling tennis ball, when it hit the

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.700
ground, was 16.7 ms downward.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.420
But we aren’t done yet. We’re looking
to link acceleration and POSITION,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.640
so we’ll need to go one step further
by integrating again.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.380
There are a couple of different ways we could
do it, but let’s just use the power rule again.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.430
The integral of (a * t) is (half)(a t)(squared),

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.180
and the integral of v_0 is just v_0 * t.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.000
Put ‘em together, and you end up with this,
which is starting to look a whole lot like

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.200
ANOTHER kinematic equation -- the one we’ve
been calling the displacement curve.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.740
Now, what about that C?

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.660
Well, just like before with the starting velocity,
the starting position will tell us where to

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.830
stick this equation on the vertical axis.
So we’ll just make C equal to the starting

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.280
position, which we’ll write as x_0.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.860
And that’s our integral -- the displacement
curve equation.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.400
Which means that now, we have everything we
need to figure out, how high your window is.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.030
The starting velocity is zero, because you
just dropped the ball without throwing it.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.370
The acceleration is 9.81 ms^2. And it took
1.7 seconds to land.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.300
And now you know everything there is to know
about calculus. (long pause) No you don’t.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.710
As you can probably imagine, we’ve barely
scratched the surface here -- there’s a

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.890
reason it normally takes two semesters of
university, just to cover the basics.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.940
And, you know some people spend their
whole lives studying this stuff.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.760
But we’ve at least established enough background,
that when those things do come up in this

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.620
course, we’ll be able to use what we’ve
covered here, to talk about them.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.600
Today, you learned that integrals are the area between an equation on a graph and the horizontal axis.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.360
You also learned a few shortcuts to help find them, and how to find C using an initial value.
