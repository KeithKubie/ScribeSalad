00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:11.548
In the fall of 1960,
Frances Oldham Kelsey

00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:15.093
was one of the Food 
and Drug Administration’s newest recruits.

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:16.490
Before the year was out,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.284
she would begin a fight that would 
save thousands of lives,

00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:21.740
though no one knew it at the time.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.833
Although she was new to the FDA,
Kelsey was no novice as a scientist.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:28.666
After graduating 
from high school at age 15,

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.694
she enrolled 
at McGill University in Montreal

00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:36.097
and earned both undergraduate 
and master’s degrees in pharmacology.

00:00:36.097 --> 00:00:38.048
From there, she applied
for a research post

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:41.300
at the University of Chicago’s
pharmacology department.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.917
Her acceptance letter was addressed 
to Mr. Oldham.

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:48.424
Kelsey later joked that had her name 
been Elizabeth or Mary Jane,

00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:50.346
her career might have ended there.

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:52.387
Fortunately, it didn’t.

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:54.267
She earned her doctorate
in pharmacology

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:57.282
and accepted Chicago’s invitation 
to stay as faculty,

00:00:57.282 --> 00:01:00.931
where she undertook pioneering
research on drugs and fetal safety.

00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:06.107
In 1950, she earned an MD, 
her fourth and final degree.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:07.815
By the time she joined the FDA,

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:12.755
Frances Kelsey was one of the most
educated, experienced scientists around.

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:14.528
Yet, as the newest member
of the team,

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:18.147
Kelsey was assigned what everyone 
thought would be an easy review:

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:21.173
an application from the
US drug company Merrell

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:24.068
to sell a drug called thalidomide.

00:01:24.068 --> 00:01:26.542
Thalidomide was a sedative 
developed in Germany

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:29.389
that was already being widely used 
in dozens of countries

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.715
to treat insomnia and workplace stress.

00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:35.186
Thalidomide’s anti-nausea properties

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:39.223
also made it a popular remedy for pregnant
women with morning sickness.

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:41.121
Reviewing Merrell’s application,

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:45.694
Kelsey found its data on thalidomide’s
absorption and toxicity inadequate.

00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:50.170
Today, the FDA classifies drugs based 
on their safety for a fetus.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.740
But in 1960, many experts believed 
that the placental barrier

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.681
shielded a fetus from harm.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.525
Kelsey's earlier animal-based research

00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:59.059
demonstrated the opposite:

00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:02.291
drugs could pass from mother 
to fetus through the placenta.

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.921
Like other drug companies at this time,

00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:07.862
Merrell had not tested its drug 
on pregnant animals.

00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:11.690
Kelsey later said Merrell’s evidence 
for thalidomide’s safety seemed

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.665
“more like testimonials than
the results of well-designed studies.”

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:17.876
Kelsey rejected Merrell’s application

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:21.445
and asked them to submit a second 
backed by better evidence.

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:24.305
Her FDA colleagues 
supported this decision.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.067
Merrell had expected a quick, 
affirmative reply

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:30.009
so it could launch thalidomide
for the holiday season,

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.036
when sedative sales soar.

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:34.621
Instead of supplying Kelsey
with the data she requested

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.994
they first tried to convince her
to approve the drug

00:02:36.994 --> 00:02:39.533
over a series of calls and visits.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.178
When these failed to sway her,

00:02:41.178 --> 00:02:43.091
Merrell executives complained

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:46.478
that stubborn and nit-picking 
Kelsey was the problem,

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:48.357
not thalidomide.

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:49.946
The FDA backed Kelsey,

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:52.039
forcing Merrell to file 
another application,

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.976
and another,

00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:54.708
and another.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:57.864
As Kelsey reviewed 
and rejected each new application,

00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:01.385
news of thalidomide’s adverse 
side effects began to surface.

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:05.104
Doctors reported cases of nerve damage 
in early 1961,

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:08.925
and by fall,
they’d unmasked a more horrible truth.

00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:12.961
Thalidomide, widely used by pregnant
women, caused severe birth defects.

00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:15.260
Thousands of babies died in utero,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.793
and tens of thousands more 
were born with extra appendages,

00:03:18.793 --> 00:03:20.199
shorter limbs,

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.759
or no limbs at all.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:26.171
In November 1961, thalidomide 
was pulled from the German market.

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.562
Nonetheless, Merrell continued trying 
to get it approved in the US

00:03:29.562 --> 00:03:33.606
for several months before withdrawing 
their sixth and final application.

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:37.800
While Kelsey wasn’t the only scientist 
to identify the risks of thalidomide,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.051
she sounded the alarm

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.275
that kept it off the multi-billion-dollar 
American drug market.

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:45.723
As public awareness 
of the thalidomide tragedy grew,

00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:48.981
the quiet scientist 
became a media sensation.

00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:52.347
Headlines in newspapers 
and magazines heralded her heroism

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:54.728
while a smiling President John F. Kennedy

00:03:54.728 --> 00:03:57.904
presented her an award 
on the White House lawn.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.538
After the thalidomide scare,

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:02.620
Congress passed laws that expanded 
the FDA’s authority

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.436
and toughened requirements 
for new drug applications.

00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:09.097
Kelsey was tapped to head 
the agency’s drug investigation branch.

00:04:09.097 --> 00:04:11.977
Working at the FDA in
different capacities into her 90s,

00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:16.128
Kelsey was able to witness the changes 
her actions helped inspire.

00:04:16.128 --> 00:04:19.668
Her visibility may have dimmed since,
but her legacy endures.

00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:23.879
Privileging facts over opinions, 
and patience over shortcuts,

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.930
she made evidence-based medicine
the foundation of reforms

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.468
that continue to protect people today.
