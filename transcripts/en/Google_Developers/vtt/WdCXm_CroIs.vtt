00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.186
Hey, gang!

00:00:01.186 --> 00:00:02.810
Did you know you can
send notifications

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.040
to iOS devices using
Google Cloud Messaging?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.882
Well, you can.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:07.340
Why would you ever
want to do that?

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.650
Maybe that's a better question.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.400
Let's find out the answer
on this episode of Route 85.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.668
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.640
So notifications, they
are a great way for you

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.724
to engage with your users.

00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:24.389
They let your customers know you
have important, new information

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:24.960
for them.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.250
And when used responsibly,
they can be a great way

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.290
to keep users coming
back to your app.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.249
But they're not super
fun to implement.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.540
There's a lot of steps required
to set up notifications

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.809
in the first place.

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.850
You need logic on both
the client and the server.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.170
And if you're developing a
cross-platform mobile app--

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.780
and most of you are
these days-- you

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.140
have to do this for
Android and for iOS.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.680
And I'm not just talking
about two sets of client logic

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.320
either.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.200
It turns out sending
notifications to iOS

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.990
and Android devices requires
different logic on the server,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.820
too.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.240
See if you've done any
notifications work in the past,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.170
you're probably used to talking
to APNS-- that's the Apple Push

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.430
Notification Service--
to deliver notifications

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.000
to iOS devices and
to GCM-- that's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.209
Google Cloud Messaging--
to deliver notifications

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.594
to Android devices.

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:08.010
And while sending notifications
through these two services

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.700
is similar, they each have
slightly different features,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.590
use different protocols, accept
different message payloads,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.464
and return different
responses, all of which

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:17.880
means that you've got to keep
track of what kind of device

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.550
each of your users has and use
two completely different code

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.530
paths to send a notification.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.610
Or do you?

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.620
Well, no.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.449
No, you don't.

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:27.990
You see one pretty great feature
about Google Cloud Messaging

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.740
that a lot of people
don't know about

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.110
is that GCM can relay to
APNS any notifications you

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.952
want to send to an iOS device.

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:37.410
Now granted, you'll need to do
some setup work, like upload

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.800
your APNS certificate
to GCM and make

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.070
sure your client sends its
device token to the GCM

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.880
service.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.390
But once you've
done that, you can

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.740
use GCM to send all
of your notifications

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.070
no matter what platform
your target device is.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.970
And GCM will deliver
your notifications

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.490
to the correct device using
the appropriate service.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.990
Well, this means
that you don't need

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.020
to care about what device
your user has anymore.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.030
You just have to write and
maintain one code path.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.260
And as we all know, less code
means less room for mistakes.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.280
But it's not just
about using less code.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.285
By using GCM to handle
your messaging for you,

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:09.660
you can take advantage of some
of the other nice features

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.900
that GCM offers to
developers, like topics.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.260
Topics allow your app to
subscribe to notifications

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.010
about any particular topic
that you or your users want to.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.010
For example, let's say
you've got a weather app.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.996
And I, as a loyal
weather fan, want

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:24.370
to be notified whenever there's
extreme weather happening

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.860
in my zip code.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.319
Well, in the old
way of doing this,

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.235
you'd probably need to
set up a database where

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:30.980
you keep track of
each one of your users

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.780
and their devices
and their zip codes

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.582
and do this whole select users
where blah, blah, blah, query.

00:02:35.582 --> 00:02:37.790
Then, loop through the
results and send notifications

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.760
to each device that you get
back from this database query.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.930
But with topics, none
of that's necessary.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.030
Instead, your app
simply tells GCM

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.630
that you're interested
in subscribing to, say,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.910
the WEATHER_94043 topic.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.050
Then, next time there's
rain in California--

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.081
for us that counts
as extreme weather--

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:54.580
Oh my gosh!

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.372
There's something coming
down from the sky.

00:02:56.372 --> 00:02:58.163
I don't know if it's
water or if it's acid.

00:02:58.163 --> 00:02:58.895
I can't go out.

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:01.870
I don't know how
to drive anymore.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.190
Yeah, that seems about right.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.080
So, yeah, with topics,
your server simply

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.510
tells GCM to send notifications
to all devices subscribed

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.700
to the WEATHER_94043 topic.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.310
And I will get notified
along with all other devices

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.452
subscribed to that topic.

00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:15.785
So there's no database required.

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:17.176
Go ahead and throw it out.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:19.800
Oh, as long as you weren't using
it for anything else, I guess.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.960
I probably should have
mentioned that earlier.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.820
GCM has other useful
features, too,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.410
like upstream messaging, which
allows your app to communicate

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.894
to your server through GCM.

00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:29.310
This can be helpful
in cases where

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.600
you might want some lightweight
communication from your clients

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.390
to your server, but
don't feel like dealing

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.264
with the hassle of
setting up and maintaining

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:37.550
a full blown server open
to the entire world.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.760
Or read receipts, where in
some, but not all situations,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.800
you can be notified
that a user has received

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.640
your message, something
you can't normally

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.405
do through APNS alone.

00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:47.780
Oh, and in case
you're wondering,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.870
all this is free, as
in please send us $0.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.790
And it's using much of
the same infrastructure

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.270
that Google uses
for its own apps.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.506
So it'll probably
scale for yours.

00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:58.880
So there's a lot to learn when
it comes to notifications,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.810
and I encourage you
to get started here

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.554
with our Google Cloud Messaging
Documentation for iOS.

00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:05.720
We also have a couple of
sample applications for you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.430
to look at.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.050
There's Friendly Ping, our
cross-platform chat app powered

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.920
entirely through
Google Cloud Messaging,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.560
as well as the
GCMPlayground, which

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.470
lets you easily experiment
with sending calls

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.240
through the GCM service.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.472
And keep watching Route 85.

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:19.430
Maybe you'll see another
Google Cloud Messaging

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.047
video pop up in the future.

00:04:21.047 --> 00:04:22.630
If only we had some
way of letting you

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.330
know when that happened.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.500
Well, I'm stumped.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.850
