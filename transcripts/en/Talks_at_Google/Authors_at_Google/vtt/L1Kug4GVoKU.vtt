NATHAN: Hi and welcome,
everybody, to Talks at Google.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.240
Today, I have the pleasure of
introducing Brian Solis, who

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.190
is the author of "What's the
Future of Business (WTF)."

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.950
He's a well-renowned digital
analyst, author, and has a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.290
great blog.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.980
I also encourage you to go visit
my personal favorite at

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.730
go/shaqbrian, which is a
great interview of--

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.640
Brian giving an interview
to Shaquille O'Neill.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.460
So without further ado, I'll
let Brian take it away.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.300
BRIAN SOLIS: Thanks, Nathan.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.300
Well, good afternoon.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150
Thank you for spending
the Friday with me

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.910
before a long weekend.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.890
I'm a digital analyst.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.100
I study technology and its
impact on business.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.620
And on nights and weekends,
I like to say that I'm an

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.350
aspiring digital
anthropologist.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.710
I like to look at how technology
is impacting you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.900
and me and how it starts to
change sort of who we are,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.110
forms of self expression, how
we communicate with one

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.480
another, and ultimately how that
makes us or helps us or

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.380
improves or changes the way
that we make decisions.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.830
Because in that world between
analysis and anthropology is a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.250
greater understanding of
how to get in front

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.590
of how we're changing.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.160
And nothing really says change
and innovation and

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.673
transformation as much as a
PowerPoint presentation.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.730
Now that I think about it,
with a small room that's

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.300
probably not the best choice.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.790
But I will just kind of flip
through some slides, and then

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.350
I'd love to just hear
your questions.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.280
One of the things that I find
most fascinating is that when

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.020
I'm not working with technology
companies and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.550
working with big brands and
enterprise organizations to

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.680
help them figure out how do
embrace innovation and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.770
technology as a way of improving
engagement-- whether

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.340
it's with customers, whether
it's with employees, whether

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.550
it's using technology as a way
to improve products or

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.230
processes or services--

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.840
and what's consistent in almost
every case is this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.230
inability to really understand
the role that people play in

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.430
the whole process.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.680
Technology is part of it.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.320
But things like transparency,
communication, empowerment,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.020
listening to people, thinking
about the problems that they

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.180
have and how to improve those
processes that contribute to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.590
the problems or the
products that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.080
contribute to the problems.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.090
None of this really is part of
the decision-making cycle at

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.970
the enterprise executive
level.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.030
I actually believe this
contributes to what I call

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.450
digital Darwinism.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.040
Technology and society
are evolving.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.040
It's just a reality.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.220
And a lot of businesses and
organizations and governments

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.270
aren't evolving along with it.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.110
And that creates a problem where
we're trying to solve it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.320
with technology where we will
say, networks, tablets,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.400
smartphones.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.250
These are all ways that
we're communicating.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.000
So therefore, the answer has to
lie with the device or has

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.310
to lie with the network.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.570
When in fact it's more cultural,
it's more human.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.110
Understanding this
difference--

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.790
if I was a relationship
counselor, you would talk to

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.680
somebody in a marriage
and say, well

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.780
there's what you said.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.150
And there's what they heard.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.330
And often, they're different.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.380
So allowing yourself to step
outside of, say, you and think

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.890
more about the people, the
markets, the opportunities

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.780
allow you to see things in
a very different light.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.120
I'm not sure if anybody has
watched that show "Undercover

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.980
Boss," but it's one of
my favorite shows.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.650
Even though it has the same
exact ending every episode,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.820
there's a beauty in the
validation that

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.740
happens at the end.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.210
It's sort of this gift of
empathy that executives get

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.050
from having to walk in the
footsteps of their customers

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.130
or their employees and in turn
seeing, essentially, what it

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.630
is that they have missed
all along.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.339
They'll always say the
same thing, too.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.570
They'll say, I forgot
what it was like.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.640
And that's important.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.785
Because when you start to
remember what it's like, or

00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:29.690
when you get to see what the
challenge or the problem is--

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.180
you've probably heard of the
book "The Innovator's

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.540
Dilemma." You sort of play on
words and you realize it's the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.320
dilemma's innovator that can
pave a way to a brighter, more

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.630
meaningful future where empathy
plays a key role in

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.490
all of this.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.920
What it all nets out
too is that, yes,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.260
technology is pervasive.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.760
It's part of our everyday
life now.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.120
And when you post a selfie on
your favorite network of

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.960
choice, and you don't get as
many reactions as you hoped,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.930
that affects you.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.300
So you do it again.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.900
Or you find a more interesting
way to evoke that type of

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.210
engagement or reaction that
validates why you did it in

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.200
the first place.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.000
And as we start to do this,
there's a self-empowerment in

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.070
the process.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.870
You place yourself at the
center of everything.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.340
I call the egosystem, and I use
that word lovingly, where

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.950
you are literally at the center
of your universe, where

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.890
people, businesses, anything
that's important to you sort

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.430
of revolves around you.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.210
And you, too, revolve around
the other things that are

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.100
important to you.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.510
Why is this important?

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.140
Because at the center of all
of this, understanding this

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.460
human algorithm--

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.840
what makes us tick, what's
important to us, how are we

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.980
changing, and how are we forcing
others to change

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.788
around us--

00:05:53.788 --> 00:05:58.610
I believe, requires not only
study but innovation.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.110
So I brought some of these books
that I'm going to leave

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.740
behind for anybody that
has a long drive this

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.370
weekend or a flight.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.060
Because I want to share
my story with you.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.520
I wish I had more time
in the world.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.630
If I did, I would fix how we
teach kids in school because

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.910
we're adapting old processes
to new ways of thinking.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.240
And it's almost the same problem
across the board,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.540
whether it's a government
or business.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.010
It's just that we're taking what
we know and we're trying

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.445
to stuff what's new into old
processes and methodologies.

00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:39.490
And I thought, wow, well
you know what?

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.030
I'm an author.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.960
This is, I think, my sixth
or seventh book.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.520
There is no way I could sit
down and write another

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.250
400-page business book.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.090
I just can't.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.440
In the last year and a half
since I've published my last

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.570
book, a lot's happened.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.735
I'm part of maybe too
many networks.

00:06:56.735 --> 00:07:01.110
I'm definitely tethered to too
many devices, in good ways.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.580
But just my ability to think and
write, consume, it's now

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.480
more bursting than it is
consistent or continual like

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.780
the way it used to be.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.820
It's not a bad thing.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.080
I actually think I've learned
more in the process.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.140
So then I started to think about
textbooks and kids and

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.000
how they learn or how they're
having difficulty learning.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.310
And how maybe we're prescribing
medication to them

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.770
to get them to focus rather than
maybe innovating in ways

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.490
that help them focus
their way.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.350
So I thought about the book,
the concept of a book, and

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.000
decided why would I write a book
the same old way on the

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.410
same old paper with the same
all font when I could and

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.560
should develop a book that would
be the way I would want

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.010
to consume it or the way a
younger millennial or Gen-Z

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.100
would want to consume it?

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.340
And so I spent about a year or
so studying UX and design and

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.570
studying how you and I read on
tablets, and how we read on

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.580
smartphones, and what
makes us share.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.120
What become something
that's shareable?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.160
What makes us engage with
the piece of content?

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.920
And the idea of a book
went out the window.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.230
The idea, then, of an analog app
started to come into view.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.590
And how I wrote, the way I wrote
a sentence, how I would

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.700
bring a paragraph together,
when I would not opt for a

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.840
paragraph and go for
a visual instead.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.570
Thinking about what a table of
contents means and why there

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.830
wouldn't be a navigation bar
as you turn the pages.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.419
It started to make more sense
that if I was trying to

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.220
innovate for the sake
of innovation, it

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.410
might miss the target.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.750
If I was trying to innovate
based on the dilemma, you

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.690
start to see greater
opportunity, greater clarity

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.860
through empathy.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.370
And so this is why I believe
that the future of innovation

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.120
actually lies at the center
of, say, data science and

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.010
social science.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.330
Because essentially, the people
that we're trying to

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.860
connect with, the people that
matter to us, well, they have

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.950
an audience of their own.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.950
And their audience has an
audience of their own.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.170
And they live in this ecosystem
where they don't

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.640
have to step outside of it.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.750
It's fulfilling to them.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.180
It's fulfilling to us.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.370
We capture experiences, we share
experiences that are

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.150
important to us.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.750
And if anything isn't making a
correlation in this regard,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.930
then you're missing an
opportunity to extend your

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.730
reach, to extend your value,
your purpose, your mission.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.050
And when I talk to businesses,
a lot of them will sit there

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.370
and say, we get what
you're saying.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.280
So we think the answer, then, is
going to be in technology,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.800
and then also better
understanding millennials.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.400
So we're bringing on millennial
marketers.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.800
We're bringing on folks in
HR who better understand

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.380
millennials.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.980
And you realize, cool.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.780
All right.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.140
But it's not just about
an age group.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.820
It's about behavior.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.090
And I refer to this
greater-connected society as

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.990
Generation C, where the C
stands for connected.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.720
And the reason I do that is
because when you study how,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.420
say, a 49-year-old uses their
tablet, their social network,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.630
and their smartphone, they
start to exhibit

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.430
millennial-like behaviors.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.230
My mother, for example,
is, I believe, a

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.440
millennial at heart.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.300
She's too connected.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.000
She's too social.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.810
And sometimes I've had to
consider blocking her because

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.040
of how active she is in tagging
posts and pictures and

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.240
what have you.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.630
But in that regard, though,
the way that she makes

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.430
decisions has also changed.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.880
She's watching television
with her tablet.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.640
She's sharing things
in real time.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.990
She's capturing and sharing
experiences.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.610
So to her, what becomes
important has to fly through

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.190
the stream, has to fly
through her network.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.500
It doesn't necessarily have to
be in a billboard or a print

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.640
magazine or on a television
show or commercial.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.100
So the idea is just segregating
by age or

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.800
demographic--

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.290
sure, it makes sense
in some regards.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.870
But I think if we look at
behavior there's a bigger

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.740
opportunity because behavior--

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.690
by the way, if you just add
colors to this bike, I see

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.510
that driving up and down the
street all the time.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.520
It's a very talented move,
if you ask me.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.630
But in reality, technology just
becomes an extension of

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.790
who we are at all times.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.230
I hear parents--

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.180
I interviewed Katie Couric for
my web show, and she just sort

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.000
of talked about the frustration
she has, for

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.780
example, of being a parent and
trying to get her kids to look

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.530
away from the smartphone during
dinner or to put the

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.950
phone down while they're
watching TV or movies.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.290
And essentially, what we're
trying to do is force people

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.860
to go through their lives in
the way that we grew up, in

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.560
the way that we learned.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.380
When, in fact, it is us, I
think, who have to learn.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.220
Look, I'm not a millenial.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.230
I like to pretend
I am, though.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.060
When you look at how a young
child approaches a flat-screen

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.260
television, it's natural for
them to want to pinch

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.200
and zoom and swipe.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.150
If you can hand them a remote
control, there is just

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.570
absolutely no way that would
make sense in any type of

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.340
intuition of why you need
so many buttons to

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.830
control that thing.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.060
And then if you look at how many
controls you have just in

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.230
the living room alone, it just
doesn't make as much sense.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.870
And what we're starting to do
is take this philosophy--

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.980
processes of how we make
decisions, why we're making

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.570
decisions--

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.910
and you come back to that
"Undercover Boss" TV series.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.750
And you realize that the people
making decisions about

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.610
the future welfare of the
business, the company, the

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.860
government, the livelihood of
whatever it touches, they're

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.830
making these decisions based on
life as they know it, not

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.590
life as they don't.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.190
And this is why I believe
that thinking--

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.990
I laugh when I see
this picture.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.440
But the reality is that
to them, that is

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.400
the best party ever.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.940
And so better understanding why
that moment is shareable

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.190
and why they're connected to
their device and to figure out

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.930
how to capture attention and
to be part of that moment

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.070
requires a completely different
process leading up

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.950
to it-- how you talk, how you
engage, how you keep people

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.860
engaged, how you understand what
they're trying to do, and

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.180
how you help facilitate what
they're trying to do.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.830
What you realize is that,
essentially, you're just

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.930
solving for yourself.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.060
Because this is as much about
trying to get your attention

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.750
as it is trying to be relevant
to a person who has different

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.220
needs, different expectations.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.920
Because the more that you become
connected, the more you

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.310
become informed.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.730
The more you become informed,
the more you become empowered.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:04.190
The more you become empowered,
the more demanding you become.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.480
Real-time, personalization--

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.910
you are at the center
of all of this.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.170
And if things aren't meeting
your needs or expectations,

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.600
you share that with your
greater network.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.582
You let those around you know.

00:14:16.582 --> 00:14:22.500
There used to be a joke that
only social media experts have

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.820
problems with airlines.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.670
And the joke is because you
hear about it all the time

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.630
where they're tweeting that
United or JetBlue or

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.250
Southwest--

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.990
that, my flights delayed
five minutes.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.010
WTF!

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:34.380
Really?

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.560
It's not really a problem.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.010
Sometimes it's a problem.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.390
But the reality is that
businesses don't even know

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.830
what to do with that.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.770
Oh, we're so sorry.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.940
Here's an 800 number.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.400
Call us.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.770
Or here's an email address.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.150
Call us.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.750
That's not going to happen
because that's not the way

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.630
that I work.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:55.320
And if we want to connect, we
can't think about channels as

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.430
being ways for us to talk at
your, for us to come up with

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.830
some beautiful brand or some
story or some value

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.250
proposition and stuff it into
as many channels with as

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.312
little effort as possible.

00:15:08.312 --> 00:15:12.010
I actually believe that when we
innovate based on problems,

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.400
based on behavior, it's like
looking at the remote control.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.400
You start to see that the way
things are and the way things

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.890
could be are, in fact,
different.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.830
The fact that businesses,
decision-makers in general

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.830
still think that we make
decisions in a linear fashion

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.900
around a funnel is funny, so
much so that I call it a

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.310
cluster funnel because it's
this great masquerade.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.560
The persuasion--

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.460
think of that as marketing
or branding, some clever,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.840
creative, gorgeous ad.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.990
It's to persuade you
to think about us.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.500
And then we have some deal, some
hook, some incentive to

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.980
bring you in to the point where
you have to exchange

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.050
with us something, whether it's
vote, whether it's money,

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.370
what have you.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.810
And then once we have
you, there's

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.090
always a great distance.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.780
We don't need you.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:09.900
And if you need us, well, we
have processes for you, then,

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.690
to start to try to
engage with us.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.140
But we might need you
at some point.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.070
We have a new product, we
have a new initiative

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:17.870
that needs a vote.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.680
So we call that the
reenchantment.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.950
And after the reenchantment,
we just place you into this

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.910
governance system that is either
CRM or some database

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.140
that's falling apart.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.760
But there's just no way to keep
you informed or engaged,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.810
to build a relationship that
goes beyond a transaction.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.610
In the '90s, there was a book
called "The Experience

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.690
Economy" that a friend of
mine, Joe Pine, wrote.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.860
He said, if you think about
being in the business of

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.550
products, you're going
to fail over time.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.080
If you think about being in the
experience business where

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.140
a product is one of the things
that brings an experience to

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.000
life, then that represents
the future of engagement.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.970
And I actually believe that's
true because if you think

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.500
about what it is that we share
in all of these networks,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.920
across all of these devices,
they're always experiences.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.420
It's very experiential.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.730
It's a very emotional landscape
in which we've woven

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.339
through this technology,
through devices.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.910
We share what we love, we share
what we hate, we share

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.050
what's meh.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.650
Connecting in that way, then,
you start to see that an

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.480
emotional layer, an experiential
layer is required

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.880
to be defined by you and lived
through by those who are

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.950
important to you.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.780
It's more of a journey, not a
funnel, where everything that,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.100
say, related to Google, related
to any business,

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.850
related to anything, are
stitched together based on

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.160
shared experiences before,
during, and after

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.940
transactions.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.450
Always--

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.075
it doesn't go away.

00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:51.500
It's not Snapchat.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.790
These experiences don't
self destruct.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.580
They start to culminate,
much like a

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.320
Google index, for example.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.950
And these shared
experiences are

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.210
always on, always available.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.690
Think about the Lazyweb
for a moment.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.770
Some people won't even
use Google search.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.260
They'll just go right to their
network of choice and say, I'm

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.870
thinking about, does anyone
know, can anyone recommend, so

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.110
that they can bring the answers
to them without

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.970
leaving one particular window.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.290
And when we get those answers,
we're forced to walk in these

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.230
steps, in these click paths,
in these journeys that are

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:34.660
defined for an old way of
thinking, a linear flow that

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.980
just doesn't work.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.330
It's almost like the
remote control.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.580
It serves a purpose, but we're
forcing people to use

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.730
something and do things
our way, not a

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.810
way that's more natural.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.430
I dug up a very interesting
report from the Google

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.280
Insights team-- it was called
"The Multi-Screen World"--

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.890
that I thought was pretty
interesting.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.180
And it studied how people made
decisions and how those

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.570
decisions came to life
across screens.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.620
Were they able to complete
something with one screen?

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.550
Did they have to screen hop?

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.950
Did they complement
one another?

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.180
And what this told me was aside
from how people are

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:21.590
using it, they're using every
device differently.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.340
And what if we could better
understand what the nature of

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.600
that screen was, what the
intention of that screen was,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.900
what the intention of that
outcome would be, and then

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:38.270
redesign the UI, the UX, around
everything so that it's

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.865
efficient, it's natural,
it's native.

00:19:41.865 --> 00:19:44.090
I'm not sure how many of you
have read the book "The

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.800
Cluetrain Manifesto."
I think it came out

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.610
10 or 11 years ago.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.270
And in the book, the authors
talked about how the future

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.830
was going to be driven by
conversations, that all

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.450
markets were conversations.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.100
And at some point those
conversations would become

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.350
more powerful, more defining
than any effort you could do

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:06.496
in terms of branding or
marketing or influence.

00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:11.410
When I think about that, they
were so right that it's not

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.470
just about conversations.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.070
Really, what it's about is this
idea that conversations

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.710
are expressions of
experiences.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.880
The future of markets, business,
education, what have

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.985
you, is all driven
by experience.

00:20:25.985 --> 00:20:31.230
And I was inspired by Google's
work around the zero moment of

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.870
truth a couple years ago.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.830
And for those who don't know the
zero moment of truth, it's

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:41.860
this idea that when something
captures your attention,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.540
you're going to essentially
Google it to

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.690
learn more about it.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:50.090
What I found fascinating about
that was it was just one of a

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.770
series of moments of truth.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.080
You take away the funnel, you
take away the journey, you

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.280
take away this idea of
conversations, and you just

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.530
realize that as a consumer, as a
human being, when we want to

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.230
make a decision, there are just
four moments of truth

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.660
that happen that affect how we
make a decision and how in

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.460
turn we affect how other
people make a decision.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.560
What I found fascinating,
though, is what happens in a

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:20.370
world where maybe we don't
have our laptop first?

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.810
Maybe google.com isn't the
first place we go.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.060
Maybe we go to another Google
property like YouTube because

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.780
maybe it's easier to look up a
video on a smartphone than it

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.410
is a website.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.730
I, for one, for example,
can't even read a

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.960
product manual anymore.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.030
I can't even read websites
anymore just because they're

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.540
not necessarily written
for human beings.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.510
They're written for the people
who signed off on the check to

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.140
pay for the design.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.930
For example, I'm a
big photographer.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.190
I love digital SLRs.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.750
I just picked up a new
camera recently.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.630
I was wowed by the beauty
of their advertisements.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.930
When I opened up the box and I
looked at the manual, I swear

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.740
it was created in 1927.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.820
It was illustrated poorly.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.870
Sorry, I'm not going to the
brand because it's on video.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:20.170
But I had to go to YouTube in
order to figure out what I

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.170
needed to do.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.730
And I couldn't find any videos
by the manufacturer.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.090
Instead, I found videos from
other people like me who

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.470
couldn't find answers who
answered questions, who

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.220
demonstrated capabilities.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:38.040
It's fascinating to me that in
that moment of truth, the

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.810
company was saved because it
had committed consumers,

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.120
people who cared enough
to actually use the

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.200
channels the right way.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.280
So what if we were thoughtful in
the approach and say, look,

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.220
I understand you're not going
to find what you need.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.410
You're not going to
like this manual.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.770
So we're going to give
you other options.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.780
And we're not going to just rely
upon you to add to the

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.620
ecosystem to find solutions.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.680
We understand you're
going to go around.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.590
Google research shows that every
year the number of touch

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:10.830
points seems to grow, often
doubles, because they can,

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.260
because technology
is pervasive.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.270
It's everywhere.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.770
But what keeps coming back in
those moments of truth aren't

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.630
the things that we
think they are--

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.920
not the things that we're
designing like websites and

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.840
long forms of copy
and collateral.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.400
It's all experiences, the
experiences people have and

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.290
the experiences people share.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:33.730
For example, as an author I have
to rely, whether I like

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:41.950
it or not, on Amazon reviews,
on iTunes reviews, on just

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.980
reviews in general more than
I can rely on my own

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.380
website for the book.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.020
More people are going to believe
what you say rather

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.540
than what I say.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:57.390
So if I know that, why wouldn't
I start to work with

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.780
my own teams or my own
consumers to build an

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.680
ecosystem that when someone asks
a question in Google or

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.420
somebody puts a series
of keywords in

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.960
YouTube, for example--

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.960
why would I leave it to surprise
or to chance in what

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.420
comes back in those
moments of truth?

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.450
Why wouldn't I design that
moment of truth, much in the

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.920
same way that we designed
SEO SEM?

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.510
So if we could work with
people to design the

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.720
experiences that we want them to
have, that we want them to

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.860
share, wouldn't it be
fascinating in that world

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.280
where we know what comes back
when a question's asked?

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.280
So I'm just going to kind of
jump ahead because I think the

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.240
future of anything that we do is
about creating experiences.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.720
Because if you can design an
experience that people need or

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.810
that they expect--

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.870
or that we understand the
problems that they have today

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.240
and we could design something
that solves for it--

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.160
then we could merge the
real world and the

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.530
virtual world into one.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.940
That becomes useful.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.510
It's not just a utility.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.130
It's experiential.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.770
So I think about--

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.060
I'm a geek, so I think about
stuff like this-- "The Matrix"

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.650
or "Inception." The one thing
that both of those movies had

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.620
was an architect, this person
who was responsible for

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.770
designing the landscape.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.780
You still were you and
you still moved

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.120
through this landscape.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.070
But they created a world that
was important to you, that you

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.350
could navigate or would want
to navigate around.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.510
And that is the way I think
about experiences.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:37.980
Because in what I call the
ultimate moment of truth,

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.500
you're going to experience
something.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.680
Like if I don't like a product
manual, I'm going to share

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.430
that I don't like a product
manual because

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.340
I'm going to search.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.890
I'm going to ask questions.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.350
That experience you have every
step of the journey--

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.070
before, during, and after
a transaction--

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.160
is something that's shared.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.980
It's something that's indexed.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.970
It's something that's
findable.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.010
And if we're not designing what
that experience could be,

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.990
we don't only leave it to chance
for what is shared.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.540
What is shared actually becomes
the culmination of

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.610
your brand.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.190
A brand is not a logo.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.060
It's an ethos.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.265
It is what it represents.

00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:18.610
It's what it symbolizes.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.230
We would often try to complement
a brand with a

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.590
vision statement or a
mission statement.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.530
With my last book, I read
about 1,500 of those.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:32.670
And I found three that we're
really meaningful, human, that

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.480
actually spoke to me.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.950
Like, oh, I see where
you're trying to go.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.810
I think that vision is something
I can align with.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:43.230
But in a world where experiences
become you,

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.080
there's always an experience
divide.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.290
There's this brand promise--

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.810
what you say you're going to do,
what you say I should have

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.210
as a customer or as a
stakeholder or as

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.260
part of your community.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.350
And then there's the experience

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.490
that I actually have.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.470
What I actually have
and what I share--

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.910
the more this happens, the more
connected we become, the

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.140
more reality it is.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.920
It's the truth.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:16.130
And this transparency starts
to become a way of life.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.325
This truth, then, is not
anything you can manipulate,

00:27:18.325 --> 00:27:20.580
you can try to influence
or steer.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.595
It's something you have
to aspire to create.

00:27:22.595 --> 00:27:25.130
And I think this is
a great thing.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.490
I don't know how many of you
have heard of or used the

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.360
Pebble watch.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.040
But I was following that
Kickstarter program when it

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.890
shattered all the records.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.970
I was an early Kickstarter
backer for this product--

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.390
well, a whole bunch of
products because

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:41.070
I think it's fun.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:50.040
But what it promised sounded
amazing, so amazing that a lot

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.320
of people backed it.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:59.770
What the real experience was,
however, was very different.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:04.950
And the most common complaint,
other than the screen dying,

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:09.860
was the company never responding
to anybody.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:14.030
And now you have this brand
promise and a real world

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:19.480
series of experiences that
affect what I'm going to do as

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.880
a new customer.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.620
These reviews, these experiences
really start to

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.820
influence whether or not you're
going to follow in the

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.450
same footsteps willfully or if
you're going to rely on your

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.695
peers to help you
make a decision.

00:28:31.695 --> 00:28:35.400
And in an emotional world, this
is true for Amazon, this

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.580
is true-- this is
from Best Buy.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.980
What's true about emotional
experiences when they're

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.710
shared is they're either a
five or they're are one.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.380
The fives are people who
believe in the promise.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.240
The ones are people who didn't
believe the promise and who

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.720
had a different experience.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.170
The ones can become threes,
fours, or fives with

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.000
engagement, with learning--

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.290
understanding how that
experience failed to meet

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.190
expectations and how
to fix that.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.760
So all of the complaints from
people who said that the

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.430
company didn't care, didn't
listen, didn't follow up,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.030
well, there's a way
to fix that.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.180
And any time somebody tries
to fix anything a

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.560
natural thing happens.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.800
It's called reciprocity.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.230
You're actually thankful.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.410
You actually appreciate that
somebody reached out, heard

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.890
you, listened to you.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.940
And it changes how you
feel about things.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.220
Often, you actually change
your review.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.095
You share something publicly.

00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:34.980
You tell people that you
heard from them.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.720
And that's important.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.590
At the same time, it's a sad
state of the world when you

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.510
actually get help and it's
that transforming.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:46.430
But that's a whole
other discussion.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.800
So I believe that the future
of shared experiences isn't

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.770
just about innovation or
coming up with ideas or

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.330
finding ways to use technology
to just be ahead of the curve.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.990
I actually think that the
greatest form of innovation is

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.970
when you are the dilemma's
innovator.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.890
There are a lot of problems in
the world that I think create

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.120
a lot of opportunities.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.690
And with that, those
opportunities can be inspired

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:16.430
by, enhanced by empathy.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.330
The world, I think--

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.360
every decision maker, every
leader in the world, every

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.820
manager in the world could use
that "Undercover Boss" moment

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.065
because it's inspiring.

00:30:27.065 --> 00:30:28.590
It makes you think
differently.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.760
It makes you see differently.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.260
And that's the point.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.770
Because when you can see things
differently, when you

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:39.090
can feel things differently,
you are living in an

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.850
experience layer--

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:46.430
a layer, by the way, I believe
that is user defined.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:50.945
This is entitled, "How Computers
Are Born." I thought

00:30:50.945 --> 00:30:52.410
it was funny.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:57.350
But more importantly, it was a
visualization that got me to

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.590
see differently.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.850
And that is whether it's a
business, whether it's a

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:10.370
government, whether you're an
author, if you try to think

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.590
about what it is you're creating
or delivering and

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.490
what it takes to bring
that to life--

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.930
when you start with empathy
and thinking for different

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.110
type of person, you find that
the end result, the outcome,

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.630
the deliverable, whatever it is,
is different than if you

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.850
try to approach it with
iteration or just pure

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.761
innovation.

00:31:32.761 --> 00:31:36.010
And I think this is
complementary to ways that we

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.350
do things today or it's
revolutionary and just

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.680
completely usurping how
we do things today.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.680
To get this, by the way, it
wasn't like I called the

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.000
publisher and said, hey, I need
you to not print the book

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.850
the way you usually do.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.480
I have a whole different
shape, and I

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.890
need different paper.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.030
Could you guys find a different
printing press, too?

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.390
And what do you guys usually
pay for printing

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.170
each copy of the book?

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.410
Because I'm going to need
you to triple it.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.130
It was a very, very painful
conversation to have.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.790
In fact, the whole idea of the
design delayed the book by six

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.340
or eight months, to the point
where I was going to give up.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.050
But thinking differently about
what you're trying to do and

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.210
why it's important,
that's purpose.

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.330
And purpose is contagious.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:21.810
And I believe when you start
with that, only good things

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:22.740
can come out of it.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.440
But at the very least, what ends
up happening is this idea

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.400
of relevance.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.240
Relevance becomes an outcome
because you're considering

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.270
every aspect of it-- the brand
experience, the user

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.090
experience, the customer
experience--

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:40.380
where the one thing that ties
them all together is

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.152
experience.

00:32:42.152 --> 00:32:47.270
It was thoughtful, it was
designed, it was reinforced,

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.520
and it was connected.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.600
So what I'd just love to close
out with-- and if you have any

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.900
questions, we'll throw to you00
is this idea, though,

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.200
that innovation isn't something
that has to be

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.690
driven by technology.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.420
Innovation is something that
I actually believe is most

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.780
meaningful and most relevant
when it's something that you

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.760
feel, and it's something that
inspires you because that part

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.260
inspires those around you.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.140
And I only just started on
my path or my journey to

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.990
rethinking the way that
I would do things.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.220
If I have to change the way I
talk or the way I write and

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.840
just not take it for granted
that I just do things the way

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.670
I always have-- if I want to
be relevant to a different

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.080
type of reader or to a different
type of student,

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.050
then I have to actually
try to be relevant.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.800
I can't just assume
that it would be.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.480
So at the future of
whatever it is--

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.030
whether it's business or
government or music or

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.640
television--

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.460
the greatest innovation is
going to happen when you

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.210
actually care enough about what
you're trying to enable

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.180
as much as the experience that
you're hoping to deliver.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.260
AUDIENCE: I get the idea
you're giving.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:06.730
So do you have any just initial,
concrete, baby steps

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.760
for us, as employees, thinking
about our own

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.580
teams and our leaders?

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.139
Just about how to start
implementing some of the ideas

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.460
that you're talking
about here?

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:20.080
BRIAN SOLIS: So I'll start with
just talking to the team,

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.350
or talking to users, to get a
better understanding of what

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.860
it is that they're experiencing,
what they're

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.600
feeling, what a day in the
life is like, their

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.480
opportunities, their
frustrations, their

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.300
challenges.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.250
And I do it one-on-one.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.760
So it's not like
a focus group.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.120
It's like an interview, like
a therapy session.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.030
Because then when you disarm
those who you're talking to,

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.420
you get the truth.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.040
And in the truth-- and
this has yet to

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.389
fail me, by the way--

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:49.360
in the truth comes insights.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.210
And when you present those
truths back to the team,

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.780
there's a lot of surprise and
often, like the ones and fives

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.330
in a review, there's
often surprise and

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.430
there's often denial.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.080
And what ends up happening,
though, is like that

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.170
experience divide.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:08.070
There's just always a divide of
what you think you're doing

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.630
and what's really felt
and what's happening.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.640
But also, within that divide
comes this idea of what your

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.100
next steps would
be to close it.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.880
It becomes purposeful.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.820
And that always, always works.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.910
People align around that.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.230
If they don't, then
they don't care.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.120
But I haven't seen
that happen.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.710
But when they can align around
something, its purposeful.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.780
That's where it always starts.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.540
It's not a complex process.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.110
It's just a process
of understanding.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.110
It's like that "Undercover
Boss" moment.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.970
You're just walking in the steps
to better understand

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.930
what's happening,
what's feeling.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:42.740
AUDIENCE: So thank you, first
of all, for coming out and

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.420
talking to us.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.110
But I really like the part where
you said that with the

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.540
Pebble watch, the people who
commented on the ones could

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.560
have probably been brought up
two, three, or fours with just

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.480
engagement.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.170
But in this progressing world
where engagement's becoming

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.550
more and more important, do you
think if you can only have

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:01.860
one, is personalization or
consistency more important in

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.052
your engagement with
your customers?

00:36:04.052 --> 00:36:08.730
BRIAN SOLIS: I actually think
that consistency is probably

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.640
going to outweigh
personalization, at least

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:16.050
initially, because in that
Pebble example, there is no

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:20.430
uniformity in the solution.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.580
There is uniformity
in the problem.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.720
I mean, it's just consistent.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.520
You read every review, even
those that have great reviews.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.560
It's just the problem
is consistent.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.440
So anyway, in that regard, what
if you just aimed for

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.530
consistency in the experience
that people are going to have?

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.200
What if you aim for consistency

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.300
in the promise delivery?

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.470
Maybe it's not the
right promise.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.630
But you were consistent
with the promise.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.220
From there, though, the idea of
personalization, I think,

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.330
can be unlocked.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:51.110
It's almost harder to create
alignment between the desired

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.855
experience and the experience
people have.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.700
If you can do that, people
become a form of

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.830
engagement for you.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.140
It's almost like advocacy.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.820
And that could have
been solved for.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.920
When you look at the best
products, there is a sense of

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:07.870
uniformity because the

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.005
experience is what was designed.

00:37:10.005 --> 00:37:13.920
And it creates this excitement
or this enthusiasm within the

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.100
community where people will
actually start to answer other

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.190
people's questions.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:20.510
So this is going to sound silly,
but it's true for the

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.830
Vitamix blender world, by the
way, which I've just found out

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.710
is a church.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:29.300
People are really religious
about this blender.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.710
And they are answering all of
the questions that people have

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.180
about it before anybody from
Vitamix can even get to it.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.590
Actually, I haven't seen
anybody from Vitamix.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.750
Not to say they're not, but
in every case the idea of

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:48.560
consistency was delivered in the
product and therefore, the

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.270
idea of personalization came
from peer-to-peer.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.980
So pretty interesting
in that regard.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.020
Any other questions?

00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:01.860
Well, as an analyst, when I try
to solve for businesses

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:07.880
who actually want to survive,
I'm almost like a lawyer.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.840
I have all the evidence that's
necessary to fight my case, to

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.080
say, look, we're actually on a
path to irrelevance than we

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.880
are on a path to relevance.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.870
The reason why there isn't a
prescription is because it's

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:26.270
never a problem of them not
wanting to do the right thing.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.240
It's always a cultural problem
of them thinking that they're

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.800
doing the right thing and that
everything that they've

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.620
learned, everything that they
do on a daily basis, is sort

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.530
of managing the business in a
direction that they believe it

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.740
to be most successful.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.140
So this is why the idea of
anthropology came, at least,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.670
into my world.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:47.210
The stakeholder interview thing
is interesting because

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:50.600
when I report out to an
executive at a company and

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.520
they actually see that what they
think is happening and

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.560
what they're managing toward is
not the reality, it always

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.170
creates very interesting
discussions.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.030
And what they always do after
that is they form--

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.660
using enterprise words, their
words, not mine--

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.380
is they form either a steering
committee or a task force to

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.670
go learn more about it.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.110
This has to do with
part innovation--

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:16.190
so they'll move people here to
Silicon Valley to talk to you,

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.030
to talk to other companies to
see what's on the horizon,

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.940
what's trending, what
are they learning.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.450
They'll also look to their
folks in the social media

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.380
department, for example,
to listen.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.420
What's taking place?

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.500
What are we hearing?

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.680
What are we not missing?

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:39.680
But in every case, the problem
is the bottom line.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.200
When you look at that stat about
companies that turned

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.260
over, there was one time when
Kodak was incredibly

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.510
profitable.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.370
So the one thing that I hear
every time is that, look, our

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.470
last quarter was this.

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.000
Why do we even need
to listen to you?

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.730
And it becomes a culture of
management rather than a

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:02.880
culture of leadership.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.670
There's an interesting
infographic that's going

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.920
around over the last couple of
days that showed the number of

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.250
executives who either got bailed
out, who got fired with

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.810
the golden parachute, and
ultimately how many of those

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.060
folks drove those companies
into the ground.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:22.130
What creates this demise is
anything and everything.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.010
A lot of times, it's greed, a
lack of transparency, a lack

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.490
of leadership.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.630
So that's why the problem is
there isn't a prescription.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.140
I do think that the solution,
though, is around creating the

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:35.890
desired experiences that meet
expectations or at least beat

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.900
what it is that customers
expect.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.020
At the back of the book,
I talk about the

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.430
psychology of change.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.740
How you get somebody to
see that there's a

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.450
problem with smoking?

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:48.390
And then how do you get them to
quit smoking in order to do

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:49.890
something differently?

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.560
So a lot of this, I
realized, was part

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.950
politician, part lawyer--

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.370
not just building the case but
also championing the case.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.470
In every case, what ends up
convincing someone who's

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.790
preserving power, they
understand that there's a way

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.370
to get more power by thinking
differently or investing in an

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:11.220
alternative strategy.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.710
So you almost have
to feed into it.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:15.520
And very rarely does it happen
because they saw it.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.370
It happened because the team
that they've surrounded

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:22.830
themselves with to insulate
them has said this is the

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.650
direction that they
have to go.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:30.880
So in many cases, the team that
surrounds the decision

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:36.650
maker is not the team that sees
the opportunity, either.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:42.580
So for us, for me, every single
time I have to get--

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.920
it's good, old-fashioned
politics.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.200
I have to get what I need
because I see an opportunity,

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.730
because I did the math to see
that it's an opportunity, and

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:55.820
then get an executive sponsor
that's in that inner circle to

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.260
at least allow me to prove it.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:03.440
When that happens, then that
inner circle invests in this

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.750
innovation committee,
this steering

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.170
committee, this task force.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.530
And then they're chartered with
tangible things to bring

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:09.250
about change.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:13.050
So what ends up happening is
that three, four, five years

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.590
from now, those little pilots
have added into an augmented

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:21.040
or a complementary program
that brings about change.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.890
It doesn't just say, look, we're
going to compete for the

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:25.290
future and we're going double
down on all this stuff.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:26.430
It's incremental.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.790
So I look at the Tata
group out of India.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.740
And the one thing that I like
about them is that they didn't

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.890
know the answer.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.910
They didn't know how to stay
competitive or how to stay

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:38.030
innovative.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:43.270
So they put it in the hands
of their employees to just

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.880
innovate, made it part
of the culture.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.150
They said management had to take
ideas and that they would

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.960
then be measured by how
they translated

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.350
those ideas into programs.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.030
It was a cultural thing.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.330
Now, that's led to very
interesting things like

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:02.100
low-cost cars, a lot of
improvements in processes.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.940
But in that regard, the leader
of the organization said that

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.240
there's an opportunity here.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.160
In other ways, you have to
create that opportunity.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.660
It has to become part
of culture.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.370
And the only way to do that is
to get it into the inner

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.590
circle to affect the ultimate
decision maker.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.220
Because nothing happens
from the bottom up.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.010
It always has to happen
from the top down.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.020
It's complicated, hence ending
the book on all these

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.440
psychological steps to get
people to see and how to fight

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.410
for change.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.820
One of things that I'll bring,
and I'll bring it back to

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.400
higher level.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.220
But there is no easy answer.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.600
I was really inspired by Joseph

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.210
Campbell's the hero's journey.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:41.130
Because in the hero's journey,
there was this common path

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:45.450
that mythological leaders
had followed.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.680
And there was a lot of
challenge, a lot of doubt, a

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.720
lot of renaissance.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.730
And I sort of adapted that,
saying, you're going to be met

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:57.220
with every obstacle that's going
to dissuade you from

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.160
doing what you want to do.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.720
It's not even in your job
description or your

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.410
responsibility to try to bring
about this type of change.

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:05.810
But there's a great reward for
it, and here's 21 steps to

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:09.500
follow to at least have a shot
at it and to create strength

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.920
and unity around you.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.280
Because without it, waiting
for it to come from

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.850
the top down is--

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.190
it's just not going to happen.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:20.470
That's why Kodak
is what it is.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.640
I spent about five years of
research looking at all the

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.160
companies that just failed
and created an

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.140
infographic around it.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.670
And it's sobering,
to say the least.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:35.860
But there wasn't one common
thing that led to the demise

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.510
of some of the brands that
we all grew up with.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:41.270
But what was common was just
this inability to see that

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.510
there were alternative
possibilities for the future.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.190
And that's why I think that that
hero's journey, what this

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.590
really starts to inspire is what
happens if you and I can

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.420
just start to try to answer this
question and start to try

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.180
to bring about the change or at
least create the need for

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.980
change or make a case for an
opportunity for change.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.900
And then you become the best
practices or the series of

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.590
steps that we follow.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.570
And that's the book that
I hope to write next.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.440
And I wanted to try to spark
a revolution around that.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.390
So guys, thank you for your
time and attention this

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:20.040
afternoon, and enjoy
the long weekend.
