 [Music] 

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.320
 AppOn is based in Pune 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.510
 Was established in 2012. 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.570
 We develop easy-to-explain games 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.450
 And improved for emerging markets. 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.450
 With this huge turnout on smartphones, 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.280
 We had to focus on these markets to maximize our profits. 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.422
 They offer us a great number of business opportunities. 

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:30.700
 Kitchen Story is a simplified simulation game 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.930
 And skills management. 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.050
 You must cook different types of food 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.110
 To compete with various international chefs. 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.250
 When Kitchen Story was at the theoretical level, 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 We were taking into account that it was 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.100
 Game size is less than 20 MB. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.110
 Beginning, in India, there are many 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.000
 Of the challenges we face. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.330
 The first of these challenges is hardware compatibility. 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.260
 The second is the cost of data. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.740
 The third is low-performance devices and language support. 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.830
 So you have to make sure that the game 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.750
 Compatible with all types of devices 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.610
 And performs the same performance on all devices, 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.490
 Whether the device is expensive or cheap. 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.490
 We learned from our previous mistakes 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.720
 That the development of a large-scale game 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.330
 Will lead to catastrophic consequences in these countries, 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.560
 So we are really excited to develop a game 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.750
 Smaller and faster performance. 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.900
 Working with Google, we've discovered the best possible way 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.180
 To minimize the size of the game. 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 The first method is to use Noto fonts instead 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.790
 Custom fonts, because that reduces 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.310
 The size of the applications facilitates the possibility of 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.119
 Translate your games into other languages. 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.910
 Second, embedded formats are useful for content 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.350
 In animation, user interface and effects. 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.520
 Using built-in forms helps content 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 In greatly reducing the size of the game, 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.640
 We make sure that this does not adversely affect the user interface or experience 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.230
 Best use of color tables. 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.700
 The images are similar to color measures, 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.160
 Where you can fill color tables and indexes 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.989
 separately. 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:59.530
 After that, you can change the color table 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.390
 And get a completely different picture. 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.310
 We developed the game so that it works without Internet, 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 Because in India, some users may not have an Internet connection 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.880
 All the time. 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.780
 We also transferred a lot of gaming data or assets 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.940
 To the electronic cloud. 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.680
 We have so far received almost 6 million downloads 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.729
 And more than 100,000 comments with a rating of 4.4. 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.270
 Initial retention rates 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.830
 Really high because the game is easy to learn 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.775
 Therefore, retention rates on the first day rose to 60%. 

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:28.710
 We always focus on developing light and fast games 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.500
 It offers a great user experience. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040
 These technologies that we have used so far, 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.430
 Part of our business strategy. 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.880
 We continue to use these techniques in our new games.
