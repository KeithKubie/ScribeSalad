00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.700
Jill just received $40.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.610
The number of dollars she
has left, y, after x days,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.670
is approximated by the formula
y is equal to 40 minus 2.5x.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.660
Graph the equation
and use the graph

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.950
to estimate how much money
Jill will have 8 days later.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.080
So let's just make a
table of x and y values.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.730
Then we can use that table
to actually plot the graph.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.150
And then ask us to do
everything else they want us.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.840
How much money she'll
have after 8 days.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.430
And we should actually just
put that right in the equation,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.119
we might as well do that.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.142
So we're doing numbers of days.

00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:35.600
We're not going to
go back in time.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.090
She starts with $40, so
we can start with 0 days.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.870
So 0 days.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.786
So she just received
the $40, you don't even

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:43.202
have to look at
the equation here.

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.586
What's 0 days after that,
how much money will she have?

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:47.460
Well she hasn't had a
chance to spend it yet.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.834
So you could just
think about it.

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:49.546
She'll have $40.

00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:50.920
Or you could look
at the equation

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.970
and see that the
equation verifies this.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.460
When x is 0, so the y value
is going to be 40 minus 2.5

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.100
times 0, which is just 40.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.099
Because that part
right over there is 0.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.950
So at time, at 0 number of
days, she will have $40.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.060
Now we could do one day
later, but then we're

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.930
going to have these
decimal points in here.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.044
So that this part
of the equation

00:01:14.044 --> 00:01:15.460
always ends up
with clean numbers,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.840
let's multiply it
by multiples of 2.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.920
So then at 2 days, how
much money will she have?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.930
Well, it's going to be
40 minus 2 times-- I'll

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.600
do the same order--
minus 2.5 times 2.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.230
2.5 times 2 is 5.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.020
So 40 minus 5 is $35.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.391
After 4 days, it's
going to be 40--

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.890
let me do this in
a different color,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.264
so when I plot
the points, you'll

00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:44.330
see where I got my
information from.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.560
After 4 days she's going to
have 40 minus 2.5 times 4.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.690
2.5 times 4 is 10.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.070
So 40 minus 10 is 30.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.450
You see, every 2 days that
goes by, she is spending $5.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.540
$5 every 2 days,
or $2.50 every day.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.290
And you actually see
that right over here.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.090
She is spending.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.260
That's a negative sign.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.960
$2.50 dollars every day.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.290
Every time you increment
x by 1, $2.50 goes away.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.570
So let's keep going.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.910
So then after-- I'll look for
another color here-- 6 days,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.350
it's going to be 40
minus 2.5 times 6.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.595
2.5 times 6 is 15.

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:29.260
40 minus 15 is equal to 25.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.960
Then finally we could
do after 8 days.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.760
After 8 days, she'll have
40 minus 2.5 times 8.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.830
2.5 times 8 is 20.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.679
So 40 minus 20 is $20.

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.220
So we actually
answered our question.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.710
Our estimate for how much
money Jill will have 8 days

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.862
later is actually $20.

00:02:48.862 --> 00:02:50.070
But let's do this first part.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.710
Let's actually graph the
equation, see it visually.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.207
So let me draw some axes here.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.790
This will be a
hand-drawn graph, but I

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.770
think it'll get the job done.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.340
So let's make that our
y-axis, or in this case

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.140
it's the number of
dollars she has.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.480
And let's make this my x-axis.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.930
This is our x-axis.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.480
And we only need to focus
on the first quadrant.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.282
Because at least
in this context,

00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:13.740
we're assuming she won't have
a negative number of dollars.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.660
So the y values
will be positive.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.190
And we assume that the days
are only going to be positive.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.760
We're not to deal
with negative time.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.410
So the x values are always
going to be positive.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.410
So we're only going
to be operating

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.380
in the first quadrant.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.050
So that's all I have to draw.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.880
And so she starts off at $40.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.600
Let me mark off the y-axis
in increments of 10 first.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.290
So this would be $10, this
would be $20, this would be $30,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.750
this would be $40.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.320
And then I could do the $35, the
$25, the $15, and then the $5.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.290
And then let me
mark off the days.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.240
So this is-- let me do it, I'll
do that same yellow color--

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.420
so this is after 2 days, this
is 4 days, this is 6 days,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.950
this is 8 days.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.100
We could keep going if we like.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.760
So after 0 days, so this
right over here, after 0 days,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.030
she has $40.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.950
So that's this point
right over here.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.690
That's that right over there.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.400
Then after 2 days, she has $35.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.640
2 in the x direction,
then we go up 35.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.550
So that's that point
right over there.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.460
Then after 4 days, she has $30.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.830
So you go x 4, remember the days
are in x, or x are the days,

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.680
actually you should
mark it, these are days.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.720
And the y-axis is
the dollar axis.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.180
So after 4 days, she has $30.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.530
Then after 6 days-- I'm
going to do the same color--

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.060
after 6 days she has $25.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.790
So x-coordinate is 6,
y-coordinate is 25.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.426
And then finally, after
8 days, she has $20.

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:00.990
And so we've plotted
those points,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.725
and we could connect them.

00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:03.190
We could actually just,
if we had a nice ruler,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.370
we could just
connect two of those,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.550
and we would have the line.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.966
But our line looks
something-- let

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:09.410
me do this in a new color--
our line would look something

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.791
like that.

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:16.676
That shows how much she
has after every day.

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:17.300
And we're done.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.716
We've graphed the
equation, and we

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.950
know she'll have $20
left after 8 days.
