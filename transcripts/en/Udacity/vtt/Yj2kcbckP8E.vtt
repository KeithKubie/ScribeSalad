Good job. Now you know the names of the cells, but

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.230
usually instead of words in the cells we'll have numbers or data.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.650
If this is the case, you'll have to copy and paste

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.560
the data from the shared Google spread sheet, into your own spreed

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.970
sheet in order to analyze it. let's get familiar with this.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.260
To create your own spreed sheet go to your Google Drive. All

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.600
of this is also explained in the Instructor Note section. If

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.270
you're signed in to your Google email account, you should see a

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.430
bar at the top that looks like this. You can click Drive, or you can just go

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.670
to drive.google.com. Make sure you're signed in. From your

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.320
Drive, I suggest your first step should be to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.030
create a new folder for this class. To do

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.120
that, click this icon here. Name this whatever you

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.380
want. Maybe just Statistics. After you name it, you

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.260
should see a Statistics folder appear in your drive.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.590
You can use this folder to store all the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.620
datasets you work with throughout this class. Click on

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.860
it. Once you're in your Statistics folder, you can

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.270
create a new spreadsheet by clicking this button and selecting

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.840
Spreadsheet. You should then have a new spreadsheet that

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.700
looks like this. Then you can copy and paste

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.240
the data that I provide, like this flight cost

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.320
data. You just click Cmd+c, or Ctrl+c if you're on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.414
a PC. And then you go to your

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:21.710
spreadsheet and click Cmd+v or Ctrl+v. Now you're able

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.150
to analyze the data. I recommend either creating a

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.940
new spreadsheet for each new dataset. Or, create a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.140
new sheet within this same sheet by clicking this

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.420
plus sign at the bottom. Then you'll have a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.850
new sheet within the same spreadsheet, in which you

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.370
can input a different dataset. Then you could call

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.600
this spreadsheet something like Statistics Datasets. And rename each

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.912
sheet to what it is, and what lesson. For example, this is

00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:56.130
fFight Cost data from lesson 15. Alternatively, within

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.350
your Statistics folder, you can just continue

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.390
creating new spreadsheets. And then naming the entire

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.950
spreadsheet the name of that dataset that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.570
I originally provide you. Its up to you.
