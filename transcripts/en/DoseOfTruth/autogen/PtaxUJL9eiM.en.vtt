it's a mind-boggling idea man really

certainly seems phenomenologically
correct and I mean the potential that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
correct and I mean the potential that

like this might be useful for you or
maybe you get attracted to this person

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
maybe you get attracted to this person
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860
maybe you get attracted to this person
or maybe you admire this person that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
or maybe you admire this person that
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.479

happens with kids a lot they'll admire

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
happens with kids a lot they'll admire
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.459
happens with kids a lot they'll admire
someone and then copy them and you can

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
someone and then copy them and you can
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.170
someone and then copy them and you can
see that that's obviously part of their

see that that's obviously part of their
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.510
see that that's obviously part of their
developmental progression right it's hip

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
developmental progression right it's hip
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.189
developmental progression right it's hip
form of hero-worship but kids are very

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
form of hero-worship but kids are very
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899
form of hero-worship but kids are very
imitative and they hero-worship at the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
imitative and they hero-worship at the
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510
imitative and they hero-worship at the
drop of a hat and so they're they're

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
drop of a hat and so they're they're
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.170
drop of a hat and so they're they're
entranced by the the next stage of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
entranced by the the next stage of
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.700
entranced by the the next stage of
development and if they see someone who

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
development and if they see someone who
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710
development and if they see someone who
embodies that especially if it's in the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
embodies that especially if it's in the
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.570
embodies that especially if it's in the
zone of proximal development it's it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
zone of proximal development it's it's
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.450
zone of proximal development it's it's
um it's something they could achieve

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460
um it's something they could achieve
 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.890
um it's something they could achieve
stretching a bit they find someone who

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900
stretching a bit they find someone who
 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.330
stretching a bit they find someone who
embodies that next stage of development

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
embodies that next stage of development
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580
embodies that next stage of development
and then they start to imitate them and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
and then they start to imitate them and
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.690
and then they start to imitate them and
act like them

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
act like them
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.910
act like them
