[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:06.660
BEN ORLIN: Thanks, Max.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.680
And thanks,
everybody, for coming.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.610
I'm really excited to be here.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.900
This is fun.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.890
I've gotten to do--

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.060
since the book came
out in September,

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.226
I've got to do a few different
events, a lot of them

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:15.916
at colleges, but this is
my first corporate event.

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.290
And it's nice, because Google
is basically a big college.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.610
So I appreciate being here.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.030
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: I mean,
note the chairs too, right?

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.500
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, that's right.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.800
Yeah.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.425
Yeah, well, this
makes it seem like I'm

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:27.930
a film director, like we're
here to discuss our latest film.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.680
Which maybe we could
try to do that after.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.860
I'll just start by showing a few
images from-- it so I started,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.965
I've been a teacher since
I graduated college.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:39.730
I started a blog
about five years ago.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.320
I wanted to do--

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.180
wanted to write about math,
knew that math needed visuals.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.260
I also knew that I can't draw.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.550
It's just not in my skill set.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.870
So figured I would
disclaim it upfront.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.780
It's gonna be math
with bad drawings.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.940
So I figure I'll just
show a few images

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.200
from my writing and my rather
unlikely illustrating career

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.925
so far.

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:02.300
So this was right
after, I think,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.349
the month I started the blog.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.059
And this is still probably
one of the, I dunno,

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:08.600
better known, the
more popular pieces

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.080
of writing that I've done.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.120
And you can see that my
illustration style is still

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.860
developing.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.890
That's me, and I'm
pretty sure I'm supposed

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.280
to be pulling out hair.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.600
That's tufts of
hair in my hands,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.740
which was just a grotesque
idea for a drawing among also

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.035
not being the best
piece of execution.

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:27.800
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: I
think I didn't quite

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.170
understand that the first time
that I looked at it, that that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.460
was what he was holding there.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.531
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, I
think you're not alone.

00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:35.530
He just looks like there
are horns or something,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.830
I don't know.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.464
I also learned pretty
soon that I hands are just

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:40.130
a losing battle.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.870
You don't wanna
try to draw hands.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.630
Anyway, but so this essay
is one of the first things

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.680
I did on the blog.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.420
And one of the
things I was really

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.962
interested in, especially
right when I started writing

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:51.920
about mathematics, moving
from having taught it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.590
for four years at that point
to trying to reach a larger

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.940
audience, was mathphobia
and math anxiety,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.410
and this whole suite of
almost psychiatric problems

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.990
that people have when
they think about math.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.970
And so this actually, I mean,
like most of my writing,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.759
it's a very kind of
breezy, silly piece

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.300
with some jokes in it.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760
It was incredibly hard to write.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.550
It's an essay about a math class
I took senior year of college

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.260
that I struggled in.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.270
And when I sat down
to write it there,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.210
I was about 500 or
thousand words deep,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.966
and it was all disclaimers of
like, "well just so you know,

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:27.590
I'm actually pretty
good at this stuff.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.230
So it's not that I'm bad at it."

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.670
And the idea of actually
looking directly

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.140
at where I had
struggled and where

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.710
I had failed in this class, it
was like looking at the sun.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.187
It was really hard to just
bring my focus towards that.

00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:42.770
And in some sense,
most of the writing

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.260
I've done since then
flows out of that,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.730
I think trying to look at the
experience, which is really not

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.610
fun to look at, but of
being in a math class,

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.740
running into something
that you don't understand,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.600
and just kind of
feeling like an idiot.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.420
Which is something, if you take
enough math, you wind up there.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.961
I mean, everybody
has that experience

00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:02.107
at one point or another.

00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:04.190
Anyway, and so that was,
from the start, something

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.290
that I was thinking
about with the blog.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.100
Another piece, this was a year
or two later, a similar angle.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.870
And you can see my
drawing style evolving.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.650
Basically, not
trying to do as much.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.270
No noses, no hands.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.390
This was in the midst of what
I call my Long Neck Phase,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.240
where all my stick figures had
necks that were much too long.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.010
And also, I think,
understanding what,

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.950
as someone who has no
background in drawing

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.520
and really no comfort
with it as a medium

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.580
or as a skill, what
can I do is basically

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.890
try to come up with
some concepts for images

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.730
and have the concept override
my lack of technique.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.680
So this was one where I
think a common kind of meme

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.120
in the culture
around mathematics

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.700
is that you hit
some maximum point.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.574
For some people, it's algebra 1.

00:03:54.574 --> 00:03:56.990
For some people, it's their
trigonometry or calculus class

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.770
in high school.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.900
For some people, they
take abstract algebra,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.280
and they start learning
about rings and fields,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.321
and that's where they sort
of fall off the wagon.

00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:05.446
And there's this
notion that yeah,

00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:07.070
there's a ceiling
that you can advance.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.270
Math is hierarchical.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.350
You climb the ladder.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.740
Then you get to a rung,
and it's like, oh,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.656
you can't go past that
one, because your lungs

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:14.040
don't work that high.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.524
Which I think is wrong.

00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:17.940
I don't think
that's how it works,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.890
but it's a very authentic
experience that people have.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.250
So I show this as just
as an example of the kind

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.250
of the kind of cartooning I do.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.580
My metaphor is this futon.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.150
It was freshman year of college.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.390
And you may remember
this, actually.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.119
The guys on the
first floor in our--

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:38.660
yeah, we had the
same entryway, yeah.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.070
The guys on the
first floor wanted

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.000
to get rid of their futon.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.050
So they're very
nicely carried it up

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.460
to the fourth floor for us.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.651
And along the way, like
a little piece broke off.

00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:48.650
And we were like, ah,
it's a little piece of it.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.150
It was like a little
piece of metal.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.930
It seemed fine.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.690
And then, like a week later,
the futon was doing that.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.240
And then two weeks later,
it was sort of like that,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.190
dumping in the middle.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.140
And then eventually, it
took like a month or two,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.390
and then the futon was broken.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.700
And I think that to me isn't
a bad metaphor for what

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.550
happens in math
education, where there's

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.080
a little piece that's missing.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.010
I've taught eighth grade, so
an algebra 1 student can graph

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.330
some lines, maybe doesn't
really get what that's about,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.550
doesn't get the idea of
sort of the correspondence

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.270
between this equation and the
points on the line or xy pairs

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.564
that satisfy the equation.

00:05:25.564 --> 00:05:27.230
There's just some
missing understanding,

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.740
and it seems fine
in eighth grade,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.300
because they can answer
all the questions.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.180
But as you build further,
the futon kind of

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.679
starts to warp, and then at
some point, there's a collapse.

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:37.220
I think that's what
people experience

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.712
as a ceiling in math education.

00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:42.170
It's not actually them hitting
some kind of cognitive limit

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.340
of what they can understand.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.050
It's sort of old fractures
finally leading to a rupture.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.610
Some other more recent drawings.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.250
This one was a fun piece too.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.130
This actually wound
up in the book too.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.900
Partly, I show this--
this is from 2015.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.730
It really doesn't make
sense after 2016, I think.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.115
Because in 2015, it fell
like a credible critique

00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:05.990
of political journalists,
that they're always

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.710
trying to hype up the
unlikely possibilities.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.534
And then with the 2016 election
surprising a lot of people,

00:06:13.534 --> 00:06:15.450
this is one that I had
to change for the book,

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.562
because I wanted to--

00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:18.770
first, I wanted to make fun
of political journalists,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.170
but this was no longer
the right joke for that.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.159
[CHUCKLING]

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.950
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Is
there an updated version

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.965
later in the slides?

00:06:25.965 --> 00:06:28.090
BEN ORLIN: Actually, I
don't have it in the slides.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.420
This is the teaser for the book.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.461
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Oh, nice.

00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:32.060
BEN ORLIN: I gotta
go obtain the book.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.143
And this is another one
that winds up in the book,

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:35.840
why not to trust statistics.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.550
This one, you can see
I'm very, very much

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.699
in my Long Neck Phase.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:40.990
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Very long, wow.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.260
BEN ORLIN: It's really
disproportionate.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.140
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Wait, can
I pause you for a second?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.330
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, yeah, please.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.430
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Are you
drawing these on whiteboards?

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.110
BEN ORLIN: No, actually.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.943
So originally, yeah.

00:06:47.943 --> 00:06:50.330
So back at the very beginning,
I spent a year drawing

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.220
on whiteboards.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.490
I thought was a really good
idea to photograph the pens.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.140
I don't know.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.515
People would ask me something
like, "why do you do that?"

00:06:59.515 --> 00:07:02.926
I'm like, "That's the
key to the whole thing."

00:07:02.926 --> 00:07:04.430
And really, I
don't think it was.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.550
A year later, I
stopped doing it,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.716
and I've never got an email
from someone being like,

00:07:07.716 --> 00:07:09.020
"where are the whiteboards?

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.670
I miss those."

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.879
So then, yeah.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.420
At this point, I
was actually using--

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.350
I mean, this is still what I do.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.060
It's just Sharpie on
paper and I scan it.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.870
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: OK,
so I was wondering

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.400
how you got that faded area
from a whiteboard marker.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.150
I don't think I would
know how to do that.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.460
BEN ORLIN: Sure,
colored pencils.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.150
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: I didn't
realize you didn't.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.730
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.854
Yeah, very, very high tech.

00:07:25.854 --> 00:07:28.080
It's Sharpies and
Crayola colored pencils.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.246
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
Oh, that's great.

00:07:30.246 --> 00:07:31.780
BEN ORLIN: So this one was--

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.150
right, this is now three
years into the blog.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.980
And I think I was
moving towards--

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.250
I wanted to do simpler drawings,
because they are easier,

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.230
and also it looks-- if
you do it like this,

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.050
it looks like maybe I could
actually draw real things,

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.675
and it's just I'm choosing to do
something kind of deliberately

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:49.250
minimalist and simplistic.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.150
Which is a lot.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.870
That's not true.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.200
I can't.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.790
I really can't draw
any more complex.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.190
But if you do it, if you have
the right kind of simple style,

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.315
you can almost pull it off.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.410
I was moving towards--

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.400
I guess I had started--

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.775
I had agents by
this point, and I

00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:04.650
was starting to
think about the book,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.837
although I hadn't
I hadn't gotten

00:08:06.837 --> 00:08:08.920
in contact with my editor
yet, so the book project

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.135
hadn't come together.

00:08:10.135 --> 00:08:11.510
But this was this
sort of thing I

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.020
knew I wanted to maybe
build a book around.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.400
It's just jokes that
explain simple math ideas.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.160
So this one you can
sort of imagine.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.450
You guys know how means work.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.841
So a mean is very
sensitive to the--

00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:25.340
mean is the total divided by
the number of things there are.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.970
It's not sensitive
to distribution,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.630
so this is a plausible--

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:33.031 --> 00:08:33.530
I can't.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.909
I really can't look
at these drawings

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.492
anymore, because the
necks are so long

00:08:36.492 --> 00:08:39.409
and the legs are so short.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.789
Anyway, well, the faces
of always been my focus.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.764
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: This
is really upsetting.

00:08:43.764 --> 00:08:45.680
BEN ORLIN: And then this
one wound up floating

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.200
around Twitter, but
it was sort of--

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.257
That's probably the
best joke I've written.

00:08:52.257 --> 00:08:54.590
That feels like a joke I
discovered rather than writing.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.594
It's a very simple joke
that was there already.

00:08:57.594 --> 00:08:59.260
And it was doing
really well on Twitter,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.410
but I hadn't tweeted it out.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.951
Someone else had tweeted it out
without attributing it to me.

00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:04.430
So the dangers of social media.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.394
Mostly, I'm just trying to
claim my credit belatedly.

00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:08.810
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
This may have been

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.420
in the essay that went along
with this particular cartoon,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.240
but I don't remember.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.550
Is the claim here
that there was--

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.930
you're explaining why
there was one time that

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.609
was both the best and
the worst of times?

00:09:20.609 --> 00:09:21.650
BEN ORLIN: I guess, yeah.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.229
I mean, it was my best joke.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.020
I can't say I've read
"Tale of Two Cities."

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.902
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: OK.

00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:27.110
BEN ORLIN: It's a beautiful--

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.080
I've read the opening paragraph.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.510
It's a lovely opening paragraph.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.220
I assume because it's
two cities in the title.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.290
I assume one of them, it's
real good, and one of them,

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.160
it's real bad there?

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.170
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.512
BEN ORLIN: But don't ask
me what the two cities are.

00:09:38.512 --> 00:09:39.470
Paris has gotta be one.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.230
Anyway, and then this
is a more recent essay.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.960
So this point is five years in.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.510
I guess if you'd
asked me 2013 if I

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.420
was gonna have five or
more years of things to say

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.460
about mathematics, doing
a post or two a week,

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.289
and lately I've been doing
four cartoons a week,

00:09:55.289 --> 00:09:57.830
I think I might not have been
too optimistic about continuing

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.522
to have fresh ideas.

00:09:59.522 --> 00:10:00.980
But to some extent,
I mean, this is

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.270
what I think what
writing almost anything

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.050
is, is finding fresh ways
to present or to discuss

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.460
old insights.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.060
So one of my favorite
essays I've written,

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.926
which isn't in the book but
may appear in a feature book,

00:10:15.926 --> 00:10:18.300
was I actually got the chance
to ask a question of Andrew

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.150
Wiles, who was the
mathematician who

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.730
proved Fermat's last
theorem after this 350-year

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.660
to try to figure out
what this lost proof was,

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.120
which clearly
Fermat did not have.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.690
And so I got to ask Wile
in a way that research

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.060
mathematicians don't, usually.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.210
He gets a chance to speak
to a much wider audience.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.800
He's sort of a figure in
the popular imagination,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.810
and what's the message
that he tries to send

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.550
when he gets those chances?

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.820
And what he said was
basically that mathematics

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.970
is about being stuck and being
comfortable with being stuck.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:57.060
And that to solve problems
is to kind of glory

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.530
in that phase, where
you've entered,

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.030
you see what the problem is,
you see what the destination is

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.030
you're trying to get to.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.330
You just don't know
how to get there,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.800
and to grow
comfortable with that

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.844
and to grow to
enjoy that process.

00:11:09.844 --> 00:11:11.260
And he said it
really beautifully,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.430
so I just did some cartoons and
a little bit of my own prose

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.609
elaborating on that.

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:18.150
But that's still, in any given
week, probably one of the more

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.930
visited posts on my
blog, because it's

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.262
sort of a timeless message.

00:11:23.262 --> 00:11:24.720
I mean, which makes
sense for a guy

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.230
who spent a decade solving
a 350-year-old problem.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.930
He's good at coming up with
fairly timeless wisdom.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.790
And then, yeah, so
this leads to the--

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.540
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: It's a
pretty universal idea too.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.170
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.915
Yeah, it stretches
beyond math, I think.

00:11:36.915 --> 00:11:37.290
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.081
BEN ORLIN: This is my
wife's favorite joke.

00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:40.420
She's a research mathematician.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.420
And it's not the absolute
best joke, but you know,

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.510
it makes her happy.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.100
I've been doing more
cartoons lately,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.610
trying to-- you can
see my illustration,

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.290
you can see it's getting better.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.360
Those necks are much
more proportionate .

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.360
To the oven almost has a
plausible geometry to it.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.339
So I'm proud.

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:57.380
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: I'm very
impressed with the oven.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:57.910
BEN ORLIN: Thank you.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.243
Yeah, let's go back to the oven.

00:11:59.243 --> 00:12:02.160
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah, the
glass on the front door, well,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.480
the only door of the oven--

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.020
BEN ORLIN: Thank you.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:04.290
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:04.830
BEN ORLIN: Thank you, Max.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.100
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: You're welcome.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.970
BEN ORLIN: That's exactly right.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.650
I'll tell you, that's
an afternoon right

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.051
to make that happen.

00:12:09.051 --> 00:12:11.041
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:13.290
And then actually, recently,
so my first book came out

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.873
in September, and
I've got another one

00:12:14.873 --> 00:12:16.332
with the same
publisher coming out.

00:12:16.332 --> 00:12:17.914
We don't have the
publication day yet,

00:12:17.914 --> 00:12:18.970
but probably this fall.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.640
And so that's been
fun working on that.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.160
It's about calculus.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.560
So you know, the
mathematics of change.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.580
And the illustrations
are black and white,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.120
which actually I just
thought was kind of classy.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.250
I don't know.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.725
And I liked the
challenge of trying

00:12:32.725 --> 00:12:35.100
to-- because usually I rely
on color as kind of a crutch.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.470
It's like like, "look,
it's green and blue.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.669
And don't worry about
how poorly drawn it is."

00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:41.460
And so having to do it
with black and white

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.600
was fun to work on.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.442
Those are some of the
more recent drawings.

00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:45.150
I've got red too.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.649
You can see the bloodshot
eyes of the waiting child.

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:48.690
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah, no.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.900
The child really seems
to be in distress there.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.619
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:12:51.619 --> 00:12:52.910
Yeah, actually, I find myself--

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.700
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Very graphic.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.950
BEN ORLIN: Sometimes when
I'm drawing faces like that,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.810
I'll catch myself kind
of making the face.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.540
This is the level of
amateur artist I am.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.510
I can't actually draw a panicked
person without reminding myself

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.067
what panic feels like.

00:13:05.067 --> 00:13:06.650
Or maybe that makes
me a great artist?

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.420
I don't know.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.420
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: I bet a
lot of us would do that,

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.174
if we were drawing
panic like that.

00:13:11.174 --> 00:13:11.840
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.100
I like to think so.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.960
Anyway, yeah, those are
just some images that

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.000
span my whole artistic career.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.100
Which, I think if you
would tell my sisters,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.550
who have always known me as
an utterly incompetent artist,

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.310
the first time I had a blog post
that wound up at the Huffington

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.680
Post, they'd read it
on their homepage.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.110
And the byline they wrote
for me without asking me

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.020
was "writer and artist."

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.390
And my sisters both called
me within like 30 seconds.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.392
"What's with artist?

00:13:37.392 --> 00:13:38.350
What did you tell them?

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.766
What kind of lies
are you peddling

00:13:39.766 --> 00:13:42.000
to the Huffington Post?"

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.800
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
And sorry, what you

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.060
had written for the
Huffington Post did not

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.310
include a drawing at the time?

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.090
BEN ORLIN: That was
back in my photographs

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.160
of the whiteboard marker phase.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.650
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah, OK.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.130
BEN ORLIN: It was
those early days.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.300
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: OK, so
they were willing to bestow

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.470
that title on you.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.820
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, I think they--

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.653
I don't know what they
were reading into it.

00:13:55.653 --> 00:13:58.110
"Artist" was clearly a bit
of a lofty title for it.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.040
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Well,
and the Huffington Post

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.642
isn't your sister, so I
guess a little more lenient.

00:14:01.642 --> 00:14:02.850
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, that's fair.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.266
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: You've sort
of answered this a little bit,

00:14:05.266 --> 00:14:08.070
but if you had to really
focus in, what would

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.326
you say was your
inspiration for even just

00:14:10.326 --> 00:14:11.700
the blog, Math
with Bad Drawings?

00:14:12.264 --> 00:14:13.680
BEN ORLIN: Yeah,
It's interesting.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.080
I think my ambition
has maybe-- actually,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.062
even as the reach of
the blog has grown

00:14:18.062 --> 00:14:20.520
and I've gotten to do these
sort of exciting book projects,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.920
I think my ambition has
probably narrowed a bit.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.150
I think at the start--

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.482
I started the blog
when I was 24, 25.

00:14:27.482 --> 00:14:28.560
Yeah, 25.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.720
So I think at that
time I had this idea

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.050
that good writing
about mathematics

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.950
could really make it
totally accessible to people

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.730
for whom it was inaccessible.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.084
Yeah, it's hard for me to
climb back inside the mindset,

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:47.250
because I think now I tend
to take a little bit more

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.920
of a systemic view, and there's
a lot of big challenges in math

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.760
education.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.800
And a guy writing
cartoons is not

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.250
gonna transform
anything particularly.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.610
The way I think about
it now is, my goal

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.945
is to give people positive
experiences of mathematics.

00:15:01.945 --> 00:15:03.320
You know, whether
there's someone

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.480
who has a professional
relationship to mathematics,

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.230
or someone--

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.760
I mean, especially
people who don't

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.926
have that kind of relationship,
for whom mathematics

00:15:09.926 --> 00:15:14.360
was kind of a bane, and was a
difficulty in their schooling

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.010
years.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.860
Not that I expect my
drawings and my writing

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.550
to suddenly turn
them into Googlers,

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:27.440
but to maybe help them just
have a day of reconciliation

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.580
and have a couple
laughs with mathematics,

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.780
is how I think about it.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.480
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah, because
I guess they don't really--

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.104
you're not writing
a curriculum, you're

00:15:34.104 --> 00:15:36.939
just taking individual
one-off ideas.

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:37.980
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.900
And then there's brilliant
people out there, man.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.300
I know some people who
work on curricular stuff,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.290
and it's really
interesting to me.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.760
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
Curricular cartoons?

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.160
BEN ORLIN: Cartoons?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.760
That would be cool, man.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.500
No, no.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.874
Yeah, I don't know a lot people
doing that, but designing

00:15:47.874 --> 00:15:51.530
curriculum, and new Common
Core-aligned curricula.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.620
And that's really cool work,
and yeah, not what I'm doing.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.180
I'm just I'm just making jokes.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.060
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: So you mentioned
challenges in math education,

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.830
and you have
significant experience

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.770
in that area yourself.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.760
So what do you think are
current and important challenges

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.554
in math education?

00:16:05.554 --> 00:16:06.470
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.949
I mean, I think
definitely there's--

00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:10.490
probably a lot of
people in this room

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.140
have interesting
thoughts on this--

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.796
but how mathematics is
going to adapt to the fact

00:16:15.796 --> 00:16:18.170
that, in the last 20 years,
the technological environment

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.390
has completely transformed.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.790
Education tends to be
pretty slow moving, but not

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:23.810
infinitely slow moving.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.240
I think you already
see a bit of a shift

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.490
away from some of the
computational emphasis

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.060
in the younger grades.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.190
I'd say just middle schoolers,
it's not it's less about--

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.290
it was very important
when we were in school,

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.992
you had to learn to
divide a five digit

00:16:37.992 --> 00:16:39.200
number by a two digit number.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.075
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah.

00:16:40.075 --> 00:16:41.750
BEN ORLIN: And
they don't really.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.940
And honestly, it's not that--

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.590
this is a controversial
one, but I

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.330
don't think that's a
particularly important skill.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.829
I think being able to execute
the algorithm with a one digit

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:51.337
number, sure.

00:16:51.337 --> 00:16:53.420
Being able to estimate is
a really important skill

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.970
and probably a harder one than
executing a standard algorithm.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.600
So that's sort of one
general issue, I think,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.540
is how math education will
adapt to the new technological

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.104
environment.

00:17:03.104 --> 00:17:04.520
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
And are you saying

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.103
that it still is the
case that there's

00:17:06.103 --> 00:17:08.923
a big computational emphasis
when you're younger,

00:17:08.923 --> 00:17:11.089
and you think that's one
thing that needs to change?

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.210
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.670
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Or do you see
that change happening already?

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.545
BEN ORLIN: It's true.

00:17:14.545 --> 00:17:16.479
I mean, classrooms
are so diverse that I

00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:18.770
think there's still definitely
lots of classrooms where

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.064
teachers are teaching in
a pretty traditional way,

00:17:21.064 --> 00:17:22.730
and not really
acknowledging the reality

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.650
that we've all got a
calculator in our pocket,

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.650
and the calculator is
better than any calculator

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.030
you could get 20 years ago.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.700
And so there's two
different classrooms

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.100
where it's time to
update and acknowledge

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.890
that the set of skills
that's important has changed.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.156
But for any classroom
that has one problem,

00:17:43.156 --> 00:17:45.530
you can always find a classroom
with an opposite problem.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.600
So I'm always a
little wary of trying

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.060
to prescribe general solutions.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.060
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Prescribe screen
time and skipping the work.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.180
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.340
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: But I remember
that in elementary school,

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.840
they were always a
lot of people who

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.256
were very challenged by exactly
what you're talking about,

00:17:59.256 --> 00:18:01.270
by long division and
long multiplication.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.936
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:18:01.936 --> 00:18:04.430
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: It
was very frustrating.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.000
On a different tack, what
did your book writing process

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.040
like look like for "Math
with Bad Drawings"?

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.956
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.590
So the book is in five sections.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.756
The first one is sort of a
very general introduction

00:18:14.756 --> 00:18:17.390
to mathematics, and then the
next four each take you--

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.390
there's one on probability,
and one on geometry,

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.170
and one on statistics.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.000
And so basically, I was
teaching at the time.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.380
So I spent a few months
opening a document,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.540
and looking it over, and
changing three words here

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.290
or there, and fussing with it.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.949
So that was always
the way I'd written.

00:18:33.949 --> 00:18:35.990
Because before that, people
weren't really paying

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.529
me to write, and I just
could do it when I wanted.

00:18:38.529 --> 00:18:40.070
And then I did that
for a few months,

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.695
and then looked up
and was like, "Oh, I

00:18:41.695 --> 00:18:44.600
need to write a chapter
every four days now in order

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.130
to finish the book on time."

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.310
And what that meant is, I
started writing really fast.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.010
And luckily, that first
section of the book, I

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.420
got to fiddle with.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.760
And then the later sections
are much more modular.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.680
I had to, with a lot
help from my editor,

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.830
come up with basically spots
in the world, where you've

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.130
got useful mathematics
and mathematics that's

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.259
really low to the ground.

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:07.550
You don't need a chapter on
expected value or something

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.170
like that.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.160
Where you don't need
a lot of background

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.380
to access the mathematics.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.080
And then it was sort of,
got a few days per chapter

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.120
to kind dive in and
spend a day or two

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.275
doing background reading.

00:19:18.275 --> 00:19:20.150
Four days, it may have
been more like a week,

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.760
I guess, per chapter that I had.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.230
As I fell behind, I had to--

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.460
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: That still
sounds pretty overwhelming,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:25.959
though.

00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:27.547
BEN ORLIN: It felt
really fast, yeah.

00:19:27.547 --> 00:19:29.630
Yeah, I'm really happy
with how the book came out,

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.212
and certainly my publisher
does a really beautiful job

00:19:33.212 --> 00:19:34.670
designing the
physical book itself.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.940
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Mm-hmm.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.398
BEN ORLIN: But
yeah, so the process

00:19:37.398 --> 00:19:38.960
was very leisurely
at the beginning,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.877
and then a lot faster.

00:19:39.877 --> 00:19:41.793
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: And who's
the publisher again?

00:19:41.793 --> 00:19:43.669
BEN ORLIN: It's Black
Dog &amp; Leventhal,

00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:44.960
they're an imprint of Hachette.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.020
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: How long
did it take in total,

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.360
including both the
slow moving part

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.770
at the beginning of
the writing process

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:49.980
and finishing the final draft?

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.646
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:19:50.646 --> 00:19:54.410
Yeah, I guess we probably
got the book deal in October,

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.937
and then spent a few
months outlining.

00:19:56.937 --> 00:19:58.520
Then again, my editor
was really good.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.800
She pushed back on what I
think is a natural tendency.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.630
My degree is in
pure mathematics,

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.657
so I have a certain blithe
confidence that just like,

00:20:07.657 --> 00:20:09.490
"Oh yeah, prime numbers
are just interesting

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.780
for their own sake."

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.359
For some people, they are.

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:16.900
I think in my original outline
I had planned several chapters

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.970
on prime numbers and
then kind of hitting

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.990
RSA encryption at
the end of that,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.450
in very non-technical terms.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.840
And she was saying
for the sort of book

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.720
we're hoping to do,
lots of pure mathematics

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.780
with a payoff in
something fairly technical

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.130
wasn't really--

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.839
we want like lottery tickets.

00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:36.130
That's the kind of [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.500
Like, the Death Star
is another chapter.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.110
So I think orienting me back
towards stuff that was--

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.100
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Real
world stuff like that.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.640
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.720
Real world stuff
like the Death Star.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.220
Exactly.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.540
Really just concrete stuff
you run into every day.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.260
Yeah, so it was outlining
at the beginning, yeah,

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.660
and bouncing ideas back
and forth with my editor,

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.050
and then probably three
months or so mostly

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.310
working on that first section
at a fairly inefficient clip,

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.196
and then a pretty hasty
five months or so.

00:21:03.196 --> 00:21:05.570
I don't think those numbers
add up to the correct amount,

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.594
but, don't check.

00:21:07.594 --> 00:21:09.010
There's no way of
knowing, really.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.385
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: I don't think
I have a calculator nearby.

00:21:11.385 --> 00:21:13.390
BEN ORLIN: That's
exactly it, yeah.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.931
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Did
you find anything

00:21:14.931 --> 00:21:17.050
really surprising about
either the writing process

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.966
or the publishing process,
aside from the fact

00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:22.270
that a book mostly
about prime numbers

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.770
might not be right
for the audience?

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.770
BEN ORLIN: I was shocked
to find that that's not

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.870
something-- my editor, who's
has edited lots of pop science

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.130
books, but her background's
not in mathematics.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.254
So it turned out coming to
her with a proposal that

00:21:33.254 --> 00:21:37.510
was 1/3 about prime numbers
wasn't striking her fancy.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.210
Yeah, well, actually, I
just finished the manuscript

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.370
for the second book with
the same publisher now.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.210
I think both books have
really surprised me.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.150
I mean, it's just a
scale of writing project

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.097
that I hadn't done before.

00:21:48.097 --> 00:21:49.930
"Math with Bad Drawings"
actually pleasantly

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.670
surprised me,
because I was really

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.711
excited to get the
opportunity to write the book.

00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:56.200
I was like a little pessimistic
or a little skeptical

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.590
that I could write a
book I'd be satisfied

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.050
with that was about math.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.730
That struck me as
too broad a topic.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.650
Like, you wouldn't
hire a history teacher

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.380
to write a book about history.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.050
Just give us the
greatest hits of history,

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.200
just an overview of history.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.092
It's like too much?

00:22:14.092 --> 00:22:14.800
Or like, science?

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.780
You wouldn't be like, "Oh,
yeah, like science teacher, just

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.680
use science.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.400
Just cover it."

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.000
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
Isn't that like how

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.890
most of the textbooks
we had in middle school

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:21.927
were actually defined?

00:22:21.927 --> 00:22:22.885
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, right.

00:22:22.885 --> 00:22:25.010
I wouldn't call them great
pieces of literature.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.710
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: No, exactly.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.480
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, no.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:26.730
It's true.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.600
Yeah, most the
textbooks are like that.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.350
If you look at your pop
science shelf or something,

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.110
Mary Roach doesn't sit down
and write a book about science.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.255
She writes a book
about human digestion,

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:39.970
or she writes a
book about corpses.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.570
She has a really wacky
sense of what's exciting.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.910
But or like Stephen
Hawking, "Brief

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.310
History of Time," that's
a pretty sweeping topic,

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:53.117
but it's still not attempting
to do all of physics exactly.

00:22:53.117 --> 00:22:55.450
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: It was amazing
that you got all of math.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:55.910
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, that's it.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:56.993
It covers the whole thing.

00:22:56.993 --> 00:22:58.522
You won't find anything missing.

00:22:58.522 --> 00:22:59.980
Yeah, basically,
I mean, it's a bit

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.850
of like a magic-illusion
kind of trick

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.220
to make it feel like it's got
breadth while still having

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.110
enough depth in a few topics.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.570
I was basically
just surprised how

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.997
it came together to feel
like a cohesive package.

00:23:13.997 --> 00:23:15.580
Yeah, so I was very
pleased with that.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.372
With the second
book, I had a premise

00:23:17.372 --> 00:23:18.580
that I thought was brilliant.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.010
It was gonna go through
calculus and connect

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.781
each concept in calculus to
something in the humanities,

00:23:24.781 --> 00:23:26.530
to an author, or a
painter, or someone who

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.690
had played with the same ideas.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.250
Which I thought
was really clever,

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.020
and would have been
if there were people

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.730
in the humanities
who had done that

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.050
with every idea of calculus.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.190
It turned out I had like
three, and would have

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.650
made a pretty artificial book.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.510
So I spent maybe
four months writing

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.370
a draft of that,
and then basically

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.190
had to start from page 1,
because there were like three

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.170
or four chapters where
it fit perfectly,

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.560
and then others where I was
just trying to shoehorn together

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.300
things that didn't fit.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.650
So that one, that surprised me.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:54.820
I'm really happy
with the draft now.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.510
It's much more about
storytelling now.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.040
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
And this is the one

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.970
you showed "Change is
the Only Constant."

00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:59.870
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, "Change
the Only Constant."

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:00.110
Yeah.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.790
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Cool.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.331
One of the things
I wanted to jump to

00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:05.920
is, what would your readers
who haven't met you in person

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.599
find most surprising about you.

00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:08.140
do you think?

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.390
BEN ORLIN: There's
this weird asymmetry,

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.520
where, when I talk to
friends or family members who

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.340
read the book, they always say,
"Oh, it sounds just like you.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.990
That's exactly what-- the
page really captures you."

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.710
And when I meet people who know
the book and then they meet me,

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.390
they're like, "You're
really not what I expected.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.670
You're really nothing
like I was anticipating."

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.503
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: So what
were they expecting?

00:24:26.503 --> 00:24:28.370
BEN ORLIN: I don't know.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.330
I guess I'm more of a
writer than a performer.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.820
So I think probably
I come across as--

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.260
on the page, I
try to come across

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.190
as a very freewheeling, circusy,
joke-making kind of person,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.555
but I'm not.

00:24:40.555 --> 00:24:41.110
I don't know.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.170
I'm just kind of guy.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.580
So I'm not as much of
a performer in person.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.184
So I think that surprises
people a little bit.

00:24:49.184 --> 00:24:50.350
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Interesting.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:56.020
And also for readers of
your blog and your books,

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.957
what would you tell them you are
doing when you are not writing?

00:24:59.957 --> 00:25:01.540
BEN ORLIN: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.940
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Or
doing stuff like this?

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.550
BEN ORLIN: Right, exactly.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:03.720
I know.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.010
I'm just constantly--
I mean, I'm

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:05.640
just hanging out in here now.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.060
This is a really nice room.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.460
This will be my new hobby.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.320
Yeah, it's a little funny,
really, because I went from--

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.880
I mean, during the start
of my teaching career,

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.250
teaching was my day job,
and writing and cartooning

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.500
was sort of this
passion project hobby.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.780
And now when your
passion project hobby

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.450
becomes your professional
activity, it sort of leaves--

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.030
I'm in this weird
position now, where

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.780
I haven't taught in a
year and a half now,

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.140
and I'm really, really anxious
to get back to the classroom.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.390
There's so much energy
there in a way that

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.850
just being in a
coffee shop typing

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.850
is a little less electric than
being around young people who

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.930
are learning new things.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.530
So I think that's what--

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.490
yeah, that's the weird kind of
state that I'm in right now,

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.970
is having switched my
hobby and my day job.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:46.860
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: So you
just spend most of the rest

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.060
of your time wishing you were--

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.810
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, pining
for the classroom.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.820
Exactly, yeah.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.050
You know, I like reading a lot.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.490
Yeah, I try to read
eclectic, weird things,

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.530
because I want to write
weird, eclectic things.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.696
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: It seems
like a good practice, then.

00:26:00.696 --> 00:26:01.840
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.190
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Well, let's
jump to maybe some audience

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.480
and some Dory questions.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.745
Let's start with you.

00:26:08.745 --> 00:26:10.490
AUDIENCE: so, First
thanks so much.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.030
That was an awesome
demonstrations

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.094
of some illustrations.

00:26:14.094 --> 00:26:16.260
I thought the quote you
brought up from Andrew Wiles

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.840
was particularly moving and
interesting, and also relevant

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.060
for a lot of the work
that's done here too.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.780
And so as somebody who's
taught computer science

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.312
at the high school level, I was
wondering about that building

00:26:28.312 --> 00:26:29.395
up comfort and discomfort.

00:26:29.395 --> 00:26:31.020
A super important
skill for math,

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.820
super important skill
for other things.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.420
What pedagogical tactics do
you take both as a teacher

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.940
and as an author and
Illustrator to help instill

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.650
that sense into students?

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:44.610
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, I think
it's hard to instill

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.419
as an Illustrator-writer,
because it's

00:26:47.419 --> 00:26:48.960
kind of an inherently
passive medium.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.330
I'm not there in the
room with someone.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.380
As a teacher--

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.462
I mean, you can describe
stories like that as a writer,

00:26:55.462 --> 00:26:57.420
but it doesn't have the
same impact as actually

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.581
having the experience.

00:26:58.581 --> 00:27:00.330
As a teacher, there's
really no substitute

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.556
for just having students
in that situation.

00:27:03.556 --> 00:27:04.680
So coming up with problems.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.270
The sort of ideal,
right, is to have

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.420
a problem that has a low
barrier to entry, where

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.730
you can wrap your head
around what you need to do,

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.980
where there's some kind of
intrinsic excitement to it,

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.620
where you want the
solution to this puzzle.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.010
And then to let them
go, to not provide

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.710
answers, to not drop hints.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.450
There's this art.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.824
My sister is also
a math teacher,

00:27:24.824 --> 00:27:29.452
and she's really good at the
art of nonjudgmental "Uh-huh.

00:27:29.452 --> 00:27:29.952
Huh.

00:27:29.952 --> 00:27:31.424
Oh, yeah."

00:27:31.424 --> 00:27:33.090
Where some student
will propose an idea,

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.257
and you really don't wanna--

00:27:34.257 --> 00:27:36.256
I'm always tempted to be
like "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:36.256 --> 00:27:37.560
You're on the right track."

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.050
or "Uh, that's not
sounding good."

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:44.746
But to really cultivate just
the non-judgemental "OK, cool.

00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:45.870
That's an interesting idea.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.480
Tell me more about that."

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.670
I mean, this is always
what it comes down

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.580
to in education, is
what we spend time on

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.670
is what kids will
perceive that we value.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.617
So if it's 9 days out of
10 is sort of technique,

00:28:00.617 --> 00:28:02.700
and here's a technique and
now practice it, here's

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.870
a technique, now practice it.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.450
You know, that's an
important part of math,

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.949
but if that's 9
days out of 10, kids

00:28:06.949 --> 00:28:08.850
think that's 90% of the subject.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.180
And so it just takes
spending classroom time on,

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.310
here is a problem, and
you're gonna work on it.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.210
And you won't know
how to solve it,

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.850
and I'll try to give you some
models for thinking about it.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.400
I'll try to maybe do a
simpler example on the board,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.410
try to get a conversation going.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.240
But really just getting
students experience

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.997
with being in that space.

00:28:25.997 --> 00:28:28.080
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Thank you
for the in-depth answer.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.081
Can we show the Dory on
the screen for a second?

00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:32.330
The first question here, I
think, is very interesting.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.890
"How can we remove the stigma
in young children of 'math

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:35.580
is hard.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.100
I shouldn't bother, and anyone
actually good at it should be

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.800
beaten up'"?

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.966
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, I mean,
I'm not convinced that they

00:28:40.966 --> 00:28:42.036
shouldn't be beaten up.

00:28:42.036 --> 00:28:44.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.360
I don't know.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.650
There's a lot there.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:47.520
Math is hard.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.370
I mean, there's two
approaches to that.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.330
One is to say, "Oh, no.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.440
Math, yeah, it's fun.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.220
You can get along with it."

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.570
And then to say,
"Yeah, math is hard.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.111
That's kind of what's
cool about it."

00:28:56.111 --> 00:29:00.540
It stretches your mind, and it's
a chance to challenge yourself

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.810
and to dive into ideas that
will change the way you think.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.720
So I think that's one
where, as educators, you

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.430
want to own math as hard.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.895
You don't want to dismiss that.

00:29:09.895 --> 00:29:11.520
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: It's
OK that it's hard.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:11.980
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.400
Yeah, that's what's beautiful
about it, is that it's hard.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.140
I mean, if you think
about kids, things

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.720
that kids find
intrinsically exciting,

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.580
no one's like, "Well, soccer
is too hard or too easy."

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.380
You don't think about
it in those terms.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.338
To become a great soccer
player is really hard.

00:29:27.338 --> 00:29:31.200
To play a little soccer
is fun and not too hard.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.820
And it's just the activity
itself is motivating.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.840
When it comes to that
"I shouldn't bother,"

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.100
that's what it comes down to.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.830
Soccer and things like
guitar or musical instruments

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.300
are analogies I
think about a lot.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.716
Because those are
things that kids

00:29:46.716 --> 00:29:48.760
are inherently
excited about often.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.890
Not all kids, but
music and sport

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.010
are things that we can just
dive into and be excited about.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.950
And why isn't math one of
those things for most kids?

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.440
And I think it's pretty rare
to have a glimpse of what

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.960
doing great math looks like.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.970
I don't know when most
kids would see that.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.580
You can turn on the
TV and see soccer.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.130
You can turn on the-- not
radio, because it's 2019.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.010
But you know, turn on
whatever music app you use

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.640
and hear what great
guitar sounds like.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.720
But where do you
look for great math?

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.886
And so I think part of what
math education has to do

00:30:21.886 --> 00:30:23.737
is to show what does
really exciting,

00:30:23.737 --> 00:30:25.820
engaging, interesting
mathematical problem solving

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.980
to look like?

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.130
To show the exemplar of
what we're aiming at.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.680
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: It's a really
interesting problem to solve.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.846
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, because
it's such a technical field

00:30:34.846 --> 00:30:37.240
that it can be hard sometimes.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.604
Yeah, what is great
math to someone

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.770
who knows the background
is illegible to someone who

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.670
doesn't know the background.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:43.180
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Mm-hm.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.096
Let's take another
question from the audience.

00:30:45.096 --> 00:30:46.810
AUDIENCE: So I guess
you can boil down

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.510
my question is, how do you
answer that question yourself?

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:54.100
So I remember math from high
school being rote and boring,

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.102
and well, who really cares about
algebra 2 in the first place?

00:30:57.102 --> 00:30:58.060
BEN ORLIN: Right, yeah.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.350
AUDIENCE: And then math from
college and grad school being,

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.180
"Oh, look.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.460
Yeah, here's these theorems.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.460
There's 500 ways to prove it.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.910
Which way do you prove it?"

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:15.580
Do you try to bring that more
creativity and proof creation

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:20.400
into high school, or is that
even the tack you wanna take?

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.100
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:21.620
Yeah, no.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.786
It's a good question, right.

00:31:22.786 --> 00:31:24.340
So proof in
particular, I mean, you

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.210
ask because you're
already a mathematician.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.620
Proof is the heart of
the subject, right?

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.510
How do we move from
this Euclidean idea?

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.730
How do we move from
assumptions to conclusions?

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.610
The place it tends
to show up in the US,

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.645
your first encounter
often is geometry, where

00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:39.820
you do these two column proofs.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.910
I have not super
positive feelings

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:42.910
about two column proofs.

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:44.260
They tend to be--

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.800
it's a kind of artificial
way of setting them up.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.660
And also, you run
into the problem

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.600
that when you're developing
any axiomatic system,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.200
the early proofs are usually
very technical, and about

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.690
like just following out
from your definitions,

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.180
and it takes a while before
you get into the meat of it.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.290
So you know, if you
start with Euclid,

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.623
you've got these five really
simple postulates, and then

00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:07.900
the first few things you prove
just feel blindingly obvious

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.330
when you look at them.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.260
And so it's not a
great playground

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.530
for proof in that sense.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.640
It's weird to start your proof
experience by proving things--

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.830
what you learn is that
rather than proof helping

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.770
you understand things
that you didn't, proof

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.360
is when you get
confused about things

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.485
you thought you understood.

00:32:23.485 --> 00:32:24.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.520
Which isn't really the
message we wanna send.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.660
So how do you?

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.070
I think doing more
informal argument,

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.290
almost any mathematical
solution can

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.980
be presented as an argument,
something kind of like a proof.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.430
And I think doing that
much earlier with students

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.430
and much more frequently
and on problems

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.110
where it's not
blindingly obvious what

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:48.069
you're trying to prove.

00:32:48.069 --> 00:32:49.985
Because I think you need
to have a fair amount

00:32:49.985 --> 00:32:52.210
of informal experience
with mathematical argument

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.210
before you can appreciate
formal mathematical proof.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.710
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Let's look at
another question from the Dory

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:58.920
here, because this looks fun.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.530
Can you name some writing or
writers of popular mathematics

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.900
that you have been
inspired by or liked?

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.570
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, I
mean, definitely.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:09.972
I try to read as much as I
can in the popular math space.

00:33:09.972 --> 00:33:11.680
Yeah, there's been a
lot of really good--

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.130
So Simon Singh's Fermat's--

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.880
"Fermat's Enigma" was
the title in the US.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.350
"Fermat's Last
Theorem" in the UK.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.810
But that's one of the best
pop math books out there.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.520
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: The US
title sounds a lot better?

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.280
BEN ORLIN: "Fermat's Enigma"?

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:22.870
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:23.350
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, it's true.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.180
Yeah, enigmas more fun.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:24.610
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Mm-hmm.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:25.420
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, right.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.080
Theorem is not.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.220
Yeah, that's probably
why they changed it.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:27.700
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Yeah.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.200
BEN ORLIN: We're better at
marketing here in America.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.850
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Please go on.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.290
BEN ORLIN: So and then
other recent ones, I mean,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.240
Jordan Ellenberg has a book
called "How Not to Be Wrong,"

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.020
which is great.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.160
Steve Strogatz has a
book called "Joy of X,"

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:42.010
which is a really wonderful
ABC of mathematics, starting

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:43.900
from counting and
building toward some more

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.550
modern mathematics.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.384
Eugenia Chang has a
really fun book called--

00:33:47.384 --> 00:33:49.508
this is another one with
different titles in the US

00:33:49.508 --> 00:33:51.880
and UK, but I think "How
to Make Pi" in the US,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.040
where she's a category
theorist and explores

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.989
some analogies between
cooking and mathematics.

00:33:57.989 --> 00:33:58.780
Those come to mind.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.400
Biographies of mathematicians
are often good.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.316
Siobhan Roberts as a
biographer I really like.

00:34:02.316 --> 00:34:04.510
She wrote a good
biography of John Conway

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.420
called, "Genius at Play."

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.239
Martin Gardner is obviously
a master of the discipline.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.310
I mean, sort of
recreational mathematics.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.505
I've only read bits
of what he's written.

00:34:15.505 --> 00:34:17.227
I'm trying to
think of what else.

00:34:17.227 --> 00:34:17.810
Yeah, I mean--

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.250
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: This is a
long list, so it's helpful.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.794
BEN ORLIN: OK, well,
I'll stop there.

00:34:20.794 --> 00:34:22.210
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
But on that topic,

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.210
do you think that math is
generally getting more popular

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:25.989
these days?

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:26.560
What's going on there?

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.101
BEN ORLIN: Yeah,
there's definitely--

00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:31.562
I feel like there's a bit of
pop math or math popularization

00:34:31.562 --> 00:34:32.770
sort of Renaissance going on.

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.310
It probably goes along
with a renewed emphasis

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.379
on STEM communication.

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:38.920
That seems like
something also that--

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.520
I don't know if social media
lends itself to that, or just

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.499
the fact that visuals really
benefit science and math

00:34:46.499 --> 00:34:48.040
communication, and
now that we've all

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.290
got pretty good screens
around us all the time,

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.164
you can have these
beautiful visuals in a way

00:34:52.164 --> 00:34:54.610
that 30 years ago it was
actually a little harder.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.610
I mean, TV specials could
do it, but it was harder

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:02.840
as a random writer to
communicate with great visuals.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.570
Yeah, the visual is
probably part of it.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.570
I think YouTube is actually
a really good medium

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:07.537
for math too.

00:35:07.537 --> 00:35:09.120
I'm much more knowledge
about the book

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.190
side than the video
side, but there's

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.930
a lot of people doing
really good stuff.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.210
If any of you've come
across 3Blue1Brown,

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.091
he's a master of the form.

00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:18.840
His YouTube videos are
exceptionally good.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.980
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: I'll
have to check that out.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.000
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.810
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Looks like
we have another question

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:22.566
in the audience.

00:35:22.566 --> 00:35:23.940
AUDIENCE: One of
the math authors

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.940
that I really admire in
math education practitioners

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.410
is Paul Lockhart, who wrote
"A Mathematician's Lament."

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:30.076
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:35:30.076 --> 00:35:33.480
AUDIENCE: And in that book and
in some other earlier studies,

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.390
he commented on how we've got
this systemic problem in math

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:40.650
education, where people go
through primary education,

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.280
learn that math is
horrible and they hate it,

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.710
they become math teachers,
and they teach students

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.560
that math is horrible
and they hate it.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.930
Do you see other systemic level
ways to approach that problem

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.900
and break that cycle, other than
being a person who understands

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.810
a different perspective on
math and exemplifying that just

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:01.311
yourself?

00:36:01.311 --> 00:36:01.976
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:36:01.976 --> 00:36:03.562
Yeah, I mean,
Lockhart's "Lament," it

00:36:03.562 --> 00:36:05.603
was my first or second
year of teaching, I think,

00:36:05.603 --> 00:36:09.390
that I read it,
and it was such a,

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:14.070
like the blinding light of
that essay, I loved that essay.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.710
It opens with this
metaphor, where

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.560
he compares math education
to art education,

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.062
and has this whole extended
metaphor, where it's sort of--

00:36:22.062 --> 00:36:23.770
I'm not gonna remember
the details of it.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:24.160
But basically--

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.743
Oh, no, sorry.

00:36:24.743 --> 00:36:26.460
Music education first, I guess.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.830
So he compares math
education to music education,

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.710
and imagines a world in which
music education is mandatory

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.780
for everyone from K
through 12, and it

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:39.240
consists of transposing series
of notes into different keys,

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.520
and breaking up
things by measure

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.320
and figuring out
the time signature

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.620
from looking at sheet music.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.490
And you never hear any music,
you just look at sheet music

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.370
and manipulate sheet
music in various ways.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.510
Which is a really grim
metaphor for math education,

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.800
and not entirely wrong.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.060
I think I really admire
Lockhart's idealism.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.870
I think probably in
the last eight years

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.360
or whatever it's been since
I read that essay, I've

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.840
gotten a little more pessimistic
about the ability of just

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.210
an idealistic vision to
help transform mathematics

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.730
education, because I think in
particular one of the roles

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:15.920
it plays in education is as
a platform for competition.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.090
So in particular,
AP calculus is taken

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.550
by half a million students,
quarter million students

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.640
a year.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.820
It's a pretty common
thing to do in the US.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.210
I think it's driven largely by
the fact that to get admission

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:31.050
to a competitive college, it
really helps to do AP calculus.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.750
It's not as though calculus
teachers sat down and said,

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.130
let's make this a
competitive environment.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.090
It's that the economy has
some zero-sum elements to it.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.240
And for whatever reason, we
see math education and success

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.090
in math education as a
signal of competence.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.860
And so I think part of what
drives math education being

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.270
as occasionally dry and
disappointing as it is,

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.370
is that competitive
pressure, the fact

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:03.220
that students want a
platform on which to compete

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.620
so they can prove themselves.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.661
And once you have a platform
on which to compete,

00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:09.837
well, you want very
fair, objective tests.

00:38:09.837 --> 00:38:12.420
But once you're doing very fair,
objective, predictable stuff,

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.610
you've drained a lot
of life out of what

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.250
makes mathematics cool and fun.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.000
I don't know.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.330
I mean, the competitive
pressure isn't gonna go away.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.820
So to some extent, I
don't think there's

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.690
an easy fix for that other
than to move the competition

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:28.665
to some other platform.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:35.400
That's not a problem I feel like
I have any prescription for.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.380
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: That
was an eloquent summary

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.370
of the problem, though.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.250
So thank you.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.770
Why don't we take one more
question from the audience?

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.215
AUDIENCE: So one thing I've
noticed looking at your older

00:38:44.215 --> 00:38:46.590
drawings and your newer ones
is actually not the drawings

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.804
but the handwriting.

00:38:47.804 --> 00:38:50.220
The handwriting in your earlier
ones is really pretty bad,

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.650
and in newer ones, I can
read what they're saying.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:54.150
And I'm wondering
if you've switched

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.340
to using a font for this
or if your handwriting has

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.090
gotten better.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.420
BEN ORLIN: No, no.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.590
I switched to using a font.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.920
Yeah, for the book they--

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.350
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Oh, can we
look at the examples again?

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:02.760
BEN ORLIN: Sure, yeah.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.630
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Were the
examples present in the slides?

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:05.550
BEN ORLIN: It should
be there, yeah.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.200
AUDIENCE: The more recent
ones in the slides.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.408
Like that one, that one's OK.

00:39:08.408 --> 00:39:10.052
But once you start
using sharpies.

00:39:10.052 --> 00:39:11.010
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, right.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.060
There's no text in that one.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.060
AUDIENCE: Like that,
that's pretty hard to read.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.040
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, that
is tough to read.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.470
And then you're right,
also pretty tough to read.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.656
And then if you go to the
current ones, still not great.

00:39:22.656 --> 00:39:24.780
It was actually for the--
that's still handwriting.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.059
Yeah, so this is the font now.

00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:26.850
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Ah.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.040
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
maybe, Ben, put some work

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.760
into figuring this out.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.470
A different kind.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.070
BEN ORLIN: Absolutely.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.180
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: You
didn't make this font?

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.560
BEN ORLIN: It was a
very cool experience.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.120
My publisher told
me, actually, they

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.245
needed a font for the book.

00:39:37.245 --> 00:39:40.037
Because you can't-- the things I
learned about publishing that I

00:39:40.037 --> 00:39:41.620
probably should have
known in advance,

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.165
you can't just submit
handwritten scrawl.

00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:47.800
They're like, "We need
to copy edit this.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.960
We might translate it.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.090
We need to provide
files to people.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.530
We can't just take your scrawl.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:54.336
That's not gonna work."

00:39:54.336 --> 00:39:55.710
So what they did
is, they sent me

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:59.580
to a man named [? Chenk, ?]
who lives in the Twin Cities.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.380
He must have a last name, but
I know him only as [? Chenk. ?]

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.357
And he had me draw, like write
the alphabet a couple of times,

00:40:06.357 --> 00:40:07.690
and write some other characters.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.010
He threw in some
Greek letters for me.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:09.910
I got to write Greek letters.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.326
And that's if I
can figure out how

00:40:11.326 --> 00:40:13.697
to make that happen
in my word processor.

00:40:13.697 --> 00:40:15.280
And he turned it
into this lovely font

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.250
that looks like my
handwriting, but is way better.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.490
MAX BLUM-CAMPO:
That's really cool.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:22.950
How much does
[? Chenk ?] charge?

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.890
Is it something I
can do for myself?

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:26.848
BEN ORLIN: Yeah. yeah,
you could if you wanted.

00:40:26.848 --> 00:40:29.420
Yeah, I mean, it's not
cheap, but it's affordable.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.110
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: All
right, [? Chenk. ?]

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.950
So I have one last
question, which is, is there

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.491
anything in particular
that you think

00:40:34.491 --> 00:40:36.640
Googlers should learn
from your writing

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.734
or maybe from your experiences?

00:40:38.734 --> 00:40:39.400
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.524
No, that's a good question.

00:40:40.524 --> 00:40:43.280
I mean, I probably have a
lot more to learn from--

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.030
I mean, I always enjoy
talking to Googlers

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.426
and hearing how
things work here.

00:40:47.426 --> 00:40:49.300
I mean, the thing I've
been doing, especially

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.490
with these two books,
is figuring out ways

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.190
to write about a very
technical subject in very

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.182
non-technical ways.

00:40:55.182 --> 00:40:56.140
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Mm-hmm.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.690
BEN ORLIN: And the basic
reason being that, technicality

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.920
is often a barrier to entry.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:05.560
You know, people run into the
dense symbolism of mathematics,

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.520
and people just bounce
off and go away.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.390
And so yeah, thinking
about how to communicate

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:20.440
about complex technical
things in clear and easily

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.620
transmitted ways, I mean, that's
the role of any kind of math

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.610
or science popularizer, I guess.

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:28.450
But I think the tools that math
and science popularizers come

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.820
up with might be useful
in an environment

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.982
where you guys all have
the technical background,

00:41:32.982 --> 00:41:34.690
but also there's
still-- even for someone

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:35.980
with the technical
background-- it's slower

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.720
to read a technical
document than to read

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.727
a non-technical summary.

00:41:40.727 --> 00:41:42.310
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Like
what you've done.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.120
BEN ORLIN: Yeah.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.710
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: Well, thank
you so much for taking the time

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.067
to come here and talk to us.

00:41:46.067 --> 00:41:46.900
BEN ORLIN: Yeah, no.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:46.990
Thank you.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.268
It's been really fun.

00:41:47.268 --> 00:41:48.280
MAX BLUM-CAMPO: About
your writing experience

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.547
and your teaching experience.

00:41:49.547 --> 00:41:51.880
And I think it's been really
enlightening for all of us,

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.312
so yeah, thank you very much.

00:41:53.312 --> 00:41:54.520
BEN ORLIN: All right, thanks.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.270
