00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:09.675
- HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO THE FIFTH ANNUAL MEETING

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.644
OF THE TALLAHASSEE
BLACK REPUBLICANS.

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.713
NOW, I'M PISSED!
all: MM-HMM.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:15.715
- ROYALLY PISSED!
all: MM-HMM.

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:20.720
- LAST NOVEMBER, BARACK OBAMA
WAS RE-ELECTED PRESIDENT,

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:24.057
AND THE BLACK VOTE
WENT ALMOST ENTIRELY TO HIM!

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.125
[crowd murmuring]
- DAGNABBIT.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:29.228
- WE'RE NOT GETTING
OUR MESSAGE OUT, OBVIOUSLY.

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:32.532
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
IS AND SHOULD BE

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.234
THE ONLY HOME FOR BLACK VOTES.
- YES, SIR.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:39.238
- NOW, PEOPLE THINK THAT
BLACK VOTERS ARE A MONOLITH.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.740
[scoffs]
WE'RE NOT A MONOLITH.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.442
- WHAT? WHAT?
- NO, WE'RE NOT.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.343
- IN FACT,
BLACK REPUBLICANS ALONE

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.245
ARE AN EXTREMELY DIVERSE
GROUP OF PEOPLE.

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:47.847
[crowd murmuring agreement]

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.615
NOW, TO SPEAK MORE
ON DIVERSITY,

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:54.287
I PRESENT TONIGHT'S SPEAKER,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.354
MR. DOUGLAS JACKSON.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:01:01.327
[applause]

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.234
[applause ends abruptly]

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.337
- NOW, I'M NOT GONNA
SUGARCOAT IT, I'M PISSED!

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.338
[crowd murmuring agreement]

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.574
I'M ROYALLY PISSED.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:17.710
THE LIBERAL MEDIA
THINKS THAT REPUBLICANISM

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.545
IS NOT FOR BLACK PEOPLE.
all: MM.

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:22.748
- NOW, YOU TELL ME, WHAT
ABOUT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY,

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.618
A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE,
AND A LIMITED GOVERNMENT

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:28.287
IS UNAPPEALING
TO BLACK PEOPLE?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.556
WE'RE NOT A MONOLITH!
all: MM-MMM.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.892
- WE COME IN ALL DIFFERENT
SHAPES AND SIZES.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:34.594
- WE DO.
all: MM-HMM!

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:36.596
- NOW, WHO HERE WOULD LIKE
TO COME UP TO THIS PODIUM

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.332
AND SPEAK ABOUT THE DIVERSITY
AMONGST BLACK REPUBLICANS?

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.167
- [clears throat]

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.768
- OH.
[chuckles]

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.337
GENTLEMEN,
WE HAVE A REAL TREAT TODAY,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.173
A GENTLEMAN
WHO IS A LITTLE BIT ECCENTRIC,

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:50.810
A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE OF THE BOX,
IF YOU WILL,

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:53.379
BUT I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER PERSON TO SPEAK

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.781
ON DIVERSITY
AMONGST BLACK REPUBLICANS

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:56.715
THAN THIS GENTLEMAN
RIGHT HERE.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.618
ALL THE WAY FROM ORLANDO,
MY GOOD FRIEND,

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.186
ARTHUR WASHINGTON!

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.590
[applause]

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:05.892
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.194
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.763
[applause]

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:11.831
[applause ends abruptly]

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:12.932
- THANK YOU
FOR THE INTRODUCTION,

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:13.900
BROTHER DOUGLAS.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.701
- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,
BROTHER ARTHUR.

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:17.170
- MM-HMM.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.805
HOWEVER, I AM...
PISSED.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:20.840
[crowd murmuring agreement]

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.608
ROYALLY PISSED.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:23.809
- INDEED, INDEED!
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.244
- DEMOCRATS THINK
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:26.913
TO ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.014
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.683
WE ARE NOT A MONOLITH.
[crowd murmuring agreement]

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:34.820
DEMOCRATS MAY BE COOL,
BUT THEY AIN'T PRACTICAL.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:35.955
- THERE YOU GO.
[crowd murmuring agreement]

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:37.924
- REPUBLICANS
ARE PRACTICAL.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:40.826
BLACK PEOPLE
ARE PRACTICAL!

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.596
COME TO THINK OF IT...
- GET THOSE PANTS.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.965
- I THINK BLACK REPUBLICANS
ARE PRETTY COOL.

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:47.366
[crowd murmuring agreement]
- HEAR, HEAR, HEAR, HEAR.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.901
- NOT TO MENTION
VERY DIVERSE.

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.369
- THERE WE GO. MM-HMM.
[door opens]

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.805
- EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:55.675
SOMEONE'S WHITE WIFE
IS HERE TO PICK THEM UP.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.744
[all murmuring]

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:00.546
- WAS HER NAME EMILY?

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.448
- UH, SHE WAS WHITE.
- OH, GREAT, THAT'S--
