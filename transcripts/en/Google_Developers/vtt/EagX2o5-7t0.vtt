00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.315
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Hello, and
welcome to Public Speaking Pro

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:13.170
Tips with Speechless,
presented by Google Developers.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.870
We help people turn the
mundane into the memorable.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.720
ARJITA SETHI: Challenges
into insights.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.136
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
And presentations

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:20.106
into performances.

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:21.980
ARJITA SETHI: Today
we'll deal with something

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.210
called the illusion
of the first time.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.670
It's what great
speakers do to help

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.280
make the presentation feel
fresh and exciting every time

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.822
you watch it.

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:35.363
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Even if it's
the 50th time you're seeing it.

00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:37.710
ARJITA SETHI: So let's jump
in with tip number one.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.780
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
The speed through.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.420
You're going to run through
your talk as quickly as you can.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.544
ARJITA SETHI: That's right.

00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:44.590
Tempo, tempo, tempo.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.370
This can help you hear your
presentation anew and also find

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.020
any pattern that you
may have fallen into,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.635
whether positive or negative.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.010
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Sometimes we get

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.050
caught in a rut around
how to say each line,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.350
and that can often lead to a
flat or mechanical performance.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.610
We start predicting the rhythm
and anticipating our next line

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.360
before we've delivered
the prior one.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.150
ARJITA SETHI: The
speed through forces

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.420
you to try your talk in
a new tempo, which can

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.951
lead to unexpected discoveries.

00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:14.200
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Maybe a new
way to phrase a sentence,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.110
or a desire to
take a deep breath.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.750
ARJITA SETHI: And it will
help you to stay in the moment

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.944
when you switch back
to the standard tempo.

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:23.360
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
The speed through

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.100
forces you to try your talk
in a new tempo, which can

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.260
lead to unexpected discoveries.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.610
Maybe a new way
to phrase an idea

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.370
or a desire to take deep breath.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.995
And it will help you
stay in the moment

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:32.840
when you switch back
to the standard tempo.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.452
ARJITA SETHI: Wow.

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:35.660
CLAIRE SLATTERY: No big deal.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.340
ARJITA SETHI: Let's move
on to tip number two.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.964
Give your talk character.

00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:41.630
CLAIRE SLATTERY: So
let's do an exercise

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.161
we call three through the door.

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.660
You're going to
take the first three

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.920
lines of your presentation.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.045
We'll take the first three
lines from the beginning

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:48.640
of this video.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.210
And then you're going to walk
through an imaginary revolving

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.390
door three times in character
and perform those opening

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.940
lines as that character.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.640
Arjita will demonstrate.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.072
How about for this first
one, do it as a five year.

00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:00.780
ARJITA SETHI: OK.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.040
(IN TODDLER VOICE) Hello and
welcome to Public Speaking Pro

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.960
Tips with Speechless,
presented by Google Developers.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.630
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Now
try it as a zombie.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.265
ARJITA SETHI: OK.

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:20.985
(IN ZOMBIE VOICE) Hello, and
welcome to Public Speaking Pro

00:02:20.985 --> 00:02:25.150

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.090
[ROARING NOISES]

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.670
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And
this time as a princess.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.430
ARJITA SETHI: OK.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.080
(IN A GENTLE VOICE) Hello.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.070
And welcome to Public Speaking
Pro Tips with Speechless,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.146
presented by Google Developers.

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:43.270
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Fantastic.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.146
ARJITA SETHI: Thanks!

00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:46.561
CLAIRE SLATTERY: The key is
to quickly go through the door

00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.620
and make a bold choice.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.911
Now we're not saying that
you should do your whole talk

00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.090
as a zombie, but giving yourself
a character to do your talk in

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.920
can eliminate moments that you
may have skipped past before.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160
ARJITA SETHI: Not to
mention it's a lot of fun.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.300
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And
if you're having fun,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.150
then your audience is
going to have fun too.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.733
ARJITA SETHI: So
we've given it tempo.

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:03.870
We've given it character.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.080
What's left, Claire?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.496
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Tip number three.

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:07.350
Give it emotion.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.849
ARJITA SETHI: So
let's try something

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.905
we call emotional
roller coaster.

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:17.570
Think of the stage or room or
set as three different zones.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.410
CLAIRE SLATTERY: This
will be zone one.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.910
This is zone two.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.940
And all the way over
here is zone three.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.060
ARJITA SETHI: Now
we're going to assign

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.650
each zone a different emotion
and have Claire jump back

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.730
and forth between all of them.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.310
It's a lot of fun.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.070
Zone one will be excitement,
zone two will be anger,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.450
and zone three will be fear.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.062
And let's start with zone one.

00:03:44.062 --> 00:03:45.520
CLAIRE SLATTERY:

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.780

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.560
We help people--

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.670
ARJITA SETHI: Zone three.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.730
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
(SHAKILY) Turn the mundane

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.860

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.819

00:04:00.318 --> 00:04:01.380

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.080
ARJITA SETHI:
Excellent work, Claire.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.110
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Thanks!

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.640
ARJITA SETHI: This
exercise helps

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.965
to remind you that emotions
are a powerful part

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:13.550
of every presentation.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.399
And until you find
the exact emotion,

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.300
sometimes it's helpful
to just try random ones

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.339
and have fun with it.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.130
CLAIRE SLATTERY: In
all of these exercises,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.170
you're creating healthy
pathways in your brain

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.670
around giving presentations.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.040
And that's what we call--

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.934
TOGETHER: Improv thinking.

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:30.100
ARJITA SETHI: A quick recap.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.364
We have tip number one,
give your talk tempo.

00:04:33.364 --> 00:04:35.780
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Tip number
two, give your talk character.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.990
ARJITA SETHI: And
finally, tip number three,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.144
give your talk emotion.

00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:41.310
