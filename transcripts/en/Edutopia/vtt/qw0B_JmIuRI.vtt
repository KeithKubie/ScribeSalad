00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Luckily, I have
always had an artsy side and, so,

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.972
I continue to explore other
outlets and interests.

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:08.975
&gt;&gt;Darling-Hammond: The most important
thing from an educator's perspective is

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:12.898
to create opportunities for
teachers to know children well

00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:15.752
and understand what they're
experiencing.

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:21.362
So, we need a school environment in
which the children are being listened to

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:25.595
and their experiences are
being lifted up and sought out.

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:31.374
The more we allow rich experiences
and affirming relationships to be part

00:00:31.374 --> 00:00:34.359
of the educational environment,
the more people's brains grow.

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:43.093
&gt;&gt;Student: The last for years
have been highs and lows.

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:43.852
&gt;&gt;Brown: Senior talks are one

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:45.369
of my favorite traditions
here at Codman Academy.

00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:51.408
&gt;&gt;Our students get up on stage and talk

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:53.075
about who they are and
how they developed.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:58.515
You talk about the ways in which you as
a student have grown over time at Codman

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:02.498
and explain why you should
be ready to graduate.

00:01:02.498 --> 00:01:06.421
&gt;&gt;Javaun: The three most important
parts of my life is, number one, family;

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.856
number two, friends; and,
number three, basketball.

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:12.989
Basketball has kept me from making
poor choices, like skipping school--

00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:17.940
&gt;&gt;I would go through some challenges,
but when I play basketball all I think

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.122
about is all the new people I'm meeting
and the new experience I'm having.

00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:25.606
&gt;&gt;I've learned that dedication
and collaboration are crucial.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:29.788
I keep pushing forward to make everyone
in my family proud, especially my mom.

00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:39.681
&gt;&gt;Darling-Hammond: Particularly in a
diverse society like the United States,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.388
a good environment is a culturally
competent one in which the experiences

00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:50.072
that children bring from
different backgrounds are respected

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:53.496
and acknowledged and
supported and shared

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:58.117
so that people understand each other
and how they experience the world.

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:00.792
&gt;&gt;Sheriaha: Honestly, I can say I
have lived a pretty decent life.

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:03.967
I have love from my family and,
most importantly, I love myself.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.802
Sadly, great times do not last forever.

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:10.964
&gt;&gt;It felt like you're
writing a diary entry, like,

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.381
you're just pouring everything out.

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:14.238
&gt;&gt;I did not want to feel the pain alone

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:15.935
so I made sure everyone
else felt it, too.

00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:21.415
&gt;&gt;It felt good to look back and
know this was what was stopping me

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:23.941
and this was what made
me act out in school.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.135
&gt;&gt;I started to realize that no one had
my back and supported me like my mother.

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:30.040
I am glad I went through
what I went through.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.455
You hate every second of the
pain you have to deal with,

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:34.422
but when you look back
you become grateful for it

00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:37.266
because your experiences, good or
bad, shape you into who you are.

00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:44.374
&gt;&gt;I let go of the pain.
Yeah. I let go of the pain.

00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:48.626
&gt;&gt;My advice to the community is
do not let anything that is meant

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:49.914
to tear you down, tear you down.

00:02:49.914 --> 00:02:54.176
Do not give the past the key
to your future. Thank you.

00:02:59.237 --> 00:03:02.321
&gt;&gt;Brown: It is not enough to say,
"This is what's hard about the world."

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.083
We need to educate our children to
go and change things in the world.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.163
&gt;&gt;Javaun: I think I'm walking away
from this experience with the ability

00:03:12.163 --> 00:03:16.296
to share more and be vulnerable.

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:19.510
&gt;&gt;Brown: We want our students
to be able to explain the ways

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.644
in which their journey has helped
them be comfortable in who they are,

00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:25.439
confident about who they are, so
that when the world comes for them,

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.897
they are ready to also
come to the world.
