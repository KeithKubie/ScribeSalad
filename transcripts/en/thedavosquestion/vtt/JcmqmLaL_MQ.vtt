Hello everyone. My name is Mohammed Barry,
I'm from New Gandhi. I am a young person living

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:12.889
with HIV for 11 years. My concern about this
World Cup next year is that whether the jobs

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.039
being initiated will be sustained and where
those people will not be put in risk because

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.520
right now we are in crisis and we talk about
[inaudible] crisis and I'm so concerned. If

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.630
this bridge [inaudible] has not been completed.
How about the jobs that are already been in

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.640
place and people have hopes and I tell them
hoping that their parents will bring something

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.840
that will sustain throughout their lives.
That's my concern about it. And I know with

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.329
regards to HIV I don't to become [inaudible]
around the world bringing HIV prevention to

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.559
those that are living with HIV. But I'm just
asking where South Africa has these strategies

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.250
to make sure that there money to their people
[inaudible] one of the countries with the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.590
highest prevalence around the world. I'm just
asking whether you have the strategy to make

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.220
sure that your prevalence doesn't go higher
than what you are right now. Thank you.
