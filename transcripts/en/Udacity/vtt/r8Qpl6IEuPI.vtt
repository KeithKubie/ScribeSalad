00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.010
So we've been talking about
security planning and management.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.170
There are many sort of different
pieces that make up this whole process

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.760
of planning and
then managing the security.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.370
How do we bring it all together?

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.750
If you're going to go explain
this to someone in a few minutes.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.890
What are the things you
should be talking about.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.330
Well first of all you're
going to say that

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.200
there are things that are of
value which are at risk.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.430
Maybe your reputation,
maybe your intellectual property,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.540
there are assets that are of
value which are at risk.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.560
So then you're going to talk about the
risk comes from certain threats sources.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.360
Not only there are bad guys out there.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.540
Of course, we have certain
vulnerabilities, those are the attack

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.570
vectors, that's why those threat
sources would be able to do us harm.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.000
That's why we need to worry about,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.430
the risk comes from the fact, not just
because we have something of value, but

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.120
that thing could be harmed or
could be breached.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.250
So the threats and attack vectors,
really talking about threats and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.280
vulnerabilities.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.379
Together they come together,
result in an attack.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.690
So an attack then leads to a breach.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.170
And that's where we have
the adverse consequences.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.390
So if we have that, we have to talk
about things that are of value.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.370
We have to talk about threats.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.930
These two are the reasons that help us
explain that there is something at risk.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100
And the amount or
level of risk that we may have.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.730
And the way to manage that
risk is to plan for security,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.740
implement whatever controls that
are meaningful, and then sort of manage

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.770
that in terms of controls, people,
processes and things like that.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.520
And all that has to be done, again,
this control that we're talking about,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.240
of course we're going to
look at the cost.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.890
The benefits they offer?

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.260
What impact they have?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.820
How user friendly they are?

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.090
Things like that.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.410
So we have to sort of look into
the controls that we have,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.210
what their effectiveness is.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.550
Then we have to identify people.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.020
It's their job to worry about security.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.240
We have to empower them to do it.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.510
They have to have the budget,
they have to be able to have

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.170
policies that can be enforced and
things like that.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.288
And people have to be held
responsible and accountable.

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:10.949
Because we know that
something was wrong.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.510
They should be called to
answer what exactly happened.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.540
And no matter how well you do that, we
have to plan for something going wrong.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.410
And when something goes wrong,
a response is going to be needed.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.000
Remediation has to happen.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.680
There shouldn't be any surprises.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.030
We should be prepared and
have a plan in place saying if something

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.270
bad were to happen, this is how
we're going to respond to it.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.822
Of course, people as we said, need to
be aware of the importance of security.

00:02:38.822 --> 00:02:42.135
The guiding principals, the do's and
don'ts, all the things we

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:46.295
were talking about under security
policy so we need to think about that.

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:50.305
And finally we need to understand and
people have to recognize

00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:55.100
that a proactive option is what gets
you ahead of the threats in some sense.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.970
Threats change continuously.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.750
If you're just going to be in reactive
mode something new is going to come and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.210
hit you and you're going to suffer the
same sort of thing that you did before.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.420
So proactively addressing the risk and
the threats and the vulnerabilities and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.470
having a champion to do that is another
part of this security planning and

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.080
management that we're talking about.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.205
Overall understand what is of value,
why there's risk to it

00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:24.715
which is the threats and
the vulnerabilities we're talking about.

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:29.565
And then plan, implement, manage,
and do that all proactively.

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:32.845
That's sort of bringing it all together
when it comes to security planning and

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:33.345
management
