00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.820
 If I could send a video to my 16-year-old self 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.490
 (huh) I would send her so much wisdom 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.877
 1: put your needs ahead of others 

00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:09.660
 16 year old Anna, I know it's tough 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.938
 because you are so romantic 

00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:13.826
 but for hell, give yourself some love 

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:15.168
 Or else 

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:16.960
 Ask, you, another person 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.576
 to give you all that approval and love 

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:20.202
 you need to work 

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.988
 and it's not only unreasonable for him, 

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.006
 but it is a "co-dependent" relationship with you 

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:26.364
 for the next decade 

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:28.764
 "co-dependent" relationship after "co-dependent" relationship. 

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.595
 So let's not learn it, the hard way. 

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:31.814
 Time travel, come on! 

00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:33.694
 2: I always have hair problems 

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:36.174
 because, I felt like, my hair is flat and dull, 

00:00:36.214 --> 00:00:38.254
 and if I stick close to my face, I look like a nun. 

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:39.419
 What the hell! 

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:41.609
 What you do is: you take 3 to 4 sections 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:42.759
 or maybe 2 to 3 

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:44.389
 you double them, spray them 

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:45.839
 you take the pages, you toupere, 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.919
 you spray, you do it 

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:49.109
 and eventually you curl it 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.499
 And it looks like a million 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.529
 3: Don't take other girls down. 

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:54.737
 Stop hating other girls. 

00:00:54.737 --> 00:00:57.639
 Stop feeling threatened, insecure and jealous 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:59.877
 because it just gets in the way 

00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:02.707
 to know a really cool person 

00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.797
 You know, nobody can be you 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:05.969
 No one is you 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.649
 So it really doesn't make sense to feel some kind of competition. 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.009
 I'd rather go up to a girl and say: 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.269
 "Oh my gosh! I fucking love you! All this" 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.799
 "I don't know you, but I love you!" 

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:20.789
 Instead of being like (slander) 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.199
 Because, really? 

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:24.039
 THE? What the hell is that"? 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.489
 "THE"? is not getting to know another person 

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.309
 "IT? S:" I miss all kinds of amazing girlfriend dates 

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:31.499
 where we could have dinners and cocktails 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.169
 and "farmer" and having fun 

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:34.779
 and one with whom I could have a lifelong friendship 

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:36.269
 someone who really cares about me " 

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:37.925
 Then 16 year old Anna 

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:40.001
 get together! 

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.109
 And love other girls because they are fucking cool 

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.669
 4: Go for what you want 

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:48.349
 Do not be afraid 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.519
 No one can go after your career for you. 

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:54.329
 No one can maintain your relationship, 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.089
 or your friends, or ask that guy out for you. 

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:58.879
 Who cares about you? Be brave! 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.879
 You don't want to lie on your deathbed and be #repletters 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.509
 You will lie on your deathbed: 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.536
 "YES! I do everything I want 

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:10.306
 and if I couldn't, I tried " 

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:13.076
 And lastly: Make belts out of love 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.450
 It's something I focus on in therapy, 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.720
 and if you are not in therapy, you should be in therapy, 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.210
 because we have all our problems in life, 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.350
 But, I've spent a lot of my life making decisions based on what I was afraid of. 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.100
 and it was not good for me 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.900
 and it was not good for the people in my life, 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.580
 so now this is something I would like to try to change. 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.800
 I will make decisions that are best for those I care about 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.940
 including myself 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.630
 Be happy. Take off and travel. 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.500
 See the world. Say yes to people 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.230
 Meet friends. Remember to exercise. 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.904
 Drink water. Take your vitamins 

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:42.224
 Respect your body. Respect your mind 

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.524
 Adopting all your animals you find it sensible to take care of. 

00:02:45.524 --> 00:02:47.100
 Don't be so hard on yourself 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.809
 Keep being cool, Gotham 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.477
