00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.210
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington DC.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.040 position:66%
&gt;&gt; But also, as you may know, this program
is part of a series of webinars connected

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.800 position:73%
with the Library's exhibition, Echo's of the
Great War, American Experiences of World War I,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.510 position:69%
which is on view here through January, 2019.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.300 position:72%
Today's presentation will last
approximately 30 minutes, with time after that

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.970 position:59%
for our presenter to answer questions.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.100 position:73%
You can communicate with me and with
Katherine Blood, our presenter by the Chadwell,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.450 position:69%
and unfortunately it looks like not with
your [inaudible], as I said before we began,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.610
you're welcome to send me a
note and I'll share it out.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.680 position:66%
I'll collect questions as well for
Katherine on the chat and we'll share them

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.160
with her at the end of the session.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.750 position:59%
So, please think about what you'd like
to ask her as the session goes on.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.210 position:73%
We will post the recording of this presentation

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.900
to the Library's website once it
has been captioned, and with that,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.330 position:59%
I will introduce Katherine, so today's
presenter is curator Katherine Blood,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.710 position:63%
who works with the Library's world class
collection of artists prints, drawings,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.180
and posters in its Prints
and Photographs Division.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.290 position:75%
And Katherine, that makes you the presenter now.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.560
Her exhibition and publications
projects have specialized in modern

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.040 position:63%
to contemporary graphic art by
American, Hispanic and Japanese artists.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.710 position:69%
Today's webinar is based on a public gallery
talk that Katherine gave earlier this year

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.220
as part of our programing
for the Echoes exhibit.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.090
Katherine, thank you so much
for leading today's webinar.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Naomi and to
everyone joining us today.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.380 position:73%
As Naomi mentioned, today's discussion is based

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.380 position:72%
on a gallery talk I gave earlier this year
focusing on one particular World War I drawing

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.630 position:61%
by artist, Joseph Pennell, and we'll
be looking closely at this in a minute,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.090 position:63%
but let's start by thinking a little bit
about visual communication at the time.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.460 position:73%
When the U.S. entered the war on April 6, 1917,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.430
there was a thriving visual
culture in full swing.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.810 position:67%
For example, images were circulating widely
in illustrated magazines and newspapers

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.300
and photography was well
established by this time with more

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.740
and more people taking pictures
with their own personal cameras.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.170 position:73%
But World War I marked another notable leap
forward in the history of visual communication,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.130 position:66%
and this was thanks in large part to the
extraordinary proliferation of war posters

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.200 position:64%
and other images made by some of the best
artists of the day, and also the volume

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.930
at which they were produced and
ways they were disseminated.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.500
On screen are some examples from
the Library's extensive collection

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.320
and you can see they were tilted
at getting audiences to feel,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.500 position:73%
respond and act or participate in various ways.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.460 position:64%
And while many of the images appeal to
notions of patriotism, honor and courage,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.280 position:70%
others tap into fear and hatred of the enemy.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.530
Some of the major recurring
themes include recruitment,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.780
like the first several examples
here in the top row.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.950 position:72%
Also, bond drives to raise funds in support of
the war, home front service and various forms

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.200 position:66%
of troop support from knitting to donating
books for soldier's camp libraries.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.520 position:70%
That's one of my favorites in the second row,
the second one in, by Charles Buckles Falls.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.650 position:64%
And you can explore over 1,900 World War
I posters in the Library's online catalog

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.380 position:61%
and we'll show you where you can search
for and study them in a little while.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.190 position:61%
Everything you'll see on screen today,
with one exception that I'll point out,

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.590
comes from the Library's collection
of original artist's prints,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.510
posters, drawings and photographs.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.450 position:61%
Today we're going to be taking a deep
look at an indelible and famous artwork

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.970
by American artist, Joseph Pennell.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.080 position:63%
The Library of Congress is fortunate to
preserve both Pennell's concept drawing,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.630 position:56%
which we see on the left, and his
related Liberty Bond poster of which

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.970 position:64%
over 500,000 copies were printed in 1918.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.020 position:70%
We'll also take a look at some of the
broader context and forces that came together

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.640
in launching a virtual armada
of compelling wartime posters,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.260
including this well-known example.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.890 position:56%
As a gateway for that discussion,
here's how the drawing was presented

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.870
in the physical exhibition,
the Echoes exhibition,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.990 position:73%
where it hung alongside some excellent company.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.970 position:70%
That's Cheryl Regan gazing up at the artwork.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.420 position:70%
She's our Echoes Exhibit Director, and let me
also credit our lead curators for that show,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.410 position:72%
Ryan Reft and Sara Conway Lance [phonetic] who
worked with a large team, including myself.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.370 position:59%
If you look at the wall behind Cheryl,
you may spot some familiar faces,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.090
and perhaps this one in particular.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.320 position:72%
James Montgomery Flagg's, "I want you for U.S.
Army" with his truly iconic Uncle Sam based,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.190 position:64%
according to the artist, on his own face.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.000 position:58%
Both Pennell and Flagg were among the
many artists to contribute their work

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.500 position:61%
for the division of pictorial publicity

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.930
within Woodrow Wilson's Committee
on Public Information.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.480
It was this man, George Creel,
who headed the committee.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.240 position:67%
He was a journalist and politician who
believed that art could play a crucial role

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.050 position:73%
in winning the hearts and minds of the American
public, to build support behind the war.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.980 position:73%
And his idea was that whereas people might miss
or bypass text or films or community meetings,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.820
even the most indifferent
eye, and that's his phrase,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.020 position:64%
even the most indifferent eye could not
fail to encounter posters and billboards.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.080 position:75%
In his project memoir called, "How we advertised
in American," Creel stressed that he was

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.690 position:58%
after no less than the very best work
by the best artists and in his words,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.230 position:66%
"Posters into which the masters of the pen

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.980
and brush have poured heart
and soul, as well as genius."

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.390 position:64%
And he continues, "Looking the field
over, we decided upon Charles Dana Gibson

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.060
as the man best fitted to
lead the army of artists."

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.370 position:66%
I like that he thought of them as an army.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:57.500 position:70%
"And on April 17, 1917, this splendid
American entered the service as a volunteer."

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.320 position:72%
So that would have been just a little over a
week after America entered the war on April 6.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.310
And Creel made a very savvy choice
when he tapped Charles Dana Gibson

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.460
to run the committee's Division
of Pictorial Publicity.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.980
Gibson was a very popular leading
and well-connected illustrator,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.400 position:73%
celebrated for his creation of the Gibson Girl,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.590
and you can see a classic
example of that, top left.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.560 position:61%
As president of the Society of American
Illustrators, Gibson was well placed

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.270 position:69%
to rally the troops, the artists troops, and
when he famously urged his fellow artists

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.540 position:58%
to draw till it hurts, in support of
the war, he was talking to such peers

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.550
as James Montgomery Flagg,
Howard Chandler Christy,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.340 position:75%
Edward Penfield, Joseph Pennell and many others.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.250 position:63%
By January of 1918, Gibson reported that
the artists were meeting every Friday

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.030 position:58%
at their New York headquarters on 5th
Avenue to review projects submitted

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.940 position:56%
by different government departments.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.250 position:59%
Afterwards, Gibson said they adjourned
to Key's Chop House for dinner.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.860
The ranks swelled to 300
volunteer artists who produced more

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:10.210 position:70%
than 1,400 designs including some 700 posters
that were spread throughout the country,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.770 position:64%
and they were everywhere, on the streets,
in offices, schools, theaters, libraries,

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.580
street cars, shop windows
and other public spaces.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.430 position:70%
So, in the flow of your daily life, you would
have inevitably encountered these images.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.930 position:58%
And we have some great period photo
documentation of the posters in situ,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.810
like the image we were just looking
at of the billboard on the street

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.680 position:70%
and the scene from a naval recruiting office.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.080
And just look at all of the posters
plastered on the surrounding walls.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.840 position:70%
Many of these are represented in the Library
as collection of original World War I posters

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.460 position:73%
and if you'll just take a second and kind of
memorize those back walls and hold those images

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:55.960 position:72%
in your mind, I'll show you a few closer color
images of the posters from our collection,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:03.980 position:67%
including Howard Chandler Christy's classic
GI, "Wish I were a man, I'd join the Navy."

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.140 position:72%
When Pennell joined the Division of
Pictorial Publicity as an associated chairman,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:14.830 position:70%
he was about 60 years old, so a mature,
successful artist, who like Gibson and Flagg,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.700 position:59%
had helped to find what would be known
as the golden age of illustration.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.970 position:63%
From the 1880's to the 1920's and this
is square during Pennell's active years.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.880 position:73%
He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in
1857 and he trained at the Pennsylvania Academy

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.060
of Fine Arts, and the Pennsylvania
School of Industrial Art.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.700
He later taught at the National
Academy of Design

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.220 position:70%
and the Art Students League in New York City.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.620 position:67%
Pennell died in Brooklyn, New York in 1926.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:50.900 position:63%
This pictorials' style portrait shows
him in 1922 when he was in his mid-60's.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.960 position:73%
During his long career, Pennell gained acclaim
for his work as an illustrator and print maker.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.970
He published treatises about
drawing and print making

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.010 position:66%
and taught, lectured and exhibited widely.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.540 position:73%
He was a prolific illustrator of journal
articles and books by the likes of Henry James,

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.690 position:67%
Washington Irving and William Dean Howells.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:17.680 position:66%
On screen is one of the drawings he made
for Henry James' 1909 book, Italian Hours.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.990 position:69%
Pennell and his journalist wife, Elizabeth
Robbins Pennell often collaborated together.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:27.170 position:61%
She would do the writing and he would
illustrate and they were also devotees,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.860
friends and biographers of
James McNeill Whistler.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.370 position:64%
Early on, as you can see in this drawing,

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.670
Pennell's work shows the
clear influence of Whistler.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:43.470 position:56%
This is an early portrait drawing by
Pennell of his wife in Rome in 1885.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.220
But Pennell liked to live in high
rise apartments with sweeping views

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.620
where Pennell could make drawings

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:55.150 position:64%
like the delicate watercolor you see
here called the, Out of my London Window.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:59.070
Pennell is also one of the early
artists to depict skyscrapers

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:04.900 position:73%
as fine art subjects beginning around 1904, and
here's his drawing of the Flat Iron building

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.050 position:67%
in 1908, only six years after it was built.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.960 position:56%
This opalescent sunset watercolor
on the right shows the stunning view

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.670
from their Brooklyn home.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.460 position:56%
They made the move from Philadelphia
to Brooklyn in 1921.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.180 position:59%
And you may be able to see a bit
sketchily in the distance on the left,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.970 position:73%
there's the Statue of Liberty under the clouds.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.430
Pennell is often called the
dean of American print making

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.840 position:73%
and he was a skillful accomplished lithographer
and etcher, who had a lifelong fascination

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.110
with industrial subjects, a theme
he called the Wonder of Work.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.120
And by this he meant pictures
of architecture, engineering,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.560 position:56%
construction, all kinds of industry.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.180 position:70%
He found these subjects profoundly compelling
and became gifted at presenting them

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:58.980 position:72%
as picturesque, an idea that was traditionally
associated with artist renderings with nature,

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.640
and beautiful landscapes
rather than urban cityscapes.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.890 position:72%
So, we see a Chicago skyline, the standard oil
building in New York, and a dramatic rendering

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.110 position:63%
of a grain elevator in Hamburg, Germany.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:18.140 position:69%
This lithograph is from Pennell's celebrated
series documenting the construction

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.840
of the Panama Canal.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.070 position:59%
And images of people are somewhat rare
in his work, and usually in service

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.320 position:56%
to the larger composition to
indicate scale or bustling activity.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.140 position:61%
Though Pennell considered this grouping
of workers particularly decorative.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.460 position:59%
It was based on an eye witness moment.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:42.350 position:75%
When the Panama Pacific International Exhibition
was mounted in 1915 to celebrate the opening

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:47.970 position:59%
of the Panama Canal, Pennell shared a
juried exhibition of over 2,000 prints

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.070
and he had a room dedicated
to some 150 of his own.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.800
And here he is looking very
intrepid at the construction site

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.210 position:63%
and that little sign is basically saying
that you walk here at your own peril.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.790
And here are a couple more
images showing Pennell in action.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.450
These were both taken at the
Chicago Stockyards around 1918.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.010 position:59%
One shows Pennell surrounded by a
crowd near what looks like a warehouse

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:20.350 position:75%
and the other he's sitting on the balcony and he
seems to have had a sketchbook with him always,

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.880
many portraits of him showing
him clutching a sketchbook.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.040
Our collection also has many
examples of his sketchbooks.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.910 position:63%
By the time Pennell came to the
Division of Pictorial Publicity in 1917,

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.430
he had already built strong
credentials and a solid body

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.420
of artworks documenting war
preparation in England,

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.220
which was his home base with
his wife for many years.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:48.390 position:69%
On screen from left to right are lithographs
from his series of war work in England,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.170
first in England, then in America.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:57.090 position:75%
It's fascinating to know that Pennell was raised
as a Quaker and was personally opposed to war,

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.810
but for his ongoing exploration
of his wonder of work theme,

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.900
the chance to document war
preparation was the opportunity

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.810 position:66%
of a lifetime, it was irresistible to him.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:12.730 position:67%
With government backing in both England and
America, Pennell was granted special access

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.450
to sensitive sites including
shipyards and ammunition factories.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.590
And here's a close-up detail of the
Censor Stamp from the [inaudible]

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.330
of Pennell's submarine in drydock.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:28.640 position:56%
The stamp is on the left showing
that the artwork had passed scrutiny

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.550
by the Philadelphia Navy yard
sensor on November 7, 1917,

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:40.620 position:64%
and that Pennell was not giving away any
state secrets by distributing this image.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.990 position:59%
Pennell was vocal, he made no bones
about the tension between a boring war

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.390
and being enthralled by its
technology and scale.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:54.080 position:70%
Pennell's wartime artworks were exhibited at
multiple venues including the Brooklyn Museum

00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.710 position:73%
in 1917, where the accompanying catalog
boasted introductions by H.G Wells and Pennell.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.180
And here are quotes from both.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:08.540 position:72%
To me, I think Wells really reflected the work
well and understood what Pennell was after.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.950 position:66%
The full quote is on screen, but I'll just
read the last bit, this is on the right.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:20.550 position:70%
"He gives us the splendors and immensities
of forge and gun-pit, furnace and mine-shaft.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.990
He shows you how great they
are and how terrible."

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.580 position:56%
And for his part, Pennell's quote on
the left expresses his ambivalence.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.400 position:66%
He wrote, "It is the working of the great
machinery and the great mills which I find

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:39.540 position:69%
so inspiring, so impressive, and if only the
engines turned out were engines of peace,

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.650 position:56%
how much better would the world be?"

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:47.560 position:59%
Now, this is the first of two
Liberty-Loan posters Pennell designed.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.390 position:66%
This one was for the third Liberty-Loan,
the Washington Post and the New York Times

00:14:52.390 --> 00:15:00.330 position:72%
on March 10, 1918 both published articles
that reported a planned 9 million posters were

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.620 position:64%
to be designed and distributed by various
artists and they would be distributed

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:13.010 position:61%
in the U.S., Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto
Rico, Cuba, The Philippines and France.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:18.990 position:75%
There were four Liberty Bond drives that by the
end of the war had raised more than $17 million,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.510
and that was just an unheard-of
figure at the time.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:28.220 position:73%
And here's an extraordinary statistic, out of
an estimated 24 million households at the time,

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.760
some 20 million individuals
bought Liberty War Bonds.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.510 position:70%
This poster is a classic example of Pennell's
work, which typically combined a documentary

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:43.630 position:59%
with a picturesque, but still friendly
based and eye witnessed observation.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:49.740 position:70%
His next in line, for the fourth Liberty-Loan
poster was an entirely different animal

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.190
and a real departure for Pennell.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.780 position:67%
It depicts a horrific scene with the Statue
of Liberty in ruins and New York City

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.130 position:70%
in flames while under attack by enemy planes.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:07.320 position:69%
His idea was to show, "New York City bombed,
shot down, burning, blown up by an enemy.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.560 position:72%
A fleet of airplanes fly over lower Manhattan,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.240
flames and smoke envelope
the burning skyscrapers.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.900
In the foreground, Liberty from
a pile of ruins rises headless

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.580 position:59%
on her pedestal, her torch shattered."

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.630 position:59%
So, it's a little difficult to see the
planes unless you're in the presence

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.750 position:61%
of the original drawing, though they
are clearly visible in the print poster

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.660
and here are details from
both the drawing up top.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.670 position:61%
The planes in sort of faint
light-blue are marked by the blue arrow

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.630 position:61%
and I hope you can see them, descending
down diagonally toward the left.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:47.360
The poster detailed below,
they are much clearer.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:53.090 position:72%
Within the conflagration, other details emerge
including a submarine heading toward the city

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:59.810 position:70%
skyline with a sagging bridge in the distance
and poor Liberty's disembodied head nearby.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:07.460 position:69%
We also see sunken or sinking ships with the
American flag beginning to go underwater.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.650 position:73%
The lower margin of the drawing shows Pennell's
title and signature, indicates his dual role

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:19.610 position:69%
as draftsman and printmaker and is annotated
in his hand watercolor sketch of idea.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.540
But the actual spark came earlier.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.840 position:72%
Pennell gave a detailed account of the project

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.230
in his 1918 book called Joseph
Pennell's Liberty-Loan Poster,

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:34.630 position:64%
and in it he describes making the initial
sketch pictured on the left as reproduced

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.540
from this book while riding the
train back from a New York meeting

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.450 position:61%
of the Committee on Public Information.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:46.130 position:59%
And you can see he's laid in some
color indications like red in the sky.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:50.380 position:70%
Once he arrived home in Philadelphia, Pennell
made another drawing, which he then worked

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:55.350 position:64%
up into a lithographic print and this is
the image that you see here on the right.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:01.670 position:69%
And Pennell wrote that this is the design he
submitted successfully for jury selection.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:07.470 position:70%
News coverage of the time reported that
Pennell's was one of 10 artist designs chosen

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.770
and that 10 million posters
would be printed all together.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.730
Over 500,000 copies were to be
made of Pennell's poster alone.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.150 position:64%
The Library's collection includes some 30
examples of Pennell's working materials

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:26.300 position:70%
for the poster and so far, that initial train
sketch on the left, which I've reproduced

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.370
from the book I mentioned, has
not been located in a collection.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.730
I'm holding out hope and if anyone
runs across it, please let us know.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:39.120 position:56%
We do have the drawing and resulting
lithograph shown on the right.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.450
We also have this sketchbook.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:46.400 position:70%
It's small, it's a little sketchbook in
which Pennell is apparently trying out titles

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.750 position:67%
and the wording he later settled on was,
his idea was to say, now remember the scene

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.400
of conflagration, "Buy Liberty
Bonds or you will see this."

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.040
So, this was later softened
to a more poetic alternative

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.550 position:67%
for the printed color poster, as we'll see.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:09.000 position:66%
Based on the available evidence and in
studying the original artworks themselves,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.630
the sequence starts in black and
white with the train sketch first,

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:17.400 position:58%
followed by the worked-up drawing and
lithograph and then on to full color.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.450
On the far left is a proof of
the black and white lithograph

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.960 position:58%
with lavish watercolor added by hand.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.290
It looks like a drawing almost.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.640 position:70%
Next is Pennell's full-scale watercolor
drawing for which the title differed somewhat

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.490 position:67%
from the final posters so, "Lest Liberty
Parish From The Face Of The Earth," became,

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.290
"That Liberty Shall Not Parish
From the Earth, Buy Liberty Bonds."

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:44.920 position:58%
Furthermore, and far less well known,
Pennell explored a similar concept

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:52.110 position:73%
in his second drawing dated July 4, 1918, which
moves the venue from New York to Philadelphia.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.200
The drawings are a comparable
size and made in similar style

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.050 position:56%
and color palate, and similar media.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.910 position:64%
The violence in my eyes is intensified by
adding a terrified crowd running in front

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.230
of Independence Hall and a prone
figure bleeding in the foreground.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:13.330 position:70%
I've not found much in the way of discussion
or explanation for this Philadelphia version,

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:18.740 position:73%
but both drawings are listed in the unpublished
Catalogue Raisonne of Pennell's drawings

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:26.970 position:61%
and paintings by Louis A. Wuerth, under
the heading, "War Poster Drawings."

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:34.460 position:67%
As I've mentioned, these phantasmagorical
images were extremely unusable for Pennell,

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.160 position:61%
very specific to their purpose in time.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.830 position:66%
There is a well-known story about a
meeting of the National Arts Club in 1920,

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.040
not long after the war, during
which Pennell took artist,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.920
George Bellows to task on
the issue of authenticity.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.760 position:61%
He singled out Bellows amid showing the
execution of British Red Cross nurse,

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.710
Edith Cavell, who helped allied
prisoners escape during the war,

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:02.230
saying that the work would be much
more compelling and truly authentic

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.250 position:75%
if Bellows had seen the event with his own eyes.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:10.690 position:73%
Bellows rejoinder was that it was true, he had
not seen the event, but nor, as far as he knew,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.280 position:70%
had Leonardo been present at the Last Supper.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.860 position:64%
On screen is Bellow's dramatic lithograph
and he also made a large-scale painting

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:25.270 position:67%
which envisions an angelic Edith Cavell
descending a staircase while a firing squad

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.650
waits in the shadows below
at the lower right corner.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.760 position:64%
And of course, this argument, Pennell's
argument becomes somewhat ironic in light

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.010
of the Liberty Bond poster
designs we have been looking at.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:40.560
But there is certainly an anomaly
in Pennell's broader body of work.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.300 position:66%
Right up until his death in 1926, Pennell
continued making prints and drawings based

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.530
on eye witness observation and
reflecting a changing world.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.500 position:63%
During this late period, he made a
series of beautiful watercolor drawings,

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.490
you saw this one earlier and it's
another one of my very favorites.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.970
But he made hundreds of them and
they're incredibly beautiful.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.210
He seems to have been making
them really for his own pleasure.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:13.120 position:63%
And they're capturing, many of them,
the changing light, weather and activity

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.020 position:61%
on the East River, which he could see
from his Brooklyn apartment high point.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.100
And as the Bellows' story suggests,
I think it must be said that anyone

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:28.600 position:67%
who said he's Pennell [inaudible] will bump
up against his notoriously argumentative,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.020 position:67%
difficult and sometimes [inaudible] nature.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.400
And this was remarkable enough that
it is mentioned in his obituaries,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.490 position:75%
along with long lists of honors and
achievements including his tireless, passionate,

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.660 position:58%
constant advocacy of art and artists.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:50.650 position:75%
Pennell really gave his life to this and he left
his entire estate to the Library of Congress.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.260 position:63%
So, we have an extraordinary opportunity
to study a virtually complete collection

00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:01.920 position:69%
of his lithographs and etchings, about 1,900
altogether, about 4,000 of his drawings,

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.950 position:63%
his publications and papers, along with
his wife's, their substantial collection

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.490
of James McNeill Whistler
art papers and [inaudible]

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:16.380 position:75%
and Elizabeth Robbins Pennell's rare cookbook
collection and we also have the Pennell library.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:22.260 position:70%
And as we've seen, Pennell's artwork reflects
how he moved through history and art history

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.970 position:61%
in ways that uniquely reflect the first
World War, as well as the construction

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:32.580 position:61%
of the Panama Canal, the rise of
American cities and other key subjects.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:37.440 position:73%
So, we would like to leave you with some
resources beginning with the exhibition website

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.240 position:72%
for our current show, Echoes of the Great War,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.480 position:61%
and also the art centric exhibition I
recently co-curated with my colleagues,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.650
Sara Duke and Betsy Nahum-Miller,
it's called, World War I -

Here's a select bibliography of resources
including Creel's book about the Committee

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.120
on Public Information which I found
very valuable during World War I,

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.780
and some key resources for studying
Pennell on his prints and drawings,

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:40.240 position:66%
which are also searchable in the Library's
online catalog at www.loc.gov/pictures,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.160
and available for study, of
course, in our reading room,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.540 position:67%
along with over 76,000 photographs, prints,
and drawings related to World War I.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:53.890 position:63%
You can also send us reference questions
at this ask a librarian link on screen.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.950
So, thank you so much for joining
us today, and I'll hand things back

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.470
to Naomi before we take questions.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:07.120 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks so much Katherine,
really beautiful and fascinating work.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.070 position:73%
We'd love to have you guys share some questions
that Katherine can answer if you have them,

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:18.410 position:67%
but before, well while we wait for your
questions, I have one myself, which is, so,

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.910
you mentioned that Pennell offered
the Library his entire estate,

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.730 position:64%
can you talk more about his
relationship with the Library of Congress

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.100
and why did he choose to
have his work kept here?

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:35.780 position:72%
&gt;&gt; So, our best clue comes from his wife's
biography of her husband, The Life and Letters

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:42.570 position:75%
of Joseph Pennell, and it turns out that their
estate was headed to the New York Public Library

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.870 position:56%
which also is a very wonderful home.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:50.200 position:67%
But according to Elizabeth Robbins Pennell,
after seeing the Library's print room,

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.970 position:73%
Pennell decided he considered it the finest
anywhere, this is Pennell, the finest anywhere,

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.940
and still somewhat in need of
more fine print, so he saw a need

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:06.220 position:63%
and around 1917 he made a new will in
favor of the Library and she wrote that,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.210 position:56%
according to his wife, Pennell
liked the idea of placing his legacy

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.470
in the Nation's Capital and
in the National Institution.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.940
So, that's the short answer.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.860
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.840 position:70%
Again, let us know if you have questions, but
I'll ask one more, which is that, you know,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.920
could you talk a little bit more
about the Liberty Bond Drive,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.850 position:59%
I'm not sure if you shared the
statistic that you and I talked about,

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:35.050 position:64%
about the number of households in the
U.S. as compared to how many participated

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.990 position:67%
in the bond drive, but if you haven't, it'd
be great to say or to reiterate if you did,

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:44.970
and then also tell us a little bit
more about that, about the drive?

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:55.340 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Well so, let me just sort of give the
basic sort of definition, which is that,

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:59.330
so they were essentially,
so by buying a war bond,

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:03.880 position:75%
it meant that you were essentially loaning money
to the U.S. Government in support of the war,

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.530 position:70%
with the funds to be returned at a later
date, and this was framed as a patriotic duty

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:16.420 position:73%
for every citizen from children to
millionaires, everyone was expected to step up.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:22.130 position:69%
The bonds were sold in denominations going
as low as $50, and you could also buy stamps

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:28.160 position:69%
for just $.25 and buyers were given buttons,
sort of, I think of them sort of like our

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:35.930 position:72%
"I voted" stickers today, to show
participation and encourage others to join in.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:41.680 position:63%
And let's see, the program was initiated
by Treasury Secretary William McAdoo,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:48.770 position:69%
and the bonds were promoted by major
celebrities of the day, like Charlie Chaplin

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:54.540
and Mary Pickford, and that
statistic is really incredible.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:28:00.850 position:70%
So, altogether they had raised more than $17
million for the Liberty Bond drive by the end

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:05.780 position:61%
of the war, and out of it, an estimated
24 million households at that time,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:12.930 position:66%
some 20 million individuals bought Liberty
War Bonds, so wildly successful campaign.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.130
&gt;&gt; Alright, thank you.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:23.460 position:66%
So, I haven't seen any other questions, so
I guess we'll close out today's session.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.530
I do want to remind everyone
that this is part of the series.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.280
There will be one more of
these webinars on World War I.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.270 position:69%
Oh, we do have a question, from Tim Garrity.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:37.230 position:72%
So, he says, how does Pennell's work compare
with the work of other World War I era artists

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.560
in other nations like Britain,
Germany, France and Russia?

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.140
Are there major differences?

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:50.600 position:70%
&gt;&gt; So, I think that you can compare Pennell's
work to a British artist like Muirhead Bone.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.800
I think his work is sort of
representative, picturesque,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:04.150 position:73%
something that had fellow comparisons in
Europe and certainly in England, and of course,

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:11.450
although he felt very much an
American, he spent a lot of time

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.070
in Britain, was also an anglophile.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:22.900 position:73%
So, I can mention a few of the British artists,
I mentioned Muirhead Bone, James McBey,

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:31.100 position:63%
and also an extremely influential artist
who worked with the British government,

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:37.690 position:58%
Dutch artist, Louis Raemaekers, whose
images illustrated the Bryce report,

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.840
of reported German atrocities.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.630
So, that's a great question.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:46.180 position:72%
I could go on, but that's an essential answer.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.140
&gt;&gt; OK great.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.510 position:63%
So, another question, this is from Ruth.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.760 position:59%
She says, you pointed to the
departure from Pennell's typical style

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.340 position:75%
that left Liberty parish departure from his
typical style, so can you talk a little bit more

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.720
about why he made that departure?

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:09.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, I would love to know why, and
I've looked for clues in his letters

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:14.940 position:72%
and I've looked for, I mean, I don't know why.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:23.050
I think that he was responding
to something very specific, very,

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:30.320 position:66%
if I'm allowed to conjecture a little bit,
I think a lot about this sort of tension

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:43.760 position:73%
between his being a pacifist and his being so
engaged and compelled by the technology of war,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:55.870 position:75%
I know he was distressed, disturbed, you know,
so he just chose a very, what's the word I want,

00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:03.350
I don't, histrionic isn't the word
I groping for, but it's an extreme,

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:07.880 position:67%
it's an extreme response, and there are
other comparable posters in our collection,

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:15.590 position:73%
on that very first slide that I showed, there's
a poster by John Norton, "Keep these off USA",

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:19.410 position:64%
which shows a bloody German soldier boot.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:30.420 position:73%
So, it's one, it's one, it's a tone that's used
by more than one artist, to sort of show the,

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:39.250 position:73%
show how vital it was to be engaged in these
Liberty-Loan bond drives in no uncertain terms.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:48.570 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Alright, well one last comment
that may lead to a question, actually.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:52.990 position:75%
So, Jerry said that the poster depicting the
young woman in the Navy uniform was still in use

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.680
by the Navy when I was in
the service in the 70's.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.420
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.560 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Which is interesting, but it also makes
me wonder if you might speak a little bit

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:09.200 position:75%
about the legacy either of some of the images to
come out of the Committee on Public Information

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:17.550 position:70%
in World War I or just a bit about the growth
of marketing after the war as a result,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:22.650
what's the legacy of these
images and effort around them?

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.860 position:63%
&gt;&gt; So, there's a really great example to
sort of site in answering that question.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.870 position:66%
James Montgomery Flagg's Uncle Sam, I want
you for the U.S. Army, was repurposed.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:36.960 position:56%
It was so powerful it was repurposed
during World War II and if you go

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.160
to our online catalog you can
see the different versions,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.130 position:63%
and one of them also includes a portrait
of FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:51.220 position:70%
So, I think what happened was the World War I
posters, the division of pictorial publicity,

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:58.300 position:72%
this extraordinary phenomenon which was even
considered by artists and critics at the time,

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.970
there was a self-awareness that
something special was going on,

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:05.040 position:64%
that something new was happening and that
they were moving the equation forward

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.900 position:67%
and opening the door, and I think it was
one in a series of information revolutions.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:17.800 position:67%
I think you could look at it that way, that
really things were moved forward in a way

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.150 position:56%
that opened the door for the future.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:26.360 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Alright, well thanks for that, and
thank you for this wonderful presentation.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.940
So, I'll wrap up with a few notes.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.290
One is that, as I was saying
earlier, this is part of a series,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:37.100 position:61%
and so we'll have one more webinar that
will be on December 12 at 2:00 eastern.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.370 position:56%
The exhibition co-curator, Ryan Reft

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:43.410 position:67%
of the Manuscript Division will discuss
Charles Hamilton Houston's wartime service,

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:47.700 position:69%
and experiences as a young officer serving
in a segregated military, and the influences

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.840 position:69%
of those experiences on his later work in
civil rights including as the chief attorney

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.270 position:75%
for the NAACP and a mentor to Thurgood Marshall.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:34:00.120 position:61%
This also was previously a gallery talk
and like Katherine's, a wonderful one,

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.260
so I hope you'll join us for
the last of our webinar series.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:10.110 position:75%
Today, as you may know, is Giving Tuesday, so
in that spirit, I'd like to just share that some

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:16.370 position:67%
of our programs here are made possible by
donations and gifts from generous citizens,

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.990 position:64%
so the Library of Congress has introduced
a new initiative that is called,

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.850 position:69%
"To Spark a Lifelong Adventure of Learning."

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:26.470 position:66%
If you'd like to learn more or support
this effort, you can go to loc.gov/donate.

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:30.410
And finally, we'd love to know what
you thought of today's session.

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:35.600 position:58%
If you can share your comments on the
survey, we'd very much appreciate it.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.700 position:67%
And, if you have a question, oh, thank you.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:45.060 position:73%
We appreciate your participation in the webinar
today, and again you'll find the recording

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.710 position:58%
on the World War I Exhibition website

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.570 position:59%
and also the Library's YouTube channel
once it has been properly captioned,

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.050
which should be in a few weeks.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:54.760 position:69%
So, thank you all so much for participating.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.590
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
