00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's say we have a friend Bob.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Bob is blue, he's had a nasty run in with a can of paint.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now let's assume that Bob has a Boolean formula,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
not necessarily this one but just some Boolean formula.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And suppose Bob comes to us and tells us I've already

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
found out that this Boolean formula is satisfiable.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now let's say we don't necessarily trust Bob.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Bob is given to exaggeration.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We'd like to be able to figure out in polynomial time

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
whether or not Bob is telling us the truth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So how would be go about doing that?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's say Bob came to us with a complete series of snapshots

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
from a nondeterministic RAM solving SAT on his formula.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Would that be enough for us to believe that he had a satisfiable formula?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
How about if he had a list of satisfiable clauses?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
For example, he had a list that had x as the satisfiable clause

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and not Y as a satisfiable clause.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then for the entire Boolean formula,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
could we then determine whether it was satisfiable or not?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What about if you had a satisfying assignment for all

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
of the variables in the formula?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What if we had all the calls to if&lt;u&gt;better on the Boolean formula?&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So not necessarily a complete series of snapshots

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
from a nondeterministic RAM solving SAT on his formula,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but just all the calls to if&lt;u&gt;better.&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Would that be enough for us to believe Bob?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And finally, what if we had a satisfying assignment

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
for not all the variables but 90% of the variables in Bob's formula.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Could we believe him then?

00:01:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check all that apply.
