00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.285
[cheers and applause]

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.287
(Tom)
All right.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.621
I don't know if you guys
know this or not,

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:58.258
but comedians' lives
are lonely.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.626
It's a lonely existence.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.096
I mean,
you're in airports and hotels

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.098
and cities with strangers
every week.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.366
It gets lonely.
Like, it really does.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.570
Like, you can only masturbate,
like,

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.472
so many times
before you're like,

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.241
"I've got to get something
to eat," you know?

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.776
Like...

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.278
it's one of those things.

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:20.314
You've got to find something
to boost you up.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.182
You know what's
the biggest boost?

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:25.319
The biggest spark
when you're on the road

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:28.555
is actually running into
another comedian.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:29.690
It's the best.

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:31.525
I can't even describe it to you.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.427
It's the one thing
that you're like, "Yes."

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.796
If it's a comedian
you already know,

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.564
it's like a reunion.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:39.499
And if it's a comedian
you've never met,

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.269
"There's so much excitement
at the potential."

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:45.105
You're,
"Oh, is he gonna be weird?

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:46.507
"Is he gonna be hilarious?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.710
Is it gonna be hilarious
how weird he is?"

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:51.712
But there's so much there.

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:53.614
You know, it's how I imagine
serial killer feel

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.349
when they meet each other
the first time.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.718
They're like, "You know,
you do it differently

00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:00.621
"than the way I do it,
but I totally respect

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.155
"your commitment to the craft.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.058
"Like,
you keep their toes in jars.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.493
That's nuts.
That's awesome."

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:09.162
So I'm at the airport,

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:10.797
and I'm waiting to board
a flight,

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.201
and who do I see at the gate

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.503
boarding the same flight?

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:19.506
The comedian Bruce Bruce.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.176
Now, if you don't know
who Bruce Bruce is,

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.213
super successful comic,
had TV shows.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.814
He sells out clubs
and theaters everywhere.

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:29.383
He's awesome.

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:31.185
And I've never met him.

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:32.553
I see him at the gate,
and I'm like,

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.221
"I'm gonna go talk
to Bruce Bruce."

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.556
And then I go,
"No, you're not.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.224
Bruce Bruce doesn't want
to talk to you."

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.592
[laughter]

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.360
So I don't say anything.

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:44.097
And then we board the flight,
and I get upgraded.

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:47.568
Whoop-whoop,
upgraded,

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:51.338
and now, who is sitting directly
across the aisle from me?

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.308
Bruce Bruce.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.809
Now I can't help myself.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:57.444
Now I have to say something.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.613
So I introduced myself
to Bruce Bruce.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.416
Now, for this to really
make sense to you,

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.685
if you don't know who he is,
I have to paint a picture, okay?

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:08.689
Bruce Bruce is black,
he has dreads,

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:11.124
and he's a big boy,
all right?

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:13.227
Like,
when you say your name twice,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.428
there's a lot of you.

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.363
[laughter]

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.532
Bruce Bruce is, like,
4 bills, okay?

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.335
So...

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.270
I made name myself Tom Tom
if I gain another 100 pounds.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:24.404
So...

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:27.241
[laughter]

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:29.243
I'm sitting across the aisle
from Bruce Bruce,

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:33.313
and I introduce myself,
and he could not be nicer.

00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:35.616
Just to give you an idea
of his status,

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.484
we're at the gate on this plane,

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.586
and the flight attendant
announces

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.655
that we're stuck at the gate,
and she says,

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.724
"You can get off
if you want to.

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:45.325
"Just take your boarding pass
with you.

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.827
And then you can get back on."

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.795
So as I'm talking to him
and they say that, I go,

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.464
"I'm not getting off,"
and he goes,

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.299
"I'm not getting off,"
and then a woman,

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:56.236
a passenger from the back
of the plane walks up.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.539
and she leans down to him,
and she goes,

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.141
"I'm getting off ; is there
anything you want or need?"

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:04.311
And he goes,
"I would love some candy."

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.280
And she goes,
"Candy?"

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:10.050
And he goes, "Twix, Skittles,
shit like that."

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.420
[laughter]

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:18.125
And then she gets off the plane,
and I go, "Who is that?"

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:19.293
And he goes,
"I don't know."

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:21.628
[laughter]

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:26.200
And I'm like, "Are strangers
buying you candy?"

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.634
And he goes, "Yeah."

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:31.205
[laughter]

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:33.607
Like, that's Bruce Bruce status,
okay?

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.309
So we keep talking.

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:37.477
We kind of start talking
about gigs that we've done,

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.447
and we start talking
about comedians and who's funny.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.382
Who are
the funniest comics ever?

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:45.452
And we start literally listing
comedians through time.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.388
Like, we start with, like,
Lenny Bruce and Dick Gregory,

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:51.491
and we talked about George
Carlin and Richard Pryor,

00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:54.728
all the way through Eddie Murphy
and into today, you know,

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.797
Kevin Hart and Dave Attell.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.266
And then Kevin Bruce Bruce says,
"That's all good,

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.036
but do you know who the funniest
cat of all time is?"

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.638
Now,
I think it's a setup.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.540
I think he's just gonna be like,
"It's me, bitch.

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.375
I'm the funni"--
like, it's like that, right?

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.677
That's what I think
it's gonna be.

00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:12.546
And I'm gonna let him have it.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.682
So I go, "No," like, "Who's
the funniest cat of all time."

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:18.352
And he goes Andy Griffith.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.387
And I go, "What?"

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.655
[laughter]

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.490
And he goes,
"Andy Griffith."

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:25.225
And I go,
"Are you talking about, like..."

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.393
[whistles]

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.362
"That dude?"

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:29.730
And he goes,
"Yeah, you ever been to

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.331
the Andy Griffith Museum
before?"

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:32.733
And I go,
"What kind of question is that?

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:35.169
No, of course not, man, like...

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:36.670
Is that real?"

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:39.406
And he goes,
"Real?

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.375
"They have the car
that he used to sit in,

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:43.110
"and you can sit in it too.

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:45.445
And you can touch shit
that he used to touch."

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.149
[laughter]

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:51.685
And he goes,
"Did you ever see episode 215

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:54.388
of <i>The Andy Griffith Show?"</i>

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:57.624
And I go, "No, ass burgers,
I didn't see episode 215."

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.526
[laughter]

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.395
And he goes,
"That's my favorite episode.

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:04.565
It originally aired
March 13, 1967."

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:07.334
And I go, "Are you [bleep]ing
with me right now?"

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.369
[laughter]

00:06:09.403 --> 00:06:12.372
And he goes...

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:14.208
"No, it was March 13, 1967."

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.409
[laughter]

00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:17.277
And then he ate Twix,

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:18.712
and he didn't talk to me
for the rest of the flight,

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.547
but I am begging you,

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:23.116
if you ever see Bruce Bruce
anywhere,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.153
walking around, sitting down
at a show, anywhere,

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:29.256
just go and be, "Hey, man,
Andy Griffith is the shit,"

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:30.724
and he'll be like,
"I know!

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.392
I've been saying that shit!"

00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:34.127
And he'll lose his mind.

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:35.562
That's it for me.
You guys are the best.

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:35.662
[cheers and applause]
