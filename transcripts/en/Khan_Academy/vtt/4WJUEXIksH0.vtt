00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:02.325
- [Voiceover] So we wanna
evaluate the definite integral

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:05.075
from negative one to negative two

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:10.920
of 16 minus x to the third
over x to the third dx.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.749
Now at first this might seem daunting,

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.476
I have this rational expression,
I have xs in the numerators

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:18.076
and xs in the denominators,
but we just have to remember,

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:20.317
we just have to do some
algebraic manipulation,

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:22.571
and this is going to seem
a lot more attractable.

00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:24.901
This is the same thing
as the definite integral

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.596
from negative one to negative two of

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:30.679
16 over x to the third

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:33.545
minus x to the third

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:35.175
over x to the third,

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:38.954
minus x to the third
over x to the third dx.

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:41.421
And now what is that going to be equal to?

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:44.404
That is going be equal
to the definite integral

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:47.487
from negative one to negative two of,

00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:52.523
I could write this first
term right over here,

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:54.292
let me do this in a different color.

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:57.646
I could write, I could write this

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:01.813
as 16x to the negative three,
x to the negative three,

00:01:02.716 --> 00:01:05.130
and this second one,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.939
we have minus x to the
third over x to the third.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.235
Well x to the third is just over,

00:01:11.235 --> 00:01:12.556
x to the third over x to the third

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:14.843
is just going to be equal to one.

00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:17.843
So this is going to be minus one dx,

00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:20.726
so dx.

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:23.934
And so what is this going to be equal to?

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:26.934
Well, let's take the antiderivative
of each of these parts

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.043
and then we're going to
have to evaluate them

00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:29.943
at the different bounds.

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:31.030
So, let's see.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.210
The antiderivative of 16x
to the negative three,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.552
we're just gonna do the power rule

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:37.151
for derivatives in reverse.

00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:39.465
You can view this as the
power rule of integration

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:42.286
or the power rule of
taking the antiderivative

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:43.576
where what you do is

00:01:43.576 --> 00:01:46.491
you're gonna increase our exponent by one,

00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.515
so you're gonna go from
negative three to negative two,

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.565
and then you're gonna
divide by that amount,

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:53.461
by negative two.

00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:57.670
So it's going to be 16
divided by negative two

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.268
times x to the negative two.

00:01:59.268 --> 00:02:01.008
All I did is I increased the exponent

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:02.980
and I divided by that amount.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.727
So that's the antiderivative here.

00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:07.695
And 16 divided by negative two,

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:10.072
that is just negative eight.

00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:12.401
So we have negative eight,
x to the negative two.

00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:15.343
And then the antiderivative
of negative one,

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:19.510
well, that's just negative
x, negative, negative x,

00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:22.571
negative x.

00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:25.648
And actually you might just know that,

00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:27.653
and then hey, if I take the
derivative of negative x

00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:29.751
I get negative one, or if you view this

00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:33.421
as negative x to the zero power,
because that's what one is,

00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.838
well, it's the same thing.

00:02:34.838 --> 00:02:37.036
You increase the exponent by one

00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:39.033
to get x to the first power.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.831
And then you divide by one and so,

00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:43.516
I mean, you can view it
as that right over there,

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:48.177
but either way you get
to negative or minus x.

00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:50.898
And so now we want to evaluate that.

00:02:50.898 --> 00:02:52.935
We're going to evaluate that at the bounds

00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:54.297
and take the difference.

00:02:54.297 --> 00:02:57.063
So we're going to evaluate
that at negative two

00:02:57.063 --> 00:03:01.461
and then subtract from that
this evaluated at negative one.

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:03.214
And let me do those in
two different colors

00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:04.966
so we can see what's going on.

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:06.855
So we're gonna evaluate it at negative two

00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:09.765
and we're gonna evaluate
it at negative one.

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:12.277
So let's first evaluate
it at negative two.

00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:14.789
So this is going to be equal to,

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.554
this is going to be equal to,

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:18.328
when you evaluate it at negative two,

00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:22.683
it's going to be negative
eight, negative eight

00:03:22.683 --> 00:03:24.842
times x to the negative two.

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:27.913
So negative two the the negative two power

00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:29.496
minus negative two.

00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:33.142
And from that we're going to subtract it

00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:35.817
and evaluate it at negative one.

00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:40.028
So, it's going to be negative
eight times negative one

00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:43.778
to the negative two
power minus negative one.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.655
All right, so then what
is this going to be?

00:03:47.655 --> 00:03:50.677
So, negative two the negative two.

00:03:50.677 --> 00:03:53.143
So negative two to the negative two

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:57.356
is equal to one over negative two squared,

00:03:57.356 --> 00:03:59.962
which is equal to 1/4.

00:03:59.962 --> 00:04:03.317
So this is equal to positive 1/4,

00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:07.330
but then negative eight times positive 1/4

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.413
is going to be equal to negative two.

00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:14.611
And then we have negative
two minus negative two,

00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:17.417
so that's negative two plus two.

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:20.431
And so everything I've just
done in this purplish color

00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:22.664
that is just going to be zero.

00:04:22.664 --> 00:04:26.545
And then if we look at what's
going on in the orange,

00:04:26.545 --> 00:04:28.061
when you evaluate it at negative one,

00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:31.208
let's see, negative one
to the negative two power,

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.116
well, that's one over
negative one squared.

00:04:33.116 --> 00:04:34.884
Well, this all is just going to be one.

00:04:34.884 --> 00:04:39.151
And so we're gonna have
negative eight plus one,

00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:41.901
which is equal to negative seven.

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.109
So all of this evaluates
to negative seven.

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:48.767
But remember, we're
subtracting negative seven,

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:50.477
and so this is going to result,

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:51.836
we deserve a little bit of a drum roll,

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:56.402
this is going to be equal
to positive, positive seven.

00:04:56.402 --> 00:04:57.235
And obviously you don't have to write

00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:58.119
that positive out in front,

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:00.447
I just wrote that just to emphasize

00:05:00.447 --> 00:05:03.876
that this is going to be a positive seven.
