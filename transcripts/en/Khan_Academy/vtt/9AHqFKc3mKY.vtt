00:00:01.431 --> 00:00:02.277
- [Instructor] In other videos,

00:00:02.277 --> 00:00:05.152
we've already talked
about how Classical Greece

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:07.108
has had an immeasurable impact

00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:08.653
not just on Western civilization,

00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:11.050
but on civilization as a whole.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.191
In order to understand the period

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:15.258
that we call Classical Greece,

00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:18.092
it's valuable to place it
in context on a timeline,

00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:20.963
so I have significant conflicts or events

00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:24.473
that happened to the Greek
world on this timeline,

00:00:24.473 --> 00:00:28.635
especially in the fifth
and fourth centuries BCE

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:31.023
In the beginning of the fifth century BCE,

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:33.269
you have the Greco-Persian Wars,

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.559
where the Greek city states
are able to fend off attack

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.897
from the great Persian Empire,

00:00:38.897 --> 00:00:40.705
and then they go on the offensive.

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:44.159
But as we exit the fifth century BCE,

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.939
the city states start
fighting amongst themselves.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.535
You have Athens leading the Delian League

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:53.053
in a fight against
Sparta and their allies,

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.959
which significantly
weakens the city states.

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:57.888
It ends with Athens losing,

00:00:57.888 --> 00:00:59.970
but all of the city
states have been weakened,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.343
and it leaves them open to be
conquered by the Macedonians,

00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:05.353
in particular Phillip of Macedonia,

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:07.960
and then his son Alexander the Great

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.914
is able to not just keep control

00:01:10.914 --> 00:01:13.300
of Greece, of the city states,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.268
but conquer Egypt and Persia

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:20.189
and get all the way to modern
day Afghanistan and Pakistan,

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.787
but after his death,

00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:23.441
you then have his successors,

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:26.347
and Greece falls under
the Antigonid dynasty.

00:01:26.347 --> 00:01:29.276
But eventually as we get into the second

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:31.389
and first century BCE,

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:34.355
it goes under Roman control,

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.844
and we've talked about
this Classical period,

00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:39.439
all of the various contributions.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.985
We've talked about the
contributions in philosophy,

00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:45.650
from people like Socrates,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.530
and Socrates's student Plato,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.030
and Plato's student Aristotle,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.471
but there were also
significant contributions

00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.204
in mathematics.

00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:58.085
You have Pythagoras,

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:01.223
who actually predates these philosophers,

00:02:01.223 --> 00:02:05.834
and he's most famous,
especially to many of us,

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.140
for his Pythagorean Theorem

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.515
and a lot of mathematics

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:13.521
and the foundations of a lot of geometry.

00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:15.831
But he and his followers,

00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:19.088
they were actually creating
something of a mysticism,

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:21.722
of a religion around mathematics,

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:24.191
and even a philosophy
that would later influence

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:26.396
some of the other philosophers
that we talk about,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.097
especially this ideal
of ideal platonic forms.

00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:33.136
You can imagine, if you're
studying perfect right triangles,

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:35.782
there's no such thing as
a perfect right triangle

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:37.041
in the universe.

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:39.782
These are ideas that we use in geometry,

00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:41.440
and other things in the universe

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.206
are really just approximations of these,

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:48.490
but to appreciate the
philosophical side of Pythagoras,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.101
here are some quotes from him,

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:53.268
or quotes ascribed to him.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.590
"There is geometry in the
humming of the strings.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.423
"There is music in the
spacing of the spheres.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.784
"Reason is immortal, all else mortal."

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.641
And you see even in the sixth century BCE

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.908
this thread of Greek thinking,

00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:16.457
putting reason at a very high level,

00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:18.383
not just trying to explain everything

00:03:18.383 --> 00:03:19.672
with pure mysticism,

00:03:19.672 --> 00:03:22.031
although Pythagoras definitely was,

00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.334
and Pythagoreanism was
definitely about mysticism,

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:27.294
but it was mysticism that at the core

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:30.042
had mathematics and geometry.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:32.414
But continuing on with significant

00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:36.061
mathematical contributions
from ancient Greece,

00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:37.311
we have Euclid.

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.188
We don't know all of the exact details

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:43.173
of his birth and his death,

00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:46.349
but he is the Father of Modern Geometry,

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.037
and as you can see in this map here,

00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:51.031
he didn't live in what we
call Greece proper today.

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:52.357
He lived in Alexandria,

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.910
a city established by Alexander the Great,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.099
and this is during the Hellenistic Period

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.826
where all of the territory,

00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:00.748
or most of the territory
that had been conquered

00:04:00.748 --> 00:04:04.620
by Alexander the Great was
still ruled by his successors.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.412
Egypt was ruled by Ptolemy,

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.692
establishing the Ptolemaic dynasty

00:04:08.692 --> 00:04:10.998
in the time of Euclid,

00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:13.129
and Euclid lived in that great center

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.036
of learning and the arts, Alexandria,

00:04:16.036 --> 00:04:18.036
which even exists today,

00:04:19.027 --> 00:04:22.277
and he is most famous for his Elements.

00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:28.170
This is a much later
printing of his Elements,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.051
of Euclid's eEements,

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:33.569
but you would be amazed
how much of modern geometry

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.485
has been described by Euclid.

00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:38.633
Even your geometry
textbook can trace it back

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:41.065
directly to Euclid's Elements.

00:04:41.065 --> 00:04:44.168
Abraham Lincoln famously
learned every proof

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:48.348
in Euclid's Elements in
order to fine tune his mind.

00:04:48.348 --> 00:04:50.069
So you can really view Euclid

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.236
as the Father of Geometry,

00:04:54.492 --> 00:04:55.948
but that's not all.

00:04:55.948 --> 00:04:59.839
There are many other contributors
in philosophy and math,

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.410
and this is just, once again, a sample

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.712
of all of the folks who contributed.

00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:06.172
On the side of philosophy,

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.406
you have Xenophon,

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:10.136
who was another one of Socrates' students

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:11.424
in addition to Plato,

00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:13.585
and in fact, the life of Socrates

00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:16.464
we learn from the writings
of Plato and Xenophon.

00:05:16.464 --> 00:05:18.176
Xenophon was also a historian

00:05:18.176 --> 00:05:20.816
who gave us some accounts of
the later Peloponnesian War.

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:23.816
You have the famous cynics,

00:05:23.816 --> 00:05:27.401
Antisthenes and his student Diogenes,

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.260
Diogenes, famous for living
in a barrel in Athens,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.899
and somewhat insulting
Alexander the Great.

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:35.717
But these cynics, which
the word is derived

00:05:35.717 --> 00:05:37.243
from being dog like,

00:05:37.243 --> 00:05:39.132
these are people who were philosophers

00:05:39.132 --> 00:05:41.704
who gave up the trappings of materialism

00:05:41.704 --> 00:05:44.327
and caring, frankly, what
other people thought.

00:05:44.327 --> 00:05:47.682
As we go a little bit out of
our timeline right over here,

00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:48.786
you have Archimedes,

00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:50.676
one of the greatest mathematicians

00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:52.926
and scientists of all time,

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.132
but you also have
contributions in the arts,

00:05:58.132 --> 00:06:02.349
some of the most famous
playwrights of the ancient time,

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.882
Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides.

00:06:04.882 --> 00:06:07.726
Aristophanes, we might
remember as being a bit

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:10.093
of a thorn in the side of Socrates.

00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:11.300
He wrote about Socrates,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.653
but it was more of a parody.

00:06:12.653 --> 00:06:14.971
You have contributions in medicine,

00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:16.948
the famous Hippocrates.

00:06:16.948 --> 00:06:19.828
The Hippocratic Oath
still has an influence

00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:22.021
on modern medicine.

00:06:22.021 --> 00:06:25.658
You have some of the earliest
what we could say historians

00:06:25.658 --> 00:06:26.975
that we know of,

00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:30.772
Herodotus, famously giving
us the accounts we have

00:06:30.772 --> 00:06:32.658
of the Greco-Persian Wars,

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:33.732
a lot of what we even know

00:06:33.732 --> 00:06:35.924
about the ancient Persian Empire.

00:06:35.924 --> 00:06:37.360
You have Thucydides,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.886
who gives us accounts
of the Peloponnesian War

00:06:39.886 --> 00:06:41.553
along with Xenophon.

00:06:42.963 --> 00:06:45.885
And so when you see this density

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:48.135
of arts, sciences, learning

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:50.456
in one place,

00:06:50.456 --> 00:06:53.283
a lot of this was centered in Athens.

00:06:53.283 --> 00:06:56.723
It makes you wonder what
was going on at that time,

00:06:56.723 --> 00:06:58.937
and historians do call the period

00:06:58.937 --> 00:07:03.488
from when the Athenians were
able to fend off the Persians

00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:06.902
all the way until the end
of the Peloponnesian War

00:07:06.902 --> 00:07:09.635
as the Golden Age of Athens,

00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:10.594
and for good reason.

00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:13.624
Look at this flourishing of
the arts and the sciences

00:07:13.624 --> 00:07:16.137
that developed during that period.

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:20.178
You might wonder what was
happening in terms of government,

00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:23.411
and government of this period might be one

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:25.836
of the longest lasting influences.

00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:29.169
As we exit the sixth century BCE in 507,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.357
you have Greek Democracy
taking root in Athens,

00:07:36.362 --> 00:07:38.986
and in fact, the word
democracy is a Greek word,

00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:40.925
government by the people.

00:07:40.925 --> 00:07:42.822
And shortly after that,

00:07:42.822 --> 00:07:46.286
during the Golden Age of Athens,

00:07:46.286 --> 00:07:49.619
you start having leadership by Pericles.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:52.169
He was an orator.

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:53.084
He was a statesman.

00:07:53.084 --> 00:07:54.315
He was a general.

00:07:54.315 --> 00:07:55.994
In this period right over here

00:07:55.994 --> 00:07:56.974
that I have in orange,

00:07:56.974 --> 00:07:59.582
often known as the Age of Pericles,

00:07:59.582 --> 00:08:01.974
he helped Athens invest significantly

00:08:01.974 --> 00:08:04.641
in the arts and in architecture.

00:08:05.765 --> 00:08:07.348
Some of the most iconic structures

00:08:07.348 --> 00:08:10.246
we now associate with
Greece or ancient Greece

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:12.972
were built during his time.

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:14.814
They were promoted by him.

00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:17.700
Here you have a picture of the Acropolis,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.685
which is this rock outcropping,

00:08:19.685 --> 00:08:21.262
which still exists in Athens

00:08:21.262 --> 00:08:25.090
as it likely looked during
the time of Pericles,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.804
during the Golden Age of Athens,

00:08:27.804 --> 00:08:29.292
and you can see here in particular

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:30.446
the most famous structure.

00:08:30.446 --> 00:08:33.181
The Parthenon, a lot of
which still stands today,

00:08:33.181 --> 00:08:37.388
was constructed under
the rule of Pericles.

00:08:37.388 --> 00:08:39.672
As I mentioned, the Greek
city states get conquered

00:08:39.672 --> 00:08:41.036
by the Macedonians,

00:08:41.036 --> 00:08:43.300
but after the death of
Alexander the Great,

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.964
falls under the control
of the Antigonid dynasty,

00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:48.748
but eventually, as we get
into the second century BCE,

00:08:48.748 --> 00:08:50.283
off of this timeline,

00:08:50.283 --> 00:08:52.454
it comes under Roman control,

00:08:52.454 --> 00:08:55.038
becomes part of the Roman Empire.

00:08:55.038 --> 00:08:58.932
But the Roman Empire is itself
significantly influenced

00:08:58.932 --> 00:09:01.336
by Greek culture, Greek mathematics,

00:09:01.336 --> 00:09:04.198
Greek architecture, Greek philosophy,

00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:05.666
and in a lot of ways,

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:08.481
the Romans end up becoming the caretakers

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:12.209
of much of this culture that
we talk about in this video,

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:14.566
and once you have the
decline of the Roman Empire,

00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:16.824
especially the western Roman Empire,

00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:19.771
and Europe enters into the Middle Ages,

00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:22.361
you have the Islamic world that acts

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:23.690
as a bit of a bridge

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.975
of this Greek culture into
the European Renaissance

00:09:27.975 --> 00:09:29.664
and eventually the Enlightenment.

00:09:29.664 --> 00:09:32.658
And so we can trace even our modern views

00:09:32.658 --> 00:09:34.656
of science and philosophy

00:09:34.656 --> 00:09:37.431
all the way back to these Greeks,

00:09:37.431 --> 00:09:40.360
and so I'll leave you with this quote

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.527
from the Roman poet Horace

00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:46.743
who wrote this around
the first century BCE.

00:09:46.743 --> 00:09:50.377
"Captive Greece took
captive her fierce conqueror

00:09:50.377 --> 00:09:54.544
"and instilled her arts in
rustic Latium," or Laecium.

00:09:55.592 --> 00:09:56.945
And so what he's saying is,

00:09:56.945 --> 00:09:59.674
even though Rome had conquered Greece,

00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:02.740
Greece's culture took
captive her conqueror,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.847
took captive the Roman culture,

00:10:05.847 --> 00:10:09.613
instilled Greece's arts
in the rustic Latin world.
