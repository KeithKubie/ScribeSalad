00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700
an element of him that encouraged you
 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.790
an element of him that encouraged you
hopefully because without the

world is a dismal place very difficult
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.390
world is a dismal place very difficult
to be a courageous person unless you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
to be a courageous person unless you
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000
to be a courageous person unless you
have your father in body and spirit

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010
have your father in body and spirit
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.120
have your father in body and spirit
behind you it's very demoralizing like

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
behind you it's very demoralizing like
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250
behind you it's very demoralizing like
it really kills people not to have their

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260
it really kills people not to have their
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.230
it really kills people not to have their
mother they just don't recover from that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
mother they just don't recover from that
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.439
mother they just don't recover from that
but and I think people can recover from

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
but and I think people can recover from
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.440
but and I think people can recover from
a fragmented father relationship but

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
a fragmented father relationship but
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.530
a fragmented father relationship but
it's the next worst thing you know

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
it's the next worst thing you know
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.540
it's the next worst thing you know
because if your father rejects you or

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
because if your father rejects you or
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.040
because if your father rejects you or
doesn't form a relationship with you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
doesn't form a relationship with you
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.619
doesn't form a relationship with you
it's as if the spirit of civilization

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
it's as if the spirit of civilization
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.680
it's as if the spirit of civilization
has left you outside the walls as of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
has left you outside the walls as of
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.690
has left you outside the walls as of
littleworth it's very difficult for

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
littleworth it's very difficult for
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.549
littleworth it's very difficult for
people to recover from that so the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
people to recover from that so the
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.229
people to recover from that so the
father should be an encouraging force

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
father should be an encouraging force
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.389
father should be an encouraging force
but can be a tyrannical and crushing

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399
but can be a tyrannical and crushing
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.119
but can be a tyrannical and crushing
force and so that's very that's a very

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
force and so that's very that's a very
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.680
force and so that's very that's a very
difficult thing to get right partly

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
difficult thing to get right partly
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.540
difficult thing to get right partly
because if you're my son then I should

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
because if you're my son then I should
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.149
because if you're my son then I should
impose the highest standards of behavior

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
impose the highest standards of behavior
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.520
impose the highest standards of behavior
on you and I should always be judging

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
on you and I should always be judging
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.190
on you and I should always be judging
what you're doing why should be judging

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
what you're doing why should be judging
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770
what you're doing why should be judging
it with with the aim of making the best

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
it with with the aim of making the best
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.310
it with with the aim of making the best
in you come forward but but getting that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
in you come forward but but getting that
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.380
in you come forward but but getting that
balance exactly right is very difficult

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
balance exactly right is very difficult
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.899
balance exactly right is very difficult
and so it's easy to for a father to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
and so it's easy to for a father to
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.330
and so it's easy to for a father to
swing too much into judgment let's say

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
swing too much into judgment let's say
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070
swing too much into judgment let's say
and then of course mothers can play this

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
and then of course mothers can play this
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020
and then of course mothers can play this
rule too to swing too far into the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
rule too to swing too far into the
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789
rule too to swing too far into the
domain of judgment and to be too harsh

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
domain of judgment and to be too harsh
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649
domain of judgment and to be too harsh
and to the degree that the father has

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
and to the degree that the father has
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109
and to the degree that the father has
his own pathologies he's going to do

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
his own pathologies he's going to do
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999
his own pathologies he's going to do
that imperfectly you know he might be

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
that imperfectly you know he might be
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.030
that imperfectly you know he might be
someone who's who's the father who

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
someone who's who's the father who
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.190
someone who's who's the father who
devours his son because he's jealous of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
devours his son because he's jealous of
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.950
devours his son because he's jealous of
the new possibility the new potential

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
the new possibility the new potential
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.580
the new possibility the new potential
that the struggle for for attention and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
that the struggle for for attention and
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020
that the struggle for for attention and
love from the mother or from the other

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
love from the mother or from the other
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.609
love from the mother or from the other
children in the family there's all sorts

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
children in the family there's all sorts
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.450
children in the family there's all sorts
of things that can go terribly wrong so

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
of things that can go terribly wrong so
 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.219
of things that can go terribly wrong so
that's the father as wise King and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
that's the father as wise King and
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.920
that's the father as wise King and
that's another symbol that's been lost I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
that's another symbol that's been lost I
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.899
that's another symbol that's been lost I
would say to a massive degree in modern

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
would say to a massive degree in modern
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330
would say to a massive degree in modern
universities because all we're taught is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
universities because all we're taught is
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.719
universities because all we're taught is
to tear that down and to not even notice

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
to tear that down and to not even notice
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310
to tear that down and to not even notice
that it manifests itself everywhere

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
that it manifests itself everywhere

that it manifests itself everywhere
especially in the universities which are

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
especially in the universities which are
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.729
especially in the universities which are
like they're as close to an ideal

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
like they're as close to an ideal

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
imperfections then then you're
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.809
imperfections then then you're
completely blind to this element of the
