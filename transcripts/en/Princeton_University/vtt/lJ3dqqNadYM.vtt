00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.950
Is this on?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.120
My favorite Princeton experience. That’s a really hard one.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.640
It’s really hard to answer the question

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.020
of what’s my favorite experience.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.450
My favorite Princeton moment was, winning the Ivy League

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.150
championships this year.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.260
One of my favorite things at Princeton was the ‘Skate Nights.’

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.340
It was an event called Princeton Palooza where there was music,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.920
and just like a lot of bands outside in the 1903 Courtyard. It

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.590
was Communiversity. It was a really wonderful day.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.850
I guess my favorite Princeton experiences would be working with

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.760
Black Box Inc. and Hip Hop Art &amp; Life.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.993
Our favorite moment at Princeton… Was playing

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.560
on the squash team together.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020
Woo hoo! And house parties.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.780
I would have to say, as bad as it sounds, my favorite experience

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.240
was writing my thesis.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.160
My favorite Princeton moment was when I went to go turn in my

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.020
thesis. I was rushing from Firestone to 1879 and I ran into one

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.240
of my good friends giving a tour, and the entire tour cheered me

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.460
on as I made it the rest of the way to turn it in.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.830
My favorite Princeton experience was freshman

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.350
seminar with Chris Eisgruber.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.580
My favorite Princeton moment was meeting Sonya Sotomayor at the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.770
Latinas at Princeton reception. It was a great experience and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.390
she shared a lot of great Princeton memories.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.790
My favorite Princeton moment was definitely getting the chance

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.560
to interview the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.160
When I was able to go abroad, for instance, to Beijing with

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.090
Princeton in Asia. And especially to Ghana with Engineers

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.040
Without Borders.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.020
My favorite thing about Princeton was my opportunity to study

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.610
abroad in Cuba.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.020
The best elements at Princeton: The faculty, the students, and

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.370
doing fun activities.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.260
I think my favorite experience was like, getting to know all the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.110
faculty in the Visual Arts program.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.040
Last year, I had the honor of being the drum major of the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.840
Princeton University band, so I got to lead the P-rade through

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.820
the Fitzrandolph gate leading the 25th reunion. And it was just

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.210
absolutely…just seeing all those orange and black jackets and

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.850
all those smiling faces and people who were so excited to see

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.170
us…absolutely was like, the best thing of my life and I can’t

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.910
wait to walk in the P-rade this year as a senior.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.780
My favorite Princeton experience, definitely has to be every

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.760
year during reunions, the P-rade. Just seeing all the tradition,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.880
all the orange, all the old alums, you know. Meeting alums that

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.280
are 100 years old and having them shake your hand, and just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.940
having that experience together definitely gives you the sense

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.230
that Princeton is going to be part of your life forever.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.470
Alright, but what are we going to say though? 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.490
I don’t know.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.410
I am a chemistry major.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.360

Ohh, so nervous!

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.060
I guess what helped me get through Princeton was probably a lot

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.520
of support from my friends and family.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.050
The people who helped me get through Princeton are my closest

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.320
friends: People I eat with, people I study with, people I party

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.980
with. It really is an incredible group of intellectuals and good

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.050
people.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.730
All my good friends and roommates

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.950
My family and my friends here at Princeton

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.160
My roommates have been extraordinary. I was very lucky to be

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.630
placed with three amazing girls in my freshman quad and I’m

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.930
still living with them as a senior. And we’re all different

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.130
races and its been a real lesson in how to interact across

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.830
racial boundaries.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.110
My parents, and my sister

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.930
My roommates, and my parents and my brother

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.770
My parents definitely. Um, God….don’t think I would’ve made it

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.850
through.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.820
My thesis advisor, my live advisor. I could not have done it

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.650
without him.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.130
The Varsity Women’s Ice Hockey team and all my teammates and

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.310
coaches

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.470
Definitely the teammates on the Crew team and the other

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.290
Chemistry majors were a huge help.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.740
Shirley Tilghman, she was an inspiration. And has taught me to

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.040
try and become as professional and inspirational as she is.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.090
Definitely having a very very kind thesis advisor

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.310
I think, all my class experiences

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.750
The great professors at Princeton helped me to succeed, and I

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.750
hope that I’ll go on in the future and be an academic like them.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.250
I think, my friends here helped me get through the Princeton

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.380
experience…as well as Frist, especially when it’s open 24 hours

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.680
which it should be all the time.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.470
Frist Campus Center as an entity. It’s a good place to meet all

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.030
your friends.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.520
What got me through Princeton? Uh, gallons of coffee

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.960
Definitely the 24 hour access to 185 the art building for the

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.630
Lewis Center

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.210
I think there is a lot of solidarity among students at

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.760
Princeton.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.050
I guess my friends really got me through Princeton. Wouldn’t

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.350
have made it without ‘em.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.080
My friends

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.050
My family and friends

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.020
My friends

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.520
Uh, friends

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.970
My friends pretty much got me by.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.250
All of my friends

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.990
My friends

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.920
My friends

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.490
I couldn’t have done it without the friends that I made here.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.010
I’m so grateful that I met them and I’m going to be friends with

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.020
them forever.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:04.440
Four years are actually a really short time. Coming in as a

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.590
Freshman, I thought four years would be an eternity, but they’re

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.190
not.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:17.437
Do anything and everything you want to and don’t hold back.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.890
Remember that four years just goes by so quickly, so enjoy every

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.550
moment, every day, even the hard days. It’s worth it. It’s such

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.590
a great place to be. We’re so blessed.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.740
Today, you leave this privileged place as the beneficiaries of a

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.040
world class education. 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.580
One that I hope has prepared you well for whatever comes next,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.010
including the unexpected. 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.420
So as you walk, skip, or run through the Fitzrandolph gates

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.330
today as educated citizens of this and many other nations, I

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.750
hope you will carry forward the spirit of Princeton and all it

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.140
has sought to teach you. Aim high and be bold!

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:36.290
[music]

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.950
It’s sad, it’s so sad.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.030
But we know we’ll be friends past this so it’s ok.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:47.830
[music]

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:55.010
Getting some good hard work, getting work done, and doing it for

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:55.560
Princeton.
