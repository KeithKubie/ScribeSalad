00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.180
If you’re watching this video on a laptop
in-between watching more cat videos, you may

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.340
have noticed the sound of fans whirring away,
trying to keep your slim technological miracle

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.730
of form and function cool.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.799
Heat is a natural enemy of electronics, it
can cause computers to slow and crash, and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.009
damage important hardware to boot.

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.599
So scientists at Duke University have been
exploring a new technique inspired by insect

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.259
wings to keep your CPU as cool as you are.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.609
The concept behind every cooling system ever
is basically the same: take heat from a hot

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.469
area, move it to somewhere less hot, repeat
ad infinitum.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.390
The details of how different systems do this
exactly can vary a lot, and they range from

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.300
simple to ingenious.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.690
Heat sinks just let the electronics warm a
set of metal fins with a large surface area

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.240
while a fan blows cool air over the fins.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.679
The air warms up, absorbing the heat, and
then is blown away.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.809
Only the most powerful pre 90s computers needed
these but now they’re a staple of home computers

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.489
and have made higher processing speeds possible.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.569
Heat pipes contain liquid and use heat to
turn it into a vapor, which then travels to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:05.290
a cooler part of the pipe to condense again.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.380
The liquid then naturally flows back to the
hot areas along grooves on the inside of the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.479
pipe because the liquid is attracted to the
material, a phenomenon called capillary action.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.180
No pumps or gravity are required, so this
is the technique many satellites use to manage

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.930
heat in space.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.549
Like a heat pipe, the new system developed
at Duke also uses vaporizing liquid as a means

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:26.930
to carry heat away.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.090
A sponge-like material filled with liquid
rests just under the surface that needs to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.090
be cooled.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.149
The liquid absorbs the heat until it turns
into vapor and leaves the sponge -- taking

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.899
the heat with it.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.240
Below the sponge is a cool surface for the
liquid to condense on, but it’s been specially

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.740
designed to be superhydrophobic.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.350
I’m not talking regular hydrophobic, like
oil and water.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.320
I mean super-hydrophobic like a cat, it actively
repels it.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.970
It does this by mimicking the microscopic
bumps on the wings of a cicada.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.110
Condensing water droplets sit on these bumps
like a person sits on a bed of nails.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.149
When droplets merge though, they leap into
the air.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.640
This is because when the two droplets come
together, their overall surface area is reduced.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.410
The energy that was once used to keep the
droplets flat on the hydrophobic surface is

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.410
suddenly released, popping the drop straight
up.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.770
Cicadas use this phenomenon to keep their
wings clean, while the cooler uses it to return

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.820
liquid to the sponge.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.000
There are a few benefits of a cooling system
like this.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.300
It works in any orientation and is independent
of gravity.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.080
It can also passively cool moving hotspots
that naturally occur; If an area of the electronic

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.390
device gets hotter than the rest, it’ll
just evaporate more liquid from the sponge.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.960
Other techniques either can’t target hotspots
at all -- making them ill suited to cool large

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.590
areas -- or they have to use power to target
moving hotspots, making them less efficient.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.750
The technology has a ways to go before it’s
ready, as the scientists have to find materials

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.590
that will last long term, but they’re optimistic
about their progress so far.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.300
After working on this for a few years, the
researchers claim their technique is on par

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.220
with the performance of the most common technology
used now: copper heat spreaders, but has the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.900
potential to surpass it.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.450
While new technologies that promise to make
high performance electronics and electric

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.620
cars better is exciting, my favorite part
of the story is the researchers who developed

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.860
this technology are the same ones who first
observed how cicada wings repelled water.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.790
Back in 2013 they suggested it might be used
as a way to cool devices, and here we are

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.670
four years later and they’re doing exactly
what they imagined they would.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.720
Don’t you love the progress of science?

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.650
You’re probably watching this video on a
phone or a computer right now, hopefully it’s

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.600
cool, but is staring at screens all day really
bad for your eyes?
