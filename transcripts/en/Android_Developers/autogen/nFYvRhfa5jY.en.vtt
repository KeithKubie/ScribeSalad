then we'll dig just a little bit deeper

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.730
then we'll dig just a little bit deeper
to learn some of the tricks for

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
to learn some of the tricks for
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.099

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.849
 
so what is a podcast creation act yeah I

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
so what is a podcast creation act yeah I
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.099
so what is a podcast creation act yeah I
was wondering that myself because I know

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
was wondering that myself because I know
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.220
was wondering that myself because I know
about podcast abs and when I first saw

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
about podcast abs and when I first saw
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.659
about podcast abs and when I first saw
that that this is what we were doing I

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
that that this is what we were doing I
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.979
that that this is what we were doing I
thought oh let me bring out you know

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
thought oh let me bring out you know
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.870
thought oh let me bring out you know
beyondpod dog catcher and all my

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
beyondpod dog catcher and all my
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.580
beyondpod dog catcher and all my
favorite it's a popular category but

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
favorite it's a popular category but
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.430
favorite it's a popular category but
this is different these apps often will

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
this is different these apps often will
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.170
this is different these apps often will
let you listen to a podcast but they're

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
let you listen to a podcast but they're
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.420
let you listen to a podcast but they're
really geared towards the creator of the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
really geared towards the creator of the
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.069
really geared towards the creator of the
podcast absolutely so it's an

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
podcast absolutely so it's an
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.750
podcast absolutely so it's an
interesting idea it's this notion that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
interesting idea it's this notion that
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.209
interesting idea it's this notion that
you have a phone it has a microphone a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
you have a phone it has a microphone a
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.470
you have a phone it has a microphone a
lot of the times when you want to be

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
lot of the times when you want to be
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540
lot of the times when you want to be
creating cool content to share with

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550
creating cool content to share with
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.560
creating cool content to share with
people you're going to be out and about

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
people you're going to be out and about
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110
people you're going to be out and about
why not do that on your phone sure so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
why not do that on your phone sure so
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000
why not do that on your phone sure so
there's actually not a huge number of

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
there's actually not a huge number of
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040
there's actually not a huge number of
podcast creation apps out there or at

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
podcast creation apps out there or at
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.349
podcast creation apps out there or at
least not that I could find so we're

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
least not that I could find so we're
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.460
least not that I could find so we're
gonna have a look at a couple today

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
gonna have a look at a couple today
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899
gonna have a look at a couple today
which have been around for a little

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
which have been around for a little
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.210
which have been around for a little
while and look at what they've done what

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
while and look at what they've done what
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.350
while and look at what they've done what
they've done right what they could have

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
they've done right what they could have
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.690
they've done right what they could have
done better and then dig a little bit

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
done better and then dig a little bit
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.950
done better and then dig a little bit
deeper and maybe share some of that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
deeper and maybe share some of that
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480
deeper and maybe share some of that
knowledge as to how you can create an

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
knowledge as to how you can create an
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.609
knowledge as to how you can create an
app which does something similar

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619
app which does something similar
 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.300
app which does something similar
particularly because it seems like it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
particularly because it seems like it
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.649
particularly because it seems like it
may be an underserved market so let's

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
may be an underserved market so let's
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.630
may be an underserved market so let's
have a look at the key sort of features

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
have a look at the key sort of features
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149
have a look at the key sort of features
for podcasting so the the central things

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
for podcasting so the the central things
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.740
for podcasting so the the central things
which you're going to need record audio

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
which you're going to need record audio
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810
which you're going to need record audio
sure if that seems like a fairly

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
sure if that seems like a fairly
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850
sure if that seems like a fairly
straightforward but not just record

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
straightforward but not just record
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.560
straightforward but not just record
audio this is really important because

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
audio this is really important because
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020
audio this is really important because
the way that these apps differ from

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
the way that these apps differ from
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480
the way that these apps differ from
normal recording app is that they need

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
normal recording app is that they need
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280
normal recording app is that they need
to record a lot of audio they need to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
to record a lot of audio they need to
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.380
to record a lot of audio they need to
stay recording for a very long period of

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
stay recording for a very long period of
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510
stay recording for a very long period of
time absolutely and of course you need

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
time absolutely and of course you need
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.980
time absolutely and of course you need
to be able to do that audio playback and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
to be able to do that audio playback and
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.020
to be able to do that audio playback and
not just for the podcast which you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
not just for the podcast which you
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359
not just for the podcast which you
create but also for other podcasts from

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
create but also for other podcasts from
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.160
create but also for other podcasts from
the community which you generally

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
the community which you generally
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660
the community which you generally
belonging yeah I wouldn't say that's an

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
belonging yeah I wouldn't say that's an
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.399
belonging yeah I wouldn't say that's an
absolute necessity but it seems to be a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
absolute necessity but it seems to be a
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230
absolute necessity but it seems to be a
really popular feature yeah I think it's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
really popular feature yeah I think it's
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179
really popular feature yeah I think it's
a it helps you become a better part of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
a it helps you become a better part of
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.620
a it helps you become a better part of
that community of you understand some of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
that community of you understand some of
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.700
that community of you understand some of
the things which other people are doing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
the things which other people are doing
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.340
the things which other people are doing
help be inspired absolutely I wouldn't

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
help be inspired absolutely I wouldn't
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.530
help be inspired absolutely I wouldn't
mind seeing a little bit on playback in

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
mind seeing a little bit on playback in
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.979
mind seeing a little bit on playback in

podcasts on your phone which is arguably
not the the best platform for a

not the the best platform for a
 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.110
not the the best platform for a
recording audio is that you can do it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
recording audio is that you can do it
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.940
recording audio is that you can do it
while you're on the go so having some

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
while you're on the go so having some
 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.159
while you're on the go so having some
more integration with geolocation

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169
more integration with geolocation
 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.720
more integration with geolocation
mappings that you can see where these

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
mappings that you can see where these
 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.250

really nice absolutely and finally
 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.479
really nice absolutely and finally
exactly what aim was referring to some

your podcast being able to do some audio
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.789
your podcast being able to do some audio
audio manipulation i think would be a

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799
audio manipulation i think would be a
 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.069
audio manipulation i think would be a
real win now one thing that a lot of

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079
real win now one thing that a lot of
 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.920

without signing in now all of these
things are on the page most of them have

slightly different UI elements that
 

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:14.619
slightly different UI elements that
there's four buttons but they're in two

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:14.629
there's four buttons but they're in two
 

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.600
there's four buttons but they're in two
different colors does that mean anything

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:16.610
different colors does that mean anything
 

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.889
different colors does that mean anything
do the different colored buttons

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:17.899
do the different colored buttons
 

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:20.230
do the different colored buttons
represent a different kind of choice if

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240

I've forgotten my password that's a link
so there's all of these different ways

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:24.020
so there's all of these different ways
 

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.839
so there's all of these different ways
of being able to proceed and it can be

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:25.849
of being able to proceed and it can be

quite confronting to a new user to try
to figure out I just I just want to get

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:29.719
to figure out I just I just want to get
 

00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:31.689
to figure out I just I just want to get
to the app now I should point out that

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:31.699
to the app now I should point out that
 

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:33.159
to the app now I should point out that
both the first screen in this screen

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:33.169
both the first screen in this screen
 

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:34.630
both the first screen in this screen
both have a button that will just let

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640
both have a button that will just let
 

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.100
both have a button that will just let
you skip forward to the actual app

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.110
you skip forward to the actual app
 

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.139
you skip forward to the actual app
itself but it's kind of buried amongst

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:38.149
itself but it's kind of buried amongst
 

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:40.630
itself but it's kind of buried amongst
all this other stuff so again here I'd

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640
all this other stuff so again here I'd
 

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.870
all this other stuff so again here I'd
really suggest that you try and cut that

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880
really suggest that you try and cut that
 

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.460
really suggest that you try and cut that
as much as possible make it as simple as

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:44.470
as much as possible make it as simple as
 

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.140
as much as possible make it as simple as
you can make that login process as

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.150
you can make that login process as
 

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.120
you can make that login process as
simple as you can and possibly put that

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.130
simple as you can and possibly put that
 

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.710
simple as you can and possibly put that
further into your app once you get to

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720
further into your app once you get to
 

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.570
further into your app once you get to
the point where they need to be logged

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:51.580
the point where they need to be logged
 

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.600
the point where they need to be logged
in to do something now again in terms of

in to do something now again in terms of

in to do something now again in terms of

Android controls on screen and I noticed

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:57.970
Android controls on screen and I noticed
 

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.880
Android controls on screen and I noticed
that even the text views a custom they

00:08:59.880 --> 00:08:59.890
that even the text views a custom they
 

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.260
that even the text views a custom they
don't actually display the cursor

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:01.270
don't actually display the cursor
 

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.760
don't actually display the cursor
position when I have them selected and

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:02.770
position when I have them selected and
 

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.440
position when I have them selected and
it's worth noting that the buttons

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.450
it's worth noting that the buttons
 

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.150
it's worth noting that the buttons
themselves don't respond visibly to

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160
themselves don't respond visibly to
 

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.190
themselves don't respond visibly to
being touched so again you press the

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200
being touched so again you press the
 

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.110
being touched so again you press the
button nothing happens until you let go

and you'll take into the next to the

spectral analyzer so I can see you know
which frequencies are being recorded

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360
which frequencies are being recorded
 

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.530
which frequencies are being recorded
it's kind of non-trivial to implement

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:20.540
it's kind of non-trivial to implement
 

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.260
it's kind of non-trivial to implement
but it looks really awesome so it's

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.270
but it looks really awesome so it's
 

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.220
but it looks really awesome so it's
something which I may be worth looking

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.230
something which I may be worth looking
 

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.040
something which I may be worth looking
at I think well do you want to have a

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.050
at I think well do you want to have a
 

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.830
at I think well do you want to have a
spectrum with more elements than 16 not

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:29.840
spectrum with more elements than 16 not
 

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.800
spectrum with more elements than 16 not
necessarily I think he could do a 69

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:31.810
necessarily I think he could do a 69
 

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.850
necessarily I think he could do a 69
would be fine you just want something

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:33.860
would be fine you just want something
 

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.010
would be fine you just want something
that usually did it might be a spectral

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.020
that usually did it might be a spectral
 

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.540
that usually did it might be a spectral
analyzer I was I was trying some

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:37.550
analyzer I was I was trying some
 

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.680
analyzer I was I was trying some
different fridges it's hard to do with

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:38.690
different fridges it's hard to do with
 

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.080
different fridges it's hard to do with
your voice but I think I noticed a few

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.090
your voice but I think I noticed a few
 

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.760
your voice but I think I noticed a few
differences I think they actually might

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:42.770
differences I think they actually might
 

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.920
differences I think they actually might
be doing a like a Fourier transform on

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:44.930
be doing a like a Fourier transform on
 

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.480
be doing a like a Fourier transform on
that that would be kind of cool it would

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.490
that that would be kind of cool it would
 

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.010
that that would be kind of cool it would
be I will have to investigate further or

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:48.020
be I will have to investigate further or
 

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.480
be I will have to investigate further or
perhaps the audio boob guys can reach

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:49.490
perhaps the audio boob guys can reach
 

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.270
perhaps the audio boob guys can reach
out and let us know if I'm just being an

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:52.280
out and let us know if I'm just being an
 

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.590
out and let us know if I'm just being an
idiot yeah we'll talk about that later

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600
idiot yeah we'll talk about that later
 

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.720
idiot yeah we'll talk about that later
yeah it's generally the KPD apart yeah

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:55.730
yeah it's generally the KPD apart yeah
 

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.750
yeah it's generally the KPD apart yeah
absolutely he also pointed out how nice

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760
absolutely he also pointed out how nice
 

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.310
absolutely he also pointed out how nice
it would be to see the audio levels or

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320
it would be to see the audio levels or
 

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.050
it would be to see the audio levels or
the times that I confirm the things that

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.060
the times that I confirm the things that
 

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.460
the times that I confirm the things that
I've been recording have actually been

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:03.470
I've been recording have actually been
 

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.410
I've been recording have actually been
recording so basically just that volume

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:05.420
recording so basically just that volume
 

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.660
recording so basically just that volume
but over a period of time to see how it

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:07.670
but over a period of time to see how it
 

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.090
but over a period of time to see how it
all go

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100
all go
 

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.620
all go
and again if you take it to that next

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:09.630
and again if you take it to that next
 

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.569
and again if you take it to that next
step and provide some ability to do

00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579
step and provide some ability to do
 

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:14.210
step and provide some ability to do
edits to do punching punch outs it's a

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220
edits to do punching punch outs it's a
 

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.499
edits to do punching punch outs it's a
really easy way for you to be able to

00:13:15.499 --> 00:13:15.509
really easy way for you to be able to
 

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:16.999
really easy way for you to be able to
see where those different segments of

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:17.009
see where those different segments of
 

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:21.620
see where those different segments of
your Oreo are now once i'm done i have

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:21.630
your Oreo are now once i'm done i have
 

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.569
your Oreo are now once i'm done i have
this awesome button at the top which is

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579
this awesome button at the top which is
 

00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:27.559
this awesome button at the top which is
a slave / delete button which is quite a

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:27.569
a slave / delete button which is quite a
 

00:13:27.569 --> 00:13:29.720
a slave / delete button which is quite a
dichotomy and I'd really strongly

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:29.730
dichotomy and I'd really strongly
 

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.309
dichotomy and I'd really strongly
suggest that you separate these it's

00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:31.319
suggest that you separate these it's
 

00:13:31.319 --> 00:13:33.230
suggest that you separate these it's
very unlikely that anyone is going to be

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240
very unlikely that anyone is going to be
 

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.400
very unlikely that anyone is going to be
particularly comfortable hitting a

particularly comfortable hitting a
 

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.379
particularly comfortable hitting a
button that says either save or delete

00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:36.389
button that says either save or delete
 

00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:39.230
button that says either save or delete
it's a 50-50 chance we'll see what

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240
it's a 50-50 chance we'll see what
 

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.650
it's a 50-50 chance we'll see what
happens that said the recording itself

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660
happens that said the recording itself
 

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.210
happens that said the recording itself
seemed to work pretty well I didn't

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220
seemed to work pretty well I didn't
 

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.069
seemed to work pretty well I didn't
notice any issues I think Ian you said

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079
notice any issues I think Ian you said
 

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.150
notice any issues I think Ian you said
that there was some cut outs when you

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160
that there was some cut outs when you
 

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.499
that there was some cut outs when you
were doing some testing well I did get a

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:48.509
were doing some testing well I did get a
 

00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:50.120
were doing some testing well I did get a
drop out on playback but I think that's

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.130
drop out on playback but I think that's
 

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:55.040
drop out on playback but I think that's
actually a reported bug for jb4 point to

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.050
actually a reported bug for jb4 point to
 

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.400
actually a reported bug for jb4 point to
point to that there are some cases where

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:58.410
point to that there are some cases where
 

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.110
point to that there are some cases where
audio track or open SL can drop the last

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120
audio track or open SL can drop the last
 

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.090
audio track or open SL can drop the last
few milliseconds of a track that's

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100
few milliseconds of a track that's
 

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.379
few milliseconds of a track that's
interesting yeah so I didn't notice any

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:06.389
interesting yeah so I didn't notice any
 

00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:09.670
interesting yeah so I didn't notice any
problems it could very well be our fault

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680
problems it could very well be our fault
 

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.870
problems it could very well be our fault
but anyway in any case that all seemed

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880
but anyway in any case that all seemed
 

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.100
but anyway in any case that all seemed
to work pretty well and I really love to

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.110
to work pretty well and I really love to
 

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.620
to work pretty well and I really love to
see like I said that ability to start to

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:15.630
see like I said that ability to start to
 

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.970
see like I said that ability to start to
trim the start and ends of my booze

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980
trim the start and ends of my booze
 

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.769
trim the start and ends of my booze

00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:22.370
before I upload them and publish them

easier to get started and overall it
 

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:33.410
easier to get started and overall it
really just needs to take a close look

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420
really just needs to take a close look
 

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.090
really just needs to take a close look

happen to use the same color of chroma

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540
happen to use the same color of chroma
 

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.510
happen to use the same color of chroma
key green that we use for our the

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:32.520
key green that we use for our the
 

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.190
key green that we use for our the
transparency here so let's say let's

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:34.200
transparency here so let's say let's
 

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.110
transparency here so let's say let's
take a look at how that would look there

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120
take a look at how that would look there
 

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.920
take a look at how that would look there
we go yeah so that's exactly the way

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:39.930
we go yeah so that's exactly the way
 

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.690
we go yeah so that's exactly the way
which we think it should look is just

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:41.700
which we think it should look is just
 

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.700
which we think it should look is just

well exactly you know that that can help

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600
well exactly you know that that can help
 

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.870
well exactly you know that that can help

this is probably an app that hasn't

this is probably an app that hasn't
 

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.240
this is probably an app that hasn't
really been touched since probably

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.250
really been touched since probably

again most of the features are very
similar to audioboo you xui issues which

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:53.499
similar to audioboo you xui issues which

there's really a lot to gain by sticking
 

00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:09.269
there's really a lot to gain by sticking
to the standard rather than going your

experience is actually pretty similar to
what we saw in audioboo so I really

00:18:16.289 --> 00:18:16.299
what we saw in audioboo so I really
 

00:18:16.299 --> 00:18:18.119
what we saw in audioboo so I really
offer a lot of the same feedback and

for years you create an audio record

00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:12.729
for years you create an audio record
 

00:19:12.729 --> 00:19:15.239
for years you create an audio record
object and then you call read in a loop

we actually have a different problem
 

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.350
we actually have a different problem

morning and we you know had a Yap about

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:50.690
morning and we you know had a Yap about
 

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.690
morning and we you know had a Yap about
the old times and talked about recording

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:52.700
the old times and talked about recording
 

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.980
the old times and talked about recording
on Android and this is one of the things

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:53.990
on Android and this is one of the things
 

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.830
on Android and this is one of the things
that I hadn't realized but Glen said on

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840
that I hadn't realized but Glen said on
 

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.870
that I hadn't realized but Glen said on
the Nexus 7 he could actually measure

00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880
the Nexus 7 he could actually measure
 

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.830
the Nexus 7 he could actually measure
three to four seconds of latency going

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840
three to four seconds of latency going

from memory to persistent storage in
 

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.170
from memory to persistent storage in
that case to a flash memory so we're

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.180
that case to a flash memory so we're
 

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.780
that case to a flash memory so we're
actually talking about a very long

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:10.790
actually talking about a very long
 

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.670
actually talking about a very long
period of time now once things get

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:12.680
period of time now once things get
 

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.640
period of time now once things get
started the flash memory is capable of

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:15.650
started the flash memory is capable of
 

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.160
started the flash memory is capable of
writing just as fast as the microphone

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.170
writing just as fast as the microphone
 

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.800
writing just as fast as the microphone
is producing data much faster actually

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:20.810
is producing data much faster actually
 

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.170
is producing data much faster actually
but it takes a while to get started so

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:23.180
but it takes a while to get started so
 

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.760
but it takes a while to get started so
of course we need to fix this with our

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:27.770
of course we need to fix this with our
 

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.550
of course we need to fix this with our
old friend threads and extra buffers its

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:30.560
old friend threads and extra buffers its
 

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.410
old friend threads and extra buffers its
way if we fix every audio problem is

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:32.420
way if we fix every audio problem is
 

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.360
way if we fix every audio problem is
with a little bit of extra buffering so

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:34.370
with a little bit of extra buffering so
 

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.000
with a little bit of extra buffering so
here's how we do it we want to have one

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.010
here's how we do it we want to have one
 

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.420
here's how we do it we want to have one

this
audio record first is a blocking API

00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799
audio record first is a blocking API
 

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:50.980
audio record first is a blocking API
when you call read it will block until

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:50.990
when you call read it will block until
 

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.639
when you call read it will block until
the data has been read second it's not a

guaranteed delivery API in other words
if you don't call read often enough you

00:21:59.409 --> 00:21:59.419
if you don't call read often enough you
 

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:01.960
if you don't call read often enough you
simply will miss data the data will just

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:01.970
simply will miss data the data will just
 

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.730
simply will miss data the data will just
go off to some other app or or into the

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:03.740
go off to some other app or or into the
 

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.529
go off to some other app or or into the
bit bucket and you won't read it all so

00:22:05.529 --> 00:22:05.539
bit bucket and you won't read it all so
 

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:07.720
bit bucket and you won't read it all so
you get a drop out so you want one

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:07.730
you get a drop out so you want one
 

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.460
you get a drop out so you want one

the record thread in this diagram so
 

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.970
the record thread in this diagram so
every time it gets a buffer does two
