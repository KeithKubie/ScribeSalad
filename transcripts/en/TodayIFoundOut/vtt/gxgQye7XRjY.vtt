00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.370
One such method of self-mummification was
practiced by Japanese Shugendō monks as the

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.390
ultimate act of self denial.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.440
Shugendō is a form of Buddhism that originally
combined elements of Buddhism, animism, Old

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.290
Shinto, mountain worship, and Taoism, among
other religions.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.750
“Shugendō” itself means something to
the effect of “the way to spiritual power

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.940
through discipline”.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.900
The culmination of some of the Shugendō monk’s
lives was to voluntarily choose to mummify

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.710
themselves, a process called Sokushunbutsu.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.780
This ritual lasted around nine years, six
of which the monk would be alive for.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.510
The payoff for monks that achieved self-mummification
was that they were seen as a Buddha and were

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.719
then supposed to be placed in a temple for
others to see and honor.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.610
Failed attempts, which seems to have been
the case a large percentage of the time, resulted

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.020
in the bodies simply decomposing.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.090
As you might imagine, mummifying one’s self
is a process that is excruciatingly painful,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.280
hence why individuals who were successful
were considered to have achieved a state of

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.850
perfect enlightenment.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.780
The monks would begin by ceasing eating any
food except various nuts and seeds, with some

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.270
accounts stating that they were also allowed
to eat fruits and berries.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.610
They would also begin a regimented program
of heavy physical exercise, which they would

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.780
continue throughout this first period that
lasted one thousand days.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.720
During the next one thousand days, the monks
would further restrict their diet by only

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.810
eating bark and various roots, again with
some accounts stating that they were also

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.350
allowed to eat a limited amount of fruits
and berries.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.330
Near the end of this period, they would drink
regular draughts of a drink made from the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.200
sap of the Urushi tree.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.410
This tree’s sap is mildly poisonous and
is normally used as a natural lacquer.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.740
Ingesting the drink caused the person consuming
it to vomit frequently, further restricting

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.520
the body’s ability to obtain nutrients from
the sparse diet they ate.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.630
They would also rapidly lose bodily fluids
due to vomiting.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.560
This sap also has the mummifying side-effect
of acting as a preservative.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.000
In the final stage of self-mummification,
the monk’s body would be little more than

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.410
skin and bones.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.320
If the monk survived to this point, he would
lock himself into a stone tomb that was just

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.140
large enough for him to fit in, sitting in
the lotus position, which is a position he

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.739
would not move from until he died.

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.250
The tomb itself contained an air tube, so
that the monk could live for a time after

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.250
being entombed.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.540
It also contained a bell, which the monk would
ring on a daily basis to let those outside

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.800
the tomb know he was still alive.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.910
While in the tomb, the monk would sit in the
lotus position and meditate until death.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.700
Once the monk died and, thus, no longer rang
the bell each day, the breathing tube would

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.722
be removed and the tomb sealed for the final
thousand day period of the ritual.

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:48.150
At the end of this period, the tomb would
be opened to see if the monk was successful

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.560
in mummifying himself.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.220
If he was, the preserved body would be put
on display in the temple.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.992
Having successfully demonstrated mastery over
the physical, the priest would also then be

00:02:57.992 --> 00:02:59.220
declared a Buddha.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.070
This practice continued until around the 19th
century when it was outlawed by the Japanese

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.070
government.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.660
While the bodies of these monks were supposed
to be removed from their tombs after the final

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.220
thousand day period, archeologists have unearthed
some of these self-mummified monks very recently,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.310
implying that, for whatever reason, this removal
did not always happen, perhaps because the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:44.220
body was not seen to have been preserved well
enough, so was simply left where 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.910
it was.
