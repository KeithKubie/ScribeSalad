00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.040
Why Michael Jackson's Skin Turned White as
He Got Older

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.360
Many scandals marred Michael Jackson’s personal
life, overshadowing his otherwise remarkable

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.560
musical career.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.700
One such scandal was the obvious change in
his appearance, especially his skin color,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.359
which started from the mid-eighties to slowly
but surely turn from dark to white.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.470
By the mid-nineties when Jackson released
his album History (1995), it was more than

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.260
obvious even to his most dedicated fans that
the man of Thriller (1982) looked nothing

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.680
like the man who had recently married Elvis
Presley’s daughter, Lisa Marie.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.500
By this time, Michael Jackson was milky white;
a skin-color transition that started almost

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.190
a decade earlier was more or less complete.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.660
So what happened?

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.840
According to his family and Jackson himself,
the “King of Pop” had vitiligo, a condition

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.570
that causes depigmentation of parts of the
skin, which usually results in white spots

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.640
on the patient’s body; these are even more
noticeable if the person has a dark complexion

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.170
as in Jackson’s case.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.340
The 1 in 250 or so people who have this condition
typically first start seeing signs of it beginning

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.789
between 10 and 30 years old.

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.560
Approximately 30% of the people who have it
also have it run in their family, which is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.560
true of Jackson.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.049
In addition to this skin disorder, Jackson
also reportedly suffered from systemic lupus

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.530
erythematosus, which besides potentially being
a very serious condition can also cause loss

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.280
of skin pigmentation.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.749
When the controversy about his changing skin
color hit its zenith, Jackson spoke openly

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:42.060
about his vitiligo for the first time in an
interview he gave to Oprah in 1993.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.799
He said among other things,

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.439
It is something I cannot help.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.509
When people make up stories that I don’t
want to be who I am, it hurts me.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.710
It’s a problem for me.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.020
I can’t control it.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.619
But what about all the millions of people
who sit in the sun to become darker, to become

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.179
other than what they are.

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.950
Nobody says nothing about that.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.079
VitiligoIn the days after, at Jackson’s
request his condition was publicly confirmed

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.399
by his dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, who
also stated Jackson was first diagnosed with

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.180
the condition in 1984.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.380
It was also confirmed that he had lupus erythematosus,
but that it was in remission.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.500
Conspiracy theorists propose that there was
much more to it than this.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.739
That in fact Jackson had no such disease and
that he, instead, systematically bleached

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.090
his skin using Benoquin cream and other medical
cocktails in his quest to look like a white

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.090
person.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.690
The obvious and extensive cosmetic surgeries
he had on his eyebrows, eyelashes, lips, and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.620
nose only served to enforce the theory that
he was simply purposefully tweaking his appearance

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.650
even more by bleaching his skin.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.650
Vitiligo2So is there any truth to this?

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.500
Dr. Christopher Rogers, deputy medical examiner
at the Los Angeles Coroner’s Office and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.569
the man who conducted Michael Jackson’s
autopsy, chimed in on this after performing

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.080
the autopsy on Jackson.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.040
Dr. Rogers confirmed that Jackson indeed suffered
from vitiligo, most noticeably with patches

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.060
around his face, chest, abdomen, and arms.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.610
So did he also bleach his skin?

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.480
According to dermatologist Dr. Hanish Babu,
Jackson did; this is sometimes a treatment

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.569
used for those with vitiligo.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.940
When these white patches first started appearing,
you can see from certain of Jackson’s concert

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.989
footage that he was trying to mask them with
makeup matching his original skin color.

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.250
Once the patches became too numerous to easily
hide with makeup (and he supposedly became

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.790
tired of the extensive time needed to apply
the makeup every day), he switched strategies

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.629
and began the process of bleaching his skin,
supposedly under the care of his dermatologist

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.579
and using 20% monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone
(Benoquin Cream).

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.819
Much later, in June of 2009 after his death,
tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone were found

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.090
in Jackson’s home.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.640
As Dr. David Sawcer said, “some patients
with vitiligo get to the point where it makes

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.760
more sense to remove the brown bits because
so much of the skin is pale.”

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.849
Besides giving him a white complexion, this
also results in being prone to sun burns,

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.049
which is why in later years he often kept
himself nearly completely covered when outside

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.049
in the sun.

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.049
(See What Causes Sunburns and How Sunscreen
Prevents It)

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.909
In the end, only Jackson knew his true motivation
for ultimately choosing to bleach his skin,

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.840
whether as a treatment for his vitiligo to
even out his skin color as reported, or as

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.980
the conspiracy theorists claim, to further
change his appearance to more of a Caucasian

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.080
look, though one would think the latter would
be an odd move for the co-author of the line

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:36.160
(with Bill Bottrell), “It don’t matter
if you’re black 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.580
or white.”
