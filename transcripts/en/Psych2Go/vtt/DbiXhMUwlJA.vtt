00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.540
Whether you're 16 or 40 coming out is never easy

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.989
There's never a right time to come out as the only perfect time is when you feel safe and comfortable with your own self

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.839
Have you figured out that you're a part of the LGBTQ community, but you're not sure how to tell people about it

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.480
Here are 8 things. You need to know before coming out of the closet

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.040
It doesn't have to be perfect

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.570
It's okay to feel anxious

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.750
it's perfectly normal to feel nerves or even anxiety when you're thinking about coming out if

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.220
The thought of making the announcement itself is what scares you just remember that coming out doesn't have to be a grand event

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.820
Some people may feel empowered by coming out parties and Facebook posts, but it can be as intimate as you need it to be

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.140
You don't have to do it alone

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.000
Coming out doesn't have to be something you have to handle on your own

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.680
It's perfectly okay to have a friend or a loved one someone you've already come out to to accompany you in?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.740
Situations that may make you especially anxious this can include telling your parents

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.480
extended family or even a group of friends

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.580
Choose the right time

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.560
When coming out to close friends and family for the first time it helps to have their undivided attention

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.840
Before bringing up something so important

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.120
It's not the best idea to come out during major events

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.660
Like weddings or baby showers or while the person you're talking to has their minds occupied with other activities

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.880
It's also probably not a great idea to bring home a brand new partner to shock your parents with

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.800
Coming out can be an emotional time for every party involved

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.829
So it's important to give the person you're talking to attention and private time to help them internalize what you're telling them

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.180
Before we continue we'd like to thank our partner TUSI cosmetics for sponsoring this video

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.160
TUSI cosmetics planes her advocacy for the

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.999
LGBTQ community and her passion for makeup to create a line of cosmetic products that shows your inner mermaid

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.379
Just like Ariel The Little Mermaid wanted her voice to be heard

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.160
a lot of people going through transition have been made fun of or been told that they aren't real when

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.859
in the end

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.440
Arielle made a sacrifice to make her dreams come true. You should never be judged for who you are or who you want to become

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.660

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120
Don't put yourself at risk

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.749
There are situations in which coming-out can mean jeopardizing your own safety

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.280
Remember your safety must always come first if you fear that coming out to someone could harm you in any way

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.400
Socially or even physically then don't do it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.020
Unfortunately, there are people that may not be accepting of your coming out

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.560
but that doesn't mean that you have to live the rest of your life in the closet

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.640
If being openly

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.489
LGBTQ at home is not a safe option for you or even if you feel ostracized or shamed where you live

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.560
It's important to look for support and comfort elsewhere

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.860
Search for any LGBTQ friendly community programs or alliances near you or speak to a counselor to discuss your possible options

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.580
Throw away your expectations

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.500
People's first reactions may not be the ones you wanted or expected

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.320
This is a big part of your life that you're opening them up to and everyone reacts differently to news this big

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.640
Some people might be completely shocked while others may need some time alone to digest the information

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.820
Others may have already seen some clues that you were LGBTQ and may tell you that they had a feeling

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.480
Some people may treat the topic very casually as if it was just some cool thing about you that they didn't know

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.780
whatever their response try not to judge them and be patient with how they handle your news

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.880
A true family bond can't be broken by sexuality. Don't be so hard on your parents

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.880
Some parents know their children are queer before they themselves do

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.740
But other parents may have a different life for their children planned out in their heads in their minds

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.760
You're going to marry a cisgendered person of the opposite sex. You're gonna have children naturally

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.500
You would never know the hatefulness and fear of homophobia or transphobia

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.720
While the world still has a long way to go in the Equality Department. Your parents need help to understand that you are

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.920
Who you've always been and your life for the most part doesn't have to change

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.840
Be open with them explain your feelings to them don't be upset if they react with sadness or disappointment

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.380
Sometimes we get caught up in thinking that it's everyone else's job to try to see things our way, but your parents aren't perfect

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.570
They need help understanding to

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.850
Prepare yourself for questions

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.620
Be open to questions. Know that the people you came out to may ask questions lots and lots of questions

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.660
Sometimes they may not always feel appropriate. In fact, they might feel a tad invasive

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.760
But they're just curious. They're just trying to gain an understanding of your newly proclaimed identity

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.380
Note that while it's important to be open and willing to educate those close to you about yourself

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.640
You also don't have to feel like you need to explain everything

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.320
There are some things you would rather keep private. There are others. We don't always know the answer to. Just be patient

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.840
Coming out never ends

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.400
Heterosexual people don't have to walk into a room and shout. Hey, I'm straight and you shouldn't have to either

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.920
We often don't understand how much our sexual and gender identities play into our everyday lives until we realize we're queer

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.280
Do you talk about your girlfriend? When all the other girls in the room are discussing funny things that their boyfriend said?

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.060
Whether you decide to disclose your LGBTQ identity or not is up to you and your comfort level

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:59.400
It might always be a little nerve-racking to let people find out that you're LGBTQ, but it gets easier every time

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.900
Coming out can be daunting and sometimes it feels like there are a hundred reasons why we just shouldn't do it at all

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.180
But once you're ready, there are a thousand reasons, why coming out can be amazing

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.060
Coming out is never easy. The most important part is being confident and true to yourself

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.360
