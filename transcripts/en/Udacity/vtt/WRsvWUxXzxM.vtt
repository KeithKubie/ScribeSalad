00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.910
In our code, we're going to initialize
the adapter

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.950
within the Placeholder Fragment
onCreateView method.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.160
Because that's where we want the ListView
to be populated with data.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.555
We're using a ArrayAdapter, and we can
initialize it with four parameters:

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:14.693
A context,

00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:16.557
the ID of a list item layout,

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:20.041
the ID of a text view within that list item layout,

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.885
as well as a list of data.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.870
We'll go through each of these
parameters one by one now.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.670
First, for context -- it contains global
information about the app environment.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.000
It allows us to access system
services and resources,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.230
as well as the application specific
resources that we've defined.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.720
We use the fragments containing
activity as the context.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.490
So, we're going to call getActivity
for our parameter here.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.890
Since the adapter needs to know
the layout for each list item,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.370
it needs some reference
to the XML layouts that we've defined.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.500
The r.java class is a generated file
that creates human readable identifiers

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.030
for our resources.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.860
For the list item layout, we refer to it
in code as R.layout.list_item_forecast.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.996
This was the name of the XML file
that we created earlier.

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:11.400
Next, the array adapter needs to know
how to take the weather forecast string

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850
and set that to be displayed
in a text view.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.474
So you pass in the ID of the text view
that we defined earlier,

00:01:17.474 --> 00:01:18.978
in the list item layout.

00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:22.009
Even though these two
resource IDs look similar,

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.106
one starts with R.layout
while the other starts with R.id.

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:32.133
R.layout refers to a layout file, while
an ID refers to a specific XML element

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.574
with the matching ID attribute.

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:36.772
And lastly, we pass in weekForecast,

00:01:36.772 --> 00:01:40.350
which is the array list of forecast data
that we defined earlier.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.450
Now go ahead and initialize your adapter.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.370
Check this box when you're done.
