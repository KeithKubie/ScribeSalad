00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930
tenured professors here in history I
 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.320
tenured professors here in history I
have written substantially are primarily

have written substantially are primarily
 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.939
have written substantially are primarily
on 20th century history and yet in the

on 20th century history and yet in the
 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.510
on 20th century history and yet in the
world history textbooks if you have say

four chapters out of 36 devoted to the
 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.810
four chapters out of 36 devoted to the
20th century that's one ninth not 1/2 in

20th century that's one ninth not 1/2 in

profession then the near past seems to

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539
profession then the near past seems to
 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.969

be too little much in a much more

be too little much in a much more
 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.490

let's say is no farther away than 1850

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930
let's say is no farther away than 1850

let's say is no farther away than 1850
now the one obvious explanation of this

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300
now the one obvious explanation of this
 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.480
now the one obvious explanation of this
would be that we know what happened

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490
would be that we know what happened
 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.409
would be that we know what happened
before 1850 but we're still masticating

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419
before 1850 but we're still masticating

before 1850 but we're still masticating
the 20th century to try and find out

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460
the 20th century to try and find out
 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.040
the 20th century to try and find out
what happened and therefore what goes up

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050
what happened and therefore what goes up
 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.800
what happened and therefore what goes up
to the late 19th century is kind of a

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810
to the late 19th century is kind of a
 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.570
to the late 19th century is kind of a

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580
homogenized given this is what history
 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.320
homogenized given this is what history
is and then what happens since the late

is and then what happens since the late
 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.800
is and then what happens since the late
19th century is still up for grabs I

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810
 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.659
have talked before about my concern

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669
have talked before about my concern
 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.879
have talked before about my concern
about a premature canonization of world

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889
about a premature canonization of world
 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.150
about a premature canonization of world
history along exactly these lines that

people will come away with the idea that

readable form for world history up until
fairly recent times and then we get into

fairly recent times and then we get into
 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.029
fairly recent times and then we get into
the interesting stuff I've tried to

the interesting stuff I've tried to
 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.089
