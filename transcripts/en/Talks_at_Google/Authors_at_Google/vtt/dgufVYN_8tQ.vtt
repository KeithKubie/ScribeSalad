DIANE ATKINSON: Well, thanks for
coming in your lunch hour for--

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.556
I hope what I'm
going to say isn't

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:11.570
going to give you indigestion.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.900
But let's see.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.400
Well, I've written about
suffragettes in the past.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.090
And I'd always concentrated
on what they did

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.770
in terms of their militancy.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.500
Remember, these are the
women who fought for the vote

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.439
in a very insistent, outrageous,
provocative, direct action

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.200
kind of way.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.570
So I talked about their
campaign, which really started

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.100
with shouting at meetings,
interrupting politicians,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.570
went right through to burning
down churches and attacking

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.880
works of art over a period
of about eight years.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.185
So it was very controversial
and deeply unpopular.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.060
So I'd written about.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.025
I'd also written about
how modern they were.

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:57.999
How they invented political
merchandising and marketing

00:00:57.999 --> 00:00:58.540
and branding.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.970
They branded their campaign
really beautifully.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.340
And more about that in a moment.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.989
They had a color scheme of
purple, white, and green.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.804
And they branded
and merchandised

00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:09.470
their slogan, "votes for women,"
in all sorts of different ways.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.846
So I found that very kind
of sexy and exciting.

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:14.470
And then I got to
thinking about, well,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.060
who were these amazing women?

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.390
I mean, what kind of
person would do that?

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.440
Would make that journey?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.850
Would become a suffragette?

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.450
Because make no mistake,
it was the most unpopular

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.420
political campaign
of the 20th century.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.360
It was a coming-out
moment for anybody

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.920
who said in terms
of conversation

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.330
or by wearing a badge that
they were suffragettes,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.080
because they were so
detested and so loathed.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.400
All they wanted was to vote,
but the sheer effrontery of them

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.040
not asking for it nicely, but
demanding it outrageously,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.090
and noisily, and
cheekily, and violently,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.240
was something that people
just couldn't stomach.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.010
So I was interested in who they
were, where they came from,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.440
what their biographies are,
what their backstories are,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.407
what their prehistory is.

00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:04.240
And I was interested
in their mums and dads,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.198
and their siblings, their
brothers and sisters,

00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:07.790
their neighbors,
and family groups.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.930
Because you had to have
your family on your side

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.550
if this was going to work.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.901
And your family had to be quite
extraordinary to back you,

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:17.650
because they're going
to get a lot of flak

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.340
from neighbors, and
colleagues, and family members

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.740
if you support your
daughter embarking

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.910
on this kind of campaign.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.640
So I was really interested to
get kind of the backstories

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.690
on them.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.500
Of course, the lucky
suffragettes, if you like,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.710
who persist and have a
long suffragette career

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.940
are extremely fortunate.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.150
They've got supportive husbands
and fathers, et cetera.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.230
Some women found that their
fathers and families were not

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.540
going to support it.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.440
You know, they had some
very tough choices.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.690
They either sort of shut up and
stop it, or they leave home.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.690
They're thrown out.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.398
They're cast out.

00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:53.290
They're disinherited.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.470
They're disowned.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.170
And many of them
had that experience.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.870
Some marriages rocked and
ended, and some engagements

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.950
broken off.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.450
Quite a lot of women involved
in the campaign lost their jobs.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.970
And in one of their papers,
called "Votes for Women,"

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.800
there's a regular feature
where suffragettes

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.420
are writing in, asking in
the situations wanted column

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.240
in the classified ads
section, explaining

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.330
they need a job because they've
been dismissed from their post.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.100
And you could be
dismissed for even

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.610
having a suffragette leaflet
on your desk, not even been

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.684
spotted smashing a window
or anything like that.

00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:31.600
It was just the fact
that you were interested.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.640
You'd been to a meeting
was enough to get

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.950
you dismissed with mostly
pretty disastrous results.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.340
So I was fascinated in
the strength of character

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.050
and the strength
of a family unit

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.270
that condoned this
kind of behavior.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.860
I was also interested
in diversity.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.129
I was interested in
all kinds of women who

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.420
were getting involved in there.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.815
So I did a lot of digging
away at that kind of story.

00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:53.379
And I found some great
examples of diversity.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.420
I was interested in it
being a regional-- looking

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.810
at the regions rather-- and
understanding how nationwide it

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.170
was, which it was.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.610
They had branches all over
the country quite quickly--

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.540
in Scotland, in Ireland, in
Wales, and all over England.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.070
So that was a measure of its
success and organization.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.677
And they even had shops
selling their merchandise.

00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:15.760
Suffragette shops selling
purple, white, and green

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.190
stuff all over the country.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.049
So that, I thought,
was pretty sexy, too.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.840
And I was interested
in working-class women

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.110
because they've been very much
marginalized in this story.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.810
It was often said that
the suffragettes were just

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.830
middle-class hobbyists.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.080
They weren't interested
in working-class women.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.770
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.850
So lots of things
to go and look for

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.897
and to weave into this story.

00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:42.313
Well, I have to talk about the
ladies on the screen, first

00:04:42.313 --> 00:04:44.170
of all, by saying
these are undoubtedly

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.570
the stars of the campaign.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.770
On the far left is
Sylvia Pankhurst,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.360
who is an artist and designer.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.260
She gives the WSPU, the
militant campaign, the look.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.930
She designs exhibitions,
designs logos.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.926
She is responsible for the
branded look of the WSPU.

00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:06.050
Her sister is next to her,
in the next image along,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.816
she has a first-class
degree in law.

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:10.440
But because she's a
woman, you couldn't

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.790
be a lawyer then, which was
irksome to say the least.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.810
So she gave her great strategic
thinking and logic and planning

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.890
skills into the campaign.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.610
And she was their
big thinker, really.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.840
And Mrs. Pankhurst, the mother,
who got them all together

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.730
and founded the Women's
Social and Political

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.020
Union in her parlor in 1903,
great, charismatic woman.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.500
She could fire up a room.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.764
She could light up
a room very quickly.

00:05:37.764 --> 00:05:38.930
All of them could, actually.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.060
All the Pankhurst girls
were charismatics.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.990
She's a tiny creature.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.662
Her shoe size was two.

00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:48.750
But she's like a cannonball
when she got going.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.340
She's amazing.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.880
And then, Annie Kenny, who is
a mill girl from Oldham who

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.940
joined the campaign
very early on.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.820
She becomes a very senior
member of the campaign.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.890
She's the poster girl
for the campaign.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.050
And she can reach into
working-class communities

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.500
and recruit women in the way
that the Pankhurst couldn't

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.280
always.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.050
So she's a big
part of the story.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.604
And she was very
pretty and the subject

00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:16.020
of many different
postcards, which

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.990
women collected at the time.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.590
This is the context the
suffragettes were operating in.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.530
Mom is a suffragette.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.655
Is your wife a suffragette?

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:27.960
You know, domestic
chaos comes when

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.330
women are involved in
politics and want the vote.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.820
How dare they?

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.240
There's hundreds of these flying
around, different designs.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.480
Thousands of them being
sent around the country

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.170
at this time.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.170
It's the golden age
of the postcard.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.520
People kind of made
arrangements to see each other

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.570
with these postcards.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.420
London had 12 postal
deliveries a day.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.810
Those were the days.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.477
And they're a bit
like tweets and texts.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:53.351
You could make an
arrangement in the morning,

00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:55.519
and you could confidently
expect your postcard

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:57.060
to be delivered and
meet your friends

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.400
in the afternoon for tea
or whatever in the evening.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.380
So it was a brilliant
means of communication.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.830
So civilization is going to
collapse if women get the vote.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.840
And certainly,
domestic chaos reigns

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.607
whenever they're asking for it.

00:07:14.607 --> 00:07:16.815
This is the first suffragette
postcard I ever bought.

00:07:16.815 --> 00:07:19.380
I thought it was just so daft.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.840
I liked it, actually.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.572
Suffragettes have
never been kissed.

00:07:23.572 --> 00:07:25.530
And this was to frighten
young girls from being

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.730
involved in the campaign.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.750
Because, they said, this
is what happens when you

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.072
don't take your life seriously.

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:34.530
And if you're
involved in politics,

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.557
you're going to be so
unattractive to men,

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:37.890
you're never going to be kissed.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.740
You're going to have a very
sad and unfulfilled life.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.190
So the message is--

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.700
it's the sexual frustration
of an unfulfilled

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.510
life that's driving these
women into asking for the vote.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.340
So there we have it.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.640
An apocalyptic vision--
when women vote,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.030
this is what's going to happen.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.310
There's about 10 in this series,
which are fantastic, hilarious,

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.570
and daft, of course.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.780
I love the idea of what
happens when women vote.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.190
They have their friends around.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.060
How dare they?

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.010
They smoke.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.880
They have chocolate.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.690
They just hang out and just
relax while their husbands are

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.630
in the kitchen getting
very red in the face

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.070
and coping very badly with a
boiling child, and the washing,

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.380
and the everything.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.370
So the reversal of roles
here is a horrible prospect.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.630
It's horrible.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.130
It's a topsy-turvy world.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.235
It's to be stopped
early in its tracks.

00:08:30.235 --> 00:08:32.799
And we've got to make
sure this doesn't happen.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.919
And when women vote, they're
going to ask men to marry them.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.039
They're not going to
just sit around and wait,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.351
hoping it's going to happen.

00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:41.350
So they're going to kind
of take the initiative.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.927
And that's going to
be horrible, too.

00:08:43.927 --> 00:08:48.416
This is Annie Kenny dressed
up to lead a procession.

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:50.790
As I said, she could reach
into working-class communities

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.320
everywhere, all
over the country.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.510
And these are the clothes
she wore when she worked

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.610
in the cotton mills of Oldham.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.890
She was a half-timer
from the age of eight.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.427
When she was 13, she
became a full-timer.

00:09:01.427 --> 00:09:02.760
And these were her mill clothes.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.972
She was wearing clogs with steel
tips, a skirt, and a shawl.

00:09:08.972 --> 00:09:10.680
Another shawl has been
put over her head.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.870
So you know, it's
a really powerful,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.690
rather haunting image.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.370
And it was very successful,
and thousands of copies

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.920
of this image were sold.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.410
Suffragettes could
be really young.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.850
They could be teenagers.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.980
And this girl here
was 17 when she

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.507
started her suffragette career.

00:09:27.507 --> 00:09:29.340
She worked in her dad's
shop in Westminster.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.680
He had a kind of chemist shop.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.730
And she got involved.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.710
And with her father's
blessing, she got involved--

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.130
lucky girl.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.040
But she did change her name
to spare his embarrassment.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.640
She was born Jessie Spinks,
which is such a nice name.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.350
And she'd call herself
Vera Wentworth.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.380
And that's how she was known.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.880
Her prison record knows
her as Vera Wentworth,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.470
but her real name
was Jessie Spinks.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.080
So you could be really young.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.210
You could be in your 20s
and 30s, 40s and 50s.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.660
And even feminists
in their 70s, who'd

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.230
fought all sorts of interesting
campaigns in the 19th century,

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.690
in their 70s and
early 80s were joining

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.480
the suffragette campaign,
adding their imprimatur

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.310
to this movement and marching
alongside the Pankhurst going

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.590
to Parliament to
talk to politicians.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.429
To "talk" to politicians,
which is to insist on the vote.

00:10:19.429 --> 00:10:20.970
It wasn't nothing
to do with talking.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.380
It was demanding.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.660
So across the age
spectrum, women

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.310
are getting involved
in this struggle

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:31.717
and adding their own special
and unique qualities to it.

00:10:31.717 --> 00:10:33.300
I like this image
because it shows you

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.270
how the movement
is kind of bursting

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.610
out all over the country.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.640
The map shows where they had
branches, committee rooms,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.230
and shops.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.350
It's a brilliantly
organized campaign.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.630
Everything was like
a military maneuver.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.110
They left nothing to chance.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.960
They had lots of volunteers
to make this happen.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.140
They paid their organizers
2 pounds a week,

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.820
which a lot of the
legwork was done

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.850
by unpaid volunteers from
all class backgrounds,

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.670
not just middle-class girls
with nothing else to do.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.760
And it was well-resourced.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.731
They had a great couple who
were the business managers,

00:11:09.731 --> 00:11:10.230
if you like.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.190
They provided a lot
of the seed money.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.690
And they happened to be
generous, kind, noble,

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.600
intelligent.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.280
A wonderful couple called
the Pethick Lawrences.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.850
Fred was a barrister, so he
gave lots of legal advice.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.760
And lots of his money was
used to bailout suffragettes

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.180
from custody until their
cases were heard at court.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.010
So a lot of his
personal fortune was

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.440
going to support the campaign.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.260
And Emmeline, his wife,
was the fundraiser.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.360
She raised the equivalent of 3
million pounds in five years.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.990
The woman could not
stop raising money.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.400
She has dozens of ideas, which
are brilliant at filling up

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.480
what they called the
"war chest," which

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480
was their campaign fund.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.340
Annie was having so much fun
in the suffragette campaign,

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.400
her sister, Jessie,
has come to run

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.810
one of the London departments.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.080
And here she is sitting
in front of the map here.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.580
She's got a senior
position, too.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.670
So much nicer than
working in a cotton

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.240
mill is to actually
come to London

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.850
and be part of
something really vibrant

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.460
and very, very exciting.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.850
This was the marketing
and merchandising.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.580
The colors featured
very prominently.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.750
They start off quite small with
badges and rosettes and sashes.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.450
But very quickly,
there's a vast amount

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.980
of merch available to those
women who want to buy it.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.850
At the top end, if you
were really well-off,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.570
you could have a purple,
white, and green car

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.780
upholstered and decorated
with suffragette logos.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.090
So that's high-end marketing.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.910
You could get
suffragette bicycles.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.284
You could get votes for women
cigarettes, and chocolates,

00:12:46.284 --> 00:12:49.800
and marmalade, and all
kinds of foodstuffs.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.940
You could get jewelry.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.080
You could get dresses.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.570
You could get slippers and
shoes and hats decorated.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.460
I mean, whatever you
wanted, somebody out

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.420
there would make it for you.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.795
And all the big
department stores

00:12:58.795 --> 00:13:00.660
in London and the
major cities would

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.150
stock purple, white, and
green clothing and accessories

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.400
for suffragette customers.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.100
There's a tea set there that
was on the market in 1909.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.740
And there are
still a few around,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.400
but they're extremely
rare and very expensive.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.070
Well, suffragette campaign was--

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.840
I haven't got time to go
into too many of the kind

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.350
of year-on-year details.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:30.190
But initially, from moving away
from interrupting meetings,

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.922
women were banned from
political meetings

00:13:31.922 --> 00:13:32.880
because you never know.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.484
They look quite nice, but
they could be suffragettes.

00:13:35.484 --> 00:13:36.900
They could be so
troublesome, they

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.540
would just get up
and unfurl a banner

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.040
and shout votes for women
and interrupt politicians

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.390
making speeches.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.730
So women were banned.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.380
And to protest
that, they would get

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.330
onto the roofs of
those buildings

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.420
where they were banned, and
they would have banners.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.300
And they'd do rooftop
protests, like prison protests.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.070
They started it, really.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.830
And when the police and the
firemen would try and hose them

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.270
down off the roof--
extremely dangerous--

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.390
the suffragettes got
so cross, they just

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.930
ripped the slates off the roof
and just chucked them down

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:09.810
on the police below.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.170
So you know, these protests
could end up extremely

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.730
violent and dangerous.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.680
And of course, it all adds
to their bad reputation.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.260
They stalked
politicians as well.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.551
They would follow them around
and just make their lives

00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:22.890
a total misery.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.858
They would follow
them into church.

00:14:24.858 --> 00:14:27.066
And they would button hold
them and grab hold of them

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:29.340
and say, when are you going
to give women the vote?

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.180
They would follow them when
they were playing golf.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.650
They'd hide in the
bushes and jump around

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.775
and say, when are you going
to give women the vote?

00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:37.470
They were really
an absolute pain.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.990
That was kind of slapstick
and funny and not so bad.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.570
But then, when the government
promises to seriously consider

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.900
a bill and give it
time in Parliament

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.210
and allow it to become
law, when they renege

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.340
on these promises
three years running,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.515
things start to get
really difficult.

00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:56.450
And the suffragettes think, OK,
we're going to move on a bit.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.260
We're going to move the action
a bit further down the line.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.694
And it's extraordinary for
me to be saying these things,

00:15:01.694 --> 00:15:03.360
because these were
just straightforward,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.780
ordinary women.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.420
All they wanted was
the vote, but they

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.480
found themselves caught up in
this most extraordinary battle

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.770
between the police, the
government, prison authorities,

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.260
and sometimes, members of
the public would attack them.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.190
It was a really dangerous thing
to be to be a suffragette.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:24.441
This one particularly dark
day in 1910, suffragettes

00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:26.190
were waiting to hear
about a bill that was

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.870
being debated in Parliament.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.650
Just waiting to hear when the
legal timetable was going to be

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.780
drawn up for it to become law.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.400
Asquith, who is
the Prime Minister,

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.390
just completely torpedoes it.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.770
And says, oh, no, well, we
haven't got time for that.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.130
We'll think about
it again next year.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.540
And this is after a lot
of peaceful lobbying

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.110
and campaigning.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.720
So they set off in groups
of a dozen from Caxton Hall

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.730
where they were
meeting and waiting.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.420
And they try and
get into Parliament.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.570
And the police are
ready for them.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.940
They know they're going to
kind of make their protest

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.770
in Parliament Square.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.170
And Winston Churchill
was the home secretary.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.800
Actually, recruited
a lot of policemen

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.310
from the East End who are used
to dealing with violent thugs.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.644
And they were there
but in plain clothes.

00:16:11.644 --> 00:16:13.810
They just looked like members
of the crowds, members

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:14.820
of the public.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.550
And they were in disguise
really, in two ways.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.690
They were wearing badges, which
said Men's League for Women's

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.460
Suffrage.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.690
So they were pretending
they were supporters.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.680
They weren't.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.740
And they and the uniformed
police, like you can see here,

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.550
and mounted policemen,
actually their mission

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.440
was to handle that
situation in such a way

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.387
the women would never come
back and protest again,

00:16:40.387 --> 00:16:42.720
which meant that women were
crushed against the railings

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.070
by police horses.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.560
They were punched, kicked,
beaten, hair pulled,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.670
clothes turned--

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.390
pulled off, really,
badly assaulted.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.600
And about 40 women were taken
down various side streets

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.180
around Parliament Square
and sexually assaulted

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.010
by uniformed policemen and
these agent provocateur.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.109
And the crowd were
encouraged to join in.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.530
So it's a terrible day.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:10.200
150 women are involved in
these kind of assault, physical

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.660
and sexual assault.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.760
Caxton Hall, where
they'd been meeting,

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.180
becomes like a field hospital.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.410
Nurses with suffragettes
sympathies rushed there.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.150
And doctors rushed there to
do some very basic first aid.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.810
But it was an awful day.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.650
And it triggered riots
the following weeks,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.260
where hundreds of women
are being arrested.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.630
Some of them are being
discharged, but a lot of them

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:34.770
are going to prison.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.350
Holloway fills up.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.460
And the others are just
bussed around the country

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.200
because there's no
room in Holloway.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.260
They've got to go to Liverpool,
Bristol, Newcastle, Manchester,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.830
anywhere, just to kind of-- to
cope with them while they're

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.670
going to be charged
and their sentences

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.787
are going to be handed down.

00:17:50.787 --> 00:17:51.870
It's such a difficult day.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.494
It's such a dangerous,
horrible moment.

00:17:53.494 --> 00:17:56.022
And Mrs. Pankhurst said, I
don't think we can do this.

00:17:56.022 --> 00:17:57.480
We can't go to
Parliament like this

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.810
because it gives police
too much time to molest,

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.320
manhandle, all sorts
of things are going on.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.630
So what we need to do is we
need to have protests where

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.189
women are arrested immediately.

00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:10.230
So that's going to be like
guerrilla campaigning.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.150
And she said, we're going to
have to wage guerrilla warfare

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.350
on this government because
we cannot trust the police

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:21.050
to police these
demonstrations properly.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.810
The campaign goes underground
in the autumn of 1910.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.730
And violence and
vandalism breaks out all

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.210
over the country.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.090
And the idea is--
smashing windows, yes.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.210
They stood there and
waited to be arrested

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.960
because that would
mean they went straight

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.120
to the police station.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.830
There's none of this pushing
and shoving and kettling,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.810
which still happens
at demonstrations.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.940
It's kind of a quick protest.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.084
They're going to go to prison.

00:18:44.084 --> 00:18:45.750
I mean, they don't
want to go to prison,

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.430
but they don't mind
doing that if this

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.470
is going to further the cause.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.530
So this is a tipping point.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.880
And this day, the
18th of November,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:59.490
1910, is remembered ever after
by suffragettes for the rest

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.216
of their lives as Black Friday.

00:19:03.216 --> 00:19:04.590
People sometimes
say to me, who's

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.673
your favorite suffragette?

00:19:05.673 --> 00:19:08.009
And I say, well, there's
about 200 of them,

00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:09.050
and they're in this book.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.110
But to pick one, I have to
pick Edith Rigby, because she

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:18.270
was just so gorgeous, and
outrageous, and unconventional.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:22.140
She was a doctor's doctor and
a doctor's wife in Preston.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.890
And she was absolutely
single-minded in getting

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.252
the vote and focusing
on working-class women.

00:19:28.252 --> 00:19:30.210
She comes from a nice,
comfortable middle-class

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.200
background, but her interests
lie in votes for working women.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.591
And she recruits local women.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.840
She takes them down to London.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.260
They get involved in all kind
of protests and demonstrations.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.450
And you just had to
take one look at Edith

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.915
to know how
unconventional she was.

00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:48.120
She didn't wear the normal
clothes an Edwardian lady--

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.300
corsets and pretty dresses
and that kind of stuff.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.945
She wore clothes that
she made herself.

00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:57.320
I suppose we think of her now
perhaps as the first hippie

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.278
because they're really
big, baggy dresses, kind

00:19:59.278 --> 00:20:00.360
of homemade dresses.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.530
She made her own jewelry.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.440
And that's all a bit bohemian
and pretty, but very weird

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.230
for the times.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.680
Nobody else was
dressed like that.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.290
And she wore sandals
all year-round.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.904
People thought that was weird.

00:20:11.904 --> 00:20:13.320
And she chain-smoked
all the time.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.790
And that was most unladylike.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.850
So that's what Edith was like.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.842
And she does the whole
suffragette number.

00:20:21.842 --> 00:20:22.800
She goes to Parliament.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.910
She protests.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.250
She breaks windows.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.560
She burns down houses.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.461
I just want to point
out that whenever

00:20:30.461 --> 00:20:32.710
suffragettes burned down a
house, it was always empty.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.840
They always looked
at the place first.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.600
Their owners were
still unhappy about it,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.400
but no human life was lost.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.260
So for the last
few months of 1913,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.102
Edith's on the run
from the police.

00:20:45.102 --> 00:20:46.560
Even her husband
doesn't know where

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.350
she is because she's
got out of prison.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.850
Because she's been
on hunger strike,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.620
and she's been force-fed.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.340
And she was released
on a special license.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.330
And she hides in
Ireland, in Galway.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.810
And she's there not
communicating with her husband

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:01.950
or friends at all.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.740
And just waiting to slip
back into the country,

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.870
to carry on doing
more militancy.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.110
So Edith Rigby is a
really interesting woman.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.960
And I mean, there are
200 women in this book

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.540
with incredible stories.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.890
They do things that I don't
think many of us or any of us

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.720
would be able to do now.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.590
It required a really
particular mindset

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:29.020
and phenomenal
sacrifice and courage.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.720
I like this photograph because
it looks really modern.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.900
It was taken by
a special branch.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.860
It's a surveillance photograph.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.090
There was a man hiding in
a van in the exercise yard

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.930
or in a box in the exercise
yard at Holloway Prison.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.050
And he's taken a picture.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.570
She's got no idea she's
being photographed.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.092
Multiple copies of
these prints will

00:21:50.092 --> 00:21:52.050
be sent all over the
country to police stations

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.990
to look out for women,
because they were very mobile.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:59.310
They would arrive in places
with aliases and in disguise.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.300
They moved all over the country.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.000
They were like soldiers,
really, in a campaign.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.830
They would turn up.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.180
And they would smash windows.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.430
And they would put phosphorous
bombs in pillow boxes.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.410
And they would vandalize
sports facilities.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.970
They would get ashed in
burning golf greens--

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.360
golf, that kind of stuff.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.810
They were a tremendous
problem to the police.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.760
And special branch had lots
of detectives following them

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.640
and taking photographs
of them to try and get

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.760
a handle on who they were,
and where they were going,

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.830
and what to do when
they turned up.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.490
Grace's father was a
clergyman in Norfolk.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.310
And he knew what she was up to.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.670
He didn't try and stop her.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.700
But to make life a
bit easier for him,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.490
they have a very
distinctive surname.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.970
They're called Marcon.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.590
She's called Grace Marcon.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.734
So she had an alias.

00:22:50.734 --> 00:22:52.400
Quite a lot of
suffragettes had an alias

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.090
to spare their
fathers' feelings,

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.130
even though they knew
they were suffragettes.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.400
And she called
herself Frida Thomas.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.290
And she has an
interesting career.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.500
In London, she works
as a gymnastics teacher

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.130
and a masseuse.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.110
But when she's on
suffragette missions,

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.390
she's obviously
not able to work.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.265
And she's kind of on
the run from the police

00:23:11.265 --> 00:23:12.610
a lot of the time.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.310
So Grace Marcon is a
tremendous character.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.480
And she was about 20 when she
got involved in this campaign.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.710
Well, being a
suffragette was hard.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.240
If you tried to make a
speech outside, perhaps

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.980
in Wimbledon Common
or wherever, the crowd

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:28.980
could be really hostile.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.120
They could be very abusive.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.490
They could be very vulgar.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.530
It's mostly male,
rough crowds who

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.280
are kind of following you
around to just bait you, really.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.090
They would perhaps throw
rotting fruit and vegetables,

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.760
lumps of coal, cabbages, rocks.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.460
Suffragettes were often stoned.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.470
Sylvia had experiences
in the East End

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.280
where dead cats and
dogs were thrown at her.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.960
So it was horrible
and dangerous.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.370
And again, it's hard to
imagine doing that now in front

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.370
of a really rough crowd.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.909
Of course in those days, it
was even more unimaginable.

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:04.950
So there's a lot of that.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.110
There's all the stuff
that's going on in prison,

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.270
which is being force-fed.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.100
The reason why they
go on hunger strike

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.280
is they say we're
political prisoners.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.390
We're being treated
as common criminals.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.400
What's happening?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.490
Men who are
campaigning politically

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.570
and are being arrested
for political crimes

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.736
in their campaigning methods
are given special status.

00:24:24.736 --> 00:24:26.610
Right back to the 19th
century that was then.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.110
Why aren't we being
given this status?

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.190
And the government would
never give in on that.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.880
So they went on hunger strike.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.270
And hundreds of women
were fed by force.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.190
The worst-- there are
three ways of doing it.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.220
I'll just go straight
to the worst, which

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.470
was where liquid food
is poured in a funnel

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.250
down a tube, which is
pushed down your throat,

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.780
down here to the
top of the stomach.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.800
So it's just poured
straight into your stomach.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.370
It's milk with raw egg,
or it's milk with brandy,

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.579
or ether extract,
that kind of thing.

00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:00.120
And you're tipped
back in your chair.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.490
You're held down
by four wardessess,

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.600
and that's poured into you.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.310
Imagine-- the gag reflex
would not be happy about this.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.290
And suffragettes had their vocal
chords damaged, had their teeth

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.057
knocked out in the struggle.

00:25:15.057 --> 00:25:17.390
While it's being poured in,
they're vomiting it straight

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.010
back out again.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.860
Sometimes, food
got into the lungs.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.830
And they had pleurisy
and pneumonia.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.550
So it's really dangerous,
because with pneumonia, this

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.540
is before antibiotics.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.850
And so you could
die from pneumonia.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.560
And a lot of people did.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.690
So it's torture.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.180
You know, it's torture
by no other name.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.777
But hundreds of
them were doing it.

00:25:37.777 --> 00:25:38.610
It's their decision.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.590
Nobody told them to do it.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.460
And their position is we're
going to force the government

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.060
to give us the vote.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.660
So the stories of hunger
striking and force feeding

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.540
are really powerful
recruiting tools

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.390
to women who will
hear these stories.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.090
And they're going to
have a response to that.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.100
They might not want to
go out and do militancy,

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.670
but they're going
to give some money.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.160
They're going to give some time.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.380
They're going to be
involved in the campaign.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.210
And you know, these stories--

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.850
these moments were
really important

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.000
because it galvanized women
to support the suffragettes.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.460
They might not like militancy.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.440
They might not
really approve of it,

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.210
but they felt it was
a means to an end,

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.560
a means to a very,
very important end.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.240
So there's a lot of scary
stuff, dangerous stuff,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.170
unpopular stuff you've got to
kind of develop a thick skin

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.739
about, but there's fun as well.

00:26:26.739 --> 00:26:27.905
They're very big on parties.

00:26:27.905 --> 00:26:29.520
They're very big
on tea and cakes.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.680
That was a big part of the
kind of recruiting process.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.540
And here, they're having
a suffragette sleepover.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.750
This is when it's census night,
when the government's sent

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.960
around to count the population.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.890
Suffragettes said, we pay taxes.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:45.200
We have no voice in
the making of laws,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.587
so we're not going
to be counted.

00:26:46.587 --> 00:26:48.170
The government
threatened to fine them

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.000
and sent them to prison.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.640
Didn't matter.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.030
And 4,000 women
dodged the census.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.760
They had a party wherever
they went on the night.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.440
They gathered groups together.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.260
They hired caravans and
went out on Wimbledon Common

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.744
and spent the night out
there and had a party.

00:27:02.744 --> 00:27:03.785
They had smoking parties.

00:27:03.785 --> 00:27:05.840
They went roller
skating all night.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.520
It was a lot of fun.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.180
And making it a really
important political point.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.120
No voice in our
legislation, so we're

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.250
not going to be part of
your official headcount.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.600
So I like this because
it looks like it was fun.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.970
I was very lucky to meet
this lady in the 1990s

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.305
when I worked at
Museum of London.

00:27:27.305 --> 00:27:28.805
There she is as a
young suffragette.

00:27:28.805 --> 00:27:31.030
She's called Victoria Simmons.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.410
In that photograph,
she's about 19.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.710
She came up to London, and
she broke windows in Whitehall

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:37.590
in 1912.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.280
She went to prison
for two months,

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.640
and she went on hunger
strike, and she was force-fed.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.139
She came up with
her sister, Winnie.

00:27:43.139 --> 00:27:46.070
Winnie managed to get away,
so Winnie went and sang songs

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.230
every day outside
Holloway Prison

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:52.160
to keep Victoria
kind of company.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.410
And when Victoria
went back to Clifton,

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.990
which is where she came
from, her local clergyman,

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.880
the man whose
church she attended,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.830
saw her selling a
newspaper in the street.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.890
And he was so disgusted by
the fact she'd been to London,

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.480
and she did what
she did, he just

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.710
spat in her face,
which is not what

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.220
you'd expect a clergyman to do.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:18.490
But people felt able to
make those kind of remarks

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.770
and those kind of behaviors.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.690
I met her in the
1990s, when she's 100.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.620
She's 100 in that photograph.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.020
And she was still a
suffragette, actually.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.820
She still had that
suffragette twinkle.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.550
She still had that
fire in her eyes.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.920
And she'd been a political
campaigner all her life.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.670
She'd got married.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.070
She was the first
woman optician.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.030
She got involved in all kinds
of animal rights campaigns.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.100
In her last campaign for the
audition of women priests,

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.350
she lived to see that happen.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.700
And it was great.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.290
The very first time I met her--

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.120
well, the only time I met
her, but I spent a whole day

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.800
with her, and it was such
a thrill to actually meet

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.970
someone who had done it.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:57.290
I could see completely how
she had taken that position.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.440
I said, well, let's go and
have some lunch, shall we?

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.420
She was perfectly able.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.253
She didn't need a walking
frame or anything.

00:29:03.253 --> 00:29:05.300
She's perfectly fine living
in a flat on her own.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.850
And she said, well, it will
have to be vegetarian, dear.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.270
Because I've been a
vegetarian since 1897.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.017
So you know, that's how she was.

00:29:14.017 --> 00:29:15.600
And I said, what's
it like living here

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.005
in Brighton-- in Hove?

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:18.380
She said, oh, it's
all very well.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.082
But it's full of old people.

00:29:20.082 --> 00:29:22.040
I think she thought she
was about 50, actually.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.660
She didn't realize she was 100.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.910
So it was really
nice to meet her

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:27.560
and to just kind
of spend some time

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.470
with somebody who had actually
been and done the business.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:35.130
And the last photograph I want
to talk about is this one here.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.037
And this is-- was taken in 1967.

00:29:39.037 --> 00:29:40.620
And these are the
moderate campaigners

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.080
and the militant campaigners.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.350
They've been bought
together for a photo shoot.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.030
"The Observer" have
gathered 13 of them.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.290
They can get together
on a particular day

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.620
for a big feature that
was in "The Observer."

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.420
And I love this photograph.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.900
I just love it because
it's so colorful.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.670
It's so vibrant.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:00.065
And it's about the personality.

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:01.640
I think the color
of their clothes

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.910
reflect the vibrancy
of those characters.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.790
And I just want to point out a
few of my favorites, actually.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.540
I'm just going to
move over here.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.510
Now, this is like the
formal photograph.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.840
It's all kind of--

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.180
everything's OK here.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.250
But things have relaxed
a bit by the time

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.480
we get to this photograph.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.890
[INAUDIBLE] burning
down buildings.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.920
When she's interviewed years
later, her eyes lit up.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.360
She was really excited talking
about when she burnt down

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.120
these buildings.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.710
So she's in and out of prison.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.200
She's on hunger strike.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.280
She's force-fed.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.340
She was somebody who had
food go into her lungs.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.350
She had pleurisy and
pneumonia at the same time.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.280
She could have died.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.440
She was only 20 when
it happened to her.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.660
When she was charged
in court at Bow Street,

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.290
the magistrate sort of sent
her down for six months.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.700
She said, oh,
well, I'll be back.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.324
Next time I'm out, I'm going to
burn down two buildings a week.

00:30:55.324 --> 00:30:56.250
That's my project.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:00.175
She was completely
kind of irrepressible.

00:31:00.175 --> 00:31:01.550
And because she
was so small, she

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.890
could be smuggled out
in laundry baskets.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.170
And what they often did was they
were out on special licenses.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:14.300
They're supposed to sit in this
place, this designated address,

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.580
to get better, to
put on some weight,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.170
and just wait to be rearrested.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.470
That was the scheme.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.446
That was a police idea.

00:31:20.446 --> 00:31:22.320
Well, they're not going
to do that, are they?

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.170
They're going to kind
of recover a bit.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.060
They're going to put
on a bit of weight,

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.894
just be looked after in
a nursing home context.

00:31:28.894 --> 00:31:30.310
And then they're
going to get out.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.226
They're not going to
wait to go back to prison

00:31:32.226 --> 00:31:34.220
and carry on the
whole business again.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.870
So they would
arrange for parties

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.484
if women would come
to see them, see

00:31:37.484 --> 00:31:39.900
how they're getting on-- flowers
and chocolates, all that.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.150
And there'd be a body
double amongst that group.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.400
So a number of
times, she got out

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.340
by swapping clothes
with somebody--

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.885
a young, small person.

00:31:50.885 --> 00:31:52.510
And she would just
walk past the police

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.730
who were on 24-hour guard
outside the premises

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.797
where she's being looked after.

00:31:57.797 --> 00:31:59.880
So very often, she just
walked straight past them.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.379
Or she goes out in
a laundry basket.

00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:03.320
And she had this
brilliant ability.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.480
Because she's so small,
actually, she can be a child.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.716
She's often dressed as a boy.

00:32:07.716 --> 00:32:09.590
And that's how she gets
away from the police.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.620
So she had lots of-- she
had a very lengthy record,

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.480
but she hardly spent
any time in prison

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.690
because she's so
good at getting away.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:18.640
I love her.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.190
And this is Mrs. Gwen O'Brien.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.740
Gwen O'Brien was one of
Mrs. Pankhurst's bodyguards

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.290
because there's
about 40 women who

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.810
were part of the
bodyguard who used

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:33.440
to mob her to try and stop her
being arrested by the police.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:39.640
So Gwen had many
fisticuffs with the police

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.430
to trying stop Mrs.
Pankhurst being arrested.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.015
And the last lady I want to
talk about is this one here.

00:32:46.015 --> 00:32:47.720
She's called Una Duval.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:54.280
Una Duval was-- again,
total career suffragette.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.100
She got mired in 1912.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.330
And she made a press release
before she got married

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.850
and said, I shan't be
saying the words "I obey"

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:02.950
in the wedding service.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.064
And everybody got completely
agitated about this.

00:33:05.064 --> 00:33:06.730
The Archbishop of
Canterbury said, well,

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.420
you won't be married if
you don't say "I obey."

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.150
She said, well, I'm
not going to say it.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:11.134
So she carried on.

00:33:11.134 --> 00:33:11.800
She got married.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.330
She completely kind of ignored
the Archbishop of Canterbury.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.730
And she just went ahead with it.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.680
But that gives you a clue as
to how strong-minded they were,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.690
how dedicated they were,
how visionary they were,

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:30.490
and how insistent and persistent
they were in their views.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:35.470
And she was part of
a suffragette family.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.950
She married into a family
called the Duval family.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.920
So the Dugdales
and Duvals numbered

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:47.710
about six female suffragettes
and two husband supporters.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.660
Now, they couldn't
join the WSPU,

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.910
but husbands were really
important in protecting

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.430
their wives, their female
relatives and friends,

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.940
from attacks from any
different direction.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.910
And so this important family,
the Dugdales and Duvals

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:04.110
were part of this whole
family of suffrage.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:06.500
I think all the women who
got involved in suffrage

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.110
thought they were
part of a family.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.150
And you really needed
to feel that to actually

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.330
be able to keep doing
it, because it was hard.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:18.929
It involved a lot of sacrifice
and quite a lot of suffering.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.179
That's all I want to
say about the images.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:24.070
I'm very happy to take
questions if you--

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.403
I'll try and answer them.

00:34:25.403 --> 00:34:26.369
Thank you.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.610
AUDIENCE: My question
was you've obviously

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.235
been talking about
this and researching

00:34:38.235 --> 00:34:39.530
this for a very long time.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:41.920
And in the time you've been
doing so, and more recently,

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.134
have you found the
conversation has changed?

00:34:43.134 --> 00:34:45.790
Have your audiences changed
to be more receptive, more

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:46.967
understanding?

00:34:46.967 --> 00:34:47.800
DIANE ATKINSON: Yes.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.440
I mean, I've been
involved with this subject

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.400
for a long, long time.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.489
And for years, there
was no love in the room

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:55.780
for the suffragettes.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.910
People couldn't stand them.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.630
Even academics, even historians
were quite dismissive of them.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.790
They believed the
lie that it was just

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.940
middle-class women looking
after their own interests.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.980
But now, there's
quite a lot of love

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.200
in lots of rooms where I
talk about the suffragettes.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.350
Because people can hear,
really, the full story and

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.840
understand about
their characters,

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.630
and their strengths, and their
courage, and their commitment.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:23.850
And I think they're women that
lots of people can be proud of.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.930
But the mood and
the attitude has

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.036
shift as the full story
of their involvement

00:35:29.036 --> 00:35:30.535
and their struggle
actually emerges.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.087
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:35.087 --> 00:35:35.920
I've got a question.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.290
So I kind of feel right now
with the "Me Too" trend,

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.240
I feel that we
are perhaps living

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.760
through another pivotal moment
as we did a hundred years ago

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.480
with the suffragettes.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.230
I don't know if you
would agree with that?

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.266
And my question to
you is, do you feel--

00:35:50.266 --> 00:35:51.890
I mean, I guess I've
got two questions.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.556
One, I wonder whether
these ladies would

00:35:53.556 --> 00:35:56.950
feel proud of where we are
right now as a society,

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:58.600
or whether they
think it actually

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.950
hasn't moved on enough?

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.470
Because I personally feel
we're still quite far

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.156
from true gender equality.

00:36:05.156 --> 00:36:07.540
And my second question to you
is with this pivotal moment

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.750
that we're living through
now, with the "Me Too" trend,

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:15.390
do you feel this will result in
a significant move towards kind

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.100
of genuine gender equality and
the kind of world, I guess,

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.824
these ladies hoped
they would achieve?

00:36:20.824 --> 00:36:22.490
DIANE ATKINSON: Well,
I mean, excuse me.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:23.990
That's two good questions.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:28.450
I think that the suffragettes
thought a lot of this

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.540
would have been
sorted out by now.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.790
I think one of their
wishes was for equal pay.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.530
They were talking
about equal pay

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.840
at the turn of the
century and before.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.370
So they'd be very disappointed
about the inequity

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.940
of unequal pay.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.580
And they would say,
I'm sure, how did you

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.080
let this go on for so long?

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.656
Don't forget, in 1970, the
Equal Pay Act was passed.

00:36:53.656 --> 00:36:55.780
It was supposed to be right
across the board, fully

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.030
implemented by 1975.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.470
And it still hasn't happened.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.900
So they'd think that
was weird, which I think

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.160
is code for shockingly bad.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.890
I think the "Me Too" moment
is going to actually--

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:14.270
I think both of these issues are
going to result in something.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.010
Because I think so many
people are affected by it.

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.670
It can't just be papered over.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.600
It can't be ignored.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.220
It can't be brushed
under the carpet.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.894
So many people have the
issue of unequal pay

00:37:27.894 --> 00:37:28.810
and sexual harassment.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:31.106
I can't see that
nothing can happen.

00:37:31.106 --> 00:37:32.980
But I think what we do--
and the suffragettes

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.000
would say, well, how did we
let this go on for so long?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.790
Because the suffragettes
were campaigning for the vote

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.230
to stop sexual harassment.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:44.250
And they said, well, you
haven't got that yet.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.200
I think they would
like us to have

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.260
Mrs. Pankhurst's slogan
at the top of our minds,

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.940
"deeds not words."

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.230
Stop talking about it.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.480
Stop having committee
meetings about it.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.840
Just talk about it
but make a strategy

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.420
as to how it's going to happen.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.019
What are we going
to do about it?

00:38:02.019 --> 00:38:03.310
How are we going to bring this?

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.140
How can we deliver
these changes?

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.480
Because talking about
it just isn't enough.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.520
And Mrs. Pankhurst
would really love

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.669
us to revive her slogan,
"deeds not words."

00:38:11.669 --> 00:38:13.710
And I think we perhaps
ought to think about that.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.700
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Alice.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.120
I suppose along the
"deeds not words" action,

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.970
you talked about essentially
Asquith going back

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:30.775
on his promises.

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.400
Says, yes, we'll do
it, and then not.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.350
And then, the
suffragettes feeling

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.962
that they had to escalate
the types of actions.

00:38:36.962 --> 00:38:38.670
To what extent do you
think that actually

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.870
if you want real change,
that extreme actions actually

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.390
take you to a place that
dialog just can't do.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.867
Is it something-- real change,
can it be achieved with dialog?

00:38:49.867 --> 00:38:51.450
Or do you in a
democracy actually need

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.660
to demonstrate your
frustration, anger in more

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.460
sort of vocal extreme manners?

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.660
DIANE ATKINSON: I don't
know if I've been taken over

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.700
by a suffragette spirit.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.750
It's possible that I have.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.080
But I don't think
dialog's enough.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.250
I think extreme action,
whatever that is.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.550
Whether it's a general
strike, women going on strike

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:09.900
and not doing any work at all.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.560
I don't know.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.500
But it's got to be strong.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.970
Just talk is so easy.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.160
It's so cheap.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.520
How do you translate
that into something?

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.900
Although governments never
want to agree or concede,

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.750
they always give in to violence
and extremism eventually.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.290
They just have to manage
that really carefully.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:35.370
But they will always have
to make some concessions,

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:38.715
because you can't have
the country at war.

00:39:38.715 --> 00:39:40.260
It just can't go on.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:44.070
So I think the suffragettes were
right to pursue this campaign.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.560
They suffered enormously
because of it.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.190
But in the end, the net result
of it was during the war

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.920
when they realized
that a lot of soldiers

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.600
had accidentally lost
the right to vote

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.016
because they were away from
home and hadn't re-registered.

00:39:57.016 --> 00:39:59.040
It's just a technical thing.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.230
Once they realized
that had happened,

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.960
they had to quickly
re-enfranchise,

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.090
because this is a PR nightmare.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.370
They then decided, well,
all these men are fighting.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.745
We've got a large number of
men who haven't got the vote.

00:40:11.745 --> 00:40:14.220
We got to enfranchise them
because they are putting

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.900
their lives-- laying
their lives down

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.060
for our country and our empire.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:22.590
So soldiers are re-enfranchised.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.650
21-year-old men
are re-enfranchised

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.250
across the board.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.950
There's also like,
how are we going

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.480
to reward women for war work?

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.730
Because war work done
by women was critical.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:37.990
The home front, that war
was fought and won by women.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:41.820
So they had to make some
kind of remark about that.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.420
And that meant that women
over 30 with certain property

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.770
qualifications got the vote.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.370
And I really feel that if
the suffragette hadn't pushed

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.044
the struggle to the
top of the agenda,

00:40:53.044 --> 00:40:54.210
that wouldn't have happened.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.040
The thought of another
suffragette campaign

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.430
starting up again, if they
didn't give them the vote,

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.470
we just couldn't face it.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:06.000
There's so much should be done
once the war was over that

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.450
dealing with that as well.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:08.970
And also, the
suffragettes would be

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:13.500
so re-invigorated by the moral
high ground of saying, hang on.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.540
What more do women have
to do to get the vote?

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:18.540
We fought the war.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.810
The men have been at the front,
and we fought the war at home.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:26.160
So I think the suffragettes
created a mood whereby

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.330
women had to get the vote.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.050
I mean, it was unfortunate that
they weren't all enfranchised

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.160
on equal age thing.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.180
But if they had
been, women would

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.535
have been in the majority.

00:41:37.535 --> 00:41:41.194
Politically, just
couldn't be contemplated.

00:41:41.194 --> 00:41:42.360
We think now, well, why not?

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.577
But at that time going
from like no votes of women

00:41:44.577 --> 00:41:46.660
to having women in the
majority in the electorate,

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.550
that was just scary.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.580
And it just very unappetizing.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.150
So I think the extremism of the
suffragettes actually counted

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:58.860
for something when it
came to the Representation

00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.610
of the People Act.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.450
And that's how
women got the vote.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.000
Sorry it was a
long-winded answer,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.334
but it's quite a
complex question.

00:42:07.334 --> 00:42:09.242
SPEAKER 1: Any other questions?

00:42:13.137 --> 00:42:13.970
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.219
Thank you so much for joining.

00:42:15.219 --> 00:42:18.489
Where did your personal interest
in this topic come from?

00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:20.530
DIANE ATKINSON: I worked
at the Museum of London,

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.840
and they have this
really important

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.230
world-class collection called
the Suffragette Fellowship

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:27.420
Collection.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.350
And it's such a touching story.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:32.530
Because when the vote
was won in the 1920s,

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.240
I always imagined what
they did with themselves

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.800
after that really exciting
campaign and the war period

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.650
because they were all involved
in all kinds of war work.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.170
And now I know what they did.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:47.120
They collected stuff to
remember the campaign.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.650
They had this fellowship
to remember the Pankhurst

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.160
and to remember militancy.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.740
And they gathered all
the banners, and posters,

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.710
and stuff.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:56.710
And they made this huge archive.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.460
They had a little
museum in Cromwell Road.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.330
And you could just go along
and kind of look at banners.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:03.700
And it was like a
very amateurish thing,

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.641
but it was a collection
that was growing

00:43:05.641 --> 00:43:06.640
and growing and growing.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.990
People were donating
their hunger strike

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.070
medals, their jewelry--

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.034
everything.

00:43:10.034 --> 00:43:11.700
And we had this at
the Museum of London.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.260
I used to just go and spend
hours Kind of messing around

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:15.760
in there.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.860
And looking at stuff, and
picking out photographs,

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.330
and just learning about them.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.170
Finding names to put
to these photographs.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:24.640
And so I kind of
immersed myself in that.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.660
And I started getting the
compulsion to write about them

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.390
and just to work out
what the stories were.

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.557
And I curated an
exhibition in 1992

00:43:33.557 --> 00:43:35.140
called Purple, White,
and Green, which

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.370
talked about the marketing.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:40.330
It was the foreground of the
campaign-- of my exhibition.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:42.630
The backdrop was
really militancy.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.260
And I just kept with it.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.020
I had a break from
writing about them.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.940
I did other
biographies of women.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.050
And I kind of came back to
them thinking, yeah, right.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:55.200
OK, let's get
biographical with this lot

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.810
and find out how
this all came about.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.850
So my book is a collective
biography of 200 suffragettes.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.707
I think I am possessed by them.

00:44:08.707 --> 00:44:10.290
Because every day,
I think about them.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.610
I kind of think, oh, I
wonder what Edith Rigby would

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.240
have done about that.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.632
What would Edith have done?

00:44:16.632 --> 00:44:17.965
So no, they're really inspiring.

00:44:17.965 --> 00:44:20.060
They're amazing.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:20.560
I love them.

00:44:31.992 --> 00:44:33.700
AUDIENCE: In the last
couple of elections

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.330
we've seen the Women's Equality
Party come to more prominence

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.460
at least than before.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.500
What's your take
on that movement?

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.380
And is that just a
modern embodiment

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.700
of the suffragette spirit, or
is it maybe a pale imitation?

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.690
What would the
suffragettes do in

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.610
the current political climate?

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:53.020
DIANE ATKINSON: Well, I
think the suffragettes would

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.811
say we should have had
the Women's Equality

00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:56.234
party a long time ago.

00:44:56.234 --> 00:44:57.400
I think they'd support them.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.570
I think they would endorse
a lot of their policies.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.027
I think they'd like
what they're doing.

00:45:02.027 --> 00:45:03.360
They'd approve of it, certainly.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.490
And I think they'd want
us all to vote for them.

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:09.910
And I think lots of people
say to me, what should I do?

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:13.070
I did an event at WOW at the
Royal Festival on Saturday--

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:16.320
Women of the World.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.540
And a young woman said to
me, what can I do about this?

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.160
I said, well, join the
Women's Equality Party.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.300
And sadly, she said,
I've never heard of them.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.130
So my mission would
be-- my advice

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.990
to women's equality-- get
out there and get known more.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:32.230
Get some candidates,
get some money,

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.600
and try and think
about adopting some

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.950
of these suffragette tactics.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:38.734
Because I think that's what
lots of women want and need.

00:45:43.287 --> 00:45:45.620
AUDIENCE: Before you started,
we talked about technology

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.390
and the impact that can have.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.430
And one of the themes
that you brought up

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.497
was how organized the
suffragettes were.

00:45:51.497 --> 00:45:54.080
Do you think that technology is
possibly hindering the ability

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.380
to get out a consistent,
organized message to achieve

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.920
an individual goal?

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.420
For example, Women's
Equality Party.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.597
Are there too many voices asking
for too many different things?

00:46:03.597 --> 00:46:04.430
DIANE ATKINSON: Yes.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.710
I think one of the virtues
of the suffragettes

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:09.570
was that they were very clear.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:10.840
There weren't democratic.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.530
They weren't interested
in committees.

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:15.770
They made policy and they
wanted their supporters

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.314
to follow the policy.

00:46:17.314 --> 00:46:18.980
And it's quite
straightforward in a way,

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.082
because I often think one way of
making sure things don't happen

00:46:22.082 --> 00:46:24.290
is to have a committee
because it just takes so long.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:25.420
It becomes a talking shot.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.560
I'm sorry, but it just
is so frustrating.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.350
It just ends up being all
about the committee, not about

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:33.480
the project and the goal.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.820
So I think they need
to have a single issue

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.830
or a big, identifiable message.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.790
And to push that.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:42.895
Because that will bring
so many people together.

00:46:42.895 --> 00:46:45.020
One of the reasons why the
suffragette campaign was

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:50.256
so diverse and so huge
really, is the fact

00:46:50.256 --> 00:46:51.380
they're going for the vote.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.090
The vote, the vote, the vote.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:56.930
And that brings a lot of
people to that campaign.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:00.920
And very importantly,
great diverse talent.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.630
And it's talent that
has so many impacts.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.530
It reaches into so many
aspects of the organization.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.410
So I think a
single-issue campaign

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.930
is something that really
has a chance of success

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:13.400
because you've got numbers.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.100
You've got diversity.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.150
And that's where I think results
can be gained more quickly.

00:47:23.211 --> 00:47:24.710
By the way, I think
the suffragettes

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.910
would have loved social media.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.925
They would have loved
tweeting and Instagram.

00:47:29.925 --> 00:47:31.050
They would have loved that.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:32.809
They would have
really embraced that.

00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:35.100
They took the technology that
was available at the time

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:35.739
to the max.

00:47:35.739 --> 00:47:37.030
And they really worked on that.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.880
So they'd think, hey,
you've got Twitter.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.963
You've got all this stuff.

00:47:39.963 --> 00:47:42.157
What's happened?

00:47:42.157 --> 00:47:43.698
AUDIENCE: I've got
one last question.

00:47:43.698 --> 00:47:45.794
So I haven't read the book yet.

00:47:45.794 --> 00:47:47.044
Looking forward to reading it.

00:47:47.044 --> 00:47:49.555
You mentioned 200 women?

00:47:49.555 --> 00:47:51.180
DIANE ATKINSON: 200
suffragettes, yeah.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:51.805
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:51.805 --> 00:47:54.870
I was wondering, are
there any prominent male,

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:56.625
can we say suffragettes?

00:47:56.625 --> 00:47:57.750
DIANE ATKINSON: Well, yeah.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.499
They couldn't--
well, I call them--

00:47:59.499 --> 00:48:00.790
AUDIENCE: That you came across.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:01.160
DIANE ATKINSON: Yeah.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.520
No, there's some good guys.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.720
There are lots of good guys.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.855
Edith Rigby's husband
was a doctor, Charlie.

00:48:07.855 --> 00:48:09.480
And he was just like
the ideal husband.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.771
He just let her get on with it.

00:48:10.771 --> 00:48:12.060
He never stopped her.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.400
He was worried about hunger
striking being a doctor,

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.850
but he didn't ever
try and stop her.

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:20.200
And a lot of the time when
she was just in Ireland,

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.200
he had no idea where she was.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.760
And a family friend
wrote and said,

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.110
oh, I'm so sorry about Edith.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:26.470
This is all very trying
for you, isn't it?

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.080
He said, I don't
want your sympathy.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.340
I don't need it because I back
Edith in everything she does.

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.430
She has the courage of a lion.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:38.400
And I don't have the moral
courage that she has.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.990
So I will back her,
whatever she does.

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.930
Now, that's quite an admission
for a man at that time to make.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:46.890
So there are lots of good
men like Charlie Rigby.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.520
But they suffered.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.250
Their reputations
amongst other men.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:54.220
Men thought they were,
like men in dresses.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.980
They said they were unsexed.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.080
They were sex traitors.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.716
So some of their
careers suffered.

00:48:59.716 --> 00:49:00.840
Their reputations suffered.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.110
Their friendships were broken.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.312
But there are some good
men in that book, too.

00:49:05.312 --> 00:49:06.520
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.936
And I think a lot
of us are really

00:49:07.936 --> 00:49:09.090
excited to read the book.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:09.900
Thank you very much for coming.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:10.941
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:49:10.941 --> 00:49:14.450
