00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.450
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.040
Couple of announcements.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.130
First of all, the Wolf Lecture
is tomorrow, right here in

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.930
10-250 at 4:00.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.790
As also, there will be the
weekly quiz, the mini

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.060
celebration.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.200
But there's going to be, a week
from today, celebration

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.330
part trois.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.510
Yes, third celebration
of learning.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.410
And remember, what we're
shooting for

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.830
is the smiley face.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.320
None of this.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.000
And those of you who are over
here on the grade point

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.790
distribution curve, we want
to move you to the right.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.300
So I'll say a little bit more
later in the week about what

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.800
the coverage will be.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.550
I'll be available for office
hours later, and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.790
I thought to try to cheer you
up, and remind you that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.920
studying is not something
you do only the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.960
night before the exam.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140
You have to be studying
on a regular basis.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.910
All right?

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.860
So from the iconic film
Ghostbusters,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.110
there's this one scene.

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:31.090
[FILM PLAYBACK]

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.160
For a moment, pretend that I
don't know anything about

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.280
metallurgy, engineering, or
physics, and just tell me what

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.710
the hell is going on.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.960
You never studied.

00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:46.960
[END FILM PLAYBACK]

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.230
You don't want to be a character
in that scene.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.090
So what are you going
to do about it?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.040
You're going to study.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.120
All right.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.130
Let's get down to work.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.050
Today I'm going to take one
day and I'm going to talk

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.250
about organic chemistry.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.090
Now, I'm not going to pretend
that after one lecture, you're

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.200
going to walk out of here and
know much organic chemistry.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.820
I'm going to give you, if
you want to know organic

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.440
chemistry, you're going
to have to take 512,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.750
and many if you will.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.150
But I'm going to give you enough
that it will set up for

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.480
the subsequent units on polymers
and on biochemistry.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.300
So we'll know enough that
we can move forward.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.720
So let's get into the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480
definition of organic chemistry.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.310
It's the chemistry of compounds,
containing both

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.450
carbon and hydrogen.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.980
There can be, of course, other
elements present, but you've

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.580
got to have carbon and
hydrogen to get

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.180
yourself into Orgo.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.460
And what makes carbon and
hydrogen so special?

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.470
We've been studying these
elements through the semester.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.250
But just to be reminded.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.260
First of all, hydrogen is
peculiar because it's got the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.210
lowest atomic number.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.850
It's got the lone proton,
and a single electron.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.170
And when hydrogen ionizes,
it forms the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.930
hydrogen ion, or the proton.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.840
That's all that's left.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.100
And this thing's very
tiny, and it can

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.400
form covalent bonds.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.680
It forms covalent bonds as
primary bonds, and it can form

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.890
hydrogen bonds as
secondary bonds.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.020
So it's peculiar for
that reason.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.840
It does not form ions.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.640
You cannot imagine something is
tiny as a proton occupying

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.310
a lattice site in an
ionic crystal.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.630
OK.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.950
Now when it comes to carbon,
carbon is also peculiar.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.470
It's smack dab in the middle of
the periodic table, in the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.220
second row.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.370
Four valence electrons, which
means that it's very

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.930
difficult to ionize.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.270
If it wants to achieve octet
stability, it's going to have

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.770
to form covalent compounds.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.700
It's not going to acquire four
electrons or lose four

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.310
electronics.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.620
In rare exceptional
circumstances it, might, but

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.340
commonly, it does not.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.330
And with that intermediate
average valence electron

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.040
energy, it's going
to be capable of

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.050
all sorts of bonding.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.620
And in particular, because of
its small size, it's capable,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.110
with its small size and the
intermediate value of average

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.770
valence electron energy--

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.490
and this is critical--

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.115
is that it's capable of forming
multiple bonds.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.630
And this is key, as we'll see
later when things try to

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.770
polymerize and form
multiple bonds.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.690
And this is not common, for
example, not the case if you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.920
look underneath carbon.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.410
Silicon, germanium,
for example.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.720
Same thing.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.160
Group 4, same kind of mid-stream
average valence

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.010
electron energy.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.570
But they're too big.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.900
Silicon and Germanium do not
form double and triple bonds.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.880
So the other thing is that it's
capable of self-linking.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.990
It can link to itself, form
carbon chains, and also with

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.380
nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.040
So this gives it--

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.490
and let's put up phosphorus
as well.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.860
Phosphorus and sulfur.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.740
So with these kinds
of links-- we've

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.740
already seen oxygen links.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.850
We'll see, pretty soon, nitrogen
links and so on.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.960
There's millions of organic
compounds, and today I'm just

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.690
going to look at a few.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.790
I'm just going to give
you some taxonomy and

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.510
nomenclature, and we're going
to walk through this.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.170
And here's the way to
keep it straight.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.440
You know all this stuff.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.720
I'm just going to organize
it in your minds for you.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.100
We've already studied the
three different types of

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.970
hybridization.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.480
sp, sp2, and sp3.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.690
And we've already seen that if
you're going to have a double

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.100
bond, you need sp2 hybridization
to reserve 1p

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.330
orbital, to make that
pi second bond.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.770
And if you want to make triple
bonds, you make sp

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.932
hybridization, thereby reserving
two p orbitals to

00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:01.740
make two pi bonds.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.280
So this is sigma, sigma plus
pi, sigma plus pi plus pi.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.920
That's it.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.570
Now what we're going to do is to
is go back and look at this

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.830
in the context of
hydrocarbons.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.520
So hydrocarbons is going to be
now the focus here, and the

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.860
hydrocarbons are the simplest
of the organic compounds.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.640
So let's look at hydrocarbons.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.470
I'm going to look at their
nomenclature and their

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.150
properties.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.580
But the structure behind
everything, the treatment, is

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.990
the type of hybridization.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.520
So these consist only of
hydrogen and carbon.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:49.420
Compounds containing only
hydrogen and carbon.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.790
So I'm just going to
go down that chart.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.620
And we'll go through.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.520
So the first one on the left is
the alkanes We'll look at

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.290
the alkanes.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.030
And the alkanes are
characterized by sp3

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.410
hybridization.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.123
And so this gives the maximum
number of carbon linkages.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.730
Why?

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.570
Because you can only
form single bonds.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.960
So if I can only form single
bonds, every bond goes to a

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.890
different atom.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.260
Whereas if I form double bonds,
then I'm burning up

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.370
some of the capability.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.030
Because if I used two bonds
to get to one neighboring

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.740
element, instead of two single
bonds each to two different

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.440
neighboring elements, I don't
have as many linkages.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.630
So the maximum number of carbon
linkages-- and because

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.980
they have the maximum number,
we're going to borrow

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.430
terminology from the last
unit on solutions.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.310
What's the maximum amount of
solute you can get into a

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.380
solution called?

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.400
It's called the saturation
value.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.880
And they use that term here.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:56.760
These are called saturated
hydrocarbons, because they've

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.620
got the maximum number
of linkages, bonds.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.360
And they're all sigma bonds.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.170
All of this is a consequence
of the choice of sp3.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.200
I could have led you through all
of this, but we're putting

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.750
it up quickly here.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.070
All right.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.940
And so they have a
common formula.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.590
CNH2N plus 2.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.350
I think I've got some--

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.970
yeah, this is taking from
one of the other books.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.810
I know you've got a list like
this in your own book.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.880
So here they are.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.710
So this is just CNH2N plus 2,
and you go down, and there's

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.560
the nomenclature.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.910
The meth, for historical reasons
represents n equals 1.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:46.110
So here's what the hidden
message is.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:55.470
You name them by the carbon
number plus the suffix A N E.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.710
So the -anes, the alk-anes,
are all these sp3.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:05.810
So 1 is meth, 2 is eth, 3
is pro, and 4 is but.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.560
And they all have historical
derivations.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:16.040
But- comes from butyric acid,
which is the acid that's

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.110
formed when butter turns
rancid, and so on.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.640
After you get up to N equals
4, it's just your Latin.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.520
So you just take your high
school Latin, pentane, hexane,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.630
heptane, and so on.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.400
And if you didn't take high
school Latin, this is a great

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.310
chance to learn the
ordinals in Latin.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.290
So there they are.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.030
Now, I'm not going to
expect you to--

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.880
if I say decane, you're supposed
to slam down C10H22.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.480
But I would expect that I could
say decane, and I'd give

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.100
you that formula and you'd
be comfortable with it.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.250
What's the other thing to note
here, while we've got this up

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.960
on the chart.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.790
You can see that all of these
are symmetric molecules, and

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.300
they're non-polar.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.550
They're perfectly symmetric
non-polar.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.840
And what happens as the
molecular mass increases, the

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.190
melting point increases, the
boiling point increases, and

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.050
the state of matter transitions
from gas at room

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.850
temperature to liquid at room
temperature to solid at room

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.340
temperature.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.810
So here's an excellent example
of polarizability in action.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.590
Because the only way one methane
can bond to another

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.390
methane is by induced
dipole-induced dipole

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.520
interaction.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.200
So the only difference between
methane and icosane is that

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.550
icosane is a honking big
molecule, non-polar, but very

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.290
polarizable.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.160
And so as the polarizability
increases, you can see the

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.370
effect here.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.790
OK, so that's good.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.450
So you get to learn your
Latin ordinals.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.380
Now these are also termed
straight chains.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.980
They can be termed straight
chains, but I want you to look

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.350
carefully at what's
going on here.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.270
So here's a diagram used, the
first one on the left, you've

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.060
seen methane many times.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.860
There's ethane and
then propane.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.120
And what do you notice here?

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.050
Because of the sp3
hybridization, all of these

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.170
angles are 109 degrees,
including the

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.100
carbon-carbon angles.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.310
And when the thing is really
short, you get

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.880
this zig-zaggy nature.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.600
So because of the sp3
hybridization, you see the

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.960
carbon doing this.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.490
This is carbon-carbon, and
then the rest, forget it.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.110
I mean, this is the backbone.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.300
But if I get up to icosane and
I have about 20 of these

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.750
things, forget the zig-zag.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.050
From here, yeah, I know there's
a little bit of fine

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.990
structure, but for all intents
and purposes, this as a chain.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.390
Straight chain.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.090
And that's where you get
the terminology from.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.490
But keep in mind that there is
this zig-zagging back and

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.750
forth, due to the sp3
hybridization.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.690
OK?

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.550
So that's the first point.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:57.930
The second point is that the
bonds between the carbons are

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.300
not fully specified.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.560
So for example, take the carbon
here on the left.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.070
The sticks to go to the 3
hydrogens here depicted in

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.400
white, and then the fourth
stick goes to the carbon.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.370
And then off of that carbon
comes 3 more sticks, and all

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.520
of these are 109
degree angles.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.340
All of that specified,
and nothing more.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.750
There's nothing saying that
these 2 hydrogens in the back

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.740
have to line up.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.890
These two hydrogens out front
have to the line up.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.270
That's all free to rotate.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.310
And so we have that degree
of freedom there.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.800
The result is that you can have
something that zig-zags

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.570
back and forth.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.860
So for example, this is called
eclipse, because if I were to

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.340
stand here, these two hydrogens

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.790
are on a direct line.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.910
So the front hydrogen covers
the back hydrogen.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.080
It eclipses.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:54.210
This hydrogen out front to your
and my right is on the

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.420
same line is this hydrogen
to your and my left.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.110
And so if I were to look here
from the end, this hydrogen

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.930
eclipses, and so on.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.820
So if I get something eclipsed,
I'm going to have a

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.290
perfect straight line.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.530
If I have something that's
staggered, it's free to

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.560
zig-zag, but it's free to
zig-zag and meander, and this

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.270
is what happens.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:20.650
So here's 2 C17H36 molecules,
and the top confirmation is

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.310
more or less straight.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.170
These are more or less eclipsed
configurations.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.560
Whereas the lower one, you can
see, there's a fair bit of

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.640
stagger, and as a result, the
backbone can actually loop

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.860
back on itself.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.670
But in both cases, we still call
these straight chains.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.840
They're still straight chain.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.340
Because as you start at one
end and go from carbon to

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.580
carbon, you linearly go
to the other end.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.450
It doesn't mean it's straight
like straight as an arrow.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.550
It just means there's
no branches.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.430
So now I'm going to distinguish
this from the

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.940
other one by branching.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.910
So let's just get
this up here.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.300
So we have straight chains,
is one case.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.330
Straight chains.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.580
And the straight chains
can either be

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.945
staggered or eclipsed.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.470
And the closer you get
to eclipsed, the

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.720
closer you get to--

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.400
the more eclipsed,
the straighter.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.600
I think you'll understand
what this means.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.930
Staggered allows it to
make large loops--

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.670
I'll just put here, straight
but looped.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.420
You can use that to describe
some of your friends, too.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:37.820
All right.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.850
Now--

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.780
it's a Monday, it's a joke!

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.120
Wake up!

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.660
Wake up!

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.070
All right.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.500
Now we can look at
another one.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.750
Branched chains.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.840
And now, this will be a major
departure, whether the chain

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.490
is super-straight or does a lot
of looping back and forth,

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.900
the branched chain is in marked
contrast. Now let me

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.720
give you an example of
the branch chain.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.130
Best to just do it.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.210
So here's the branch chain.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.640
I'm going to use a butane.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.340
So you know B U T is 4.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.220
So that means 4 carbons, and
A means 4 carbons, sp3

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.170
hybridized.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.040
So that's it.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.120
So now I'm going
to write this.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.920
Here's butane.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.840
C, C, C, C.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.770
And I'm going to write this as
just a straight chain, instead

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.250
of doing this.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.040
I'm going to contrast. I'm
going to do 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.850
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.780
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.830
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:43.760
OK?

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.400
So there we are.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.000
So this is, instead of writing
all this stuff, this is

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.270
butane, and this is butane.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.340
But now here's the thing.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.590
Four stick rule.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.910
Whenever you're doing Orgo,
four stick rule.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.580
That means, four sticks
out of every carbon.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.820
So here's the carbon-carbon
bond, so I

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.040
need three more sticks.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040
1, 2, 3.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.140
And I know these are sp3
hybridized, but just, in

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.240
compressed notation,
you can do this.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.490
And I'm not even going to
write all the hydrogens.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.180
Here I'm going to write the
hydrogens because it's our

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.580
first time through, and it's
Monday, and everybody needs a

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.420
little bit of TLC.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.390
But now the TLC is gone.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.470
This is it, all right?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.270
I'm not even going to put
the H's on the end.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.380
The stick coming off of carbon
means there's a hydrogen here.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.860
All right?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.680
So how about this one?

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.670
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3,
4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.090
And now let's count
the hydrogens.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.910
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.120
C4H10.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.580
Butane.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.090
All right.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:50.040
Now there's another
way to write this.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.700
I could go like so.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.230
1, 2, 3.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.990
And I could put a
carbon up here.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.100
This is a branch, you see?

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.530
It's not in a straight line.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.930
And I'm not talking
about eclipsed.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.590
Because if I start at 1n and go
down the backbone, I get to

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:07.860
the other end, I
only hit three.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.950
I never got to this one.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:10.640
But let's see.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.900
You know, maybe this
is different.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.520
So four stick rule.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.500
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.620
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.990
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.700
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.050
Now let's count the hydrogens.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.360
1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.730
This is C4H10.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.790
It's a different molecule,
you can see.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.450
With what you've already learned
in 3091, this has a

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.980
different dipole moment,
doesn't it?

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.190
It's got a different
dipole moment.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.660
It's going to have a different
polarizability.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.450
But it's a butane,
it's a C4H10.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.780
So this is called
butane, right?

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.740
And this one, over here,

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.580
historically, was called isobutane.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.500
Because it's an isomer.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:06.830
It's got the same chemical
composition, but it's got a

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.840
different makeup.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.950
It's got a different
structural makeup.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.820
It's got a different--

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.500
I'm going to use the material
science-y word.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.320
Different structure.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.180
It's got a different molecular
structure.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.780
But the chemists going back 50
years ago didn't use these

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.920
terms. They called it different
constituents.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.390
So I'm going to use
that as well.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.786
Different molecular structure
or different constituents.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.740
And what do we mean
by constituents?

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.160
Now comes the color chalk.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.500
So we're going to do,
is I want to circle

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.400
the makeup of this.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.100
So at this end, I've got--

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.150
this is a CH3 here, correct?

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.040
There's a CH3 over here.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:02.420
And then in between, I've
got CH2 and a CH2.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.520
Now let's go over here
and diagram this one.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:11.380
The isobutane, I've got a CH3
at the end, and a CH3 at the

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.100
opposite end.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.290
So far, same as the butane.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.290
But now look.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:20.320
There's a third CH3 here,
and then there's this

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.960
thing, which is a CH.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.750
You could argue it's
a CH2 that got

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.140
methylated, but, you know.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:31.780
So I'm going to put a CH2 here
that's been methylated.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.970
And I'll tell you
what that means.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:34.370
OK?

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.910
So it's really a CH2 group
that got methylated.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.900
So it's called isobutane, but
you can see, it's got

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.320
different--

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.420
all I'm doing here is making
the justification for the

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.500
different constitution,
different dielectric

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.460
constants, and so
on and so forth.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.460
So this is where the chemists
must come in.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.870
They would say, different
constituents.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.490
And so these are isomers that
have the same chemical

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.070
composition, and are different
on the basis of their

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.620
constitution.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.820
So they call these
constitutional isomers.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.310
This is a constitutional
isomer.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.570
Isobutane is a constitutional
isomer.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.240
Now the last piece
is nomenclature.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.700
They don't use this today.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.080
Because isobutane was
a term that came

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.510
out of chemical industry.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.440
Because it looks like butane,
has got the same molecular

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.040
weight, but it's
very different.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.010
Today we use the
IUPAC notation.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.480
Remember this?

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.260
International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.850
They're the ones, when one of
you discovers and stabilizes

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.530
element 113, And you want to
name it after dadadadada, you

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.000
have to get past the
IUPAC committee.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.360
OK?

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.570
So their nomenclature committee
would say, this is

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.460
an alkane, but it's only three
carbon units long.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.000
So it is not a butane.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.920
It is a propane.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.230
It is a type of propane.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.720
But it's not simple propane,
because there's a methyl

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.130
hanging off the side.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:03.750
So in point of fact, this, in
IUPAC nomenclature, is a

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.830
methyl propane.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.010
And furthermore, if you want
to get really pedantic, and

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.100
IUPAC loves to get pedantic, is
what they'll do, is they'll

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.050
number these, starting
from left to right.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.150
So this is the number 1 carbon,
this is the number 2

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.540
carbon, and this is
number 3 carbon.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.450
And the methyl group
is pendent on

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.840
the number 2 carbon.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.950
So if we want to get really,
really, really pedantic, and

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:31.090
who wouldn't, on a Monday
morning, what we would do, is

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.475
we would call this
2-methylpropane.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.390
So it's a propane, 3 carbon
units, there's a methyl group

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.550
hanging off of number 2.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.510
Now, I don't expect you to be
able to do these on sight, but

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.510
I would like you to be
appreciative of what this is.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.130
So I'll give it to
you on an exam.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:50.390
All right.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.550
So we've got the isomers.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.290
And I think I've got some--

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:54.990
I think I've got this.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.690
No.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.500
OK, this is good.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:58.640
Oh.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.030
There's one other thing I want
to talk about with alkanes.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.350
There's another thing that we
need to know, and that's about

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.290
the radicals.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.750
The radicals that form.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.610
The radical is a species
with one or

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.860
more unpaired electrons.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.110
Right?

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.130
This is broken bond.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.220
One pair electrons.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:30.310
That's equivalent
to broken bond.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.910
OK.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.260
So this is highly reactive.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.170
Because this unpaired
electron is going to

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.800
go look for a mate.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.540
So if you take a look at CH4--

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.170
now I'm going to put
the hydrogens in.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:48.010
So this is methane, CH4.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.000
I'm going to break this bond in
the lower right corner, and

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.150
just have an unpaired
electron.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.290
And this is called the
methyl radical.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.730
Very reactive.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.800
So you can see that this methyl
radical could go up and

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.570
stick on to the fourth strut of
that number 2 carbon, and

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.350
thereby form the carbon-carbon
bond.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.600
So that's why they call
this methylpropane.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.950
So the methyl radical.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:19.160
And you can write it this way,
H3C with dot indicating

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.450
unpaired electrons.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.750
But I want you to be literate
with the way chemists will

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.230
write this in various
compact notations.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:32.120
So you might even see
it written this way.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.850
Now, that doesn't mean
that the unpaired

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.380
electron is on a hydrogen.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.990
This is just a way of saying,
you know, CH4 is methane, CH3

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.760
is methyl, and who cares.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.630
There's only one possible
meaning to

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.515
this, so it's all good.

00:23:46.515 --> 00:23:47.470
All right?

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.600
Let's do two unpaired
electrons.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.600
So I'm going to take two
unpaired electrons.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.180
Again, this is out of the
alkane, so I'll put a hydrogen

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.200
above and below.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.390
So that would be like
this one here.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.080
You see the CH2?

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.423
So it's got carbon-carbon bonds
on either side, but in

00:24:03.423 --> 00:24:05.490
point of fact, this is
part of a zig-zag.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.395
So I'm going to break
bonds here and here.

00:24:10.395 --> 00:24:11.180
All right?

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.370
So now I've got the possibility
of putting a bond

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.610
on either side.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.410
And this one here is
called methylene.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.350
This is methylene.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.300
This is the methylene radical,
and it's got

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.430
two unpaired electrons.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:30.620
So we could write that as H2C
with 2 unpaired electrons.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.500
And, you know, these
are electrons.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.090
They're not just anywhere.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.560
They're sitting in an orbital,
and that orbital is as at 109

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.020
degrees from the other bond.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.250
So it has to be sitting there
in reserve, in waiting.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.370
So if I bring another carbon
here, I get the carbon-carbon

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.860
bond, and I start forming
the zig-zag.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.220
And there's one more, a common
one that we'll need to know.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:59.770
And that's from ethane,
which is C2H6, right?

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:04.480
Let's start with ethane, C2H6,
and I'm going to make a

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.283
radical out of that.

00:25:05.283 --> 00:25:08.240
It will be C2H5, like this.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.780
To which I can add a hydroxyl,
and now I'll make ethyl

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.050
alcohol, and then
it's party time.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.400
But so this is how you start.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.510
All right?

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.130
This is the ethyl radical.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.070
Starting from methane.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.100
And that's pretty much it.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.520
That's about all I want
you to really take

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.460
away with the alkanes.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.190
C4H10.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.770
Yeah, there you go.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.960
So there you can see, to the
left, the zig-zagging of the

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.430
linear and the butane, and
then the methyl propane.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.050
That's good.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:42.330
OK.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.190
Now let's go to sp2.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.420
Now we're going to look
at the alkenes.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.340
So alkenes represent--

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.830
the alkenes--

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.140
this is sp2 hybridization.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.430
And they contain--

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.010
this means there's the
possibility of a carbon-carbon

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.690
double bond.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.160
And they're also known
as unsaturated.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.390
Because they don't optimize.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:11.560
The fact that you spent two of
your bonds going between two

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.490
atoms instead of taking one bond
to one carbon and another

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.950
bond somewhere else, means that
you're undermaximized.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:22.160
So unsaturated hydrocarbons.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.520
OK?

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:29.030
And the formula for these is
CNH2N, where obviously N is

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.930
greater than 1.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.970
We can't form a carbon-carton
double bond

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.050
with only one carbon.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.020
So you know, the prototypical
one we looked at was this one

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.720
here, just to C2.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.560
That's the first one.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.420
So it's going to be C2H4.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.980
So carbon-carbon double bond.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.180
There's a sigma bond here,
and a pi bond.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.230
And they lie in a plane.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.700
The molecule is planar.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.850
120 degrees here.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.530
So we'll put the hydrogens
on it--

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.760
you know already, I don't have
to put the hydrogens there.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.910
That's good enough.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.240
All right.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.300
So what's this one called?

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.240
This is called ethylene,
historically.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.100
Ethylene.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.410
But the IUPAC notation is
similar to this one.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.070
It's carbon number
plus -ene, E N E.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.070
So strictly speaking, this
is what everybody knows.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.640
But IUPAC insists--

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.660
and I don't know.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:21.370
As you publish, some editors
are really fastidious, and

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.720
they'll force you to change
if you use this kind of

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.660
terminology.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.350
So you're going to have
to call it ethene.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.310
Or in the UK they
call it ethene.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.170
But everybody knows
it is ethylene.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:32.460
OK.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.370
So there it is.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.755
And you only need 1
carbon-carbon bond.

00:27:37.755 --> 00:27:41.580
So you can have long
chains where the

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.090
position isn't fixed.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.440
So let's look at a couple
of examples.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.500
So let's look at butene.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.260
OK, let me just write
that down.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.960
That's good.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:28:00.410
The position of carbon-carbon
is not fixed.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.220
It just has to be somewhere in
the molecule, which consists

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.560
only of hydrogen and carbon

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.500
So here's a couple
of examples.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.390
I'll start with this one.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.640
This is going to be--

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:16.670
so this is 1, 2, 3, 4, so
that's a but- something.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.610
And it's got a double bond,
so that's a butene.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.810
It's all hydrocarbon.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.670
So that's butene here.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.930
But I could also-- well,
let's finish this.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:25.300
How many?

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.500
This is 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.680
See, I even tried to indicate
the 120 degrees here.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.190
This is going to
be 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.260
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:39.990
All right.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.350
So there's the butene.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.570
But there's another place I
could put the carbon-carbon

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.140
double bond.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.500
I could do it this way.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.910
Make a carbon-carbon single
bond, move the carbon-carbon

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.820
double bond over to the
number 2 position.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.390
this is 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.180
So this is going to be 1-butene,
and this one here is

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.420
going to be 1, 2.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.010
So we'll make this 2-butene.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.370
And let's keep counting here.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:13.640
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1,
2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.460
And I've proven to you,
I hope, by now that I

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.650
can count to four.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.620
So this is 2-butene, right?

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.540
2-butene.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.500
And if you go through this
using the same kind of

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.800
diagrammatic analysis as over
here, you're going to come to

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.770
the conclusion that even though
these both have the

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:35.880
same composition, which is going
to be C4H8, they're both

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.620
C4H8, but as you diagram them,
you'll find that they have

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.750
different constituents.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.730
So these, in fact, are
constitutional

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.700
isomers of one another.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.200
Constitutional isomers.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.320
Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.730
There's even more.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.150
It gets even better.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:05.070
I want to focus on the bottom
one, the 2-butene, and I want

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.170
to write it out with a little
bit more detail.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:13.450
So let's start with that
carbon-carbon double bond.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:17.410
And we know the carbon-carbon
double bond requires planar

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.580
structures at 120 degrees
from one another.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.080
So let's look at that one.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.220
And what we've got here, is on
the carbon, I've got on the

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.880
one side, I've got a hydrogen
strut, right?

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.150
And on the other side,
I've got a methyl.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:34.520
I've put a methyl
here, like that.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.420
OK?

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.240
Or actually, let's get--

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.080
OK, I'll do that.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.220
I was-- what I wanted to
do, to get really--

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.000
OK, watch this.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.210
All right.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.360
So what I'm going to
do on this side,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.250
this side, same thing.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:47.110
The carbon has a hydrogen strut
down here, and on the

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.130
other side, you've
got the methyl.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.070
OK?

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.410
So that looks good.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:56.140
But there's another way to do
this, and still keep the

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.000
carbon-carbon bond
in the center.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.860
So I'm going to do
that over here.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.090
So 1, 2, 1, 2.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.100
And in this instance, I'll put
the same thing I have on the

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.050
left side, H3C.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.310
So so far, so good.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.850
I've got the same molecule.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.330
But now what I'm going to do,
just for grins and chuckles,

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.300
I'm going to put the hydrogen in
the upper position, and the

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.480
methyl in the lower position.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.770
Now, these are not
constitutional isomers.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.140
They have the same constitution,
right?

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.660
Carbon-carbon double bond, two
methyl groups, two hydrogens.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.250
Carbon-carbon double bond, two
methyl groups, two hydrogens.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.510
So they're constitutionally
identical, yet these have very

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.820
different properties.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.890
Can you see?

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.790
I mean, the dipole moment is
going to be different.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.010
Look.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.510
Here's the charge, all up on one
side, and here the charge

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.580
is more symmetrically
straddled.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.300
Which means, they're going to
have different melting points.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.020
They're going to have different
boiling points.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.130
And they have the same chemical
formula, and they

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.390
have the same chemical
constitution.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:01.520
So they're different kinds.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.040
There's some kind of isomers--

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.190
what's the difference here?

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:07.210
It's not the constitution,
it's the way things are

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.510
arranged in space!

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.250
This is great material
science.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.590
Spatial orientation
is everything.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:14.950
And what do you call it when
you're listening to some

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.840
loudspeakers and a really good
audio system, and you can

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.740
close your eyes, and the violins
are over here, and the

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.170
cello is here, and
you can hear the

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.370
percussion way in the back.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.230
What is that called?

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.910
Stereophonic sound.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:36.940
Stereo phonic, meaning you can
render spacial resolution.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.365
So these are called
stereoisomers.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.090
One's a stereoisomer
of the other.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.580
So they're spacially
distinguishable.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.560
So they have--

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.710
for example, I went and
looked this up.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.980
Oh.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.860
Let's give some names to this.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.080
In this case, all the methyls
are on the same side, and the

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.390
hydrogens are on
the same side.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:04.450
So I can a dividing plane
here, if you like,

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:05.990
parallel to the floor.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.540
And I'll just cut right through
the center of the

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.980
carbons, parallel
to the floor.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.420
And so in one instance, all the
methyls are on the same

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.940
side, and here the methyls are
on opposite sides of the

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.000
double bond.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.510
So when they're on the same
side, this is called

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.730
cis-butene.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.650
And let's be super pedantic.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.710
It was a 2-butene, so now
it's a cis-2-butene.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.720
This is terrific.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.800
And this is a 2-butene, but
it's on opposite side.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.253
So this is called a
trans-2-butene.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.870
Cis-2-butene and
trans-2-butene.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.940
And I looked up-- so let's see,
which one do you think

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.450
has tighter, which one's going
to be more tightly packed?

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:55.110
Which one's going to have
the greater density?

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.740
Which one's going
to pack better?

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.990
Cis or trans?

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:16.740
The density here is 0.627, and
the density here is 0.61.

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.440
OK?

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.370
Now, which one's going to have
the higher boiling point?

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.200
Which one's going to have the
higher boiling point?

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.530
Gee, that should be
a no-brainer.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.250
Once you know which one's
got the higher density.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.520
Why does it have the
higher density?

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.040
Because it's more nearest
neighbors is

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.050
more tightly packed.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.620
So I would bet on the one
with the higher density.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:42.040
And this one boils at, boiling
point is 3.7 degrees Celsius,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.040
and this one, the boiling
point is--

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.270
hang on, I've got
this backwards.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.370
This is 3.7.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.860
Boiling point is 1
degree Celsius.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.450
So those are the data
as they come up.

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:58.890
So stereoisomer, spacially
distinguishable.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.210
By the way, we can form
multiple bonds.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:03.320
We can form multiple
double bonds.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.720
So they're -enes as well.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:10.990
So if we have two double bonds
in the molecule, so we'll call

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.600
that a diene.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.070
And we can have--

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.520
you can keep going with the
Latin, but common ones you

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.350
might find is the triene.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.920
And this will come back later
when we look at polymers.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.040
So if we have two bonds,
we will have--

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:33.680
You know, some of that hard
luggage that you're seeing

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.680
that's coming back, they got the
roller boards, but instead

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.940
of the fabric, now they're
coming back with the really

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.040
hard polymer?

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:46.650
That's ABS, and the
b is butadiene.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.080
So let's look at a-- here's
a pentadiene.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.190
I'll give you a pentadiene.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.390
So that's going to
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.510
It's five carbons,
for starters.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.510
And I'm going to put
the double bonds on

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.240
the 1 and the 3 carbon.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.600
It'll be a penta-, it's
five carbons.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.070
And it's an -ene, because
there's going to be some

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.450
double bonds here.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.040
And it's a di-, because I'm
going to put double bonds at

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.870
the 1 and the 3.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:14.510
So 1 gets a double bond, and
3 gets a double bond.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.100
So this is a pentadiene.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.040
OK?

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.830
And then the last thing is--

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:22.370
pardon me.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:25.330
Last thing is radicals.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.310
So here's the common radical.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:34.770
We'll start with ethylene, and
I'm going to make an ethylene

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:35.395
radical here.

00:36:35.395 --> 00:36:39.440
I'll break off the hydrogen at
this point, and I can write

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.690
that as CH2CH.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:49.110
And we can't call this ethyl
radical, because ethyl was

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.130
already used for C2H5.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.070
So we need to indicate that
there's a double bond, and so

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.360
this radical is known
as vinyl.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.010
This is the vinyl radical.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:04.020
And so you could react this with
chlorine, for example, in

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.260
which case you'd make vinyl
chloride, and then you'd

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.790
polymerize that, and
you make PVC.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:13.070
And we're going to see that
in the next coming days.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.040
Or you could you can put
alcohol on there.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.690
I've already told you that.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.230
I don't need to remind you
twice about that, I bet.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.570
OK.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.130
So now--

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.360
oh, there's one other one.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.570
There's one other one that will
come up if you take a lot

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:28.390
of biochemistry, and
that's the one that

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.650
comes off of propene.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:31.545
So if you start with propene,
propene's going

00:37:31.545 --> 00:37:32.820
to look like this.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.000
1, 2, 3.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.120
So there's propene.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:37.990
3.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.770
There's a saying double bond
here, and I'm going to put 1,

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.550
2, 3 in here.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.470
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.580
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:50.260
OK.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.510
So this is the radical that
comes from propene.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:38:01.790
So this one is derived from
ethylene, and this one here is

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:06.520
derived from propylene.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.990
So again, as in this case, we
couldn't call this ethyl.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.280
We can't call this propyl,
because that's the one that

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.140
you get from the alkane.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.000
So instead, this one
is called allyl.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.770
A L L Y L.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:24.950
And if you take 7012 at some
point, Professor Weinberg will

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:27.090
refer to these pendant groups.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.370
He likes to pronounce
this all-YL.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.630
You'll hear him talk about,
and the all-YLS are

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.400
over here and here.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.330
That's what we're
talking about.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:35.960
OK, good.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:41.560
So this is C3H7 dot.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.900
Good.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.300
All right.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.660
Moving right along.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.220
Now I want to turn
to the alkynes.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:56.140
That's the sp hybridization.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.740
sp.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:01.590
And that means there's going
to be at least one

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:05.120
carbon-carbon triple bond.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.880
One carbon-carbon triple bond.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:14.010
So the formula there is CNH2N
minus 2, and obviously N has

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.590
to be greater than
1, otherwise you

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.010
can't form a bond.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.300
And there's very little
that you need to

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.570
remember about this one.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.740
The dominant one that you'll
come upon is C2H2.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:34.770
So according IUPAC nomenclature,
the two carbons

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:40.270
means it has to be F, and these
are all alkynes, so this

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.830
should be ethyne.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.080
And if you ask for ethyne,
nobody knows what you're

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.300
talking about, although
it's very correct.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:51.830
This is known as acetylene,
which is a fuel gas for

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.720
welding, cutting, torches
and so on.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.990
You've got two lines, you've got
a big tank of acetylene,

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.710
you've got a big
tank of oxygen.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.340
And this is used because there
is enormous energy stored in

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.830
this carbon-carbon
double bond.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:07.500
And so when you combust this
with the stoichiometric amount

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:14.400
of oxygen, you can cut through
steel, you can use this to

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.380
make very elaborate glassware
with pure silica, making fused

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.770
quartz glassware.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.830
Very, very high energy
contained in here.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:28.900
And just to give one more
example, let's look at

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.370
something that's got
four carbons in it.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.960
So it's going to have four
carbons and a triple bond.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.490
So if it's 4, it's going to have
the B U T but-, and it's

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:39.430
going to need an -yne.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.090
So this will be a butyne.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.150
And depending on where we want
to put the triple bond, I

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.830
don't know, if you want to
put a triple bond here,

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.550
there's 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:53.580
So this we could call 2-butyne,
and it's C4H6, If

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:58.510
you go through the
stoichiometry.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.220
Let's try it, just
for practice.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.720
So this carbon on the
end is 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.360
Look at the second carbon.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.130
It's got one strut bonding to
the neighboring carbon, and

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.170
three struts bonding
to the neighboring

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.610
carbon on the right.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.020
It's saturated now.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.740
Nothing comes of
without carbon.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.380
Look at this one.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.090
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:19.370
Nothing comes off of this one.

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.130
And then finally 1, 2, 3.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.360
So there's three hydrogens here,
there's three hydrogens

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.070
here, there's your
sixth hydrogen.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.740
C4H6.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.970
OK.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.280
That's good.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:30.630
All right.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.300
There's one other set that I
want to look at, and these are

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.790
called the arynes.

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:37.342
These are aromatic
hydrocarbons.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.860
Some people refer to
them as arynes.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:55.770
And the most notable one is
C6H6, which is benzine.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:05.670
And benzine's molecular weight
was determined long ago, in

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.400
the early 1800s.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:17.990
And it was Kekule who, in 1865,
dared to suggest that

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:29.400
the chemical structure of
benzine was a ring structure.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:37.650
So Kekule suggested
a carbon ring.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:42.030
Up until this time, people
didn't have the common

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:45.800
understanding that carbons could
link to themselves, let

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.410
alone form a ring.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:51.400
And so now, if we go through
this, we will put, from each

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.830
of these junctions there's the
carbon, so we have to have

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:54.580
four struts.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:43:00.580
We need hydrogen, so let's put
hydrogens 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, So

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.790
there's the 6 hydrogens.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.880
And now, each carbon
needs 4 struts.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.070
So 1, 2, 3, and I'll
put a double bond.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.260
That will make 4.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:18.420
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2,
3, 4, and now this one here.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.720
So you have an alternating
structure of double bond,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.160
single bond, double bond, single
bond on the carbons.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.020
OK?

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:30.100
So that's the way things stood
until the twentieth century,

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:36.730
when on the basis of new data,
it was discovered that all

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.110
carbon-carbon bonds--

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.610
and I don't want to make this
a single bond, I'll just say

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:48.940
all carbon-carbon bonds in
benzine, C6H6, were measured

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.200
to be the same length.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.660
Well, that's a problem,
isn't it?

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.850
That's a problem, because we
would expect that, you know,

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:01.970
we know that carbon-carbon
single bond is about 1.47

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:07.190
angstroms, and the carbon-carbon
double bond has

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.220
to be shorter, because it's
double-bond, it's tighter, so

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.070
it pulls things in.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:20.170
So that's 1.33 angstroms. And
the measurement here was found

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:27.230
to be 1.39 angstroms. And 1.39
angstroms is midway between

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.410
1.47 and 1.33.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:33.160
So people were frustrated with
this new information.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:37.820
And it was Linus Pauling who
made sense of this for us.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:43.220
Pauling, who in 1931 came
along and said,

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.990
what we have a mix?

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.420
What if we have a mix
of two structures?

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:53.510
And he said, suppose you had
something that looked like so.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.530
1, 1, 1.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.970
So here's the set of double
bonds off of the ring.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:05.970
And what if there is a resonance
with an opposite

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:09.740
hybrid, where this double bond,
instead of being here,

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.620
goes over to here?

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.490
So now we have this?

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.480
And he said, if the system
resonated between the

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.280
structure on the left and the
structure on the right, the

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:24.410
time average value of the
carbon-carbon bond length

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:32.470
would be around 1.39 angstroms.
So this is a

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:42.410
resonant hybrid structure, to
account for the mix of single

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:46.960
and double bonds, which gives
rise to the current

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.710
representation of benzine
as simply this.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.610
So we're not saying this
is single or double.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:55.570
It's a resonant between
one and two.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.350
OK.

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:00.000
The other thing is, if all of
these bonds are the same

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.190
length, and that means that
between the 12:00 position

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:10.170
here and the 2:00 position,
there is pi bonding, and then

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:14.020
along this double bond, there's
pi bonding, and then

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.760
along this double bond,
there's pi bonding.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.940
But if all of the bonds are the
same length, I can't say

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.770
that the pi bonds are confined
to where the double bonds are

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:29.050
indicated, because resonance
indicates that it could be

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.500
between adjacents.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.190
So that means that
the electrons, in

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.960
fact, can go all around.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.040
So resonance, then, means that
the pi electrons are

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.290
delocalized.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.540
And now here's some
better drawings.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.710
It's hard to draw that.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:53.680
So here they are.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:53.940
OK.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.800
So this is a nicer drawing
of benzine.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.760
So you can see, when all of
these bonds are resonant, it

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.240
doesn't matter whether I choose
this front one as the

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.670
double bond, or the
one next to it.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:06.290
They're all the same length,
and so the electrons can go

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.840
all around.

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.920
And you can imagine, if I did
this with graphite, and I kept

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.710
going, well, if the electron can
go here, then it means it

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.640
can go here, which means it can
go here, which means it

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.340
can go everywhere.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.490
Which is why graphite is an
electronic conductor, because

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:24.180
of delocalized pi bonds.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:24.760
OK.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.300
This is 1-3-butadiene.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.510
Double bond, single
bond, double bond.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:31.710
Again, all the same length, and
you can hybridize, and--

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:32.740
This is how you start making

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.890
electronically conducted polymers.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.630
You just go double bond,
single bond.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:37.860
Double bond, single bond.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.410
Smear.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:41.480
That's it.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:41.840
OK.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.920
Let's jump over that.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.770
Let's talk about Kekule So he
studied architecture, switched

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:49.470
to chemistry.

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:51.990
And then he got a job in London,
and he used to fall

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:54.022
asleep on the bus to
his apartment.

00:47:54.022 --> 00:47:55.820
And one day he was sleeping
on the bus.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.350
He woke up, and he'd been
dreaming about carbon forming

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.860
chains in 1855.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.090
And he proposed carbon chains.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.770
And then he got a job as a
professor in Belgium, at the

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.510
University of Ghent.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:10.890
And one night he fell asleep
at the fireplace, and he

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:14.500
dreamt of a benzine molecule
as a snake biting its tail

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.900
while spinning.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.230
And that's where he got the
idea of the ring molecule.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.710
All he knew was that this thing
had a formula, C6H6.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.510
And for this, he's dubbed
the founder

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.800
of structural chemistry.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.240
So what's this formula
for success?

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.780
Well, he moved into chemistry
from another field.

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.880
But to dream, you've got
to get some sleep.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.250
And I'm probably talking to one
of the most sleep-deprived

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.940
populations on this campus.

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.150
So I urge you to get some sleep,
and then maybe you'll

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.460
be able to dream.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.310
Hey, don't make noise.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:45.510
We've got two minutes left.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.510
nobody's going anywhere.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.350
All right.

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:54.780
So the next thing is, I want
to talk a little bit about

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.170
octane ratings and automobiles,
and how we go

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.900
from straight chains to chains
of different lengths.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.530
If you're looking at combustion,
the idea is, you

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.730
admit gasoline, which vaporizes,
and then the piston

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:10.050
comes up, and under
high compression,

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.670
the spark plug fires.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:14.490
When the spark plug fires, this
causes an explosion which

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.790
then pushes the piston down,
and then you've got the

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.730
camshaft that takes the vertical
motion and converts

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.010
it to rotary motion.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:22.920
Now, if you're running an
automobile after a certain

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.980
period of time, the combustion
chamber becomes so hot that

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.400
just admitting the fuel, having
it vaporized, before

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.400
the piston has risen fully to
get maximum compression, this

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.140
thing could just explode.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.070
And when it explodes, it'll send
the piston down, and it's

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:40.870
out of sequence with
the other pistons.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.100
And that's when you
get the knocking.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.170
Sometimes you're driving
up hill, you hear this

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.890
[GRINDING SOUND].

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:47.420
That's the knocking going on.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.540
You need to get a tune-up,
or switch to

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.200
higher octane gasoline.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.410
So what's going on in here?

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:55.770
What you're doing, is you're
changing the chemical

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:59.980
composition, the constitutional
isomerization.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:05.030
And you do that in the process
by which you synthesize the

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:06.540
gasoline in the first place.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.800
So the figure of merit is called
octane number, which

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.970
was first instituted here
in the United States.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.620
And they started with
2-2-4-trimethyl-pentane.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.810
It's an octane, but it's
an octane that's 2-2-4.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:18.980
Three methyl branches.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.810
So that means there's
only five left.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:23.740
So it's a pentane with three
methyl branches.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.080
And that's called 100.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.290
And then is 0 is heptane.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.780
If you put heptane into the
combustion chamber, you'll

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:31.920
knock yourself silly.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.880
And the engine will just shake
and shake and shake.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.210
So gasolines have to be
somewhere on that interval.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.630
So there's the-- you know,
if you tested and you had

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.210
something that was
trimetylpentane, 90%, versus

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.700
10% heptane, you'd call
it a 90% octane.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.080
And you can have octane
numbers higher

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.530
than 100, by the way.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:50.820
It just depends on what
the repression is.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:54.700
And oddly enough, when you when
you increase the octane,

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:57.510
you make the fuel more
difficult to burn.

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:00.300
Because you want it to
burn only on demand.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.750
Fuel that just burns whenever
it wants leads to random

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:06.440
events in the engine, and that's
not good, if you want

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.210
to get good thrust. So oddly
enough, high octane gasoline

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:12.910
requires more ignition
than low octane.

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:14.760
And the additives
are tetraethyl

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.480
lead or ethyl alcohol.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:23.490
And from that, you know now, we
get E10, which is gasohol,

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.840
10% alcohol.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.720
E85 is 85% ethyl alcohol.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.140
And all of this you
get by synthesis.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.500
You know, playing with the
catalysts, temperatures, and

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.360
so on, to get the right
mix to get good fuel,

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.380
and get good emissions.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.825
And you can decide amongst
yourselves whether going to

00:51:39.825 --> 00:51:43.670
E85 high levels of ethanol,
ethanol derived from corn, is

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.970
that smart, is that
food for fuel?

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:50.710
You know, what's the sensible
use of agriculture, algae,

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:51.960
switchgrass?

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.720
All of that stuff.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.150
I mean, it's all loaded
into here.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:56.660
All loaded into here.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.620
So yeah.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.410
With that, I think
we'll adjourn.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.200
I'll see you on Wednesday.
