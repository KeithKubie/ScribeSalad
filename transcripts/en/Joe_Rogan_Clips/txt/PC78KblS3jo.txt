Speaker 1:          00:00          Happen, the Joe Rogan experience and our fears that you were just discussing earlier about how soft we are in comparison to the past civilizations in terms of like our ability to live off the land. That's one aspect that bothers me, but one of the big ones that bothers me is the fact that everything is digital. All of our information is stored on hard drives. You Bet. And if that goes down, there's not much left. You've paper books and, and you know, a few thousands of years, imagine what will be left. Yeah, we would lose all of our advancement.

Speaker 2:          00:35          Well, I can, I can speak to this at, at uh, at, at a personal level, there was a time when I was an excellent map redo. I could navigate anywhere with, with maps, you know, my wife Santha an I did huge Jenny's in Mexico back in the early 1990s in really cheap hire cars with maps and we found our way everywhere without any problem today I can hardly use a map. The skill of using a map has lapsed within me. Why? Because of GPS, GPS technology has come along and it's, and it, it always tells me where I am and being a bit lazy, uh, I just accept that, that technology, but then I had caused to us myself, there's just the other day supposing gps, supposing all the satellites go down and there's no, no gps is the whole, the whole industrialized human race is going to suddenly be lost. All those Uber drivers who don't know their way from a to B and who rely entirely on their gps is they won't know. They won't know where they're going. And it's, and it's true with digital data. The digital digital data, unlike unlike print data is very fragile and requires programs in order to access and interpret it that are much more complicated than simply cracking the code of a, a lost language.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Do you don't mean their programs vary between different phone platform? Exactly. Very computer platforms. It's just, it's so fragile and it's so, uh, I mean, I don't know if there's any precautions that have been taken place to preserve this information in case of like what Robert Schoch describes coronal mass ejection or something,

Speaker 2:          02:07          then click down all the satellites. Yeah. No, I don't think, I don't think preparation has been made and I don't, and I don't, and it's very clear that that preparation is not being made for the risk of another, a cosmic impact. Um, uh, and again, a, a point that I'd like to make about this is that we are at, we are in a sense in a place where history can repeat itself, uh, that there are certain cycles at work. Uh, the work on the comet impact 12,000, 800 years ago. How has very clearly and specifically identified the debris trail at that comment. And that Debbie trail is the Taurid meteor stream and it's called the Taurid meteor stream because it appears to emanate from the region of the sky in which the constellation of Taurus sits. It doesn't, it's within our solar system. It's an optical illusion.

Speaker 2:          02:58          The Taurid stream is a giant complex of debris. Uh, it is 30 million kilometers wide. What you had was an original comment that might have been a hundred to 200 kilometers in diameter, a small moon which fragmented and broke up into multiple, multiple parts and those parts began to spread out along the whole orbit of the Taurid meteor stream. And to widen the whole thing widens. So it's like a giant tube of debris and the evidence and the argument is that 12,000, 800 years ago, several large bits of that debris fell out of the Taurid meteor stream and impacted with the earth. The problem is that the tour of meteor stream still exists and our planets still passes through it twice a year. Uh, and those passages take place in June and in November and each passage takes 12 and a half days and the same group of scientists who are, who are looking at the evidence for the impacts 12,800 years ago are deeply concerned that we may face future impacts from the tour of meteor stream.

Speaker 2:          04:03          That there are still large objects up there. This is not theory. This is a fact. There's a comet up there, uh, called comet Encke, which is part of the Taurid meteor stream. It's a large fragment of the original giant comment comment. Danky has a diameter of, I dunno, five or five or six kilometers. There's, there's 19 recognized huge objects within the Taurid meteor stream calculations indicate that there may be as much as 200 asteroids within the Taurid meteor stream of a diameter of a kilometer or more, which would have catastrophic effect if they, if they hit the earth and responsible astronomers regard the Taurid meteor stream as the greatest collision hazard facing mankind at the present time. And it's not something that we need to fall into despair about because it's perfectly within the level of our technology to do something about it. What could they do? Well, to give you an example, a commercial interests are looking right now and the technology is there to mine asteroids.

Speaker 2:          04:57          We can go to asteroids. If the, if the commercial interest is high enough, we can go to them, we can mine them, we can extract minerals, we can bring them back to the earth. The same technology would allow you to move asteroids or comet fragments. You don't want to blow them up with a nuke. That would be a really bad idea that would, that would, uh, turn one large object into multiple smaller objects, which could cause equally massive devastation and would be very difficult to predict where that devastation was going to fall. What you want to do is to nudge them and moved them out of a dangerous orbit into, into a less dangerous orbit. And, and, and the evidence is in the next 30 years, we are going to be passing through dangerous filaments of the Taurid meteor stream. And if we were smart, we would be devoting some resources to protecting our cosmic environment.

Speaker 2:          05:44          Just as we, there are many issues that we need to devote resources to. Unfortunately, the one that's most attractive to our politicians at the moment is warfare. Uh, we devote limitless resources to technologies of mass destruction. There. There really is no end to the amount that we're prepared to spend on that in terms of our so called security. We feel somehow we're making ourselves more secure by having these incredible weapons and spending trillions of dollars on them. But the cosmos doesn't give a fuck about any of that. The Cosmos is out there with these, with these giant giant objects, uh, which have a far greater explosive power than all the nuclear, um, weapons stored on earth at the, at the present time, the comments, you shoemaker levy nine which hit Jupiter in 1994 had a total calculated explosive power of 300 gigatons. If you took the entire nuclear arsenal of the world today and blew it all up at once, it would yield 6.4 gigatons.

Speaker 2:          06:43          So these objects are producing catastrophic results on a scale that far, far beyond anything that we ourselves could do with nuclear weapons. It's time we spent a bit less time and money on weapons of mass destruction and a bit more on looking after this beautiful garden that we call the earth. And that is our home and it will be the home of our children and our children's children. I'm a grandfather now. I feel passionately about this. We need to look after this planet. It's our responsibility as a human species to do so. And one of the challenges, it's not the only challenge. There are many, many other challenges. One of the challenges is to pay attention to our cosmic environment and to realize that the cosmos can intervene cataclysmically in the human story. And that the tour of meteor stream in particular may have been a hidden hand in human history that there may have been other impacts in the last 13,000 years that affect have affected and changed the course of humanity on this earth.

Speaker 2:          07:38          And the ancients were very good at paying attention to the sky. We ourselves have amazing tech to study the sky, but for some reason were ignoring this problem of cosmic impact. And that's incredibly irresponsible because as I said a moment ago, it is a solvable problem. It is within the limits of our technology. It would require a global cooperative effort to sweep our cosmic environment clean. But it could be done and a side product of that global corporation might be a friendlier, more nurturing, more loving, more positive human community. It is very odd that we have this infant town nature, even as grown adults and world leaders that we don't, we do like to nor imminent danger as long as it hasn't effected us in the past. Yes, there's no real moment we can point to other than tongue goose SCA in you know, photographic history, modern history where you could take pictures of things when we had an agenda and if I can, if I can pause you on that very point.

Speaker 2:          08:37          The evidence is compelling that the Tunguska event was an object that fell out of the Taurid meteor stream that happened at the peak of the Bita tour. It's in June, 1900 and eight that it's extremely likely that that Tunguska object came from the Taurid meteor stream because we were passing through the Taurid meteor stream at exactly that time. And what are the tongue Glusker? Object is estimated to be between 60 and 190 meters in diameter. So it's not a very big object. It's not a kilometer scale object. It's a, it's, it's, it's big, but it's not that big. It doesn't even hit the earth. It, it's an air burst. It explodes in the sky above fortunately, and uninhabited area of Siberia. But the devastation is huge. It wasn't even noticed for some years afterwards until scientific teams went in and studied the area and discovered that 80 million trees across 2000 square kilometers had been completely flattened by that airburst.

Speaker 2:          09:32          Uh, and to put that in context, 2000 square kilometers is the size of London. So anybody who knows London is aware that there's a ring road around London called the m 25 if that air best had taken place over central London, everything of London out as far as the m 25 would have been gone completely. Is that what it looks like today? Pretty close. Pretty close. There's like a hundred years later, there's still no trees. Yeah. And, and if you've got, you're looking at, I've parked there, you're looking at the black and whites that were taken in the early 19 hundreds. Yeah. Which, which revealed the extent of this, uh, of this damage. So it's just stupid of us not to pay a bit more attention to this, especially when we have the tech to actually do something about it. We have that, that nature though, when it comes to climate debt, there's a curious denial.

Speaker 2:          10:18          There's a denial, um, of the role of capitalism's in the human story. And there, there is even a word for that in, in science and it's called uniformitarianism. And, and this is a particular philosophy of science where the view is that everything is, we see it in the world today is how things have always been. So if we don't see cataclysms today and they're not playing a major part in our story today, then there weren't cataclysms. And they didn't play a major part in our story in the past. That's why, although it's before the time of human beings, when the evidence that the dinosaurs were made extinct by a comet or an asteroid, a first came out, um, Lewis and Walter Alvarez, the father son team who were behind that science were ridiculed by their colleagues and they were told him, absolutely observed. Of course, no cosmic event could have made the dinosaurs extinct.

Speaker 2:          11:09          They spent 10 years taking that ridicule until they found the crater in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, the whole scientific community has accepted that the course of life on this planet was radically changed by a cosmic impact. Um, you know, I like to joke about it, but it was a cosmic impact that was big enough literally to turn dinosaurs into chickens because that's what's left of the time. So align is, you know, the birds, and at the same time, skulking in those primeval forests is this little mammal and it looks a bit like a shrew, a 65 million years ago going nowhere. The dinosaurs ruled the earth. Then the cosmos intervenes. The dinosaurs are swept out of the way. And what happens, the mammals start to evolve very rapidly and they start to occupy niches that were previously closed to them. And the bottom line is we would not be here. The human species would not be here. We would not be having this conversation if the dinosaurs had not been made extinct 65 million years ago. Uh, so these are, we'll changing events. And my argument is that such a wheelchair in event occurred between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago, and it's high time. We paid more attention to it.
