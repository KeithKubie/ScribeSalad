00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:10.130
Home is more than just
the place you are in.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.370
It's a feeling.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.970
It was very dangerous if
I were to stay in Syria.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.830
So many Syrians have had
to leave our country.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.490
We have about 2.5 million
Syrian refugees in Turkey.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.312
Small things that
were easy in Syria

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:29.020
suddenly become hard
in the foreign land.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.240
I ask myself what I can
do for the refugees.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.530
I know programming.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.040
Gherbtna means "expatriation."

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.580
It helps Syrians navigate
a new life in Turkey,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.380
for example, I want to rent a
car, I want to rent a house.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.280
It helps connect
you with employers.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.900
It tells you how to your
children into the schools.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.530
Anything.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.160
I love programming because
it allows me to do anything.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.646
It seems there is no limit
to what we can accomplish.

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:00.900
Syria will always
be our country,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.890
but it's possible to make this
new place feel like a home.
