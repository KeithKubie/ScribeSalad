00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.330
So you’ve probably seen a little kid react
to a sudden bang or a terrifying clown or

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.660
some strange Santa at the mall, right?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.660
Yeah, not pretty.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.620
That child probably immediately reached for
a parent, looking for comfort, and that same

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.000
kid might freak out if she was separated from
her adult of choice, especially is she was

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.340
in an unfamiliar environment.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.180
It’s called attachment and if you’ve ever
seen a clingy kid you know why it’s called

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.180
that.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.180
They attach.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.640
For a long time psychologists assumed that
this was just an intense innate survival instinct;

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.910
I mean it makes sense that babies would be
attached to their food source and bigger kids

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.970
would stick around to the people who helped
them survive.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.210
But in the 1950s American psychologists Harry
and Margaret Harlow came along with a barrel

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.810
of monkeys, complicating and illuminating
our idea of bonding with caregivers in what

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.090
has to be one of the saddest psychological
experiments of all time.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.870
The Harlow’s were breeding Rhesus macaque
monkeys for their research on learning.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.950
Part of the process involved separating babies
from their mothers right after birth, which,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.399
yeah, pretty cruel already.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.840
They began noticing that baby monkeys were
very attached to the blankets they had in

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.910
their cages, so they set up an experiment.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.649
They created two artificial mothers.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.960
One was a bare wire cylinder with a feeding
bottle attached; they called that Wire Mother,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.759
and the other was a cozier cloth and foam
wrapped cylinder without a feeding bottle:

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:16.759
Cloth Mother.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.979
It took no time at all to see the baby’s
preference.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.840
They overwhelming preferred the comfy cloth
mama, clinging to it whenever they seemed

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.740
to be anxious or in need of comfort, and sometimes
they fed from the Wire Mother with the baby

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.170
bottle while standing on the cloth one.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.889
This discovery that attachment wasn’t just
about getting breakfast surprised a lot of

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:35.889
people.

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:40.329
It turns out that contact and touch are vital
to attachment, learning, emotional well-being,

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.729
and psychological development.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.790
As the brain and mind develop in infants so
too do they’re emotions and social behavior.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.799
Caregivers can greatly influence this development,
and most psychologists will tell you that

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.439
how a child is raised early on can have a
huge effect on how they view the world, other

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.209
people and themselves, not to mention how
they react to stressful situations or sort

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.209
out moral dilemmas.

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:06.789
I mean, it’s a big complex challenging world
out there and wire monkey baby mama just ain’t

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.649
gonna cut it.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.220
[Intro]

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.780
Touch.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.150
You can convey all sorts of emotions through
touch.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.760
A hug, a slap, a pat on the back, a poke on
the side all convey meaning.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.230
Babies learn a lot through touch.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.590
It’s how they feel security and trust.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.650
You can imagine how all those poor macaques,
who were separated not just from their mothers,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.560
but everyone, grew up to have some social
issues as adults.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.780
That is maybe putting it too mildly.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.900
Those monkeys showed many signs of being really
disturbed, from trouble eating, to rocking

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.470
back and forth in a trance, to even engaging
in self-mutilation.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.040
Most of the macaques used in this study never
recovered, and those who were forced into

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.820
pregnancy didn't know how to care for their
own offspring.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.400
Although the Harlow's research taught us a
lot, it was inhumane and would never pass

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.070
today's ethical standards.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.790
Monkeys, like humans, need to be loved.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.920
And loving touch and care are tremendously
important, but familiarity is also key to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.920
attachment.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.120
When you're little, a hug from a stranger
is not the same as a hug from your mom or

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.680
your grandma or your dad or your zookeeper
or whomever you're most comfortable and familiar

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680
with.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.100
The unfamiliar can cause anxiety.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.750
And for some critters, all these factors need
to come together sooner rather than later.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.070
Some baby animals experience a critical period
in early life when certain things have to

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.210
happen for normal development to occur.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.570
For ducks and geese, that critical period
occurs just after hatching when they accept

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.340
the first moving object they see as their
mother.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.290
This so-called "imprinting process" can be
difficult to reverse, which can make things

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.890
a bit awkward if that moving thing is a golden
retriever or a person or a beach ball.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.750
Thankfully, human babies don't imprint.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.510
The world would be a lot different and a lot
more bizarre if they did.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.090
Human babies do, however, feel a lot more
comfortable around people, things, and settings

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.510
that they're familiar with.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.960
They form emotional attachments, but not all
attachments are created equal.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.990
In the 1970's, American psychologist Mary
Ainsworth created the "strange situation"

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.620
experiment to observe children's different
attachment styles.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.810
She'd put a one-year-old kid and their mom
in an unfamiliar room, like a playroom at

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.740
the lab and then observe the child playing
with the mother.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.580
Eventually, the child would encounter something
potentially stressful.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.209
Like, a stranger would come in and interact
with the child and then the mom would leave.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.009
If the kid freaked out, the stranger would
try to comfort them.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.930
And then mom would come back and the stranger
would leave.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.650
Different children responded differently to
the strange situation.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.189
Ainsworth measured and observed 4 different
categories of behavior, including separation

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:36.360
anxiety, the child's willingness to explore,
stranger anxiety, and reunion behavior, or

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.180
how the child reacted when the mom returned,
which was what she was particularly interested

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.180
in.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.840
Ainsworth broke this behavior down into three
main attachment styles: secure, insecure avoidant,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.300
and insecure ambivalent.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.370
About 70% of her subjects showed secure attachment
and could happily explore their new digs and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.430
interact with the stranger, so long as their
mom was nearby.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.909
If mom left, they might freak out a bit, but
they greeted her return in a happy and positive

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:00.909
way.

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.240
About 15% of the kids demonstrated insecure
ambivalent attachment.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.389
They were afraid of the stranger, cried more
and explored less, and had a major freak out

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.099
when mom left, only to act all salty and mad
when she returned.

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.830
The last 15% or so showed insecure avoidant
attachment.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.610
They were fine with the stranger, kinda indifferent
actually, didn't cling to mom, didn't seem

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.849
bothered when she left, showed little interest
upon her return.

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.849
Ainsworth observed that sensitive, attentive
mothers usually raised securely attached kids,

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.009
whereas less responsive mothers who often
ignored their children, or super-anxious mothers

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.159
who obsessed over every little thing, often
raised insecurely attached toddlers.

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.969
And then of course, on the extreme, the poor
monkeys with their unresponsive, fake moms,

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.190
they became absolutely terrified in unfamiliar
situations.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.279
Attachment is vital.

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:53.790
It builds the foundation for our sense of
basic trust and quite possibly for our adult

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.789
relationships, our motivation to achieve and
our willingness to be bold, like that toddler

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.129
playing with new toys in a strange room.

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.479
Given what those messed-up monkeys taught
us, it should be no surprise that disruptions

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.819
in attachment can bring a world of pain.

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.999
Babies raised under abuse or extreme neglect
are often withdrawn and frightened, and many

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:15.150
parents who've engaged in abusive behavior
were abused themselves as children.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.839
Young kids exposed to extended abuse, trauma,
and neglect are at higher risk for psychological

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.979
disorders, health problems, and substance
abuse as adults.

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.620
Studies of children raised in understaffed
Romanian orphanages, for example, found that

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.219
they scored lower in cognitive tests and were
twice as likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.770
as their counterparts raised in quality foster
homes.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.249
It's certainly true that some kids can show
remarkable resilience, but disrupted attachment

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:44.210
and care, often further complicated by social
and economic marginalization of all kinds,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.270
can leave life-long scars.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.969
So if one of infancy's major social achievements
is forming positive attachments, then one

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:54.919
of the biggest achievements in childhood would
have to be achieving a positive sense of self.

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.470
This self-concept, or an understanding and
evaluation of who we are, is usually pretty

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.589
solid by about the time we turn 12.

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:05.900
Charles Darwin proposed that our self-awareness
begins when we can recognize ourselves in

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.900
a mirror.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.099
This self-recognition typically doesn't occur
in humans under 15 to 18 months.

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.819
And by the time that tot's heading to kindergarten,
their self-concept is rapidly expanding.

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.740
They probably know their age, hair color,
and family name.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.801
Perhaps they know they're good at drawing
and not so good at tree climbing, and they're

00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:25.309
noticing the differences and similarities
they share with other people.

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:29.369
Kids with positive self-images are more happy,
confident, independent, and sociable.

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:33.999
So, how can we instill these values and security
in kids?

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:36.460
And how does parenting affect development?

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.280
Whether your parents were aloof or affectionate,
strict or lax, and whether they spanked you

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.379
or preferred to talk it out, one model of
parenting would probably categorize them into

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:48.370
one of three major styles, all related to
control.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.680
The authoritarian parent makes rules with
consequences and expects you to follow them

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.999
because "I said so!" and tends to not be very
warm to their child.

00:07:56.999 --> 00:08:00.819
Whereas the permissive parent often caves
to their child's demands and exerts little

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:03.039
control over any of the child's behavior.

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.789
The authoritative parent, meanwhile, seeks
to find a balance between the two.

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:11.210
They are demanding, but always explain the
reasons for their rules, and are loving and

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.210
responsive.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.830
And, of course, research indicates that finding
that culturally appropriate sweet-spot between

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.960
too hard and too soft is the best way to go.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.330
Now, in addition to that growing sense of
self, two other important landmarks of childhood

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.349
and adolescence are the ability to discern
right from wrong and the formation of individual

00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:28.349
character.

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:30.610
When those two things combine, they give us
morality.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.500
Last week, we talked about Jean Piaget and
his three-tiered model for cognitive development.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.750
Well, American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg
modified and expanded on that, and blew it

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.510
up into his own three-level theory of moral
development, which emphasized the notion that

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.260
our moral reasoning continues to develop throughout
our lives.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.490
Kohlberg outlined his theory by posing a series
of moral dilemmas to children, teens, and

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.520
adults, and then analyzing their reasoning
behind the judgments.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.500
One of his most famous questions is known
as the Heinz Dilemma.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.700
A woman is dying of cancer; there's a special
new drug that might save her, but the pharmacist

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.560
wants to make a big profit, so he charges
a lot of money for it.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.100
Her husband, Heinz, can't afford it and has
tried everything, from fundraising to begging

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.870
the pharmacist, to no avail.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.770
So, he steals the drug.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.400
Was he wrong?

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.480
Kohlberg was less interested in people's answers
than in the reasoning behind their choice.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.140
He ended up organizing his subjects' responses
into three basic levels of moral thinking.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.140
Kohlberg found that if the subject was younger
than nine, they were likely in what he called

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.130
the preconventional morality phase.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.060
In this phase, kids are concerned with self-interest,
but they're also starting to judge people

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.170
individually, based on their needs and point
of view.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.320
So, Heinz needed the medicine, and stealing
it best served his needs.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.650
But in the second phase, in early adolescence,
our moral compasses seem to shift, during

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.700
what Kohlberg called the conventional morality
phase.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.710
Here, his subjects put an emphasis on conformity
and worry about what would happen to Heinz

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.230
if he was seen as a criminal.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.620
This phase seems to worry "what would people
think?".

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.540
From adolescence on, Kohlberg believes, some
people exist in the postconventional morality

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.540
phase.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.530
This is a more complex adult morality, when
we begin to account for differing values and

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.750
basic rights.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.130
Laws are important, but some situations, like
saving your beloved's life, might overrule

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.130
them.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.600
This phase tops out with reasoning based on
universal ethical principles and more abstract

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.600
reasoning.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.410
Heinz was right to steal the medicine because
people have a right to live.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.180
Critics of Kohlberg's set up question his
emphasis on moral thinking rather than moral

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.290
action, arguing that there's a big difference
between reasoning out what you should do and

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.290
actually doing it.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.160
But one thing's for sure, what we experience
during our first years on this planet, the

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.660
nature and quality of our attachments, our
sense of self, and our moral development,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.910
they all set the stage of our adolescence
and adulthood.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:53.121
Today, your developing brain learned about
Ainsworth's three styles of secure, insecure

00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:55.810
avoidant, and insecure ambivalent attachment.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.990
And about authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative
parenting styles.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.130
You also learned about developing self-concept
and Kohlberg's stages of morality.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.780
