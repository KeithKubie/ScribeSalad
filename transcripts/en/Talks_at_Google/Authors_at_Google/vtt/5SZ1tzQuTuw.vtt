[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:12.994
JEREMY N. SMITH:
Thank you, guys.

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm really happy to be here.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240
Thanks to Dave and company
for ushering me in,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.830
hosting me so well.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.980
I often ask for the
slot right before lunch,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.860
because then I'm all
powerful-- and like what's

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.590
between the audience and lunch.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.870
And it's fun to play that
game, but I think most of us

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.259
had lunch.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.080
So I guess I'm
between you and work,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.270
so we shouldn't just linger
as long as we can in Q&amp;A.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.050
I thought I would just share
a little bit about the book--

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.350
how I came to the story,
share a few passages from it,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.560
and then get into a Q&amp;A and sort
of learn what's on your mind

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.770
and have a kind
of back and forth.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.660
So "Breaking and Entering"
is the true story

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.650
of a female hacker called
Alien and the birth

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.739
of our information
insecurity age.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.120
And I should make
clear from the outset

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.160
that Alien is a
white hat hacker.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.170
She is someone who is paid by
big businesses and government

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.980
agencies to try to break
into them in order to see

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.680
how they can be broken into.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.610
She also does recovery
work if someone has already

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.840
been breached--

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.680
coming in doing forensics
and other analysis

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.890
to figure out what happened,
how to recover, and why.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.530
And she also does a
variety of other things,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.520
such as digital
hostage situations

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.050
and ransomware
cases, for example--

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.590
where you've got 24 hours
to have your hospital system

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.820
or law firm or tech
company get the data

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.300
that has been compromised back.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.179
And you have to pay
$200,000 in Bitcoin.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.220
And she kind of answers--

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.590
is that true?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.900
Is there another
way to get it out?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.050
If you do want to pay
$200,000 in Bitcoin,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.930
how do you do that in
the next few hours?

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.360
How do you do that
without getting

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.815
triple-infected on the way back?

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:14.690
We'll talk more about that
in the sort of end of my talk

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.280
as I get to the
end of her career.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.740
But I want to go back a bit.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.665
So I guess I want to just
get a sense of the room.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.890
Who here is-- I know there's
a lot of different teams--

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.020
who here is in security?

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.910
OK.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.580
So I think I've got
about 15 or so of you.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.750
So that means there's like
30 people in security and 15

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.560
are admitting it.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.890
I've learned the math.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.520
And I guess on the flip
side, has anyone here--

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.860
I won't make you tell
the gory details--

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.500
has anyone here been hacked?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.620
So I don't see any hands.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.010
So as the 15 people who
did raise their hand

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.760
could tell you, that means 40 of
you have been hacked, I guess.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.160
10 of you have, you know it,
you don't want to admit it,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.380
that's OK.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.690
And we can multiply that by 4.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.850
So then that's another
40 of you have and I

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.880
guess you just don't know yet.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.480
Has anyone ever been
targeted by a hacker?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.970
Have you ever
gotten an email that

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.457
might not have been from
the person who said it was?

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:35.540
There might have been a
link if you clicked on it,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.570
it was a bad idea
and they make you all

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.080
carry some special device from
now on to do anything at work?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.180
Anyone?

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.080
Yeah I got a call on
Monday from the Help Desk.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.790
Or it can be face
to face, and we'll

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.130
talk about some
circumstances like that too.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.300
So that is basically all of
us are targeted every day all

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.660
the time.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.010
And so we're in an interesting
situation where hacking is now

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.150
a field where everyone--
not just at Google--

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.270
but is pretty well aware of it--

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.300
from little kids to
great grandmothers.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.500
And all of us are targeted.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.760
And we know that hackers
have an outsized influence

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.240
on parts of our economy, on
our politics, on our culture.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.070
But we still-- for the most
part if you ask people,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.320
what does a hacker look like?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.160
They don't have a face.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.010
So maybe they pop up a
popular search engine.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.120
If you do an image
search for hacker--

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.620
gosh, you get
literally no faces.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.160
You get shadowed figures in
hoodies or occasional Guy

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.390
Fawkes masks.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.020
But don't worry, I'm sure
the fourth search result--

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.430
no, the fifth, the
20th, the 400th.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.420
It just goes on and on.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.140
There are no faces
to this field,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.720
even though it is
so integral to--

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.720
we're all thinking about
it more and more often.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.530
It's in the newspaper every day.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.820
So as a writer, that's an
incredible opportunity.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.020
Can I tell the story?

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.160
Can I show the face?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.755
Can I show a field growing up?

00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:26.130
You wouldn't necessarily know
it by the cover of my book.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.510
It's not that different.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.670
But I'm wedded to the world
that your search engine

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.880
results have created.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.020
And so if I want to signal that
it's a book about a hacker,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.380
I've got to have a shadowy
figure with ones and zeros.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.440
But inside, I try to
put a face on the topic.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.120
So how did I come to this story.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.320
How did I get this
chance to kind of follow

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.850
hacking over the last 20 years?

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.910
Because if you think about
it, even when we have a face,

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.630
that face is like 30, 40
years old at this point.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.570
It's like Matthew
Broderick in "War Games"

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.510
or Angelina Jolie in "Hackers."

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.870
So it's an incredible
opportunity.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.370
So did I just start
following people

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.420
with hoodies down alleyways
until I found someone going

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.850
into the dark web before the
FBI could trap them in a San

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.430
Francisco public library?

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.870
I didn't.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.200
I found this story through
an alternate investigative

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.700
journalism method.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.910
I picked my daughter
up from preschool.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.826
So I went to pick her up, and
there was a new classmate.

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:31.950
They were playing together.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.450
The girls ran off
to the playground.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.370
If you ever have
five-year-olds, you

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.740
know that the best babysitter
for a five-year-old

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.390
is a five-year-old.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.020
They kind of cancel each other
out and they occupy each other.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.590
It's mutually assured something.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:53.640
So I'm talking to the mom and
she says, hey, what do you do?

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.320
And I think, this is
going to be great.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.490
I'm going to be the interesting
person in this conversation.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.590
I'm a writer.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.900
I write these books.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.060
I write these articles.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.570
I talk about myself
for 10 minutes.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.970
And to be polite, I
say, what about you?

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.230
What do you do?

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.410
And she says, well, tomorrow,
I have to break into a bank.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.300
And I realized, oh, I'm
not the interesting person

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.890
in this conversation.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.290
And that led to a longer
series of conversations.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.140
And I found out, yeah, there's
this whole field that's real

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.120
and this whole profession that's
grown over the last 20 years

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.120
as I described to you at
the beginning of people who

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.420
have the same skills
as the bad guys

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.900
and do the same activities
in a high-end, professional,

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.880
organized way but do
it under contract.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.460
You pay them big bucks for
the privilege of having

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.885
them try to break into you.

00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:54.270
And hopefully you
get them to do it

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.620
before you've been broken
into already by a more

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.330
malicious actor.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:05.250
So as I followed her story
and heard more about it,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.610
I got really excited, because
even in the field of hacking,

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.140
people tend to specialize.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.550
You get car hackers.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.050
You get elevator hackers.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.540
You get people working
in a particular operating

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.640
system or mobile phone operating
system or particular network

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.250
vulnerability.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.810
But Alien had gone through
a huge variety of worlds.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.450
And her career, if you will--
it didn't start as a career,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.200
it started as a sort
of fun activity--

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.390
had grown up at the same
time this profession had.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.679
So in following her story, I
could follow hacking's growth

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.890
from this sort of
skateboarding-like subculture

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.430
to what's now, I
think, $140 billion

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.100
cybersecurity industry-- and
not just a large and valuable

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.970
industry, but one that touches
every aspect of our lives

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.320
and gives us insight into
every aspect of our lives.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.660
So the hope was if I can follow
a hacker in her footsteps,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.580
readers can do the same and it's
not just what reading about it

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.610
or learning about it, you'll
experience it yourself

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.650
and kind of understand
our vulnerabilities

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.540
or our capabilities
in a new way.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.730
So I want to share a few
passages to illustrate some

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.740
of the breadth of her world.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.650
One I won't share just for
time reasons is the beginning.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.740
She started as a
17-year-old at MIT.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.880
Do we have any MIT grads here?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.950
Got at least one.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.110
Two.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.965
Yeah, anyone do Course 19?

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.880
I got a smile and I
got a puzzled look.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.090
So at MIT, majors
are called Courses.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.360
So what your number?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.150
What was your course?

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.830
Course 18.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.280
Which is what?

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.385
Course 18 math.

00:09:56.385 --> 00:09:57.260
What was your course?

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.935
AUDIENCE: 6-3.

00:09:57.935 --> 00:10:00.440
JEREMY N. SMITH:
Course 6-3 which was?

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.480
Computer Science.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.290
So they're numbered and
they go up to like 24.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.590
19 is not an assigned number.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.310
There is no
designated Course 19.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.570
But, unofficially,
Course 19 is hacking.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.360
And hacking at MIT
predates computers.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.720
It does not directly
refer to computers at all.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.200
It refers to
physical exploration.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.210
So I was familiar with
part of this tradition.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.860
There's this tradition of
elaborate, ingenious, physical

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.760
pranks--

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.670
like getting a police car
on top of the dome at MIT--

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:43.160
or having a complete living room
set-- couch, liquor cabinet,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.380
even a cat, a newspaper--

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.340
upside down on the arch
outside the Media Lab at MIT--

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.110
or a working Tetris game
that's playable on the windows

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.630
of the tallest
building on campus.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.120
And I was familiar
with these hacks,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.900
but I didn't think about the
foundational skills needed

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.010
to do that.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:09.477
You don't just kind get up at
noon or 8:00 or 9:00 at night

00:11:09.477 --> 00:11:11.810
and say to your buddies, hey,
we should put a police car

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:12.310
on the dome.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.390
Maybe you do that, but you're
not going to pull it off.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.350
You've got to be able to pick
locks, sneak past security

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.490
guards, climb on
ledges, disassemble,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.720
and assemble a car.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.870
You've got to be able
to do that in the dark.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.411
You've got to be able to do that
with a small group of people

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:31.160
you can really trust
to keep a secret.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.646
And you've got to be
able to get in and out--

00:11:33.646 --> 00:11:35.270
and the same thing
with the Tetris game

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.728
the same thing with
the living room

00:11:36.728 --> 00:11:39.920
set, the same thing with
all these other hacks.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.210
And pulling a hack is
what I just described,

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.360
but going hacking is
totally different.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.552
You're exploring for
the sake of exploring.

00:11:50.552 --> 00:11:52.010
You're going through
steam tunnels.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.380
You're going along ledges.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.340
You're climbing up
elevator shafts.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:00.830
You're finding hidden or unused
spaces inside of the buildings

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.750
that everyone else
takes for granted--

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.930
and sort of goes through
as a normal civilian.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.950
And that's exciting,
it's perilous.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.880
And it has this direct
analog to computer hacking

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.220
where you're also getting
into forbidden spaces.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.960
You're also working
off label with what

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.500
somebody else has created.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.140
If an inventor
creates something new

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.300
and an engineer builds
to spec, a hacker

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.800
creates something
new with something

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.600
someone else has built to spec.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.110
So you're often knowing spaces
in a way that the creator

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.610
themself didn't.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.840
And that's a direct analog to
computer hacking we know today.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.690
She goes from that world
into computer security

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.880
as it's becoming a new field.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.570
And I thought I'd read a
short passage from a section

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.200
where she is working in
information security.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.720
This is about 2005 in a hospital
system-- one of the largest

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.270
hospitals in the country.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.870
We're aware, especially
now, that everything

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.650
that is a computer can be
hacked and that everything

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.130
is a computer.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.320
But it still is
different to know that

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.060
and to experience it firsthand.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.720
So, for example, in
a hospital, you're

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.090
connected-- on average when
you're in a hospital bed--

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.670
to about 11 different
medical devices.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.590
Those have a network
card usually.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.250
Those have an operating system.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.450
It's usually built on Windows,
maybe a little more Unix

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:28.950
in the past.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.420
Hey, maybe Chrome
or stuff right now.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.510
And that means it's going to
have the same vulnerabilities

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.910
that those systems have.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.360
Hospital equipment is
also often bought on a 15

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.730
to 20-year time cycle, because
it's millions of dollars.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.800
And so that means when you
go to the hospital in 2019,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.370
you may be experiencing
systems that

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:58.050
are serving you that have
the vulnerabilities of 2004

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.030
or 1999.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.250
But don't worry, we
will have the security

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.580
we have today in
just 15 to 20 years.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.080
So your grandchildren will
have the secure systems.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.019
So looking at trying to protect
that and what that looks like

00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:18.060
was really interesting in
trying to recreate that

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.770
through her experiences--
going on-site,

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.820
talking to her old
bosses and colleagues.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.220
And I thought I'd
share a bit from that.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:30.270
So what happens is she gets
a call from the network

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.639
team at the hospital.

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:33.180
And they're having
a bandwidth issue.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.150
Something is
clogging the network.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.210
And so devices aren't able to
communicate and some of them

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.080
are shutting off.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.540
And that's a crisis
in a situation where

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.049
the flow of data is literally
a matter of life and death,

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:46.590
and people need to
be able to contact

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.540
each other across
wards, transfer

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.190
information, and the devices
themselves are lifesaving.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.700
She goes to the office
of her colleague, Amy,

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.640
on the network team.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.530
Amy was a lanky brunette--

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:06.210
27 or 28-- dressed in
jeans and a teal pullover.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.460
Alien knelt beside
her in her cubicle

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.800
as they studied network
traffic information

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.900
from internet addresses
across the hospital.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.780
"We started getting calls
two or three hours ago saying

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.270
the internet was
slow," Amy told her.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.250
"I checked it out,
and they're right.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.800
Some internal address is
just spewing traffic."

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.930
"It's got to be a
worm," Alien said.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.390
Can you shut off the port?"

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.670
"I could, but I don't know
what's plugged into it,"

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.750
Amy said.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.790
"What if it's an
important machine?

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.270
I don't want to
just cut it off."

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.370
"Let me see," Alien said.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.380
She stepped up to the
keyboard and scrolled back

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.870
through Amy's command
history, double-checking

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.670
her investigation.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.080
Amy was a pro, though.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.210
On the basis of the
internet address alone,

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.750
the closest they could do was
trace the worm's origin point

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:59.210
to a third floor hallway in the
same building that held the ER.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.070
Alien's eyes narrowed.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.270
"Stay here.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.820
I'll find it," she said.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.250
Alien ran to the
elevator, popped outside,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.950
and cut diagonally
across the campus.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.340
Seven minutes later, wide
sliding doors separated for her

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.050
at the entrance to the ER.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.720
Amy had called ahead for backup.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.880
An IT staffer assigned
to this building

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.010
met Alien at the
third floor hallway

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.500
and showed her to the
right network switch.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.440
It serviced a long,
quiet hallway.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.680
By now, Alien had burned
almost half an hour,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.870
but she was getting closer.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.480
Back out on the hallway,
Alien stopped in front

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.760
of the only door in sight.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.590
Doctors and nurses swished past.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.800
Alien stepped back,
feeling out of place

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.320
without a white coat or scrubs.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.750
When a nurse slowed
before the door, however,

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.210
Alien flagged her down.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.900
"Hi, I'm from IT security,"
she said, and showed her badge.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.850
"I need to get in here."

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.690
"Oh."

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.960
the nurse swiped her own badge
and the door clicked open.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.210
"I'll have to
accompany," she warned.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.030
"This is a restricted area."

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.640
The room was warm and dark.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.380
Alien could make out
a few rows of what

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.040
appeared to be high,
narrow carts on wheels,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.440
each with a monitor nearby.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.530
It was vaguely reminiscent
of a server room,

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.920
but her entire concern was
with the network ports located

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.130
close to the floor.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.030
Alien dropped to a crawl.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.400
Using the same mag light
she'd had since her freshman

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:36.070
year at MIT, she swept the walls
looking for the guilty port.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.990
20 seconds passed--

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.450
40, 60.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:40.960
Finally.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.410
Alien's beam illuminated a
yellow plastic port cover,

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.060
to which someone
with a label maker

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.660
had attached the alphanumeric
name of the infected machine.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.890
Alien smiled in
triumph and relief.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.440
She used the Meg light to
trace the black ethernet

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.960
cord coming out of the port.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.780
It led to a profusion of
other plugs and cables

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.050
entering the back of the
machine closest to her.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.230
She'd page Amy and Amy
would alert their bosses.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.150
They'd get the problem
diagnosed as soon

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.920
as possible before the machine
infected anything further.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.570
Alien stood up.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.820
She felt the nurse
touching her back gently

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.790
to get her attention
without speaking.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.130
"Turn that flashlight
off, please,"

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.040
she asked in a low,
but firm, whisper.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.340
It was more a command
than a request.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.870
Alien obeyed.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.960
She felt a sense of
alarm, even dread.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.820
Had she done something wrong?

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.260
Where were they?

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
There weren't any patients in
this room, she had thought.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.010
It had no beds, only more
machines like this one.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.320
Her senses suddenly
heightened, however.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.520
She now heard the sound of
slow breathing all around her.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.440
For the first time
since her eyes

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.810
became accustomed
to the dark, Alien

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.270
took a look around the room.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.180
On each of the wheeled
stands was a teeny pallet

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.986
enclosed by clear plastic.

00:19:03.986 --> 00:19:08.030
The pallets, she saw
now, held teeny blankets.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.730
And under each
blanket was a baby--

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.180
a teeny one-- sprawled out on
its back and head turned to one

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:14.780
side--

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.610
all wired up.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.070
These newborns were
essentially on life support

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.150
and fast asleep.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.930
The room might resemble a
server room, Alien realized,

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.530
but it wasn't.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.980
It was the NICU--

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.040
the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.380
"Babies," she said to herself.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.710
So experiences like
that are eye-opening,

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.100
because you realize
the virus, the worm,

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.040
the other vulnerability
can be a life support

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.990
system for a cluster of kids.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.010
It's not a port you
want to pull right away.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.969
From her work in security,
she moves to kind

00:19:56.969 --> 00:19:58.260
of the other side of the fence.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.380
And this was fun for me
because it was the intersection

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.340
of these two worlds--

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.050
this physical breaking
and entering she

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.310
had done as an undergraduate
and the computer security work.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.630
She gets hired as a
penetration tester--

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:18.390
or pen tester-- testing
security at Fortune 500

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.210
companies, government
agencies around the country

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.110
and around the world.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.340
And I thought I'd
share a short passage

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.830
from her first day at work.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.080
We can all just think about
what our first day of work

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.980
was or our first day of work
at this campus and the kind

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.480
of onboarding process--

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.690
what was the first task you had
to do, the kind of nervousness

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.680
there.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.010
And then think about this
as your first day of work

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.654
in a sort of new opportunity.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.800
Ted Roberts-- Castle
Bank's head of security--

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.370
requested a private booth
at the hotel restaurant.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.340
A friendly blond 40-year-old
man in a business suit,

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.620
he leaned across the
table after dinner

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.290
and passed both Richard and
Alien and his business card

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.960
and a signed, one-page note.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.570
Alien skimmed the document
which she had written and sent

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.670
to Ted, asking him
to fill in the blanks

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.980
and bring it to their
meeting tonight.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.380
"Castle Bank has
hired a lead defense

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.200
to perform physical
security penetration tests

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.710
and assessments of nine sites
in three states," it said.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.020
Specific addresses
followed, starting here

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.000
with the bank's
regional headquarters,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.880
and four branches she and
Richard had driven by today

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.250
doing local reconnaissance.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.870
For the rest of the
week, Ted's note

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.920
authorized they were to probe
the facilities one by one

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.300
to determine if an uninvited
visitor could enter, explore,

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.140
remove equipment or
data, or rob the banks.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.850
The letter closed
with instructions

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.690
on how to contact Ted
if they got caught.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.370
"Your get out of jail
free letter," he said.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.400
Richard harrumphed, but
Alien gave her best smile,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.490
folding the letter and
placing it in her coat pocket.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.640
"Thanks," she said, patting
the pocket afterward.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.620
"I hope that we won't need it."

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.520
Ted signaled to a
waiter for the check.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.290
"Good luck, but not too
much luck," he said.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.560
Tuesday noon, the clock
tolled and office workers

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.500
exited the 20-story
headquarters.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.240
Everyone was bundled
up and breathing out

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.310
steam on their way to lunch.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.900
Moving in the
opposite direction,

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.050
Richard entered the
lobby to check it out.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.990
Alien watched from the front
passenger seat of the car

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.150
clutching an empty
black laptop case.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.480
No, not completely empty--

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.610
while she waited, Alien
reached her fingers

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.460
into the zippered
pocket and checked.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.940
There they were beside her
get out of jail free letter--

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.880
fake business cards she'd
printed after dinner with Ted

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.550
last night.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.120
Elizabeth Tessman-- Enterprise
Technology Specialist,

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.110
they said.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.300
Right of the red,
Castle Bank logo,

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.970
above her real cell phone
number, a fake Castle

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.660
corporate email address, and
the address of this building--

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.600
each element copied from
Ted's business card.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.200
Alien sighed,
shifting impatiently.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.602
Then she sat up, quickly seeing
Richard approach the car.

00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:16.310
"Did you get in?"

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:20.090
Alien asked after he had taken
his seat and shut the door.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.410
Richard responded scornfully,
"there is no way," he reported.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.160
"What do you " She said.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.980
"All you've done
was try the lobby."

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.200
What about the freight
elevator or the storage room

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.610
with the open window?

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.110
What happened?"

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.999
"Forget it."

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:36.290
Richard turned up the heater
and made the shift the car

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.730
into drive.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.650
"It's freezing," he
said, "let's move."

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.270
"We can totally do this."

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.770
Alien unbuckled her seat
belt. "Let me try," she said.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.350
Richard shook his head.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.760
"You won't get in," he insisted.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.290
"There are turnstiles
and a security

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.820
guard watching everything."

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.650
You'll just blow our cover.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:57.100
He continued gruffly, "let's
try the bank branches first.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.470
If there's time,
we'll come back here.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.750
We found plenty already."

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.800
"We're here now," said Alien,
"and I won't blow our cover."

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.580
Richard could spot a narrow
opening in a fence at 50 yards

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.790
and recite security
camera specs from memory.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.460
Forthright, credible,
and confident he

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.510
was, like all of her bosses,
terrific at presentations.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.330
It was clear, however, that
he had neither the patience

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.750
nor the aptitude for what
those in the infosec community

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.470
called social engineering.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.890
Bluntly put, the term
meant manipulating people.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.200
You might call it charming
them or, in some cases,

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.510
scaring them, but it
is always about getting

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.940
them to do what you wanted.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.150
Whoever you were, the trick
was to assess the other person

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.260
and figure out how you might
talk him or her into something.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.340
Perhaps the best name for
it might be human hacking.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.100
Freshman year, for example,
getting Alex and Vlad

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.680
to "help" Alien with
her calculus homework

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.237
had been social engineering.

00:24:57.237 --> 00:24:59.070
More recently, she had
turned her dinner out

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:02.580
with the bosses into a
kind of job interview.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.940
Consciously or not, every
child or parent, teacher

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.960
or military leader, politician
or player on the dating scene

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.970
use social engineering.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.610
For pen testers or their
criminal counterparts--

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.620
like those who sent
phishing emails

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.140
or persuaded victims to
empty their bank accounts--

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.510
the appeal was obvious.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.580
Why bother breaking
into anything

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.820
when you can get individuals
to open their doors for you?

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.930
And because people, especially
men, were generally less

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.560
suspicious of women in this
kind of situation, being female

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.020
could be an advantage.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.170
"It'll be fine,"
Alien smiled sweetly.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:44.040
"I'll be quick and come right
back if there's any problem."

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.980
Before Richard could say another
word, she was out the door

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.210
with her laptop case.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.840
Alien crossed the gray slate
floor of the spacious lobby.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.170
Four hip-high stainless
steel gateways

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.490
stood between her
and the elevators.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.220
Each was equipped with a
wedge-shaped black barrier

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.400
that receded when you placed
your badge on a scanner.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.160
Then, as soon as anyone
passed the gateway,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.530
the barrier closed immediately
preventing tailgating.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.100
Next to the gates was a wide
marble counter, also gray,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.170
behind which stood
a white-haired guard

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:20.310
in a crisp black uniform,
including a matching tie.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.170
She walked toward the
badge reader system

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.300
as though expecting
to go through.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.920
When the barrier
stopped her, Alien

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.310
acted startled, purposely
trying to catch the guard's eye.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.020
Then she approached him.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:31.980
"Hi," she said.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.060
"I'm with IT."

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.400
We have a computer emergency
on the seventh floor.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.350
I need to get up there."

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.060
She would be happy
to get in anywhere,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.830
but knew from remote
reconnaissance

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.580
that this was the floor with the
most day to day office workers.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.230
Up close, the man
looked even older

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.250
than she had originally
estimated-- at least 65

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.330
Alien guessed with
thin, gold frame

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.340
bifocals and permanent
creases in his forehead.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.036
Still, he looked in excellent
shape-- erect and alert.

00:26:58.036 --> 00:26:59.910
"You have to use your
badge," the guard said.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.270
"Or are you on the list?"

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:05.350
He asked, pointing to a black
hardcover binder on the table.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:09.460
"No, I'm in IT," alien told
him, re-assuming an old role.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.270
"I'm new.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.460
I just started yesterday."

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.770
The guard frowned--
"where's your badge?"

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.090
He asked.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.490
"I don't have a badge
yet," said Alien smoothly,

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.530
"but my name is
Elizabeth Tessman

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.600
and my boss is Ted Roberts.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:29.990
T-E-D-R-O-B-E-R-T-S.
Here's his card."

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.150
She lifted her laptop case
and placed it squarely

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.767
on the counter between them.

00:27:33.767 --> 00:27:36.350
She tugged the zipper and took
out and slid him one of her new

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.480
cards as well as Ted's.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.300
The guard entered both names
in his computer system.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.920
"He's in here," he acknowledged.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.461
"You'll need to call him
to get added to the list."

00:27:45.461 --> 00:27:46.960
Alien opened her
phone and pretended

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.030
to call Ted and leave a message.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:51.160
As she did so, holding
the phone against her ear

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.730
with her shoulder, she undid
the buttons of her trenchcoat.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.620
"Hi, Mr. Roberts," she said.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.910
"This is Elizabeth.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.620
I'm leaving you a voicemail.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.150
I'm really sorry to bother you.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.170
They won't let me up
to the seventh floor.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.580
I know it's an emergency.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.040
Can you call me back please?

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.030
I'm really sorry, thanks."

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.060
She stood awkwardly in front
of the desk, checking her phone

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.340
and looking fleetingly
at the elevators.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.410
The guard cringed.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:18.090
"I can try him again,"
she said to him.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.860
"I'm really sorry
to keep you waiting.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.500
I know there was a big server
crash right before I left.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.235
He might be in the data center.

00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:25.860
I just can't leave
without fixing this.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.630
I promised."

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.000
The guard was
clearly conflicted.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.700
He looked down, giving her
card only a second's glance.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.360
Then, though, he
waved her forward.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.160
"Look, I know it's
important," he said.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.590
"I'll make an exception,
just be quick."

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:44.700
"Thanks, I will," she told
him, "just as she had Richard."

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.250
Alien grabbed her laptop
bag and stepped forward

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.230
to the closest gateway.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.840
The guard pushed a
button under the counter.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.760
The barriers parted
with a whoosh.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.150
Alien was surprised to feel
her heart pounding as she

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.070
stepped out of the elevator.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.190
She'd taken much greater
physical risks in college,

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.960
but she'd never tried
to steal something.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.440
For now, at least, there was
nobody else on this floor.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.920
Alien moved quickly.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.250
Most workspaces she
saw were cubicles

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.980
containing white desks
separated by six-foot

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.230
freestanding gray walls.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.760
At the perimeter
of the floor were

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.980
the larger individual
offices of middle level

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.220
managers with glass
walls and doors.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.220
Occupants of the cubicles
personalized their space

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.170
with photos and trinkets.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.200
On every desk was a black
phone and a Dell laptop

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.330
connected to an external
keyboard and monitor.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.490
Alien hefted a few laptops.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.860
All were secured with cables.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.140
She decided to try
the managers' spaces,

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.360
starting with a corner
office with an unimpeded view

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.130
of the downtown.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:51.000
It had the same computer setup
though on a larger grade desk.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.530
She lifted the laptop--

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.700
no cable.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.540
Alien heard the elevator
ding, announcing

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.270
the return of the first of
the employees from lunch.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.960
Two men chatted as they went to
their desks not noticing her.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.420
She slipped out of the
corner office with a laptop

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.624
and walked past
two more employees.

00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:11.790
Alien was positive she
looked as guilty as she felt,

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.310
but these employees
ignored her too.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.350
Her heart was beating
harder than ever.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.900
To a bank, nothing meant
more than its reputation

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.140
for trustworthiness.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.300
The machine might have
confidential customer files

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.720
on it, Castle business plans,
corporate personnel records,

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.360
or all of the above.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.860
An identity theft ring
exploiting that information

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.210
could make millions--

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.860
so could shady
stock market traders

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.310
or any of Castle's national
and international competitors.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.140
And the fines and
settlement fees

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.950
once a big breach was disclosed
could run to eight figures.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.990
Choice Point, the
commercial data broker,

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.810
had paid $15 million
the previous year

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:53.460
for giving up information
on 163,000 people.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.260
Alien walked to the elevator
as confidently as she could,

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.590
smiling professionally at
others as their paths crossed.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.580
Everyone else wore a rigid
badge with their name, headshot,

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.540
and the Castle logo clipped
to their shirt or waistband.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.010
So she shielded those
areas with the laptop case.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.739
The elevator opened
back in the lobby.

00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:13.030
"Did you get it taken care of?"

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.950
The security guard asked.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:15.730
"Yes.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.360
Thanks so much," said Alien,
giving him a thumbs up.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.330
She crossed the street,
opened the car door,

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.620
and slipped back
inside the Taurus.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.240
"Nada."

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.150
Richard said, in a
told you so tone.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.390
"I did it," Alien said.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.290
She zipped open the case.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.630
"I got a laptop."

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.850
"What?"

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.970
Richard's eyebrows rose
as he beheld her prize.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.830
"Holy shit," he said.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:51.020
So they call that M&amp;M security--

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.520
it's hard on the outside,
soft in the middle

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.310
once you get past
the outer defenses.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.890
There's a lot of
good stuff to take.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.190
I talked to a
penetration tester who

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.572
was one of her
colleagues for a while.

00:32:02.572 --> 00:32:04.280
You want to guess what
his specialty was?

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.200
Social engineering is
the way in, but then

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.630
what does he specialize in?

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.580
Shred bins.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.800
He's like shred bins
are the greatest.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.460
They take all of their most
confidential information,

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:23.990
they put it in one place, and
then they put it on wheels.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.620
I was like, nobody
ever caught you?

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.671
He said, well, once.

00:32:26.671 --> 00:32:28.670
I was wheeling one out
and the guard stopped me.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.426
And I froze, they said,
hey, what are you doing?

00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:32.550
And I just raised my hands.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.960
And he said, that goes down
in the freight elevator.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.950
So definitely made me
look a little differently

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.460
at shred days at my
bank, things like that.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.210
So you start looking
at things differently

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.150
hanging out with these hackers.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.740
Anyway, you rob a laptop
from corporate headquarters

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.900
on day one, you get
promoted pretty quickly

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.220
if that's your new job.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.460
She's soon talking her way
into bank vaults themselves

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.220
and doing computer stuff
from internet cafes,

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.580
getting into an airline
reservation system,

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.010
doing recovery for
breached government,

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.860
taking a sort of
antennae on the highway

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.740
outside of a major
defense manufacturer

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.940
and sucking their data
under her computer,

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.710
and so on and so forth.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.130
Eventually, she starts
her own company.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.989
And sort of not on
purpose so much,

00:33:21.989 --> 00:33:24.530
but as this industry grows up
and becomes a bigger and bigger

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:28.190
field, it takes on new employees
and becomes a manager and then

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.060
a CEO.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.080
And she has this sort of
new generation of hackers

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.830
that she's sort of trained
and brought up under her wing.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.410
And that leads to different
pressures and different sort

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.900
of perspective-- like
when you give birth

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.420
and you have to debug a
fishing site the same day

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.460
from the hospital.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.790
So that was, again, sort of
parts of hacker storytelling

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.890
I hadn't seen before.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.840
I thought I'd just
and the reading part

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.960
with a couple real short
passages from closer

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.840
to the end from her
kind of CEO days.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:12.010
Luke, Gus, Sheryl, and two new
pen testers gathered around

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:17.770
the break table discussing their
latest work with client 0666--

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.730
a vast retail chain that needed
remote and on-site penetration

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.360
tests, mobile and web app
assessments, and a security

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.510
review of its credit
card processing systems.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:30.850
"Who's on site now?

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.340
Asked Alien.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.104
"Milo," Gus answered.

00:34:34.104 --> 00:34:35.520
"He cracked their
wireless network

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.770
from a cafe inside
one of their stores

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:41.219
and then wormed his way into
the company's central systems."

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:44.400
"He got root on the badge
printing system," said Sheryl.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.159
"He could add his name and
photograph to the badge system

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:50.100
and give himself access to
any building, any room--

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.810
you name it."

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.449
One of the new pen
testers piped up--

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:56.310
"we found this
internal database that

00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:01.140
had the entire shopping history
of every single customer."

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.690
"Every customer?"

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.310
asked Alien.

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.860
She shopped at 666--

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.860
everybody did.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.920
Gus hemmed, Sheryl tittered.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.520
"What?"

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.140
said Alien.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.620
"We found you," Sheryl said.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.670
"The earliest entry
was from 1993,"

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:24.780
ancient history to
the 24-year-old.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.440
"Congratulations."

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.680
Alien opened the fridge
and grabbed a water bottle.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.630
She pictured the
entire break room

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.710
papered with her life story
as told through 666 receipts--

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:40.880
from her first bra to
her daughter's crib.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.960
Last one.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.860
In mid-September, Tree
Line Bank-- called TSC--

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.290
It's the pseudonym I use
for her hacking company.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:51.480
On behalf of one
of its customers--

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.720
a construction company
based in Salt Lake City.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.630
A day earlier, the
company's payroll manager

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.700
had clicked on a
phishing email link

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.590
that infected his web
browser with a man

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.880
in the middle attack--

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.100
allowing hackers to
see everything he typed

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.100
and even replace his familiar
Tree Line online banking

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.560
page with an exact
replica, asking

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.720
for additional credentials.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.120
Only a second layer
of security requiring

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.420
special executive approval
for large wire transfers

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.360
had stopped the firm from
losing almost $60,000

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.520
to an offshore account.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.310
Could TSC investigate and
find out what had happened

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.430
and how to fix it?

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.600
Susanna-- that's her COO--

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.690
sent Luke on site to image
any affected computers

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.550
and interview staff.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.740
When he returned,
Milo took over,

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.480
using the equipment
in the forensics lab

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.940
to inspect everything carefully.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.750
The payroll manager
had clicked on 19 links

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.880
in his many different phishing
emails, he discovered.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.760
Alien volunteered to
help finish the job.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.340
"I'll do the malware
analysis," she said.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.170
To understand how
the malware worked,

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.870
Alien set it up in a
sandbox, or cordoned off

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.250
virtual machine environment.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.830
This gave her the
digital equivalent

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.020
of a high-level
biosafety lab where

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.360
the software could be
safely stored, inspected,

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.920
and dissected.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.630
Alien started by
viewing the page source

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.320
for the emailed link that led
to the man in the middle attack.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.130
It was neatly written by
sophisticated programmers.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.680
These bad guys are good.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.390
Of late, the best black hats
had emulated successful Silicon

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.290
Valley entrepreneurs--

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.620
licensing the use of
their work through

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:36.510
cloud-based commercial software
suites called exploit kits.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.310
To begin a mass
attack, you didn't

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.680
have to know how to
write a computer program

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.140
or even have your own computer.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.000
You just logged
in from anywhere,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.980
chose the kind of
hacks you wanted,

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.010
and paid by the
day, month, or year.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.500
Some black hat services
accepted payment

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.580
by deducting a
percentage of the take.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.810
Alien infected the
virtual machine

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.510
and then came back
48 hours later

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.750
to check what the digital
thieves had been doing.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.000
The software began
by configuring itself

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.780
to run at startup, then it
phoned home once every 20

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.720
minutes seeking updates
or further instructions

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.600
from one of a series of modern
command and control servers

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.540
around the world.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.830
"What do you want me to do,"
the program asked, in essence.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.350
And the criminals at the
other end of the connection

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.180
could order whatever
they wanted.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.850
"It's impressive," she
told Susanna afterward,

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:30.860
"and more than a
little frightening.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.650
Not just in itself, but
for what it portended.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.740
This wasn't solo,
hit and run operator,

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.770
it was the work of a group
of professional hackers--

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:42.140
just like TSC."

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.790
As she had gone from
novice to student,

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.750
student to practitioner,
practitioner to teacher,

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:49.610
and managed to manager--

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.650
all as a white hat hacker--

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.510
black hat hackers
across the globe

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:57.320
had followed a parallel path,
organizing their operations,

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.430
establishing reputations,
and finding clients--

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.190
and bringing in money
to their communities.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:07.640
Alien had never realized it,
and she had never wished for it,

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.830
but one could even say she
had needed the black hats

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.910
to keep growing and getting
new opportunities herself.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.430
"How many employees do
you think they have?"

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.480
Alien asked.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.720
"I don't know," Susanna
said, "but their sales team

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.230
is definitely bigger than ours."

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.430
Alien laughed.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.160
From Susanna's desk, she
picked up a little statue

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.400
she had given her.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.620
"I wonder-- maybe on the
other side of the world

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.410
if there's an evil Susanna."

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.020
Susanna raised an
eyebrow wryly--

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:45.890
"well, then there would have
to be an evil Alien too."

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:46.520
Thank you guys.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.660
So that's kind of
a taste of some

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.660
of the scope and the stories
and the kind of evolution

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:03.190
in the field and in her life
trying to use the storytelling

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.010
style to kind of express that.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:09.310
I'd love to answer
any questions you

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.070
have about either the writing
process or other stories

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.190
from the book or other topics
that are of interest to you--

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.520
or teach me something
that's keeping you

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:23.020
up at night today, security
folks, or any other folks.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.570
And I'll pass it on
to the next talk.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:33.230
Comment on what's unique
or different or interesting

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:38.940
in particular about
her experiences

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.740
as a woman in this field.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:46.220
So, yeah, I mean, she gets
that job breaking into banks

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.950
by taking a security class.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:54.830
And the instructor there is one
of the leaders of a major pen

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.690
testing operation.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.750
And when she goes into
that class, it is herself

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.240
and there are 19 guys.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.960
And so that's a very
different experience.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.380
And people-- when
they start the contest

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.690
at the end of that class,
which is sort of a hacking

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:16.940
contest, the guys kind
of shove her aside

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:21.590
and she, in that situation
at the beginning,

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.570
shoves herself aside-- or at
least lets them take the lead.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:26.450
She's used to being
outnumbered and she's

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.450
used to being at MIT
where, as she put it,

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.837
guys were taking apart--

00:41:30.837 --> 00:41:33.170
building helicopters with
their dad when they were four.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.260
Everyone's like 15 years ahead
of me when I was a freshman.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:40.160
So she doesn't think of herself
as more technically adept.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.170
But what she finds
is her chops have

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.640
been built up over the time.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.550
She had a boss between
those two things

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.600
at Los Alamos
National Laboratory

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.920
who would not let her work
start working for him until she

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.670
could do everything
without her hands ever

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.510
leaving the keyboard.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.980
And so knew how to code.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.460
She knew command
line, but she didn't

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.320
know how to play a
keyboard like a guitar--

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.200
and that level of extension
where the computer is basically

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.250
an extension of your body.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:11.180
She was watching her classmates
who kind of nudged her aside

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.550
at that contest sort of stumble.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:15.690
They kind of wanted a
graphical user interface.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:17.240
They just weren't
quite as adept.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.070
They didn't have the experience
she had had at the hospital.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.630
And so eventually she sort of
starts doing it on her own.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:27.350
And little by little, the guys
start lining up behind her.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.360
And her fingers are flying.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.130
And she's owning
system after system.

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.530
And for her, that was a
transformational moment

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.480
not because that was
when she got the skills,

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.230
but that's when she realized
that she had had the skills.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.140
Because you have that
sort of image of yourself

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.810
as a freshman or
a kid often that's

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.377
based on an insecure moment.

00:42:46.377 --> 00:42:47.960
And then here's a
moment of realizing.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.070
I can do this.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:53.730
And that sort of
sexism or exclusion--

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.710
or at least being a minority--

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:00.540
continues in a lot of
different parts of her career.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.240
But she has to--

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.232
in conversations,
she says the default

00:43:05.232 --> 00:43:07.440
when she finally does get
a job interview after that.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.344
The default is if
a guy's talking,

00:43:09.344 --> 00:43:11.760
the other guys assume that he
does what he's talking about

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.470
until he proves otherwise.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.810
They assume the opposite
in her situation.

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:18.690
So she's like, I have to sort of
drop more technical references

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:22.060
early on to sort of
establish my chops.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.680
At least for a time, she had a--

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.960
well, anyway-- it's
important to talk

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.470
about emacs earlier
in the conversation

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.450
when you're a female
hacker, I'm told.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:37.620
So at the same time,
as I said, there

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.560
are fields even within
hacking particularly

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.659
where you're playing with
people's expectations

00:43:43.659 --> 00:43:44.950
where that can be an advantage.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.430
Sometimes you want to
be the innocent figure

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:51.240
that they don't suspect is
going to be an adversary.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.456
Other times, she got
like a $2 clipboard

00:43:54.456 --> 00:43:55.830
and she was the
authority figure.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.955
You put on a suit and a $2
a clipboard and suddenly

00:43:57.955 --> 00:44:00.630
you start questioning people
and they kind of like--

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:01.360
let me see your--

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.450
you go to the guard, you're
like, I'm doing a spot check.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:04.470
Can I see your badge?

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:05.220
Can you show me--

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.910
I want to check the locks
on this whole building.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:09.390
And soon you're
in the bank vault.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:13.590
So you can flip roles too.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:16.800
And then there's experiences
that, obviously, there's

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.930
no escaping their gendered--
like giving birth,

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:20.680
being pregnant.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.500
These are experiences
only a woman

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.310
can have at this point in our
technological life at least.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:31.500
And doing that while being
a CEO, while being a hacker

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:36.270
is, to me, another
extension of her badassery--

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.430
and women's badassery,
if you will.

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:43.620
So it was cool to
see that evolution

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:48.240
and also sort of
mentoring women and men--

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.392
there are some differences,
but that's in the book too.

00:44:51.392 --> 00:44:52.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:56.040
Are you able to say what
years she was at MIT?

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.360
JEREMY N. SMITH: Yeah.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.520
1998 to 2003.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.640
Yeah.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.130
Did I assume any
personal habits that I

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:06.710
changed in the course
of writing this book?

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:08.637
So two categories--
one, I started

00:45:08.637 --> 00:45:10.970
doing crazy stuff because I
was hanging out with hackers

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.380
and trying to report and
understand their experience.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.140
So I don't know--
how many of you

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.170
kind of like Def CON or Black
Hat, those kind of conventions?

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.860
Yeah.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.500
So, as you know, there's
like 25,000 hackers

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.090
in Vegas for the weekend.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:27.524
And you just kind of see
where the spirit takes you

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:28.190
in those things.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.830
I ended up in a
shooting range that they

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:34.790
had set up like 30 minutes
out in the unincorporated land

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:35.720
in the Vegas desert.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.910
And there's like
drone-driven skeet,

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.370
people are firing cannons
they made themself.

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.450
I was like-- where--

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:44.870
I've come a long way from home.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.690
I also climbed up on the
domes at MIT and the ledges

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.170
and did that kind of stuff.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.040
And I got a tour through Los
Alamos National Laboratory,

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.717
which is crazy.

00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:54.800
It's like you're walking
through the Grand Canyon,

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.280
you take a right, and
there's MIT guarded

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.130
by people with machine guns.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:02.690
Those were exciting.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.550
And as for my own
personal habits, sure.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:06.470
I started using
email encryption.

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:09.470
I started using full
disk encryption.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.190
I was honestly more careful when
I Googled because I was like,

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:16.980
somebody is knowing what I'm
typing in one way or another.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.270
And I have certain
agreements of confidentiality

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:23.750
to change identifying
details, but you guys

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.250
are going to know--
or your machines

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.980
are going to know
whatever I type in.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:32.720
And I left my phone
when I took walks.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.290
If I didn't need
it, why be tracked?

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:39.320
You have a story like that where
the retailer has the shopping

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.450
history.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.930
We've all-- I'm just
going to make a guess--

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:47.180
90% of us have
shopped at shop 666.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.480
And you realize that's
not an isolated thing.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.400
We all shop, period.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.870
And everywhere we go, that stuff
is stored, and data is forever.

00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:00.470
So that kind of made me
think about situations where

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:03.710
I wanted to pay cash not
necessarily out of paranoia,

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:07.640
but just out of
intentionality if you will

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.070
and sort of thinking about
the price of convenience

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.140
and certain obliviousness.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.230
And certainly things like
smart fridges and doorbells

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:18.200
are pretty terrifying
to me after hanging out

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.895
in internet of things village
at Def CON for a while.

00:47:21.895 --> 00:47:25.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:26.680
JEREMY N. SMITH:
You are welcome.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.936
So that's our time.

00:47:27.936 --> 00:47:29.060
Is that what you're saying?

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.170
So I wanted to say--

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.390
I don't know if
I've lost my slides.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.950
I may have gone
without them too long.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.370
Say that again.

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:39.950
There we go.

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:43.865
I think-- I wanted to show
you guys one more thing.

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:49.310
Just as a sort of
example of the form,

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:53.390
I don't know if any of you guys
know a hacker named Deviant

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.010
in the Seattle Community.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:58.070
He's a great
organizer with Tool--

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.920
the open organization
of lock-pickers.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:05.300
And he was a source and a guide
for some of this material.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.420
And he designed
a hacker bookmark

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.490
for me and for the book.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.192
So it's a little bit
different material

00:48:12.192 --> 00:48:13.150
than a normal bookmark.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.590
It's a kind of flexible plastic.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.110
On the back, you can see
this bookmark opens doors

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:21.650
and it's got instructions on
how to use it for certain kinds

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:23.570
of lock-picking or
physical entry--

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.780
a lot like Alien and her
classmates did at MIT.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.260
We've got a few of these signed
by me and by Alien for those--

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.630
if anyone's
interested if you get

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.870
more than one copy
of the book then

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.220
that's a kind of bonus item.

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:41.190
So think about that
while supplies last.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:44.150
And even if they go,
play with one too just

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.340
to kind of get a sense of it.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.870
There's YouTube
videos of him using

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:50.764
it to get all sorts of places.

00:48:50.764 --> 00:48:52.430
So, yeah, happy to
talk more one on one.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.810
Thank you so much for your time.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:57.960
And keep us safe and safer.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.510
Thanks.
