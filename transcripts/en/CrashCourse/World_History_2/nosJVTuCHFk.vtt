00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.889
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.480
how history gets written.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.220
"Mr. Green! Mr. Green! I want to write books
about history when I grow up."

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.220
Well, we're not about the process of writing
history today, Me From the Past. Also, you

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.250
are a liar. So you're never going to be a
history writer because, try as you might,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.520
you can't stop making things up. Maybe someday,
if you're lucky, you'll write a historical

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.920
novel. Although, probably not because, you know,
it involves research, which you also suck at.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.030
So today we're going to talk about how historians
answer questions and the choices they make

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.909
in turning their ideas into books. We like
to think of history as being the story of

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.989
what happens, so there's no ambiguity or whatever.
It's just, you know, 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.620
in 1776, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.749
This is part of our thinking that, like, math
is fact-based and literature is opinion. So

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.019
we imagine history as being, like, over toward
the fact-y stuff. But in truth, literature

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.389
has a lot of facts in it. There are poems
that are objectively good and others that

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:02.489
are objectively bad. And if you've ever been
to a mathematician party and heard mathematician

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759
arguments, you'll know that math has a lot
of opinions in it.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.530
What? I go to a lot of math parties. That's
cool.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.890
My point is, that that whole fact to opinion
continuum we imagine in academics doesn't

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.659
really make sense. We just need to learn to
ignore that and think instead about how to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.509
examine the world critically.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.369
So today we're going to examine the ways that
different historians have tackled a really

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.409
problematic issue: The Rise of the West. So
what do "rise" and "west" even mean in that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.829
phrase? Well, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.869
So "The West" is a geographical designation,
kind of. It means, like, Western Europe, North

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.900
America, and Australia, which as you can see
here are west of Asia? And also east of Asia.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.670
In fact, everything is both east and west
of everything else because it's a globe.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.270
But the West is also kind of a culture. It's
a set of ideas influenced by Judeo-Christian

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.679
thought and Greek philosophy, with a little
Enlightenment rationalism and Adam Smith's

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.869
economics thrown in. Anyway, it's complicated,
like all civilizations that span multiple

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.259
continents, but most of you at least have an idea
in your head when I talk about "The West."

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.670
And then there's the question of what we mean
by "rise" when we talk about the Rise of the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.460
West, which leads us back to the philosophical
question of the nature of history itself.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.890
I mean, is history a series of rises and falls,
like the story of the Roman Empire, or is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.190
it cyclical, like the Mandate of Heaven narrative
that we saw when we looked at early Chinese

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.530
history? So you could say, in fact, that the
phrase itself "The Rise of the West" is a

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.860
little bit Western. The whole thing's a bit
nebulous.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.190
And that makes it a popular subject for historians
to tackle because you can hang a lot of ideas

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.130
on it. Like, Ian Morris, who teaches at Stanford,
wrote a book called, "Why the West Rules -- For

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.520
Now," which casts the question in terms of
political, military, and economic dominance.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.300
And Victor Davis Hanson made this idea of
dominance more explicit in his book on military

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.080
history, Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles
in the Rise to Western Power, which also offers

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.000
a pretty straightforward reason why the West
became so powerful: It won a lot of wars.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.260
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.580
Another way to think about this question is
in terms of, like, success and failure. That's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.340
how Daron Acemoğlu and James Robinson approached
it in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail: The

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.370
Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty.
These guys had two big ideas. First, that

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.490
success can be defined by wealth, as well
as political power. And secondly, that when

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.580
we look at successes, we shouldn't look at
individuals, or communities, or continents,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.910
we should look at nation-states.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.590
Now, this book isn't explicitly about the
West, but if you look at the countries that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.970
they're talking about as successes and failures,
it seems like they're talking about kind of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.160
the same thing we are. Their successful nations
are all in what we think of as "The West,"

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.250
with a couple of important exceptions in Japan
and Southern Africa.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.770
So Acemoğlu teaches economics at MIT and
Robinson teaches government at Harvard, which

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.930
is important because they're not, like, academically
trained historians. Some would say that's

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.480
an advantage, but you know who wouldn't say
that? Historians. But anyway, if you're training

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.330
is in economics and government, then you're
going to see history through the lens of economics

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.250
and politics, in the same that if you're trained
as accountant you might see history as an

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.780
indeterminable series of ledgers to be balanced,
which it kind of is. And if you're say a novelist

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.090
you'll probably see history as a series of
narratives and you'll insert narrative. Even

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.680
when it doesn't necessarily exist.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.640
How we frame historical questions is extremely
important as is the way we're trained and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.990
the tools we use to try to seek answers.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.820
So Acemoğlu and Robinson focus on institutions
and claim that a nation is successful when

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.790
it's economic and political institutions are
inclusive.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.359
This focus on institutions explains a lot
and it's very convincing, and it corrects

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.660
previous theories. For example, Montesquieu's
idea that tropical nations tend to be poorer

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.640
either because the people "tended to be lazy
and to lack inquisitiveness" or because diseases

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.850
and poor soil inhibit economic growth. But
according to Acemoğlu and Robinson the data

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.470
just doesn't support Montesquieu's conclusions.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.430
Yeah that's a little prob... Oooh it's time
for the open letter! But first let's see what's

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.280
in the globe today. Oh! It's Montesquieu.
Do you have a first name by the way? Oh, he

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.110
does, his full name is Charles-Louis de Secondat,
Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, which

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.000
explains why we only call him Montesquieu.
Anyway, an open letter to Montesquieu.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.900
Dear Montesquieu,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.700
You had so many good ideas, separation of
powers, that's a definite winner. You basically

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.100
coined the word despotism. That's a great
word, I mean before the word despotism, our

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.120
only word for that thing was like, government.
But this idea that you had that poor people

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.110
were doomed to stay poor has proven astonishingly
powerful, and it's also entirely wrong. Fortunately,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.590
Montesquieu, most of us have moved on from your
theories about poverty, although, just recently.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.220
Best wishes, John Green.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.690
Okay, so let's talk about these inclusive
institutions that are supposed to be so good

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.460
for nations. In economics it's institutions
quote "That enforce property rights, create

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.889
a level playing field, and encourage investments
in new technologies and skills."

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.639
In other words, the kind we associate with
modern market capitalism, you know, with some

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.410
regulations. You know, like in the U.S. we
have very open markets, but still Walmart

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.380
isn't allowed to sell black tar heroin. They
are allowed to sell guns though.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.889
Inclusive political institutions are those
that are characterized by pluralism which

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.670
means that they include a number of interests
with different political perspectives that

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.900
can act as checks on executive authority.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.480
So success isn't just about democracy or "majority
rule" as we have lately learned in Iraq;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.380
it's about inclusive pluralism.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.230
So the nations that Acemoğlu and Robinson
see as successful are the ones with the most

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.980
inclusive economies and the most pluralistic
governments.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.540
Now they are able to draw a clear correlation,
but it's a bit harder to say that these particular

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.450
institutions caused those nations to become
successful. This is the nature of correlation;

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.230
it's possible that they could be right that
institutions were necessary for a nation to

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.480
become rich and powerful, but there may be
other institutions that matter as much or

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.320
more than the economic and political ones
they identify.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.169
Another guy who's written a lot about this
stuff is Francis Fukuyama. Fukuyama also believes

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.090
that institutions are the key to a nation
state's success, but in his book The Origins

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.510
of Political Order he identifies the rule
of law as the institution that underlies all

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.340
success. To Fukuyama, the critical thing is
that there be a rule of law that is superior

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.990
to rulers who temporarily happen to command
the state's armed forces and bureaucracy.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.949
If no one is more powerful than the law and
no one can change the law, then inclusive

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.440
economic institutions and pluralistic political
ones sort of naturally come forth.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.010
Now, that's not all that different from what
Acemoğlu and Robinson described but there

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.690
is a twist in how Fukuyama gets there. He
argues that the root of the rule of law in

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.400
Europe as the basis for its institutions is
in religion, specifically the Catholic Church.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.360
For him it was the Catholic Church that established
the idea that there was a law that was binding,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.590
even to kings, providing the limits that are
the heart of Acemoğlu and Robinson's pluralistic

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.780
institutions. And this would push the origins
of the West's institutional advantages back

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.610
further than the advent of the nation state,
right, because until recently, religion was

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.530
far more important to most people than, you know,
nation states or capitalistic economic institutions.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.780
Fukuyama, you'll be surprised to learn, is
a political scientist and classicist by training,

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.010
so it's not that much of a surprise that he
finds the roots of the West's preeminence

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.410
in governance and classic religious thought.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.229
Okay, let's look at one last example of a
different approach to this historical question.

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:51.990
Uh, that guy Ian Morris, who we talked about
earlier, he wrote the book "Why the West Rules

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.580
-- For Now." He broke down his arguments into
a mathematical formula based on four dimensions:

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.060
energy capture, how much humans have been
able to use energy beyond their own muscles;

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.240
social organization, which he derives by measuring
the largest city in a region;

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.460
information technology, not just the Internet,
also like writing and books;

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.660
and war making capacity, which we can learn about
through archaeology and also traditional history.

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:19.060
And then he combines these numbers to develop
a social development index that describes

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:25.000
the West and the East at various points in
history from 14,000 BCE to 2000 CE. Now, Morris

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.380
is not an economist or a mathematician; he's
a classically trained historian, but here

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.909
he is using numbers, not very sophisticatedly
and, uh, lots of criticism of them, but using

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.949
numbers nonetheless. And I think that speaks
to how data-driven contemporary academics

00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:40.759
is. We like things that can be quantified.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:44.600
I mean, many of you are teenagers taking AP
World History, and at the end of that, you

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.589
will take a test that gives you a number between
one and five that tells you how much you know

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:52.839
about world history. My number was two, but
hopefully yours will be higher, because I

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.699
am smarter now than I was then.

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:57.540
Now I do wanna note one other thing, which
is that you've probably noticed that none

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.730
of these books question the assumption that
the West has been dominant in the world stage

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.589
over the last couple centuries. That is also
a question of perspective. Like, from the

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:12.209
perspective of non-human residents of Earth,
the West has been a total failure. But there's

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:17.790
a certain set of data we look at when it comes
to humans, like uh, GDP, the total size of

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:23.230
a country's economy; or number of tanks; or
innovation indexes; or life expectancy. Through

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.879
all of those lenses, the West has come out
on top in the last 200 years. But that leads

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:32.819
us to larger questions about why we measure
civilizations and determine winners and losers

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:35.680
in the first place and what that does to our
thinking.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.329
As Morris points out, one of the problematic
things about reducing human social development

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:44.869
to a number is that it can dehumanize individuals.
Now numbers are a great shorthand and they

00:09:44.869 --> 00:09:49.009
can be very useful for comparisons, like,
I would like to know if my life expectancy

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:52.990
would be longer in the United States or in
Canada. Stan informs me that life expectancy

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.769
is longer in Canada, which doesn't make any
sense. I always thought that Canada was America's

00:09:56.769 --> 00:10:01.660
hat. Turns out that we are Canada's pants.
Anyway, Stan, we got to move to Canada.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.699
But numbers are always incomplete, and too
often we mistake what is easily quantifiable

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:11.449
with what is important. Also, when we ask
the question about why the West rules or why

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:15.949
Western nations have succeeded, what are we
gonna to do with the answer? Is it for Westerners

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:21.220
to congratulate ourselves on a job well done,
or to explain away the astonishing inequality

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:26.660
in the world as being so deeply rooted in the
past as to make any efforts to fix it futile?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.459
I'd like to think that by understanding what
has made the West more successful in certain

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:34.990
ways, we can formulate policies that will
lead to a general improvement, at least in

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.600
those ways, around the world. But what we've
tried to provide here a series of perspectives

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.509
on a historical question to emphasize the
fact that all history has its perspective.

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:47.629
It's common to use mathematical measures to
analyze contemporary world problems and attempt

00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:51.389
to find solutions, and that's a good thing
in many ways. But when it comes to history

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:55.589
and politics, mathematical formulas also have
their perspective, and we need to remember

00:10:55.589 --> 00:11:00.559
that each of those perspectives is necessarily
biased to look at some things and not others.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:04.509
Whether it's Crash Course or your world history
textbook, it's important to remember that

00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:08.470
bias is inherent to the experience of writing
and telling the story of history.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.149
So when you see a number or a claim of success
or failure, stop and ask yourself what sorts

00:11:13.149 --> 00:11:17.949
of information went into that number or into
that conclusion, and just as important, what

00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:22.089
might have been ignored or missed? Thanks
for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:26.439
Crash Course is made here in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz studio with the help of all

00:11:26.439 --> 00:11:31.050
of these nice people. It's also possible because
of your support through Subbable. Subbable

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.879
is a voluntary subscription service that allows
you to support Crash Course directly so we

00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:39.619
can keep it free for everyone forever, so
please check it out. Thank you again for watching,

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.640
thanks to all of our Subbable subscribers,
and as we say in my hometown,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.860
don't forget to be awesome.
