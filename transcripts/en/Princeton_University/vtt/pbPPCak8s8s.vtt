BERNICE FOKUM: Even
though I love so,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.040
so many things on Princeton's
campus, what I especially loved

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.030
was the opportunities that
they gave us to see the world.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.610
So my semester that I spent
at the University of Havana

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.820
in Cuba was one of, by far,
my favorite experiences

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.590
at Princeton.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.830
had a great time.


00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.440

stay on campus over the summer

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.670

DEBERLY KAUFFMAN:
After Dean's Date,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.260
when I stayed up late
with a bunch of friends

playing Apples to Apples.


00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.280
DRAGOS POTIRNICHE:
Physics research,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.190
and collaborating

and with post-docs
and other researchers.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.710
SUNNY XU: Handing in
my thesis, knowing

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.010
that all those months of
hard work finally paid off.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.130

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.750
GINA TRIOLO: Both
being on campus

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.560
and the semester I
spent abroad in London,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.140
I've been able to
interact with people

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.370
of so many different backgrounds
and different places all

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.870
the world, that I never thought
I would have the opportunity

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.960
to do before I came here.


00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.740
ELISABETH POWELL:
The relationships

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.240
that I've forged
with my professors,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.540
that I know will continue
for the rest of my life.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.180
They are truly
mentors and friends.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.640
JOHN MCNAMARA: The opportunity
to come here and meet people

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640
from incredibly
diverse backgrounds,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.170
and be able to work
one-on-one with faculty.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.710
And build these relationships
that I think are going to last,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.340
far beyond when I walk
out of FitzRandolph Gate,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.960
I think is an
unbelievable opportunity.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.290
ADAM MASTROIANNI: There was
a night early in my freshman

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.270
year, when I was just sitting
around, and all of a sudden,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.170
there's these nine
people in red shirts

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.830
all banging and
screaming at my door.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.320
And I open it up, and
they tell me to run.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.380
And I'm running, and I'm
halfway across campus

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.290
before I realize I
got into Quickfire,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.950
which is an improv comedy group.


00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.610
MAURA O'BRIEN: We
stayed up all night,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.810
and we climbed to the top
of the football stadium.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.920
We watched the sun rise.


00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.510
Being very still, it
was really beautiful.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.880
LUKAS GAFFNEY:
The third class we

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.650
did in Panama was the
biology of coral reefs.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.750
And I remember the first day
of class, we got on a boat.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.800
We went to a deserted
island called

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.530
Cubita, kind of in
the middle of nowhere,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.120
off the coast of Panama.


00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.590
And then, we spent six
hours that day snorkeling,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.970
and six hours every day after
that snorkeling as a class.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.170
MARGARET WANG: I was president
of the Chinese Student

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.180
Association, and we
just did a banquet,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.180
in which we invited
a YouTube star.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.340
And then it started
snowing so hard

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.180
that we couldn't drive him back.


00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.800
But we ended up just
having a snowball fight,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.490
and rolling down the
hill, which is cool,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.010
because you don't get to do
that with a YouTube everyday.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.720
DIANA LIU: My favorite
moments are always

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.740
spent in the treehouse
in the Cotsen Children's

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.740
Library in Firestone.


00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.820

time that all of us

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.670
who were in my Z
group as freshmen

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.490
get to spend time together.


00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.910

climbed Mount Kenya,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.320
which is the second
largest peak in Africa.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.360
RYAN MCCARTY: Singing for
the Nassoon alumni

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.210

ELLEN TUNG: Between my
junior and senior year,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.700
after eight months of
hard work, I finally

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.200
submitted my paper to a
professional research journal.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.290
LUKE PAULSEN: A couple
weeks into freshman year,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.230
I'm in wind ensemble in
the low brass section,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.540
with a couple of my friends.


00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.460
We decided, then and there, the
back row of the wind ensemble,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.590
to start our own brass ensemble.


00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.640
And now, we've been
playing for four years.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.110
NATASHA JAPANWALA:
Being a member

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.320
of the Edwards Collective.


00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.840
I've met some of my best
friends through this program.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.390
I'm going to think
of all the moments

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.880
that we just spent
together, talking

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.300
about art and philosophy
and all the things we love.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.760
And developing in the process,
these fabulous friendships

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.960
that I really do think are
going to last a lifetime.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.710
