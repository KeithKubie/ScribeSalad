Hi I'm Nate Dern I'm the head

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.104
of the Comedy Central
Creater's program.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.006
And I'm Ryan.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.975
I was going to introduce. I was
going to introduce. 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.546
The Creators program
is putting five emerging

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:13.580
comedians together

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.249
to create a topical show

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.516
talking about everything
that's happening

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.919
in pop culture Monday
through Thursday

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.355
and that's going to be
lots of screaming

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.923
no matter what
the format ends up being.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.292
&gt;&gt; And we're also going to make
a workplace comedy series.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.562
We wake up. We think of goofy
stuff. They film it. We get
paid.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.030
Can't argue with that. 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.198
What scale are you grading on?

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.201
Leonardo DiCaprio is a six.
Are you kidding me?

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:39.139
He's an 8 on a bad day.
What numbers are we? [Talking
over eachtoher]

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:41.775
&gt;&gt; What was your
first impression of Ryan?

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.444
Yeah. I thought he was a dick.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.146
&gt;&gt; I know that she thought
I was a dick.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.917
When we first met each other
and so now my first impression

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.152
has been I should always be
extra nice to Hannah.

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.588
All right. Which ones cutest
and which one would you (BLEEP)?

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.291
That's the same dog. 
Yeah.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.360
&gt;&gt; Trick question.
He's cool I like Jordan.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.162
He seems like a weirdo

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:05.465
but I think he like is
more normal than what he wears.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.101
&gt;&gt; I just found this Sub Reddit
called watch people die

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.638
which is like just found footage
of a lot of people like dying.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.307
That sounds horrible.
Yeah it's really bad.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:16.109
&gt;&gt; My first impression of Hannah
is she deserves to be on Raya.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.380
If you're aware but Raya's
a very selective dating site

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.650
that has denied Hannah and I
have taken on the charge

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.085
to make sure
that she gets on Raya.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.854
&gt;&gt; Yeah I need to be on Raya.
I'm a very easy date.

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.690
Like I will do you know
like it's alright.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.394
This is like my kissing booth.
It's funny that it says trash on
it that's truly what I am.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.233
&gt;&gt; You're going to hate this
question. What comedian style

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.969
would you say you're similar to?

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.637
I don't know man. I hate
this question.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:44.905
Whichever comedian hates

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:47.307
this question most is  probably
align with.

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.509
&gt;&gt; Nick Kroll is
a huge influence of mine

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.747
so I like to do this like hybrid
character and standup thing

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:57.851
which he does so well.
I like American celebrities.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:59.386
They mostly food. Kevin Bacon.
John Hamm. Scarlett Johansen.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.459
&gt;&gt;Yeah? Scarlett Johansen.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.761
The comic they that used to
compare me

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.129
to was Cedric the Entertainer

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.998
and that's because
they say I look like him.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:13.100
I can't argue with that. Hey Ced
We need to do a show together.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.534
You could be the dad.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.436
&gt;&gt; When was the last time
you were embarrassed?

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.338
I don't get embarrassed
I get apologetic.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.640
When's the last time
you apologized?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.776
I think I've done it several
times while sitting here.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.244
&gt;&gt; I think you're right.
If I thought about

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.579
about every time I got
embarrassed.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.149
I would never leave my house.
Last time I got embarassed was

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.550
when I got the news I was picked
to be a Digital Creator.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.420
We did it via FaceTime.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.757
I was siting there. I didn't
know what to do my face.

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:38.658
Because it's FaceTime you
couldal so see your dumb face in
the top corner.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.929
You right here.
[Stammering] How ya doin?

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.197
I got it?

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.665
&gt;&gt; Thanks for answering
those questions Ryan.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.268
I'm really looking forward to
working with you in 30 minutes

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:51.905
when we meet up again.
Was that earnest enough for you?

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.174
I thought that was sweet.
Internet.
I thought that was nice.
