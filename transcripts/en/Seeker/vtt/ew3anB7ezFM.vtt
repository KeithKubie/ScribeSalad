00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.210
The idea of finding a new planet is always
so appealing and exciting!

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.780
But what if a rogue planet just, kinda, wandered
into our Solar System?

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:15.039
Hey, it might have already happened!

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.760
Hey guys, space-fan Amy with you on DNews
today.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.131
Last year, astronomers at CalTech announced
the discovery of a potential new planet, Planet

00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:23.131
Nine.

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.840
We’ve talked about it before: it’s a hypothetical
planet whose existence has been theorized

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.730
by observations of distant Kuiper Belt objects.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.070
Six of these small bodies are tracing out
similarly irregular orbits around the Sun

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.870
suggesting there’s some big gravitational
mass tugging on them: Planet Nine.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.079
If it exists, it’s between ten times the
mass of Earth and the mass of Neptune, orbits

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.880
some 1,000 Astronomical Units away, so 1,000
times further from the Sun than the Earth,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.910
and has an inclined orbit.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.080
The question then, is, how could a planet
that big have formed that far away with such

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.130
an odd orbit?

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.100
Well, new research from a team at New Mexico
State University says that it might not have

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.280
formed in our system, it might have been captured.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.740
We might have taken in an orphaned interloper
of a planet!

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.460
We tend to think of a planet as orbiting a
star, but according to a previous study out

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.500
of the Osaka University in Japan, rogue planets
are actually fairly common; 75 percent of

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.780
all Jupiter-mass planets might be free-floating
in space!

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.990
The astronomers came to this number using
a method called gravitational microlensing.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.990
This technique involves measuring how much
a massive object warps the light from a distant

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.620
star as seen from Earth.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.090
Usually used to find a planet orbiting a distant
star, astronomers found some odd instances

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.950
of microlensing in data sets.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.939
The data was consistent with a planet passing
in front of a star, but there was no signal

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.610
linking it to a host star.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.759
Their conclusion was that these planets are
free-floating rogues, wandering alone through

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.759
space.

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.030
And there were a lot of them!

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.670
This team found ten in two years, suggesting
there are potentially twice as many rogue

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.080
planets as planets in solar systems in the
milky way alone.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.080
Ok.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.740
So if this is true — remember we’re in
hypotheticals right now — could Planet Nine

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.100
be a captured rogue?

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.909
The team from New Mexico State carried out
156 simulations of solar system encounters

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.540
with a rogue planet hitting our system at
an inclined angle and found that it’s possible!

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.450
In 50 percent of the simulations, the rogue
encountered the system and was simply slingshotted

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.510
out on its way.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.840
Only occasionally — 10 percent of the time
— did a rogue passing through rip another

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.050
planet out of the system with it, creating
a new rogue.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.590
But in 40 percent of encounter simulations,
the rogue became part of the system.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.330
There are a couple of ways this could happen.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.480
With a planet the mass of Neptune — which
is about 17 times the mass of Earth and within

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.090
the range Planet Nine is thought to be -- it
would be a “soft capture.”

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.940
The rogue would start orbiting the Sun without
disrupting the solar system at all.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.800
If the planet was more massive, say, the mass
of Jupiter, which is about 318 times the mass

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.890
of Earth, the rogue would make an exchange.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.660
It would enter our system but fling another
planet out in it’s stead.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.500
An even bigger rogue three times the mass
of Jupiter would have a more devastating effect.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.239
The rogue would be massive enough to kick
two or more planets out of the system.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.629
It could even boot everyone out!

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.349
Obviously that last one didn’t happen, but
still.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.800
Rogue planets are real, and it’s possible
that they shaped the Solar System we know

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.319
and love, and one might have joined us on
its journey!

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.280
Speaking of interlopers, if NASA were to find
alien interlopers, would it tell us?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.560
I dig into the history of this question over
on Vintage Space.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.580
And there’s more on Planet Nine right here.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.110
Do you guys love or hate the idea of Planet
Nine being a captured rogue?
