00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.610
Let's say we have triangle ABC.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.095
It looks something like this.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.500
I want to think about the
minimum amount of information.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.375
I want to come up with
a couple of postulates

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:17.330
that we can use to determine
whether another triangle is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.140
similar to triangle ABC.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.690
So we already know
that if all three

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.650
of the corresponding
angles are congruent

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.604
to the corresponding
angles on ABC, then

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.770
we know that we're dealing
with congruent triangles.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.600
So for example, if
this is 30 degrees,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.365
this angle is 90 degrees, and
this angle right over here

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:36.730
is 60 degrees.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.130
And we have another
triangle that

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.210
looks like this, it's
clearly a smaller triangle,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.050
but it's corresponding angles.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.530
So this is 30 degrees.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.610
This is 90 degrees,
and this is 60 degrees,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.710
we know that XYZ in this case,
is going to be similar to ABC.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.840
So we would know from this
because corresponding angles

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.950
are congruent, we would
know that triangle ABC

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.957
is similar to triangle XYZ.

00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:11.040
And you've got to get the
order right to make sure

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.914
that you have the right
corresponding angles.

00:01:12.914 --> 00:01:15.300
Y corresponds to
the 90-degree angle.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.900
X corresponds to
the 30-degree angle.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.480
A corresponds to
the 30-degree angle.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.520
So A and X are the
first two things.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.810
B and Y, which are the 90
degrees, are the second two,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.710
and then Z is the last one.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.210
So that's what we know already,
if you have three angles.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.650
But do you need three angles?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.990
If we only knew two of the
angles, would that be enough?

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.370
Well, sure because if you know
two angles for a triangle,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.520
you know the third.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.500
So for example, if I
have another triangle

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.000
that looks like this--
let me draw it like this--

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.860
and if I told you that only
two of the corresponding angles

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.910
are congruent.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.240
So maybe this angle right here
is congruent to this angle,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.020
and that angle right there
is congruent to that angle.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.430
Is that enough to say that
these two triangles are similar?

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.930
Well, sure.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.650
Because in a triangle, if
you know two of the angles,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.400
then you know what the
last angle has to be.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.250
If you know that this is 30
and you know that that is 90,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.700
then you know that this
angle has to be 60 degrees.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.400
Whatever these two angles
are, subtract them from 180,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.950
and that's going
to be this angle.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.380
So in general, in order
to show similarity,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.520
you don't have to show three
corresponding angles are

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.820
congruent, you really
just have to show two.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.720
So this will be the first of
our similarity postulates.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.440
We call it angle-angle.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.630
If you could show that two
corresponding angles are

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.620
congruent, then we're dealing
with similar triangles.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.750
So for example, just to
put some numbers here,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.920
if this was 30 degrees, and
we know that on this triangle,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.890
this is 90 degrees
right over here,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.820
we know that this
triangle right over here

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.670
is similar to that one there.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.560
And you can really just
go to the third angle

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.130
in this pretty
straightforward way.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.840
You say this third
angle is 60 degrees,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.780
so all three angles
are the same.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.870
That's one of our
constraints for similarity.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.320
Now, the other thing we
know about similarity

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.910
is that the ratio
between all of the sides

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.140
are going to be the same.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.370
So for example, if we have
another triangle right

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.370
over here-- let me
draw another triangle--

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.410
I'll call this
triangle X, Y, and Z.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.910
And let's say that we know that
the ratio between AB and XY,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.050
we know that AB over XY-- so
the ratio between this side

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.410
and this side-- notice we're not
saying that they're congruent.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.810
We're looking at
their ratio now.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.263
We're saying AB
over XY, let's say

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:50.240
that that is equal
to BC over YZ.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.950
That is equal to BC over YZ.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:04.370
And that is equal to AC over XZ.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.730
So once again, this
is one of the ways

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.700
that we say, hey,
this means similarity.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.210
So if you have all three
corresponding sides,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.600
the ratio between all
three corresponding sides

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.250
are the same, then
we know we are

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.690
dealing with similar triangles.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.019
So this is what we call
side-side-side similarity.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.940
And you don't want
to get these confused

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.910
with side-side-side congruence.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.644
So these are all of our
similarity postulates

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.560
or axioms or things that
we're going to assume

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.934
and then we're
going to build off

00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:35.440
of them to solve problems
and prove other things.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.640
Side-side-side, when we're
talking about congruence,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.200
means that the corresponding
sides are congruent.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.900
Side-side-side for
similarity, we're

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.210
saying that the ratio
between corresponding sides

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.020
are going to be the same.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.310
So for example, let's say
this right over here is 10.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.810
No.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.170
Let me think of a bigger number.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.660
Let's say this is 60, this
right over here is 30,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.280
and this right over here
is 30 square roots of 3,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.560
and I just made those
numbers because we will soon

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.570
learn what typical ratios
are of the sides of 30-60-90

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.530
triangles.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.490
And let's say this
one over here is

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.270
6, 3, and 3 square roots of 3.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.120
Notice AB over XY
30 square roots

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.260
of 3 over 3 square roots
of 3, this will be 10.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.620
What is BC over XY?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.700
30 divided by 3 is 10.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.170
And what is 60 divided
by 6 or AC over XZ?

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.020
Well, that's going to be 10.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.200
So in general, to go from
the corresponding side

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.741
here to the
corresponding side there,

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:45.559
we always multiply
by 10 on every side.

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:47.100
So we're not saying
they're congruent

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.474
or we're not saying
the sides are

00:05:48.474 --> 00:05:50.725
the same for this
side-side-side for similarity.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.850
We're saying that we're
really just scaling them up

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.870
by the same amount,
or another way

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.250
to think about it, the ratio
between corresponding sides

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.060
are the same.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.940
Now, what about
if we had-- let's

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.000
start another triangle
right over here.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.750
Let me draw it like this.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.300
Actually, I want to leave this
here so we can have our list.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.580
So let's draw
another triangle ABC.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.780
So this is A, B,
and C. And let's say

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:33.300
that we know that this side,
when we go to another triangle,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.410
we know that XY is AB
multiplied by some constant.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.300
So I can write it over here.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.860
XY is equal to some
constant times AB.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.050
Actually, let me make XY
bigger, so actually, it

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.580
doesn't have to be.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.605
That constant could be
less than 1 in which case

00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:52.370
it would be a smaller value.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.680
But let me just do it that way.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.920
So let me just make XY
look a little bit bigger.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.850
So let's say that this
is X and that is Y.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:07.430
So let's say that we
know that XY over AB

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.820
is equal to some constant.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.390
Or if you multiply
both sides by AB,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.470
you would get XY is some
scaled up version of AB.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:20.300
So maybe AB is 5, XY is 10,
then our constant would be 2.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.020
We scaled it up
by a factor of 2.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.390
And let's say we also
know that angle ABC is

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.730
congruent to angle XYZ.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.940
I'll add another
point over here.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.850
So let me draw another
side right over here.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.690
So this is Z. So
let's say we also

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.010
know that angle ABC
is congruent to XYZ,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.610
and let's say we know that
the ratio between BC and YZ

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.720
is also this constant.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.360
The ratio between
BC and YZ is also

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.360
equal to the same constant.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.750
So an example where this 5
and 10, maybe this is 3 and 6.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.440
The constant we're
kind of doubling

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.980
the length of the side.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.490
So is this triangle XYZ
going to be similar?

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:16.590
Well, if you think about it, if
XY is the same multiple of AB

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:21.200
as YZ is a multiple of BC,
and the angle in between

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.640
is congruent, there's
only one triangle

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.210
we can set up over here.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.640
We're only constrained to
one triangle right over here,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.140
and so we're
completely constraining

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.306
the length of this side,
and the length of this side

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:35.270
is going to have to be that
same scale as that over there.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.125
And so we call that
side-angle-side similarity.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.110
So once again, we
saw SSS and SAS

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.740
in our congruence
postulates, but we're

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.550
saying something
very different here.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:55.240
We're saying that
in SAS, if the ratio

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.240
between corresponding
sides of the true triangle

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.820
are the same, so AB and XY of
one corresponding side and then

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.660
another corresponding side,
so that's that second side,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.390
so that's between BC and YZ,
and the angle between them

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.640
are congruent, then we're
saying it's similar.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.180
For SAS for congruency, we
said that the sides actually

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.060
had to be congruent.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.570
Here we're saying that the ratio
between the corresponding sides

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.630
just has to be the same.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.830
So for example SAS, just to
apply it, if I have-- let

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.950
me just show some examples here.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:33.100
So let's say I have a
triangle here that is 3, 2, 4,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.450
and let's say we have
another triangle here

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.410
that has length
9, 6, and we also

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.460
know that the angle in
between are congruent so

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.480
that that angle is
equal to that angle.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.470
What SAS in the
similarity world tells

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.470
you is that these
triangles are definitely

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.680
going to be similar
triangles, that we're actually

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.260
constraining because there's
actually only one triangle

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.750
we can draw a right over here.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.310
It's the triangle
where all the sides

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.930
are going to have to be
scaled up by the same amount.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.169
So there's only one long
side right here that we

00:10:06.169 --> 00:10:07.710
could actually draw,
and that's going

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.840
to have to be scaled
up by 3 as well.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.590
This is the only
possible triangle.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.548
If you constrain this
side you're saying, look,

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:17.614
this is 3 times that side, this
is 3 three times that side,

00:10:17.614 --> 00:10:19.280
and the angle between
them is congruent,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.810
there's only one
triangle we could make.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.920
And we know there is a
similar triangle there

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.264
where everything is scaled
up by a factor of 3,

00:10:26.264 --> 00:10:27.680
so that one triangle
we could draw

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.334
has to be that one
similar triangle.

00:10:30.334 --> 00:10:32.000
So this is what we're
talking about SAS.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.374
We're not saying that this
side is congruent to that side

00:10:34.374 --> 00:10:36.100
or that side is
congruent to that side,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.140
we're saying that they're
scaled up by the same factor.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.450
If we had another triangle
that looked like this,

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.380
so maybe this is 9, this is
4, and the angle between them

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.900
were congruent, you
couldn't say that they're

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.960
similar because this side is
scaled up by a factor of 3.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.100
This side is only scaled
up by a factor of 2.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.460
So this one right over
there you could not

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.240
say that it is
necessarily similar.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.320
And likewise if you had a
triangle that had length 9 here

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.920
and length 6 there,
but you did not

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.920
know that these two
angles are the same,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.110
once again, you're not
constraining this enough,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.910
and you would not know that
those two triangles are

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.060
necessarily similar
because you don't

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.930
know that middle
angle is the same.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.430
Now, you might be
saying, well there

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.646
was a few other
postulates that we had.

00:11:26.646 --> 00:11:31.324
We had AAS when we
dealt with congruency,

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:32.990
but if you think about
it, we've already

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.740
shown that two
angles by themselves

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.490
are enough to show similarity.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.780
So why worry about an
angle, an angle, and a side

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.080
or the ratio between a side?

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.700
So why even worry about that?

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.390
And we also had
angle-side-angle in congruence,

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.940
but once again, we already
know the two angles are enough,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.890
so we don't need to
throw in this extra side,

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.060
so we don't even need
this right over here.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.580
So these are going to be
our similarity postulates,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.760
and I want to remind
you, side-side-side,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.694
this is different than the
side-side-side for congruence.

00:11:58.694 --> 00:12:01.110
We're talking about the ratio
between corresponding sides.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.190
We're not saying that
they're actually congruent.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.274
And here, side-angle-side,
it's different

00:12:06.274 --> 00:12:07.940
than the side-angle-side
for congruence.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.390
It's this kind of
related, but here we're

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.400
talking about the ratio
between the sides, not

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.272
the actual measures.
