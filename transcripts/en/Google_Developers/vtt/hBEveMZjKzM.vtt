DI-ANN EISNOR: Hello.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.876
My name is Di-Ann Eisnor,
and I'm the director

00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:03.880
of growth for Waze.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.970
For anyone who
doesn't know, Waze

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.039
is the free crowdsource
navigation and real time

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.500
traffic application.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.570
Our goal is to save
five minutes a day,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.360
every day for our more than 50
million users around the world.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.590
With so many Wazers
driving around every day,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.810
we have an unprecedented amount
of traffic, speeds, routes,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.530
incidents, enclosure.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.500
Our cities though,
are congested.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.285
Our mobility solutions are
expensive, and they're static.

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:32.479
We need solutions for
now, an on demand world

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.720
at the speed of mobile that
can adapt to our rapidly

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.010
changing mobility patterns.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.590
So today I'm going to share
a program that we recently

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.190
started to use all
of the data we're

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.600
able to collect from those
users around the world

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600
as a way to improve mobility
in our most congested cities.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.910
We call this the Connected
Citizens Program.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.080
So we share publicly available
data on incidents enclosures

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.180
and we feed that
into the cities.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.556
In exchange, we get their
incidence enclosures.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.180
So for us, it's
critical that we're not

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.596
going to be the app sending
people over the closed bridge,

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:04.030
and this is a very
difficult problem to solve.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.790
The premise is we can
save not just individuals

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.740
five minutes a day, but
look at the city as a whole.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.000
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.070
-In Rio de Janerio,
Brazil, traffic

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.900
is a very important issue.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.040
We have almost 7 million
people here going from A to B

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.410
to C to D. From the first
phone call that we have,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.420
two weeks later, we were there
inside of Waze application

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.245
with API's, bringing
to the operation center

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:36.146
every information that
we agree to share.

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:37.770
-We have the channel,
we have the data,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.180
and we need to shorten the
distance between the citizens

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.280
and the city hall.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.300
-We 400,000 Wazers
in Rio de Janeiro.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.220
50,000 users every day.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.840
It's like we have an army of
public agents talking to us.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.250
As many Wazers that we have,
the more this number grows,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.490
more efficient and
more [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.285
this tool will work.

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:01.210
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:01.347 --> 00:02:02.930
DI-ANN EISNOR: So
it's important to us

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.560
that we're looking at mobility
patterns around the world

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.150
as we collaborate
in the solution.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.030
So you can see here, that
we have a really pretty

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.150
good geographic spread.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.970
More than 50 million users.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.450
In Rio alone, which you just
saw, we have more than 150,000

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.380
every day.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.210
And they Connected Citizens
Program is now live in 32

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.610
cities and DOT's.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.870
So the data that we're
sharing and receiving-- it's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.860
usually the closures
that are due to things

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.490
like construction, protests,
marathons, parades,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.830
and incidents-- like
traffic itself and accident.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.825
Also, what are
the unusual things

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.120
that are happening on
the road in real time?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.779
Is there a drastic
change in the speed

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.570
in which people are
driving or the patterns

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.430
in which they're driving?

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.910
Hazard such as ice,
flooding-- anything that's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.190
needed to stay safe and
informed on the road, that's

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.760
the information that we care
about and we want to provide.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.334
So the distribution is
a key piece as well.

00:02:57.334 --> 00:02:59.000
We need to make sure
that this data gets

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.220
into the hands of as
many people as possible.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.490
So we use the app itself,
the notifications, inbox,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.620
closures right on the map, and
the live map at our website.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.220
We use social media.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.350
We do have dedicated
series of Twitter

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.170
feeds for many of the cities,
and they are constantly

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.340
streaming anything
unusual we can find

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.730
so that people are alerted.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.500
Here's an example of a
closure and an inbox.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.250
It's marked on the
map, and users will

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.200
be routed around the closure.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.920
And more details about it
and when it might finish

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.450
will be in your inbox.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.780
We alert people in real
time as changes occur,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.780
and now importantly,
the same data

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.320
is seen in traffic management
centers around the world

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.290
so it can be used to
solve those problems.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.810
Here's an example from Guatemala
of an unusual traffic event.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.990
We're looking for major
changes in the speed

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.550
and behavior in real time,
not just small changes.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.170
So if we find something where
there's a drastic change,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.840
we try to correlate
it to a report

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.280
that we have inside
of our application.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.090
In this particular
case, it's an accident.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.450
You can see police there.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.420
We want people to be able to
understand what's happening

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.940
and why.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.352
Here's another example from
Obama's visit to San Francisco.

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:13.560
So on the live map, you can
see the exchanging routes

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.980
throughout the day.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.554
You can see user
generated photos

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.220
that are coming in
from our users, which

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.339
provide important context
for cities but also

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.420
for broadcasters and Wazers.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.220
And lastly, you'll
see that there's

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.142
a lot of gratitude
happening in social media.

00:04:26.142 --> 00:04:27.600
So we feel like
there's a real need

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.099
for this kind of
information, and we

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.460
try our best to provide it.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.050
From the city perspective, there
are three tangible benefits.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.060
One is on integrating the
information because they

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.150
don't have access to a lot.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.314
Communicating with
their citizen base.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.230
And then of course,
analyzing that information

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.090
to see if there are
important insights

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.350
they can take away and add
into their urban planning.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.760
So if we talk about the
integration for a second--

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.380
we need to integrate the data
into their current systems.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.260
This is really key because they
don't have a lot of visibility

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.180
right now except their road
sensors or traffic cameras.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.190
And due to cost restrictions--
these things are

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.820
very expensive-- they tend
to be only on major roads

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.680
for cities who can
afford them at all.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.414
So this is a first look at
extending for them, the what's

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:11.080
happening and where--
help me understand

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.360
what's going on in my city.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.970
Second, they see this
as a way to communicate

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.880
with their citizens.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.454
And they spend a lot
of money and time

00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:20.870
trying to gather
this information,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.380
and they need new ways to let
people know what's happening,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.610
what they're doing.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.360
So some examples here are
the parade information

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.370
after the New England
Patriots Super Bowl victory.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.620
Due to weather, nobody
knew until the last minute

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.984
what time it was going to
be or what the exact route

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:35.650
was going to be.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.520
So they came to us and
made sure that they

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.360
were able to communicate
to all of our users

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.670
in Boston what the details
were and keep people updated.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.720
Latvia is another good example.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.152
They have very strict
rules on snow tires,

00:05:48.152 --> 00:05:49.860
and they will start
fining people the day

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.310
after the rules say that
they need to have them on.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.820
So we were able to send a
message to all of our Wazers

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.490
to make sure that they were
able to know exactly when they

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.210
needed to have these tires put.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.060
Latvia was very
happy about this.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.470
NYPD is another partner.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.220
And recently they
changed the speed limit

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.920
across the entire
city and needed a way

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.260
to reinforce and let
New Yorkers know.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.010
So they were able to use
Waze for that as well.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.680
This is an example of a
variable message sign.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.180
These things cost a lot
of money, and many of them

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.800
are just sitting
there empty and blank

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.090
because the data sources
have been too expensive

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.250
or it's been too
difficult to integrate.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.910
So we're now
providing these cities

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.770
with travel times in real
time, as well as alerts.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.490
For example, snow and ice.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.420
And then thirdly, analysis
has been key for our partners.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.170
Once they have this
much data, they

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.070
need to understand
the meaning of it.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.530
And so this is an example from
the Brazilian elections in Rio

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.390
last year.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.990
They had two, and the first
is what you're seeing here.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.560
This is Waze reports before
and then during the election.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.870
So you can see that the
number of reports grew by 103%

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.690
just in that one day.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.880
What you're seeing on
the right-hand side

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.180
is every single
neighborhood in Rio.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.200
The ones in red are an
increase in reports,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.060
and the ones in
blue are a decrease.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.620
So they were able to--
for the second election--

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.914
make sure that they
redistributed traffic personnel

00:07:13.914 --> 00:07:15.580
in a way that made
sense based on really

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.371
what people were
experiencing on the roads.

00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:20.310
So this was a very nice example
of making an improvement based

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.150
on this analysis.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.590
So on average, Waze
users report an accident

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.460
30 seconds after they occur.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.310
This is significantly lower
than what people normally

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.610
see from having to call
in or even from sensors.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.240
Even in Sydney where we
don't have a huge user base,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.720
we're contributing an
additional 30% of new incidents

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.670
to their traffic
management center.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.870
And 47% are coming
in through Waze

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.540
before any other mechanisms.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.140
We also have cities that are
optimizing their traffic camera

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.680
placement based on where
accidents are happening

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.590
or where congestion is
happening on a changing basis.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.040
So, some other really
interesting ways

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.540
that people are looking at
improving their cities based

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.670
on data is, Boston Wazers
are reporting an average

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.390
of 900 potholes a month.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.190
And they are committed
to fixing them as a city.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:09.950
So this is good.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.409
You know, it's one
thing to report.

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:13.824
And it's another thing to know
that you're going to report

00:08:13.824 --> 00:08:15.110
and something will be fixed.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.000
Washington DC just
outdid Boston with what

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.650
they called Potholepalooza.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.490
And so for one week, anyone who
added a pothole through Waze

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.040
saw that it was fixed
within 48 hours.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.380
This is great
government response.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.900
We have live snow plow
and garbage truck feeds.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.390
So Rio has even changed their
garbage collection routes

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.570
based on this data.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.549
And the Kentucky
DOT is letting users

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.780
know when the roads have
been cleared in real time

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.200
so they know when they
can get on the road.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.270
LA is also taking it up a
notch in trying to soften

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.606
their peak commute times.

00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:48.230
And it can be a
difference on a commute

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.380
in LA in the morning between
30 minutes in two hours.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.740
So they're trying to
incentivize best times to leave

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.524
for work using Waze data.

00:08:55.524 --> 00:08:57.190
If you leave 10 minutes
earlier or later

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.030
you might save 30
minutes in the long run.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.300
And so we can now
surface this information.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.080
So citizens are reporting,
and cities are listening.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.670
We're playing an active
role in trying to turn data

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.470
into better mobility.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.325
And the underlying theme
we've been talking about here

00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:15.450
is really that governments
have access to more data

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.340
than ever before, citizens are
open to sharing and reporting,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.770
but citizens expect action.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.192
Cities have an obligation
now to respond,

00:09:25.192 --> 00:09:27.400
and the most successful
local governments are already

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.070
using data to take action
and improve mobility

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.580
based on citizen
communication and insights,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.880
literally taking all
this data and using it

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.870
as intelligent infrastructure.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.310
So, if you're a developer or
a planner for a city or a DOT,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.090
please join mobility leaders
from around the world

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.090
to share best practices
and crowdsourcing,

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.930
data analysis, real time
response to citizen needs,

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.480
and help spread the word.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.460
Get your cities involved.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.460
Thank you so much.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.680
