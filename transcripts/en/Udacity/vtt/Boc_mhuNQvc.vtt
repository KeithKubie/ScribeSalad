00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.350
So using our genetic code we can see that

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.270
the start code, and there's only one, AUG. And we

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.910
can see it right here, AUG. Now instead of trying

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.260
to guess the other ones, because I knew there's only

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.870
one start code on. Let's actually try to interpret this

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.100
one. GCA, let's come over here, the first letter is

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.700
G, the second letter is C, and the third letter

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.400
is A. So GCA right there, is Alanine And so

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.890
I am going to check that box and the last

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.572
one is UGA and we can go to here at stop

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:31.674
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:31.674 --> 00:00:34.292
and we see UGA is one of our stuff

00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:35.410
[UNKNOWN].

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.940
So hopefully you can get some idea of how reading this genetic code works.
