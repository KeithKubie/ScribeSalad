Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So you probably didn't know that Alabama

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.050
has it's own museum of natural history. We also have

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
the only meteorite to ever strike a human being. Want to check it out?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.120
It's known as the Hodges meteorite. It's 8.5 pounds and it hit

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.150
this woman.. Ann Hodges. It's pretty funny because she was taking a nap

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.160
on her couch and she was rudely awakened by a huge

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.180
fireball coming through her roof and nailing her on the leg.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.200
It was so forceful, it broke her radio.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.210
They didn't know if this meteorite belonged to the people that own the house,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.240
or Miss Hodges because it hit her. But the people that own the house, they wanted it,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.250
so they went to court. Long story short, she bought it from those

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.270
people anyway. Now it's here at the Alabama Natural History Museum.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.310
So now you know. The only meteorite ever to strike a person happened in

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.360
1954 in Alabama. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.390
Let's go hug a whale fossil.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.400
Not interested. I'll do it.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.450
(Wife) What are you doing?
(Destin) Did you know there used to be elephants in Alabama?

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.470
Come look at this. That's an

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.520
elephant tooth. It's called a mastadon.
(Son) Mastadon elephant.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.540
(Destin) They used to live in Alabama. You believe me?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.600
- Yes.
- Pretty awesome isn't it?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.650
