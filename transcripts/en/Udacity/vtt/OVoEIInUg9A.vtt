00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.360
In the post, Noah says he would take a line chart, a histogram or

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.970
bar chart, and the table on his island.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.600
For me, I would take a scatter plot to represent relationships between

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.320
variables, a stacked bar plot to represent comparisons, and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.400
finally a line plot to represent trends in time.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.900
I often think the most interesting insights come from comparisons and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.520
juxtaposition of data and time, so my charts might be slightly biased.
