00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.100
We're asked to solve for x.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.850
And we have this
compound inequality here,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.530
negative 16 is less than or
equal to 3x plus 5, which

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.137
is less than or equal to 20.

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:10.970
And really, there's two
ways to approach it,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.150
which are really the same way.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.191
And I'll do both of them.

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:15.500
And I'll actually do both
of them simultaneously.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.480
So one is to just solve
this compound inequality

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.980
all at once.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.021
And I'll just rewrite it.

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:23.930
Negative 16 is less than or
equal to 3x plus 5, which

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.540
is less than or equal to 20.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.050
And the other way
is to think of it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.510
as two separate inequalities,
but both of them

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.870
need to be true.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.770
So you could also view it as
negative 16 has to be less than

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.488
or equal to 3x plus 5.

00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:45.790
And 3x plus 5 needs to be
less than or equal to 20.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.849
This statement and this
statement are equivalent.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.140
This one may seem a little
bit more familiar because we

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.600
can independently solve
each of these inequalities

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.767
and just remember the "and."

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:57.266
This one might seem a little
less traditional because now we

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.870
have three sides
to the statement.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.870
We have three parts of
this compound inequality.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.619
But what we can see
is that we're actually

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.190
going to solve it
the exact same way.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.650
In any situation, we really just
want to isolate the x on one

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.370
side of the inequality,
or in this case,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.860
one part of the
compound inequality.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.450
Well, the best way to
isolate this x right here

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.540
is to first get rid of
this positive 5 that's

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.456
sitting in the middle.

00:01:17.456 --> 00:01:19.260
So let's subtract
5 from every part

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.030
of this compound inequality.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.590
So I'm going to subtract
5 there, subtract 5

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.230
there, and subtract
5 over there.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.150
And so we get negative 16
minus 5 is negative 21,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.780
is less than or equal to 3x
plus 5 minus 5 is 3x, which

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.891
is less than or equal to
20 minus 5, which is 15.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.890
And we could essentially
do the same thing here.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.410
If we want to isolate the 3x, we
can subtract 5 from both sides.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.190
We get negative 21.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.400
Negative 21 is less
than or equal to 3x.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.950
And we get, subtracting
5 from both sides.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.450
And notice, we're
just subtracting 5

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.283
from every part of this
compound inequality.

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:06.578
We get 3x is less
than or equal to 15.

00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:08.619
So this statement and this
statement, once again,

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.139
are the exact same thing.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.470
Now, going back here, if
we want to isolate the x,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.882
we can divide by 3.

00:02:14.882 --> 00:02:17.090
And we have to do it to
every part of the inequality.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.410
And since 3 is positive, we
don't have to change the sign.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.583
So let's divide every part of
this compound inequality by 3.

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:26.420
You divide every part by 3.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.671
This is equivalent to
dividing every part of each

00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:32.820
of these inequalities by 3.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.810
And then we get negative 21
divided by 3 is negative 7,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.620
is less than or equal
to x, which is less than

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.140
or equal to 15
divided by 3 is 5.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.920
You do it here.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.990
You get negative 7 is
less than or equal to x,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.940
and x is less than or
equal to 15/3, which is 5.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.952
This statement and this
statement are completely equal.

00:02:57.952 --> 00:02:58.910
And we've solved for x.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.590
We've given you
the solution set.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.630
And if we want to graph
it on a number line,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.170
it would look like this.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.270
This is 0.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.470
This is 5.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.080
This is negative 7.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.730
Our solution set includes
everything between negative 7

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.650
and 5, including
negative 7 and 5.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.530
So we have to fill in
the circles on negative 7

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.940
and positive 5.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.420
And it is everything in between.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.060
That's our solution set.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.760
And so we can verify
that these work.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.134
You could try out
a number that's

00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:33.380
well inside of our
solution set, like 0.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.120
3 times 0 is 0.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.720
So you're just left
with 5 is greater

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.690
than or equal to negative
16, which is true.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.730
And 5 is less than
or equal to 20.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.300
Or negative 16 is less than or
equal to 5, which is less than

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.930
or equal to 20.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.130
So that works, and
that makes sense.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.480
You could try 5.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.320
If you put 5 here,
you get 3 times

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.400
5 plus 5-- well, that's just 20.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.146
Negative 16 is less than or
equal to 20, which is less than

00:03:55.146 --> 00:03:55.770
or equal to 20.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.610
That works.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.200
Negative 7 should also work.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.060
3 times negative 7 is negative
21, plus 5 is negative 16.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.850
So you get negative
16, which is less than

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.739
or equal to negative 16, which
is less than or equal to 20.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.030
And you could try other values.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.738
You could go outside
of our solution set.

00:04:10.738 --> 00:04:11.660
Try something like 10.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.850
10 should not work.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.986
And you see here, if you put 10
here, you get 3 times 10 plus 5

00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:18.310
is 35.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.880
Negative 16 is less
than or equal to 35,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.620
but 35 is not less
than or equal to 20.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.640
And that's why 10 is not
part of our solution set.
