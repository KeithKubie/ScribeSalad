00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:01.909
woodland it was lame and I remembered
that I thought because I was actually

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919
that I thought because I was actually
 

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.610
that I thought because I was actually
writing the conclusion for a report that

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620
writing the conclusion for a report that
 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.559
writing the conclusion for a report that
we were writing and the the whole grant

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:06.569
we were writing and the the whole grant
 

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.149
we were writing and the the whole grant
which was called finance innovation and

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159
which was called finance innovation and
 

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:10.339
which was called finance innovation and
growth actually had been looking sector

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:10.349
growth actually had been looking sector
 

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:13.969
growth actually had been looking sector
by sector but also country by country at

00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979
by sector but also country by country at
 

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:16.790

the degree to which finance as a sector

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800
the degree to which finance as a sector
 

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.179
the degree to which finance as a sector
had become dead linked to different

00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:20.189
had become dead linked to different
 

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:22.309
had become dead linked to different
areas that we know actually caused

00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319
areas that we know actually caused
 

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.769

long-term growth not short-term kind of

00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:24.779
long-term growth not short-term kind of
 

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:27.739
long-term growth not short-term kind of
speculative growth and my first kind of

00:08:27.739 --> 00:08:27.749
speculative growth and my first kind of
 

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:30.110
speculative growth and my first kind of
question in my head was is this really

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120
question in my head was is this really
 

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.990
question in my head was is this really
just about these particular banks or is

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000
just about these particular banks or is
 

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.360
just about these particular banks or is
that actually about the financing model

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:35.370
that actually about the financing model
 

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.959
that actually about the financing model
of how the sector had again become

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:38.969
of how the sector had again become
 

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:41.269
of how the sector had again become
delinked but also the relationship

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279
delinked but also the relationship
 

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.300
delinked but also the relationship
between finance and actually how

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.310
between finance and actually how
 

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.110
between finance and actually how
companies themselves were

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120
companies themselves were
 

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.200
companies themselves were
being a if you want incentivized so this

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.210
being a if you want incentivized so this
 

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.340
being a if you want incentivized so this
whole issue around corporate governance

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.350
whole issue around corporate governance
 

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.810
whole issue around corporate governance
which I'm sure will come back to before

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:52.820
which I'm sure will come back to before
 

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.700
which I'm sure will come back to before
but the big question for me when I was

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:54.710
but the big question for me when I was
 

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.829
but the big question for me when I was
sort of seeing it sort of play out on

00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839
sort of seeing it sort of play out on
 

00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:59.380
sort of seeing it sort of play out on
television was this is bigger than just

00:08:59.380 --> 00:08:59.390

the banks how long will it take for the

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:01.730
the banks how long will it take for the
 

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.570
the banks how long will it take for the
conversation to move on and in fact I

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:04.580
conversation to move on and in fact I
 

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.700
conversation to move on and in fact I
think it took a very long time for it to

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:06.710
think it took a very long time for it to
 

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.370
think it took a very long time for it to
be a bigger question for too long I

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:09.380
be a bigger question for too long I
 

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.170
be a bigger question for too long I
think and partly that was why I don't

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:11.180
think and partly that was why I don't
 

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.940
think and partly that was why I don't
think we've reached the point where we

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:12.950
think we've reached the point where we
 

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.829
think we've reached the point where we
should be at too long it remained a

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:16.900
should be at too long it remained a

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.610
question of finance how do you reform
finance versus how do you actually

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:18.620
finance versus how do you actually
 

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.950
finance versus how do you actually
reform the system in which finance

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:20.960
reform the system in which finance
 

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.690
reform the system in which finance
should be kind of central in terms of

you've given it the diagnosis quite a
 

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.500
you've given it the diagnosis quite a
lot of diagnoses of why the economy's is

where it is give us just two solutions
that could pull us out of the situation

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:20.970
that could pull us out of the situation

that could pull us out of the situation
we find us in well the first is and this

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:24.630
we find us in well the first is and this

is sort of a separate what just then as
a continuation of what I just said so

a continuation of what I just said so
 

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.520
a continuation of what I just said so
it's more logical we need to define an

economy there also has to be incentives
 

00:37:34.289 --> 00:37:35.960
economy there also has to be incentives
for that currently we actually have

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:35.970
for that currently we actually have
 

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.690
for that currently we actually have
incentives which reward companies which

those that actually invest in the long
 

00:37:43.049 --> 00:37:45.049
those that actually invest in the long
run so something like capital gains tax

00:37:45.049 --> 00:37:45.059
run so something like capital gains tax
 

00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:46.370
run so something like capital gains tax
and this was actually labor in this

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380
and this was actually labor in this
 

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.109
and this was actually labor in this
country that did this capital gains

really not very smart if you actually

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:00.990
really not very smart if you actually

opportunities for those investments and
 

00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:18.079
opportunities for those investments and
hence we need really smart and strategic

some of the underpinning problems that
 

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.180
some of the underpinning problems that
were there so for example that said that

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:09.190
were there so for example that said that
 

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.809

00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280
actually had as many positive effects as
 

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.050
actually had as many positive effects as
you may have hoped for or to go back to

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:02.060
you may have hoped for or to go back to
 

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.200
you may have hoped for or to go back to
Marianas point has in fact yes you saved

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:05.210
Marianas point has in fact yes you saved
 

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.150
Marianas point has in fact yes you saved
the banks but actually the money just

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160
the banks but actually the money just
 

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.100
the banks but actually the money just
went into the banks to saving them and

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.110
went into the banks to saving them and
 

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.830
went into the banks to saving them and
really promote this type of economic

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:11.840
really promote this type of economic
 

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.320
really promote this type of economic
reform for real people that might have

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:14.330
reform for real people that might have
 

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:17.200
reform for real people that might have
been expected no I think the measures

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:17.210
been expected no I think the measures
 

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.090
been expected no I think the measures
that were taken were necessary but they

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:19.100
that were taken were necessary but they
 

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.670
that were taken were necessary but they
weren't sufficient and I think if you

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680
weren't sufficient and I think if you
 

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.740
weren't sufficient and I think if you
look it's very important to distinguish

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:23.750
look it's very important to distinguish
 

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.770
look it's very important to distinguish
between incomes and wealth here they're

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:26.780
between incomes and wealth here they're
 

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.110
between incomes and wealth here they're
different phenomena so if we take the

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:29.120
different phenomena so if we take the
 

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.910
different phenomena so if we take the
figures that Torsten mention which are

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920
figures that Torsten mention which are
 

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.820
figures that Torsten mention which are
really quite extraordinary about how the

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:33.830
really quite extraordinary about how the
 

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.220
really quite extraordinary about how the
age at which people become homeowners

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:36.230
age at which people become homeowners
 

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.560
age at which people become homeowners
has risen so dramatically in such a

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:38.570
has risen so dramatically in such a
 

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.410
has risen so dramatically in such a
short period of time I think that is

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:41.420
short period of time I think that is
 

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.110
short period of time I think that is
entirely accounted for by the fact that

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:44.120
entirely accounted for by the fact that
 

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.320
entirely accounted for by the fact that
long-term real interest rates have

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:47.330
long-term real interest rates have
 

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.720
long-term real interest rates have
fallen to such low levels that house

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:49.730
fallen to such low levels that house
 

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.790
fallen to such low levels that house
prices relative to incomes have reached

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800
prices relative to incomes have reached
 

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.430
prices relative to incomes have reached
extraordinarily high levels that was an

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440
extraordinarily high levels that was an
 

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.430
extraordinarily high levels that was an
almost mechanical consequence of very

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440
almost mechanical consequence of very
 

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.800
almost mechanical consequence of very
low interest rates now the consequence

00:44:59.800 --> 00:44:59.810
low interest rates now the consequence
 

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:03.040
low interest rates now the consequence
is that people in my generation found

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:03.050
is that people in my generation found
 

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.380
is that people in my generation found
that on paper at least we seemed much

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:05.390
that on paper at least we seemed much
 

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.150
that on paper at least we seemed much
wealthier because our houses are worse

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160
wealthier because our houses are worse
 

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.400
wealthier because our houses are worse
phenomenal amounts of money because not

clear you can do anything with this

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:10.730
clear you can do anything with this
 

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.640

nevertheless it means that younger

people cannot borrow the money to become

homeowners
 

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.120

now the point about this is that as

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:22.130
now the point about this is that as
 

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.310
now the point about this is that as
interest rates go back to normal levels

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:24.320
interest rates go back to normal levels
 

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.890
interest rates go back to normal levels
which I hope over 5-10 years they will

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:26.900
which I hope over 5-10 years they will
 

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.470
which I hope over 5-10 years they will
then that situation will reverse and

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480
then that situation will reverse and
 

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.230
then that situation will reverse and
house prices will fall relative to

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240
house prices will fall relative to
 

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.480
house prices will fall relative to
incomes in other words we may be in for

incomes in other words we may be in for
 

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.820
incomes in other words we may be in for
a long period of very stagnant house

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:36.830
a long period of very stagnant house
 

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:40.120
a long period of very stagnant house
prices and the new young in 20 years

time will actually be just as well off

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:42.380
time will actually be just as well off
 

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.160
time will actually be just as well off
as I was in my generation it's the

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:45.170
as I was in my generation it's the
 

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.260
as I was in my generation it's the
current generation that will lose out

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:47.270
current generation that will lose out
 

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.780
current generation that will lose out
they will have bought houses if they had

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:49.790
they will have bought houses if they had
 

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:51.760
they will have bought houses if they had
been able to do at the peak and they'll

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:51.770
been able to do at the peak and they'll
 

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:54.190
been able to do at the peak and they'll
be selling them at the trough so that's

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200
be selling them at the trough so that's
 

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.460
be selling them at the trough so that's
the wealth aspect which I think time and

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:57.470
the wealth aspect which I think time and
 

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:59.460
the wealth aspect which I think time and
higher interest rates will resolve

00:45:59.460 --> 00:45:59.470
higher interest rates will resolve
 

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.590
higher interest rates will resolve
incomes is a different issue because

incomes is a different issue because

where we would have expected it to be at

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:14.300
where we would have expected it to be at
 

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.920
where we would have expected it to be at
the beginning of 2007 by now and I don't

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:17.930
the beginning of 2007 by now and I don't
 

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.410
the beginning of 2007 by now and I don't
think that is something which is easy to

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:21.420
think that is something which is easy to
 

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.470
think that is something which is easy to
change without greater cooperation in

change without greater cooperation in
 

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.049
change without greater cooperation in
the world economy to get back to a more

the world economy to get back to a more
 

00:46:27.059 --> 00:46:29.390
the world economy to get back to a more
balanced structure I I don't want to

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400
balanced structure I I don't want to
 

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.609

deny that the issues that Mariana raised

00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619
deny that the issues that Mariana raised
 

00:46:31.619 --> 00:46:33.470
deny that the issues that Mariana raised
aren't important they are but

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480
aren't important they are but
 

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.049
aren't important they are but
nevertheless this big gap between where

00:46:36.049 --> 00:46:36.059
nevertheless this big gap between where
 

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:38.089
nevertheless this big gap between where
we should be and where we are is I think

00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099
we should be and where we are is I think
 

00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:40.490
we should be and where we are is I think
directly the result of the fact that we

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500
directly the result of the fact that we
 

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.130
directly the result of the fact that we
failed to deal with the structural

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140
failed to deal with the structural
 

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.809
failed to deal with the structural
imbalances in the world economy this is

00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819
imbalances in the world economy this is
 

00:46:44.819 --> 00:46:47.359
imbalances in the world economy this is
a macroeconomic issue and we have to get

00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:47.369
a macroeconomic issue and we have to get
 

00:46:47.369 --> 00:46:49.430
a macroeconomic issue and we have to get
that sorted out and I think the

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440
that sorted out and I think the
 

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.620
that sorted out and I think the
unfortunate thing was that whereas in

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:51.630
unfortunate thing was that whereas in
 

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:56.210
unfortunate thing was that whereas in
2008 2009 central banks were absolutely

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220
2008 2009 central banks were absolutely
 

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.510
2008 2009 central banks were absolutely
at the you know key point of dealing

00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520
at the you know key point of dealing
 

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.329
at the you know key point of dealing
with this crisis people then thought how

00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339
with this crisis people then thought how
 

00:47:02.339 --> 00:47:04.490
with this crisis people then thought how
all central banks can do miracles and

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:04.500
all central banks can do miracles and
 

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.240
all central banks can do miracles and
they are the only game in town actually

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:08.250
they are the only game in town actually
 

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.579
they are the only game in town actually
the role of central banks should have

00:47:10.579 --> 00:47:10.589
the role of central banks should have
 

00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:13.880
the role of central banks should have
been diminished from you know 2011 and

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:13.890
been diminished from you know 2011 and
 

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:17.059
been diminished from you know 2011 and
12 onwards and the policy responses

00:47:17.059 --> 00:47:17.069
12 onwards and the policy responses
 

00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:19.630
12 onwards and the policy responses
should have been focused on other issues

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640
should have been focused on other issues
 

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.400
should have been focused on other issues
but as I say I don't think any one

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:22.410
but as I say I don't think any one
 

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.079
but as I say I don't think any one
country would have found it easy to get

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:24.089
country would have found it easy to get
 

00:47:24.089 --> 00:47:25.579
country would have found it easy to get
out of this on its own and they haven't

00:47:25.579 --> 00:47:25.589
out of this on its own and they haven't
 

00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:27.650
out of this on its own and they haven't
but I mean we've been talking about

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.660
but I mean we've been talking about
 

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.970
but I mean we've been talking about
structurally global structural

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980
structurally global structural

don't want to give up being saver

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:33.540
don't want to give up being saver
 

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.839
don't want to give up being saver
countries and debtor comp countries are

then stuck being debtor countries and

then stuck being debtor countries and
there is never any structural movement

there is never any structural movement

cases now what's happening right now is

00:54:59.610 --> 00:54:59.620
cases now what's happening right now is
 

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.200
cases now what's happening right now is
a big experiment actually this area

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:01.210
a big experiment actually this area
 

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.400
a big experiment actually this area
because in Britain what we're about to

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:02.410
because in Britain what we're about to
 

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:05.460
because in Britain what we're about to
do is significantly reduce our input of

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:05.470
do is significantly reduce our input of
 

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:08.220
do is significantly reduce our input of
low paid labour and we're putting up the

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:08.230
low paid labour and we're putting up the
 

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:09.490
low paid labour and we're putting up the
price of

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:09.500
price of
 

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.560
price of
paid labor the earnings inequality in

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:11.570
paid labor the earnings inequality in
 

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.420
paid labor the earnings inequality in
Britain is falling quite significantly

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:13.430
Britain is falling quite significantly
 

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:14.860
Britain is falling quite significantly
in the moment because of the National

living wage the minimum wage is rising

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400
living wage the minimum wage is rising
 

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.760
living wage the minimum wage is rising
fast and everybody else is basically

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:18.770
fast and everybody else is basically
 

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:20.830
fast and everybody else is basically
flat yeah so earnings inequalities for

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:20.840
flat yeah so earnings inequalities for
 

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.450
flat yeah so earnings inequalities for
overall inner court is not falling but

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:22.460
overall inner court is not falling but
 

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.460
overall inner court is not falling but
earnings of equality is falling and for

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:24.470
earnings of equality is falling and for
 

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:25.990

the labour market that combined with

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000
the labour market that combined with
 

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.720
the labour market that combined with
falling migration is a huge huge change

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:28.730
falling migration is a huge huge change
 

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:30.580
falling migration is a huge huge change
and that is actually what is more likely

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:30.590
and that is actually what is more likely
 

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:31.660
and that is actually what is more likely
I think it's more likely that the

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:31.670
I think it's more likely that the
 

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:34.090
I think it's more likely that the
minimum wage higher wages will push

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:34.100
minimum wage higher wages will push
 

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.890
minimum wage higher wages will push

isn't productivity and the misspending
 

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.999
isn't productivity and the misspending
or the productivity dividend is to do

01:08:02.999 --> 01:08:03.009
or the productivity dividend is to do
 

01:08:03.009 --> 01:08:05.970
or the productivity dividend is to do
with those who own assets on the right

01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:05.980
with those who own assets on the right
 

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.430
with those who own assets on the right
or center of wealth distribution and

and then the second point connect to
this is this really dangerous idea about

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:16.869

was when the Soviet Union broke up and

we thought that rising mortality was a

so on we have it here in the United

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320
so on we have it here in the United
 

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.740
so on we have it here in the United
States and it's coming to the UK with

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:03.750
States and it's coming to the UK with
 

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:05.630
