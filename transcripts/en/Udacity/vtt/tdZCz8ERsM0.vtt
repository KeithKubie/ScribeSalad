00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If we want to make our program faster effectively,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we'd better concentrate on the eval function,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because that's taking up about 47 out of our 75 seconds or about 63% of our time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The problem is that eval is a built-in function.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We can't go editing eval to try to make it faster,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but if we can't touch eval itself,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the only choices we have are we could make fewer calls to eval.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We call it fewer times. We'll spend less time in it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Or we can make easier calls to eval.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Pass it an argument that's easier for it to evaluate.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's concentrate on easier first.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Do you see a way to break up the problem of evaluating a formula

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
into smaller pieces in such a way that we could make the resulting program, say,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
10 times faster.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What do I mean by making it easier or breaking it up into pieces?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We could do eval of ODD plus ODD and then do eval of EVEN

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and do those separately rather than do them all together in one equation.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Of course, I'd probably substitute in the numbers here rather than eval the letters themselves.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That might be one way of breaking it up into smaller pieces.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Often this idea of divide and conquer is a good idea for program design.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Do you think that that approach would work here to make the calls to eval

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
easier so that we could cut down on this 47 second execution time.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Yes or no?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I guess this is an matter of opinion. You might have some ideas.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I might have different ideas, so don't worry if you agree with me too much,

00:01:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but think about it and give me your answer.
