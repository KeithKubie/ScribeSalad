00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.189
- [Voiceover] This is the
third in a series of videos

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.269
about answering the
document based question,

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.709
or DBQ on the AP U.S. History Exam.

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.629
In the last video, we
started taking a look

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.219
at and analyzing some of the primary

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.852
documents provided for this exam.

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:20.572
So the first one was a folk saying about

00:00:20.572 --> 00:00:23.352
how the boll weevil and sharecropping

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:25.212
had taken away African-American's

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:27.592
crops and homes in the South.

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:29.432
The second was a letter from a black man

00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:33.252
living in New Orleans
asking the black newspaper

00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:36.572
The Chicago Defender, to
help in finding him a house

00:00:36.572 --> 00:00:38.512
and a job in Chicago.

00:00:38.512 --> 00:00:42.732
The third was an article
in an industrial journal

00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:45.672
counseling white factory
owners in the North

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:49.572
to segregate black workers
from white workers.

00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:51.792
And the fourth, was an article

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:55.012
in a white owned newspaper talking

00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:58.232
about race riots in Chicago, and how

00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:00.232
African-Americans were better off

00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:02.192
in the South, because they felt

00:01:02.192 --> 00:01:04.562
that lynch law was better than

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:06.378
being killed in a race riot.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:08.278
So there are three more documents

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:10.118
that we'll go through pretty quickly

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:11.418
and then we can get started on

00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:13.338
writing a thesis statement.

00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:19.058
Okay, this is a song
by an African-American

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:22.078
singer named Lizzie Miles, and the

00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:26.278
song is called Cotton
Belt Blues from 1923.

00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:27.998
Now I'm not going to attempt to sing this,

00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:29.458
'cause you do not want to hear that,

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:32.906
but let's get a gist of what it's about.

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:36.006
Look at me, look at me, and you see a gal

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:38.686
with a heart bogged down with woe

00:01:38.686 --> 00:01:42.106
because I'm all alone,
far from my Southern home.

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:44.566
Dixie Dan, that's the man, took me from

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.966
the Land of Cotton to that
cold, cold minded North.

00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:50.706
Threw me down, hit the town,and I've

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:52.886
never seen him henceforth.

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:55.306
Just 'cause I trusted,
I'm broke and disgusted

00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:59.046
I got the Cotton Belt Blues.

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:01.506
Well, it definitely seems like she has

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:05.506
experienced the kind of con man behavior

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:08.866
that the man in document
two was worried about.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.666
So, she's saying that she was fooled into

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:15.966
coming up North for a man who has

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:18.366
now left her alone.

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:21.766
And she misses her home in the South.

00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:31.126
But you could also think about
the fact that she herself

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:32.238
if we've got the lyrics to this song,

00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:35.498
and this recording,
probably did pretty well.

00:02:35.498 --> 00:02:38.538
So, this is more maybe of
an expression of popular

00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:43.198
culture, and less of a particular story

00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:45.845
about this person Lizzie Miles.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.105
So we could talk about
the influence of Jazz

00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:52.705
the fact that African-American's
came to the North

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:56.425
and influenced popular culture.

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:01.785
Alright, we're getting
down to the end of these.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:04.305
Let's look at document six.

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:06.245
Alright, this document is from an

00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:10.305
African-American journalist
named George Schuyler

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:13.605
whose writing in a magazine
called The Messenger

00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:16.105
which was a political
and literary magazine

00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:17.785
for African-Americans.

00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:21.365
So, he's writing for a
sympathetic audience.

00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:25.185
This is in August of 1925.

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:27.645
Schuyler says "It is generally thought by

00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:30.245
both Negroes and whites
that Negroes are the

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:33.865
chief strikebreakers in
the United States. This is

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:37.265
far from the truth. The Negroe
workers' part in strikes

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:41.265
has been dramatized by virtue
of the striking contrast

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:45.145
of race which invariably
provoked race riots.

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.425
But the fact is, there are many more scabs

00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:51.325
among the white than black workers.

00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:53.065
Partially because there are numerous

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:56.045
industries in which Negroes
are not permitted to work.

00:03:56.045 --> 00:04:00.745
Which too, are by no means 100% organized.

00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:02.645
Out of 20 or more millions of workers in

00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:06.605
the United States, less than
five million are organized.

00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:08.965
Note the potential for scabs."

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:10.705
So one thing you definitely
have to know here

00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:13.625
is what the word "scab" means.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:17.605
So "scab", I think you can
kind of tell from the context

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:22.045
means strikebreaker, so
if a union goes on strike

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:26.765
a factory owner might hire
scabs or replacement workers

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.505
to try to break the strike.

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:31.725
So Schuyler is saying
there is a perception

00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:34.445
that black workers are often used to break

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:39.325
strikes or that when a white labor union

00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:41.945
would go on strike, the factory owner

00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:45.245
might then hire black
workers, who of course

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:47.625
are going to have difficulty finding jobs

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.825
in a segregated economy, and therefore

00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:54.825
they don't have to pay
the white workers more.

00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:57.445
And Schuyler says that this is not true

00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:00.425
it's actually just that
African-Americans are

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.905
so frequently barred from
industries, that they

00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:06.805
can't be represented in
strikes because they're

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:09.145
not represented in
unions, or the places that

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:11.625
employ unionized workers.

00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:13.225
Okay, last one.

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:14.625
This one is a map, and
I'm just going to put

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:16.525
it right here in front of everything,

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:18.545
because it's pretty large and if

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:19.965
we made it any smaller it would be

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:21.445
really hard to see.

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:23.445
So when you're looking at maps like this,

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:26.145
the first thing you want
to do is read the title.

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:28.285
Because that way you know what this map

00:05:28.285 --> 00:05:30.245
is actually trying to show you, and you're

00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:32.105
not just making assumptions
of what it could

00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:33.725
be trying to show you.

00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:35.565
So this map is about the distribution of

00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:40.265
the African-American
population in Chicago in 1930.

00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:42.225
What you can see here,
are that the sections

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:45.285
that are not shaded at
all, or shaded white

00:05:45.285 --> 00:05:49.205
are less than one percent
African-American population.

00:05:49.205 --> 00:05:51.445
The light grey is one to ten percent.

00:05:51.445 --> 00:05:53.805
The medium grey is 10 - 50%

00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:57.925
and then this dark grey is
more than 15% African-American.

00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.605
And now what you can see here is that

00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:03.325
it looks like there is a very,
definite African-American

00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:06.185
neighborhood on the South side of Chicago.

00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:09.430
Which, I think goes to show that

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.969
there's some real segregation
happening in Chicago.

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.669
And you can see here at the bottom,

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.289
it tells you, how many
African-Americans were

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.829
living in Chicago over
the 1910 - 1930 period.

00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:28.869
And even though the
share of the population

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:31.469
more than triples in that time period,

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:36.469
everyone is set in this one small area.

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:38.749
So I think that goes to show that

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:43.249
even if you were a Southerner
who moved to Chicago

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.629
looking for a better life
as an African-American

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:50.569
you might still be subject
to this system of segregation

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.569
that would only allow you
to live in one neighborhood.

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.489
But there might also be a
positive flip side to that.

00:06:56.489 --> 00:07:00.729
Which would be that this was
a thriving black community.

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.569
If you were a Southerner who had lived

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:06.569
in a relatively rural
place, you may not have

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:08.909
been able to spend that much time

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:11.749
with other African-Americans
as a young person.

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:14.489
So that's a possible
positive interpretation,

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:16.689
but we'll keep that one
the table just in case

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.609
it might help us with
part of our argument.

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:29.709
Alright, now we've read
all of the documents

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:31.809
and as we get started
on our thesis statement

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:34.069
I think one of the most
useful things you can do

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:36.949
is just take a moment and brain-storm some

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.349
of the themes have arisen
in these documents.

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:43.649
So what themes do we see here?

00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:48.049
Well, I think that there's definitely

00:07:48.049 --> 00:07:52.419
a theme about labor in general

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:55.849
not being able to do well under a

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:58.669
sharecropping system of labor

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:02.189
and looking for a good job.

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:04.269
And several things about factory work

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:08.419
whether factories should be segregated

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:10.139
or whether African-Americans play

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:12.839
a part in the labor movement in general

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:17.379
or if they work against
unions by being scabs.

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:22.359
I think there's definitely
a theme of segregation

00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:26.379
or living patterns.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:29.279
We saw that in the map,
and we also saw that

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:32.549
in some of the documents

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.019
about segregated work places.

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:39.663
And there might also be just
kind of a cultural theme here

00:08:39.663 --> 00:08:42.303
about the differences between life

00:08:42.303 --> 00:08:45.183
in the North and in the South.

00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:48.903
We see that when our
newspaper letter writer

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.783
says he's worried about being hoodwinked,

00:08:51.783 --> 00:08:55.543
and we see that when our Jazz singer

00:08:55.543 --> 00:08:59.904
talks about she was
fooled and left behind.

00:08:59.904 --> 00:09:02.523
We might even see that
with our perceptions

00:09:02.523 --> 00:09:06.583
of black neighborhood life,
that African-Americans

00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:10.283
may have gone from a system
of living very separately

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:13.143
in the South, to living in a very dense,

00:09:13.143 --> 00:09:14.923
urban cultural area.

00:09:14.923 --> 00:09:16.623
Where they may have met many different

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:19.663
African-Americans from all
different parts of the country.

00:09:19.663 --> 00:09:22.323
I think another useful thing for us to do

00:09:22.323 --> 00:09:25.063
is to think about some of
the major historical events

00:09:25.063 --> 00:09:27.163
going on at that time period, that

00:09:27.163 --> 00:09:30.243
we can connect to these documents.

00:09:30.243 --> 00:09:34.183
A big one that comes to
mind is the great migration,

00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:37.224
which we mentioned before.

00:09:37.224 --> 00:09:42.223
Which was a period in
the early 20th century

00:09:42.223 --> 00:09:44.703
when many Southern African-American's

00:09:44.703 --> 00:09:47.443
pretty much had had it
with life in the South.

00:09:47.443 --> 00:09:49.203
It was a combination of Jim Crow

00:09:49.203 --> 00:09:51.543
segregation being legalized.

00:09:51.543 --> 00:09:55.443
And also sharply declining
economic opportunities

00:09:55.443 --> 00:09:58.824
that led thousands of
African-Americans to pack up

00:09:58.824 --> 00:10:01.403
and head for Northern cities.

00:10:01.403 --> 00:10:03.463
Now on of the reasons
that they could do this,

00:10:03.463 --> 00:10:06.683
is because World War I was creating many

00:10:06.683 --> 00:10:08.904
new factory jobs, just the way that

00:10:08.904 --> 00:10:11.083
World War II would do later on.

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:14.163
And so there were many new
opportunities in the North

00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:17.293
to draw African-Americans away to new

00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:19.404
and even better paying jobs.

00:10:19.404 --> 00:10:21.224
What else happened in this time period?

00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:24.024
Well, there was the Supreme Court ruling

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:26.473
Plessy v. Ferguson,

00:10:26.473 --> 00:10:31.473
which legalized segregation in 1896.

00:10:31.493 --> 00:10:34.453
Which said that separate but equal

00:10:34.453 --> 00:10:37.793
accommodations were constitutional.

00:10:37.793 --> 00:10:42.133
The 1910s and 1920s
were times of increasing

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:47.133
modernity, but also a time of
cultural and racial backlash

00:10:47.453 --> 00:10:50.073
as many new immigrants
streamed into the cities

00:10:50.073 --> 00:10:52.353
along with African-Americans
from the South.

00:10:52.353 --> 00:10:55.493
So there was also a
resurgence in the Ku Klux Klan

00:10:55.493 --> 00:10:58.593
at this time period, which
President Woodrow Wilson

00:10:58.593 --> 00:11:01.833
even kind of tacitly
approved of by watching

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:05.433
the film Birth of a
Nation in the White House.

00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:07.093
And we might even talk about the

00:11:07.093 --> 00:11:10.713
Chicago race riot of 1919

00:11:10.713 --> 00:11:14.773
which is the race riot
mentioned in document four

00:11:14.773 --> 00:11:17.713
when and you might even
mention the Chicago

00:11:17.713 --> 00:11:22.433
race riot of 1919 which
was one of the deadliest

00:11:22.433 --> 00:11:26.013
race riots in American history.

00:11:26.013 --> 00:11:29.313
And this is the race riot that's
mentioned in document four

00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:31.333
kind of gloatingly.

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:34.353
Alright, so we've identified
these three themes

00:11:34.353 --> 00:11:36.333
that we might discuss in our essay.

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:41.233
Now the essay itself is about
changes and continuities.

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:42.693
So for each of these three things,

00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:44.793
was there change over this time period

00:11:44.793 --> 00:11:46.853
or was there continuity?

00:11:46.853 --> 00:11:48.933
Well in labor you could say there's maybe

00:11:48.933 --> 00:11:52.773
a change in type of labor.

00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:55.884
But maybe many of the same problems

00:11:55.884 --> 00:11:57.824
of race around labor.

00:12:01.364 --> 00:12:02.944
Alright what about segregation?

00:12:02.944 --> 00:12:05.344
Well I think there's both
segregation in the North

00:12:05.344 --> 00:12:09.504
and in the South, but
again, it's kind of a

00:12:09.504 --> 00:12:12.024
difference of type and degree.

00:12:12.024 --> 00:12:15.944
So, segregation still exists in the North

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:19.066
but now it's taken on this urban form

00:12:19.066 --> 00:12:20.986
where there are majority
black neighborhoods

00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:22.195
and then other neighborhoods where

00:12:22.195 --> 00:12:24.495
there are no African-Americans at all.

00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:25.815
So a different type.

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:30.755
Alright, what about cultural changes?

00:12:30.755 --> 00:12:33.115
We could see that in some cases,

00:12:33.115 --> 00:12:35.595
African-Americans who moved North

00:12:35.595 --> 00:12:38.890
missed their old society.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.250
But then again, they certainly had

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.230
many problems when they were in the South.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.870
Singing songs about how the boll weevil

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.530
and sharecropping had caused feelings

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.790
of dislocation and poverty.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.370
So I think if there is a thesis statement

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.390
to be gotten out of this, it's that moving

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.110
from the South to the North,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.335
African-Americans in the period from

00:13:10.335 --> 00:13:14.875
1910 to 1930, experience pretty much

00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:16.855
the same problems, but they

00:13:16.855 --> 00:13:18.055
took different forms.

00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:25.959
In the next video, I'll
talk about how we can turn

00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:29.399
that into a really beautiful
and robust thesis statement

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:31.079
And then we'll go through the process

00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:33.329
of outlining this essay.
