Ever wonder why both coffee and alcohol have the unfortunate tendency to make you pee?

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.669
Well aside from the fact that you may have been binge drinking both of these substances

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.129
Hopefully not at the same time. There are actually some simple biological processes at work when nature decides to call.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.549
Your pituitary gland which resides the base of the brain controls the release of a hormone known as antidiuretic hormone.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.439
Or ADH for short. ADH is secreted by the pituitary gland enters the bloodstream and is then carried to the kidney the kidney

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.809
among other things is responsible for monitoring

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.020
How much water is in your body and whether or not you can afford to get rid of it

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.070
In times of dehydration  ADH is responsible for retaining water in your body by inducing the production of aquaporins in the kidney

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.788
Aquaporins are proteins embedded in the kidneys cell membrane that regulate the flow of water in this case allowing water to be reabsorbed back into

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.389
The body so the less water you've got more adh which means greater production of aquaporins and more water reabsorbed

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.070
So instead of letting it out

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.480
You keep it in. Think of it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.399
Like a glass of water when you're really thirsty

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.389
The aquaporins act like a straw and allow for the water to flow back into your body. More straws equals more water reabsorbed

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.580
So what does ADH have to do with caffeine or alcohol?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.549
Well, both caffeine and alcohol inhibit the release of ADH by the pituitary gland and as a result the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.839
Aquaporins are not created to reabsorb water and the amount of water in your pee increases

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.140
This explains why once you've had your morning coffee or at least a couple beers on the patio a pee break is usually soon followed

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.709
In the case of alcohol this inhibition of adh unfortunately contributes to something known as a damn hangover this also explains

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.369
Why urine can seem clear during consumption and look like Tropicana orange juice the next morning. Are you sure you want coffee Frank?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.640
That's better

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.640
(music)

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.640
