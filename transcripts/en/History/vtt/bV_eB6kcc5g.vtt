00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.100
10 to 15 bees sting me.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.170

They stung me by six

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.500
Or by my eyeball,
right above my eye.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.430
It closed my eyeball up.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.170

my brain a little bit.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.030
I don't know.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.000
It's already damaged.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.130

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.530
Oh come on, Shelby.

Whoa!
Come on.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.170
Seriously?

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.500
SHELBY: [laughs] We got

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.970
WOMAN: That's how you
get it done, right?

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.330
Just straight up danger.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.470
SHELBY: That's how

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.800

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.970
That's a damn

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.200
Log to it.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.700
Are you asking me?

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.370
Put that on the
bit back there.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.100
It's outta here.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.870
Always pass up the
good, man, by going

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.530
to the damn store and shopping.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.630
Find it drifting.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.730
That's some good [bleep], man.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.000
I've been doing it since
I was little bitty.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.370
This is gonna be

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.300
Oh, my god.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.970
It looks like you vomited

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.870
Son of a bitch, man!

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.900
You asked me to spit in it.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.100
You didn't say how much.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.170
Want me to do it again?

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.730
No, I don't want
you to do it no more.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.630
Boys, did you see it?

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.070

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.630
She vomited in the
son of a bitch.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.000
How do you have that much spit?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.400
[laughs]

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.200
