00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.740
&gt;&gt; So at the beginning of this lesson I

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.760
joked with Matt that he was reading the first book

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.740
in the Game of Thrones series. But imagine that this

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.410
book instead was filled with the entire human genome sequence.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.500
&gt;&gt; Wow I know that's a lot of letters, but so is the first book

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.440
in the Game of Thrones series. I think it has like 300,000 words in it.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.530
&gt;&gt; Well, let's say on average each word has about five letters give or take.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.720
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.910
&gt;&gt; And the human genome sequence has 3 billion letters.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.600
How many books do you think it would take to

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.250
fill the entire 3 billion letter human genome sequence? Just

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.240
one genome. Now don't worry if you don't know the

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.450
exact math or the exact number, but give me an estimate.
