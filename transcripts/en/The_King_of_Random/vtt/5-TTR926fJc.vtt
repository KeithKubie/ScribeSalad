More

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:03.280
holy bright

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.650
Hey guys, welcome back to the workshop

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.079
We've got another fun experiment using glow sticks today

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.469
And it involves combining the glow stick fluid with this decorative fountain it might not be too hard to guess

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.608
But we're gonna see if we can extract enough glow fluid to put it into this fountain and actually have its cycle with glowing blue

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.539
Liquid so we have a whole ton of these glow sticks

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.149
We're gonna crack them open separate the two fluids within and then we'll put those into the fountain

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.648
I'm gonna try and separate it so one of them is in the base and the other one is in the little

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.090
Dishes up above so that as the fountain starts running it starts activating the glow. Hopefully we can get that to work

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.880
I think it would look really cool if it does

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.930
We've got a bunch of rocks right here

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
And these are actually what I'm going to put down in the base of this fountain

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.090
This base is actually what holds normally water in our case glow fluid

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.999
But it's pretty big and empty and that would use up a lot of glow sticks, and we already have a ton

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.939
But I wanted to cut down on the number that we would need so I'm gonna use these rocks to sort of fill the empty

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.339
Spaces of this base, so there's still enough fluid to cycle, but not so much that we're just wasting glow sticks

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.560
I also have these little rocks in a bag those are going to be a decorative element on top look

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.700
It's scattered all around the base

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.850
And I'm hoping it will help the fluid diffuse and the glow will like

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.389
Flow in between the rocks and make it look even cooler. Let's give it a shot

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.769
Let's start cutting open a whole bunch of glow sticks load our rocks into our fountain

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.219
Pour our glow fluid into the fountain and hopefully get a bright

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.889
Cascading glowing effect as we run the fluid through this fountain this should look really sweet

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.889
Alright that looks like it still goes on still in place our pump is still down inside the fountain

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.510
But we have displaced a lot of the volume, so we shouldn't need quite as much blow fluid however

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.760
I still believe it's going to take three or four cups of liquid to make this fountain be able to run

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.339
Now we get to cut these all open drain the fluid and hopefully have enough

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.860
To get our fountain working now. We've seen the reaction when we crack one of these glow sticks

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.600
But what exactly is going on inside there are four main chemicals that help create this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.310
Reaction over ninety percent of what's inside the glowsticks is a chemical called diethyl phthalate

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.369
The dimethyl palyed is mostly a stabilizer

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.500
That's used to help keep the other chemicals from going bad while sitting around in the glowstick the two primary

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.239
chemicals that are reacting with each other to create the glowing effect are hydrogen peroxide and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.929
tert-butyl alcohol the glowsticks will also contain a fluorescent

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.300
Dye, and there are a variety of chemicals that can be used depending on what color is desired (blue in this case)

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.190
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.849
We have now harvested the fluid out of about 50 glow sticks

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.129
That's what these four cupfuls of liquid are and now we have to get the fluid out of these glass pieces as well

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.200
We'll put those in a separate container so that they won't combine until they are running in the fountain

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.830
These are glass which I have to break to get the fluid out, so I'm trying to cover them

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.760
Crack them over the trashcan so we don't have little bits of glass that go everywhere

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.179
That one exploded most of them pop open that one exploded open

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.059
At this point we've got four clear plastic cup full of one fluid and

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.719
About one and a half of these squeeze bottles of the inside fluid this should be the stuff that adds the dye and this is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.309
The activator where you can see the color showing up in the dye if we hit it with a black light

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.759
Which it doesn't really do much to the activator at this point

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.230
It's time to take our activator fluid and put it in the base of the fountain and see if it looks like we're going to

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.230
Have enough to run this sucker

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.549
Here goes...

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.840
Think we are just there once we add the colored dye into the top bowls. I think we shouldn't have any problems with this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.570
Now let's add some pebbles down around the base

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.120
This fountain actually doesn't drain out of this bottom bolt the bottom bowl is plugged up by what's actually an LED and

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.780
We'll be adding a little bit of additional light not that we should probably need it

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:48.200
But it should spill up and over the edge and sort of around these pebbles

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.109
Which is why I'm hoping. They'll make it look extra good

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.750
There is a chance that because of the different ratio

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.809
I've got going with tons of activator and only a little bit of dye

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.959
It's not gonna be super bright at first, but as soon as it starts moving

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.720
I'll probably add a little bit more of the dye fluid into the fountain so it all gets going in circulation

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.899
Hopefully it worked pretty well. This is an experiment. I haven't done this before

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.630
Here we go three two one

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.470
Yeah, all that looks super good

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.440
Amazing Oh

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.460
Fantastic it's such good color in there

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:55.089
This is looking really sweet just to see what happens let's take some magenta colored dye and pour that into the top

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.629
Change it a little bit we have a little bit of a purple fluid flowing down now

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.559
It's not extreme, but it was only one magenta compared to like fifty blue. That's pretty neat

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.660
There is one more thing that I do want to try

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.450
We've seen what happens if we mix a little bit of dish soap

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.450
In with our Glo fluid and the result is that it starts glowing a lot more brightly just not for very long

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.210
so I'm going to try adding some into here and see what happens it might not mix very well until it gets down and

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.430
Pulled into the pump a little bit

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.820
But hopefully we can get a fountain that starts flowing a lot brighter

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.409
It's definitely brighter down here than it was up there. Oh, I think it's now getting pulled through

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.849
Looks to me like we're getting more brightness out of this thing. I don't have a good sense of how much to add really

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.039
This is a lot more fluid than just from one glow stick, but if you add too much

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.890
It will kill it a little bit of a gamble here

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.390
But I definitely think we saw an increase in the brightness a little whirlpool

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.529
We're a small spot bubbles is just circling in one spot. It's kind of funny

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.739
That doesn't look like a health potion from a video game. I don't know what does

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.680
Maybe that just means this is like a fountain of youth

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.009
You add more soap see if we can actually just kill it with all the soap

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.749
Seems to be able to handle a fair bit of soap, it's not dying

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.260
Maybe it is that does look a little dimmer. I think it's gone down

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:29.408
Lose really smoothly. I think part of the point of these fountains with water is that you get the nice trickling noises

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:35.528
But because this fluid is more oily and viscous. It doesn't really make trickling sounds you can hear the pump running

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.289
Near the pump running a lot right now

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:43.449
Which means I might have made the pump angry by filling it with thick things like oily glow fluid and soap

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:45.939
And we now have some bubbles

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:50.109
Starting to form at the top here and our pump is barely trickling

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.979
So I'm gonna say I've made our pump angry and unplug it now

00:07:55.159 --> 00:08:01.629
The glow fountain works entertainingly well we got some really cool bright colors that looked like something straight out of the movie Avatar

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:05.319
I think I really like to look and then of course adding soap it did get a lot brighter

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:11.229
And then I kept adding soap and now as you can see there's like nothing left. It's just drained out completely

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:15.188
It's very entertaining to watch the dynamic between the soap and the glow fluid

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:23.648
We want to hear your ideas for what else we should do with this glow fluid because it looks really cool

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:26.708
