00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is exponential.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose we resolve each variable at a granularity of 20 different values,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so there's 20 different values for x and 20 for y and 20 for Î¸.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then the joint table over all of those will be 20^N

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where N is the number of state dimensions.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That's an exponential expression.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There is unfortunately no easy way around it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The biggest disadvantage of the grid-based localization method

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or the histogram method is that the scale of memory is exponential,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which means it's not applicable to even problems with 6 dimensions,

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because you can't really allocate memory for 6 dimensions.
