00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Indeed, the answer is that you should understand what the problem is,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because if you don't understand what the problem is, how would you be able to fix it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Understand what the code should do because again if you don't know what the code should do,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you won't know how to fix it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And finally, also apply a fix that addresses the problem

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and not only the symptom but the actual cause.
