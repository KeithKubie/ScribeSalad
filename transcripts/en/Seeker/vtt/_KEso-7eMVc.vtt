00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.211
When I was in school people were obsessed
with who was or wasn't a virgin, and this

00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:06.970
one word was thrown around a lot, hymen.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.630
What is this mysterious membrane and does
it have anything to do with virginity?

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.250
Hello boys and girls, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.949
I taught Sex Ed in college, and I have to
say, no matter how prepared people may be,

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.890
our first time having sex inevitably has some
level of uncertainty.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.600
No matter your age, orientation, identity,
or sex.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.970
But virginity is a complicated topic.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.389
Some think there is a “right” or “wrong”
way to lose your virginity, or that the experience

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:38.409
will leave them physically or spiritually
‘transformed’.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.979
They'll be somehow different after they 'lose
their v-card.'

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.969
But, more importantly, in a first-time sexual
encounter, women often confront even more

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.640
unanswered questions, like: can someone get
pregnant on the first try?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640
Will sex hurt?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640
Will there be blood?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.879
Many, if not most, of the questions women
have about virginity focus on the hymen.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.250
That’s because culturally, a woman's virginity
is intrinsically tied to this mysterious membrane,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.789
which according to prevailing legend, breaks
and bleeds during first-time sexual intercourse.

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.460
In the good ol’ days, before scientists
knew exactly what was going during sex, many

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.080
newlyweds were expected to hand over bloody
bedsheets to their families after the wedding

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.000
night to prove that the marriage was, indeed,
consummated.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.399
This, of course, is super creepy and no longer
a cultural norm thank goodness - but the ideas

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.829
that reinforced it continue to prevail - that
is: a woman is a virgin until she ‘pops

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:27.829
her cherry’.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.479
That’s why we’re here to set the record
straight.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.329
Hymens are a thin membrane inside the opening
to a vagina.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.150
They are NOT sealed, so they CANNOT be ‘popped’
open, and therefore are not, scientifically,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.439
tied to virginity.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.842
And this makes a lot of sense because logically,
if all women had a built-in vaginal dam, how

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:47.960
would anything, namely menstrual blood, get
through?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.179
In reality, hymens are commonly shaped either
as a ring, or a crescent or half moon.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.200
Some are thicker and stiffer, some are thinner
and more stretchy.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.490
Often, when a women has sex for the first
time, the membrane can stretch or tear, but,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.229
more often than not, the hymen is already
stretched from other types of purposeful or

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.440
accidental penetration, like tampons, sex
toys, masturbation or even some forms of physical

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.500
activity, like horseback riding.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.239
This is why the presence or absence of the
hymen membrane is in no way related to virginity.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.459
That being said, vaginal bleeding after first-time
intercourse is normal - though, it happens

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.680
to fewer than half of all women - but again,
it’s not from a ‘pop’, but rather a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.170
‘tear’ in the membrane.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.540
This can occur when intercourse is too fast
or rough, or from insufficient lubrication.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.489
And when it does happen, it’s almost always
just minor bleeding called spotting.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.780
Hymen myths aside, many women still complain
that sex hurts the first time.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.440
According to Planned Parenthood, this occurs
because no two people are alike, and thus

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.740
neither are hymens.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.790
Some women have more of a hymen than others,
and that the best way to prevent initial pain

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.959
is to manually stretch the membrane over time.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.550
Some studies have suggested, however, that
this pain has little to do with the hymen,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.180
and more to do with a woman’s mental state.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.939
According to this idea, many women are culturally
conditioned to expect first-time sex to hurt.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:10.170
This can cause some women to tense their muscles,
causing the experience of intercourse will b unpleasant,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.840
and sometimes painful.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.880
That being said, there are a number of other
factors researchers say could cause pain,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.340
like vaginal tightness, irritation from birth
control or, in rare cases, local infections

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.340
or diseases.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.610
At this point we hope you understand that
a hymen has nothing to do with virginity.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.790
So, for women as well as men -- or however
you identify -- what does it mean to be a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.790
virgin?

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.010
There’s no one answer and scientifically,
no way to tell if someone is a virgin or not.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.709
Often it's social or cultural.

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.569
For example, some people define sex as strictly
as penis-in-vagina intercourse, but that excludes

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.040
a lot of the sexually active population.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.150
Many in the LGBT community, for example, have
never had vaginal intercourse, but do not

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.890
think of themselves as virgins.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.579
Everyone has their own definition of virginity,
and that’s ok.

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.290
The important thing to keep in mind is there’s
no “right” way to lose it.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.500
Just be safe and stay lubricated!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.100
So now that you know about virginity and hymens
- why do we even have sex?

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.420
Well, we have a video all about that here.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:42.930
Do you have other questions about your bodies?
