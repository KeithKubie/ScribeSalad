00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:09.437
Have you ever daydreamed
about traveling through time,

00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:13.119
perhaps fast forward in the centuries
and seeing the distant future?

00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:15.185
Well, time travel is possible,

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.639
and what's more, it's already been done.

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:18.934
Meet Sergei Krikalev,

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.726
the greatest time traveler
in human history.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.762
This Russian cosmonaut holds the record

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:26.349
for the most amount of time
spent orbiting our planet,

00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:30.061
a total of 803 days,
9 hours, and 39 minutes.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.457
During his stay in space,

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.357
he time traveled into his own future

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.520
by 0.02 seconds.

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:40.435
Traveling at 17,500 miles an hour,

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:43.456
he experienced an effect
known as time dilation,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.086
and one day the same effect

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.387
might make significant time travel
to the future commonplace.

00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:52.853
To see why moving faster through space
affects passage of time,

00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:55.008
we need to go back to the 1880s,

00:00:55.032 --> 00:00:56.413
when two American scientists,

00:00:56.437 --> 00:00:58.342
Albert Michelson and Edward Morley,

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.778
were trying to measure the effect
of the Earth's movement around the Sun

00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:03.096
on the speed of light.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.267
When a beam of light was moving
in the same direction as the Earth,

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:08.263
they expected the light to travel faster.

00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:10.920
And when the Earth was moving
in the opposite direction,

00:01:10.944 --> 00:01:12.871
they expected it to go slower.

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:14.856
But they found something very curious.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.381
The speed of light remained the same
no matter what the Earth was doing.

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:20.644
Two decades later,
Albert Einstein was thinking

00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:23.959
about the consequences
of that never-changing speed of light.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.321
And it was his conclusions,

00:01:25.345 --> 00:01:27.922
formulated in the theory
of special relativity,

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:30.764
that opened the door
into the world of time travel.

00:01:30.788 --> 00:01:32.515
Imagine a man named Jack,

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.563
standing in the middle
of a train carriage,

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.232
traveling at a steady speed.

00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:38.963
Jack's bored and starts bouncing
a ball up and down.

00:01:38.987 --> 00:01:42.035
What would Jill, standing on the platform,
see through the window

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:43.605
as the train whistles through?

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:46.570
Well, between Jack dropping the ball
and catching it again,

00:01:46.594 --> 00:01:49.653
Jill would have seen him move
slightly further down the track,

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.495
resulting in her seeing the ball
follow a triangular path.

00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:56.184
This means Jill sees the ball
travel further than Jack does

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:58.079
in the same time period.

00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:00.294
And because speed
is distance divided by time,

00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:02.840
Jill actually sees the ball move faster.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.712
But what if Jack's bouncing ball
is replaced with two mirrors

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:08.828
which bounce a beam of light between them?

00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:11.085
Jack still sees the beam dropping down

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.286
and Jill still sees the light beam
travel a longer distance,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.425
except this time Jack and Jill
cannot disagree on the speed

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.599
because the speed of light
remains the same no matter what.

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:24.464
And if the speed is the same
while the distance is different,

00:02:24.488 --> 00:02:26.998
this means the time taken
will be different as well.

00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:32.163
Thus, time must tick at different rates
for people moving relative to each other.

00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:34.806
Imagine that Jack and Jill
have highly accurate watches

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.021
that they synchronize
before Jack boards the train.

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:40.426
During the experiment,
Jack and Jill would each see

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.070
their own watch ticking normally.

00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:46.137
But if they meet up again later
to compare watches,

00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:48.327
less time would have
elapsed on Jack's watch,

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.557
balancing the fact that Jill saw
the light move further.

00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:54.051
This idea may sound crazy,

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.104
but like any good scientific theory,

00:02:56.128 --> 00:02:57.128
it can be tested.

00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.436
In the 1970s, scientists boarded a plane

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.521
with some super-accurate atomic clocks

00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:05.316
that were synchronized
with some others left on the ground.

00:03:06.188 --> 00:03:08.235
After the plane had
flown around the world,

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.260
the clocks on board
showed a different time

00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:11.578
from those left behind.

00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:14.727
Of course, at the speed
of trains and planes,

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:16.201
the effect is minuscule.

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:18.558
But the faster you go,
the more time dilates.

00:03:18.582 --> 00:03:21.152
For astronauts orbiting
the Earth for 800 days,

00:03:21.176 --> 00:03:22.736
it starts to add up.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.543
But what affects humans
also affects machines.

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.718
Satellites of the global
positioning system

00:03:27.742 --> 00:03:29.385
are also hurdling around the Earth

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.892
at thousands of miles an hour.

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:33.239
So, time dilation kicks in here, too.

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:36.979
In fact, their speed causes
the atomic clocks on board

00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:38.765
to disagree with clocks on the ground

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.807
by seven millionths of a second daily.

00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:42.266
Left uncorrected,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.120
this would cause GPS to lose accuracy

00:03:44.144 --> 00:03:45.991
by a few kilometers each day.

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.970
So, what does all this have
to do with time travel

00:03:49.994 --> 00:03:51.761
to the far, distant future?

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:55.138
Well, the faster you go,
the greater the effect of time dilation.

00:03:55.162 --> 00:03:56.686
If you could travel really close

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.769
to the speed of light, say 99.9999%,

00:04:00.793 --> 00:04:02.174
on a round-trip through space

00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:04.699
for what seemed to you like ten years,

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:06.152
you'd actually return to Earth

00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:08.404
around the year 9000.

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:10.551
Who knows what you'd see
when you returned?!

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:12.222
Humanity merged with machines,

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:15.309
extinct due to climate change
or asteroid impact,

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:17.721
or inhabiting a permanent colony on Mars.

00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:19.988
But the trouble is,

00:04:20.012 --> 00:04:22.892
getting heavy things like people,
not to mention space ships,

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:26.604
up to such speeds requires
unimaginable amounts of energy.

00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:29.346
It already takes enormous
particle accelerators

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.893
like the Large Hadron Collider

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:34.575
to accelerate tiny subatomic particles
to close to light speed.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:39.489
But one day, if we can develop the tools
to accelerate ourselves to similar speeds,

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.466
then we may regularly send time travelers

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.529
into the future,

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:45.081
bringing with them tales
of a long, forgotten past.
