00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.840
Hi. I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.070
about the entire fracking globe over the course
of several centuries so let’s get right to it!

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.280
Mr. Green! Fracking?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.980
You don’t know about Battlestar Galactica
yet, Me From The Past? Oh, man, there are

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.360
so many great things in your future!

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.820
Today, I’m going to try to show you how
tiny Spain’s influence spread around the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.760
world and shaped the lives of almost every
human on the planet, generally in negative ways.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.570
I know, everything is such a bummer on Crash
Course recently. It’s the sixteenth century.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.330
People are getting richer, they’re living
more connected lives and all I can do is whine

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.450
about how much better the old days were.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.470
What am I, your grandpa? Let’s get festive.
Woooo!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:45.610
[theme music]

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.380
So the Aztecs weren’t the first impressive
polity in Mesoamerica, that honor would go

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.770
to the Olmecs or the Mayans. But they were
probably the greatest.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.540
The Aztecs formed out of an alliance of three
major cities in modern day Mexico in about

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.010
1430, just 89 years before Cortez and his
conquistadors showed up.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.690
The Aztec state was very hierarchical, with
an emperor at the top and a group of unruly

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.610
nobles beneath him, just like Europe! And
in addition, there was a class of powerful

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.410
priests whose job it was to keep order in
the cosmos.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.650
So, Aztec religion held that history was cyclical
and punctuated by terrible disasters and then

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.050
would ultimately end with a massive apocalypse.
And the job of the priests was to avoid these

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.320
disasters, by appeasing the gods, generally
through human sacrifice.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.020
The Aztecs extended their control over most
of southern Mexico, parts of Guatemala and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.800
the Yucatan, and they demanded tribute from
conquered people in the form of goods, precious

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.040
metals, and people to sacrifice.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.140
If you’re familiar with The Hunger Games,
it won’t surprise you to learn that this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.370
didn’t sit very well with said conquered
people. And the fact that the Aztecs were

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.340
basically ruling over thousands of people
who hated them made it a lot easier for Cortez

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.880
to come in and find allies to overthrow them.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.490
All that noted, in less than a hundred years,
the Aztecs accomplished some amazing things.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.890
Especially the building of their capital city
Tenochtitlan, on the site of modern day Mexico

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.590
City, which was like Venice in that it was
divided and serviced by canals. They also

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.320
had floating gardens, called chinampas, which
provided food for the city. Oh, it’s already

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.090
time for the open letter? Alright.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.109
An open letter to Human Sacrifice. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:15.329
today. Oh, nice! Come on. Be a mushroom, be
a mushroom, be a- ohhh dahh!

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.840
Dear Human Sacrifice, Look, I’m not going
to defend you. But if you really believe that

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.780
the world is going to end if the gods are not
appeased, then human sacrifice... kind of makes sense.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.159
And as evidence for this, let me submit to
you that we engage in human sacrifice all

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.099
the time. Remember the movie, The Dirty Dozen? No?
Because you’re too young? That makes me hate myself.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.740
Anyway, it was all about glorious sacrifice
and how a few have to die in order for many

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.489
to live. Did you at least see that uh, that meteor movie
that Ben Affleck was in? What was that called, Stan?

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.489
Stan: Asteroid.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.440
John: Asteroid!

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.560
Stan: Armageddon.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.559
John: Armageddon! Armageddon. Right. Like
that. Human sacrifice.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.140
Best wishes,
John Green

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.700
Alright, now let’s head south to the Inca
civilization, which was older than the Aztecs

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.260
and in some ways even more impressive. Founded
in the 13th century, the Inca empire ruled

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.819
between 4 and 6 million people by the time
the Spanish showed up in 1532.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.389
Trade and a very effective administrative
structure held the empire together, which

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.279
was even more impressive when you consider
all the roads and temples that were built

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:15.319
atop mountains with nothing to haul things
up those mountains, except for llamas and people.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.919
The Inca had no written language but they
were able to keep records with knotted strings

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.870
called quipus. And they were really good at
integrating conquered people into the empire,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.629
mandating that people learn the Incan language
and vitally, they ordered every male peasant

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.380
under the Inca control to do unpaid work for the Inca
government for a specified period of time each year.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.859
This system, which the Inca called mit’a
allowed them to build all those roads and

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.439
temples. The Spanish would later adopt this
system, and the hierarchical system with the

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.319
emperor at the top, except they would make
it all, you know, much suckier. And, yes,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.079
that is a technical historian term.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.949
So, the Spanish arrived in Mexico in 1519,
and in Peru in 1532, benefiting in both cases

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.139
from total chaos due to disease. And after
conquering the Inca and the Aztecs, they created

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.339
an empire with two administrative divisions.
The Vice royalty of New Spain, founded in

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:01.519
1521, and the Vice royality of Peru, founded
in 1542.

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.699
In some ways, the Aztec and Inca empires were
perfect for Spanish conquest. Their administrative

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.139
structures were similar, there was a similar
link between secular and religious power,

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.799
albeit different religions. All of which made
it relatively easy for the Spanish crown to

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.739
step into the void left by those two great empires
and send their own administrators to run the place.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.120
While most of the Spanish aristocrats who
came over ran large agricultural operations,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.419
you don’t see a lot of movies called, like,
Indiana Jones and the Search for A Nice Farm

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.770
in the Countryside. The real glory for conquistadors
was gold.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.919
Initially they found some, both in the Caribbean
and in Mexico, but never enough to get, like,

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.959
super-rich. Fortunately, or as I will argue,
unfortunately, they did find a mountain made of silver.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.060
So the Spanish adapted the mit'a, which the
Incas had used to build roads and public buildings,

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.520
to mine and process that silver. So one seventh
of the adult male Indian population from each

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.660
district was required to work in the silver mines
for a year, being paid only subsistence wages.

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.289
Now, you might wonder why the Spanish didn’t
purchase African slaves to work in the mines.

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.720
They did in Mexico, but in South America it
was cheaper to use indigenous labor.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.729
Purchasing slaves was inefficient because
one: They didn’t have experience working

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.099
at high altitudes, and two: Mine work was
super deadly.

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.150
Mercury, which can be used to refine silver
ore, was found at the mountain of Huancavelica.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.150
And mercury poisoning among miners was so
common that parents would often maim their

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.669
children to keep them from having to work
the mines. You can see why I’m struggling

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.259
to be festive! Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.669
So Spanish mines in the Americas produced
over 150,000 tons of silver between the 16th

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.659
and the 18th centuries, over 80% of the world’s
supply. Spain became the richest nation in

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.669
Europe and Spanish silver pesos became the
de-facto currency.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.729
But the Spanish royal family does not appear
to have understood inflation, and the huge

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.169
influx of silver caused skyrocketing inflation,
and since they never set tax rates to account

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.979
for it, they collected the same amount of
money sixty years after the discovery of silver,

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.349
but that money was worth a fraction of what
it once had been. And in general, it’s not

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.629
clear that Spain benefited much from the discovery
of silver.

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.889
Rich countries have a way of finding their
way into expensive and not totally necessary

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.349
wars, and Spain was no exception. While empire
wasn’t the central cause of Spain’s many

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.310
16th century wars, it sure did fund them.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.229
So in 1519, which was a heck of a year for
Spain, Charles V united the kingdoms of Spain

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.189
and Austria by being named head of the Holy
Roman Empire, so called because it was not

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:19.919
holy, not Roman, and not an empire.

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.500
Charles had this dream of a unified central
Europe, which was constantly being thwarted

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.280
by German nobles, who had a dream of a non-unified
central Europe, and eventually Charles V’s

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.139
ambitions were shattered and he gave the Austrian
half of his kingdom to his son Ferdinand,

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.629
and gave Spain with the American stuff to
Philip in 1556.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:40.710
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, Philip II didn’t
only inherited all of Spain’s holdings in

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.680
the Americas and in Europe and in the Phillip-not-a-coincidence-ines.
He also inherited a rebellion in the Netherlands,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.870
because the Dutch were like, “We’re gonna
be Protestant, also you guys know nothing

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.979
about economics,” which, incidentally, the
Dutch are still saying to the Spanish.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.569
And then the English sided with the Dutch
and there was a war featuring a disastrous

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:01.379
invasion of England, called the Spanish Armada,
in 1588. England’s success against the Spanish,

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.519
even though it can largely be chalked up to
the weather, was credited to Queen Elizabeth I.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.490
That led to a period of wealth and national
pride, which meant that people had both the

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.160
money and the desire to see, I don’t know,
plays about old English Kings named Richard. And that,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.120
my friends, is how the discovery of silver in Bolivia
contributed to the genius of William Shakespeare.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.159
Anyway, American silver didn’t cause these
wars anymore than it wrote Hamlet, but the

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:27.610
new wealth made both more possible. Knowing
that they had this enormous silver “war

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.670
chest” at their disposal made them much more inclined
to build all those ships that got sunk in 1588.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.000
And soon enough even a mountain of silver
couldn't pay for all their warring, and the

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:39.530
Spanish crown had to borrow money, which they
couldn’t pay back, so they defaulted on

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.849
their debt several times in the 17th century.
Yay, silver!

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:46.439
So, most of the silver mined in the Americas
went to Europe, but at least a third of it

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:49.840
went to China. Either directly, on Spanish
galleons, or indirectly through through the

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.370
purchase of Chinese goods.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.379
China had encountered inflation of its own
after printing the world’s first paper money

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:58.099
in the 12th century, so they switched back
to coins. Initially, Chinese coins were made

00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:02.569
out of copper or bronze, but their economy
was so big — they were the leading producer

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:06.419
of consumer goods until the 19th century — that
they ran out. So they went to silver.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:10.419
Now, China didn’t have a lot of silver itself,
but Japan did, so they traded manufactured

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:14.110
goods for it, but soon even that wasn’t
enough. This was mostly because in the 16th

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:19.779
century, China changed its tax structure.
Taxes, man, they’re at the center of human history.

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:23.749
In the early part of the Ming Dynasty, Chinese
farmers paid their taxes in goods, mainly

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:27.569
grain, and labor. But as more silver entered
the economy, the Ming government changed its

00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:30.849
policy and required taxes to be paid in silver.

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:34.530
This meant that almost everyone in China had
to produce something that could be sold for

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.820
silver, which usually meant silk. In fact, the Ming
government often required people to make silk.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.680
That glut of silk inevitably led to a price
drop, which hurt the Chinese economy but not

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.000
nearly as much as it hurt the Spanish economy,
where almost every silk producer was put out

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.300
of business. So much for the idea that global
outsourcing is a new problem.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.660
You’d think all this silver would make the
Chinese incredibly rich, just like the Spanish,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.380
right? Well, yes, just like the Spanish, in
that they got rich, but they didn’t stay

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.170
rich. The Ming government also failed to peg
taxes to inflation, and spent too much on

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.700
defense, notably the Great Wall.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.880
And by the 17th century the Ming were overthrown
by the Fu Manchus. Oh, it’s just the Manchus?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.940
Guh! History, always disappointing me. As
the historian Dennis Flynn put it, “A significant

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.460
hunk of the GDP of China – then the world’s
biggest economy – was surrendered in order

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.380
to secure a white metal that was produced
mostly in Spanish America and Japan... Think

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.190
about what else those resources could have
been used for.”

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.380
The Spanish empire’s silver trade was the
first truly global market — even India was involved,

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.040
but we’re really out of time — and its consequences
were dire, even if it did make some people rich.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.420
Both Spain and China experienced inflation
that weakened their governments. The environment

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.120
suffered. The search for precious metals led
the Spanish to find and eventually destroy

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.450
two of the world’s great empires, the Aztecs
and the Inca.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.820
And many thousands were killed mining silver
and the mercury used to refine it. But before

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.040
you say it wasn’t worth it, remember that
this process led to the life that you have

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.680
today, one where I can teach you history through
the magic of the Internet. Worth the sacrifices,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.280
human and otherwise? I don’t know. You tell
me. Thanks for watching. See you next week.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.760
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.850
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.140
team is Thought Bubble.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.210
Last week’s phrase of the week was “number
four, letter u” if you want to suggest future

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.640
phrases of the week or guess at this week’s
you can do so in comments, where you can also

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.140
ask questions that will be answered by our
team of historians.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.120
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don't forget to be awesome!
