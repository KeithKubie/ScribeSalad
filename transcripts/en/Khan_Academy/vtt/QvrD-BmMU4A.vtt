00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:01.757
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:04.272
is talk a little bit
more about federal powers

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:06.277
versus state powers.

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:08.321
And as we've mentioned in other videos,

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:11.915
this is a very relevant
topic because, even today,

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:15.112
you'll have Supreme Court
decisions being decided

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:18.303
based on citing different
parts of the Constitution

00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:20.060
or various Amendments that seem

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.023
to give one power or another
more to the federal government

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.357
or to the state government.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:28.326
Another important appreciation
is the balance of power

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:31.263
or the shifts of power
between federal and state.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.567
It has historically changed over time,

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.861
so it isn't this fixed thing.

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:37.477
So in a previous video,

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:39.720
we talked about the enumerated powers

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.633
that the Constitution gives
the federal government.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:47.534
In particular, we have talked
about the Commerce Clause

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:49.448
that allows the federal government

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:53.659
"To regulate Commerce
among the several States,"

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.534
which has turned out to be a
much farther reaching power

00:00:56.534 --> 00:01:00.204
than maybe the drafters of
the Constitution intended.

00:01:00.204 --> 00:01:02.215
And then, the thing
that really gives power

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:03.873
to even the enumerated powers

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:06.067
is the Necessary and Proper Clause,

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:10.041
"To make all Laws which
shall be necessary and proper

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.344
"for carrying into Execution
the foregoing Powers."

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:15.082
And so this is what we talk about,

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:16.649
this Necessary and Proper Clause

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.371
creates a lot of implied powers.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.100
So you could imagine, this isn't,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.130
the Necessary and Proper
Clause is not something

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.448
that made the Anti-Federalists very happy.

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:28.245
They were worried about power grabs

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:30.146
by the federal government.

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:32.848
And so shortly after you
have the ratification

00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:34.312
of the Constitution,

00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:37.184
you have the ratification
of the Bill of Rights,

00:01:37.184 --> 00:01:39.365
which are the first 10 Amendments.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.194
And the Ninth and Tenth
Amendment, in particular,

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:44.767
are Anti-Federalists' attempt

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:48.076
to limit the federal government's power.

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:49.552
So the Ninth Amendment says,

00:01:49.552 --> 00:01:52.653
"The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights,

00:01:52.653 --> 00:01:55.147
"shall not be construed to deny

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:58.438
"or disparage others
retained by the people."

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:00.711
And even more important,
the Tenth Amendment,

00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.051
and this is really speaking to
federal versus state powers,

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:07.445
"The powers not delegated
to the United States

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:08.608
"by the Constitution,"

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:10.631
so not delegated to
the federal government,

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.411
"nor prohibited by it,"
the federal government,

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:17.482
"to the States, are reserved
to the States respectively,

00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:19.718
"or to the people."

00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:21.911
And so you could view
this as reserved powers

00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:22.744
for the states.

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:25.269
It's an Anti-Federalist
attempt to say, hey, you know,

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.975
the federal government can't
just do whatever it wants.

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:29.809
It's trying to put a little bit of a check

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.668
on the Necessary and Proper Clause.

00:02:32.668 --> 00:02:34.673
So if you fast-forward to the period

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:36.453
right after the Civil War,

00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:38.099
you have the Thirteenth Amendment,

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.419
which bans slavery.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.255
And then you have the
Fourteenth Amendment,

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:45.088
which is trying to bring
slaves into society,

00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:46.551
allow them to be citizens,

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.343
not just them, but their descendants.

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:50.069
And this is in direct contradiction

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.629
of the 1857 Dred Scott decision

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.240
that we'll talk about in other videos,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.997
where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled

00:02:56.997 --> 00:02:59.191
that slaves and their descendants

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:01.629
are not considered American citizens,

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.896
and so they don't have a right
to petition the government.

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:06.756
But the Fourteenth Amendment says,

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:09.858
"All persons born or naturalized
in the United States,

00:03:09.858 --> 00:03:12.386
"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:16.006
"are citizens of the United States

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:18.549
"and of the State wherein they reside.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.644
"No State shall make or enforce any law."

00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:23.852
And so this is actually
putting constraints on states.

00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:26.470
And so, as we'll see, even
though this is in the context

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.659
of the post-Civil War era,

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.029
because it's putting
constraints on states,

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.775
this is one of the Amendments
that's often cited that puts

00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:36.396
more power in the hands
of the federal government.

00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:39.407
"No State shall make or enforce any law

00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:41.709
"which shall abridge the privileges

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.788
"or immunities of citizens
of the United States;

00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:47.719
"nor shall any State deprive any person

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.370
"of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law;

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.179
"nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.695
"the equal protection of the laws."

00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:00.585
And so since the time

00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:03.974
that the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted,

00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:06.901
this notion of equal
protection under the law,

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:11.078
that no state can "make or
enforce laws which shall abridge

00:04:11.078 --> 00:04:13.321
"the privileges or
immunities of citizens."

00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:15.734
And the Fourteenth Amendment
has been very relevant

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:19.417
in a whole series of cases in modern time,

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:22.245
a lot of cases around discrimination.

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:24.927
If there's a right that
is given in one state,

00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:26.963
do the other states have to adopt it?

00:04:26.963 --> 00:04:28.298
You can look around right now,

00:04:28.298 --> 00:04:31.346
there's significant social
debates about things like

00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:34.777
same-sex marriage or things like abortion,

00:04:34.777 --> 00:04:37.978
and those cases often center around

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:39.727
the Fourteenth Amendment.
