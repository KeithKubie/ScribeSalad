00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:01.317
Hey it's me Destin,

00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:02.882
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:04.255
If you're like me, when you think of hummingbirds

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:06.004
you think of cute little animals that go around

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:07.416
drinking out of flowers and everything is

00:00:07.416 --> 00:00:08.900
happy and beautiful right?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.105
Well it's not.

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:11.651
They're actually savage little beasts

00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:13.684
that will kill each other to get what they want,

00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:15.211
which is nectar.

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:17.347
This lady named Ramona called me from Grant Alabama

00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:19.292
and let me know that she has all these beautiful

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:21.093
feeders setup in her back yard so she can take

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:22.969
photos of hummingbirds any time she wants.

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:26.106
It's awesome, but Ramona has thrown the

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:28.049
supply and demand curves out of whack.

00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:30.019
It's a good thing because she's boosting

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.643
the population, but they now depend on her.

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:34.413
So today on Smarter Every Day we're gonna do

00:00:34.413 --> 00:00:35.481
what Ramona wants.

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.816
We're gonna take the Phantom Miro and get

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:38.394
some awesome slow motion of these hummingbirds

00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:40.302
interacting and fighting around the feeders.

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:42.886
And then, see how much of a risk we can make them take,

00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:44.441
all on slow motion.

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:46.019
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.993
[music]

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:41.208
The way these things work is pretty interesting,

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:43.214
because they have to have food at all times.

00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:45.858
It's like a supply on demand kind of need right?

00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:48.576
So hummingbirds defend a territory of about

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:49.742
a quarter of an acre.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.105
Ramona has artificially boosted the supply in the

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:53.955
local area which means they can peacefully

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.504
coexist as long as that supply is there, right?

00:01:56.504 --> 00:01:59.962
But what happens if we start to eliminate the supply?

00:01:59.962 --> 00:02:02.061
So think about this ecosystem in terms of economics.

00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.908
You've got a set supply of food and a set demand,

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:06.499
number of birds you have to feed.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.174
What happens if we remove the food from the system,

00:02:09.174 --> 00:02:11.895
we should be able to drive up the price of that food,

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.298
thereby increasing the amount of risk that the birds

00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:16.159
want to take in order to get to the food.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.010
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.760
We're gonna manipulate an ecosystem artificially

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.055
in order to get awesome slow-mo footage.

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:25.269
Let's do that right now.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.445
Let's get Smarter Every Day.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.066
No nutrients here.

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:30.397
[music]

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.222
[unintelligible]

00:02:55.222 --> 00:02:58.006
[laughs]

00:02:58.006 --> 00:02:59.452
It works.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.118
[music]

00:04:19.128 --> 00:04:22.562
[laughter in background]

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:26.658
Shoot, that's crazy! [laughs]

00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:29.729
Alright we're putting feeders back out.

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:37.783
There you go.

00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:40.342
Well I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day.

00:04:40.342 --> 00:04:42.546
This was brought to you by Audible.com.

00:04:42.546 --> 00:04:44.385
So if you want to support Smarter Every Day

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:47.458
go check out an audio book on audible.com/smarter.

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.916
The one I recommend since we're in Grant Alabama

00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:52.789
which is in Alabama, which is where Harper Lee is from,

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.634
is called To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:04:54.634 --> 00:04:55.605
She wrote one book,

00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:57.058
that's the only one she published,

00:04:57.058 --> 00:04:58.931
and she won a Pullitzer Prize for it.

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.222
That's pretty awesome.

00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:02.551
Anyway it's been banned in a lot of places because of the racism

00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:04.618
and there's some bad words and things like that,

00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:07.967
but it's a very good book and it teaches things on multiple levels

00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:09.289
so if you want to support Smarter Every Day,

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.332
audible.com/smarter, To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:05:12.332 --> 00:05:13.399
