lower Northeast well again it's trying
 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.870
lower Northeast well again it's trying
to figure out kind of when this is

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880
to figure out kind of when this is
 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.790

taking place cuz I guess I'm assuming

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800
taking place cuz I guess I'm assuming
 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.620
taking place cuz I guess I'm assuming
it's the future because we think they're

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:54.630
it's the future because we think they're
 

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.700
it's the future because we think they're
traveling to different worlds but

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.710
traveling to different worlds but
 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.379

they're not it's all on earth and earth
 

00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:58.850
they're not it's all on earth and earth
obviously looks very dangerous figure

00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860
obviously looks very dangerous figure
 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.000
obviously looks very dangerous figure
it's some sort of alternative kind of

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.010
it's some sort of alternative kind of
 

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.149
it's some sort of alternative kind of
earth in present time that might be I

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159
earth in present time that might be I
 

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:07.969

explained in their world they just

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919
explained in their world they just
 

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.670
explained in their world they just
haven't explained to us yet um and I get

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680
haven't explained to us yet um and I get
 

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.170
haven't explained to us yet um and I get
the feeling they would have that figured

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180
the feeling they would have that figured
 

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.930
the feeling they would have that figured
out so but

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:49.940
out so but
 

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.880
out so but
again the Chi as to the mystery and I

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:51.890
again the Chi as to the mystery and I
 

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.670
again the Chi as to the mystery and I
like that it's like the gems are trying

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680
like that it's like the gems are trying
 

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.220

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.540
want to go on anyway I just figured
that's because the gems are there so

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:04.550
