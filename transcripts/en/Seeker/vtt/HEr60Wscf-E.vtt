00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:08.720
Is there a downside to eating late at night,
besides getting crumbs in your bed?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.830
Hey there science cravers, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.380
A lot of diet fads are very specific about
what you should eat, but hardly any of them

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.230
talk about when you should eat.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.110
That’s because for years now the conventional
wisdom has basically been that the overall

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.310
number of calories you eat vs how many you
burn is what’s important.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.210
But a few studies have challenged this idea.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.739
One in 2013 published in the International
Journal of Obesity followed 420 obese or overweight

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.749
adults who were trying to lose weight over
20 weeks.

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:41.039
Those who ate their largest meal before 3PM
on average lost almost 2 kg more than those

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.329
who ate after, even if caloric intake and
amount of exercise was the same.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.629
But why should that be the case?

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.800
It’s possible the same calorie may be treated
differently depending on where your body is

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.210
in it’s circadian rhythm.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.670
Yes the 24 hour cycle that we usually just
associate with our sleep schedule also has

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.870
an effect on how our bodies absorb and digest
food.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.780
So eating out of our normal rhythm can contribute
to weight gain according to Kelly Allison

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.380
of the University of Pennsylvania School of
Medicine’s Center for Weight and Eating

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.380
Disorders.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.730
Wow that is one bloated title.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.229
So what’s causing us to eat out of our regular
rhythms?

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.420
Society, man.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.990
The way we work has caused a sort of social
jet lag, where the time we have available

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.070
to eat doesn’t match the time it would be
most ideal to eat.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.869
We’re skipping breakfast more, and our meal
times are becoming irregular as we focus on

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.270
getting work done or picking up the kids from
school.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.439
We may actually be intentionally fighting
the circadian rhythm, when it causes cortisol

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.869
and adrenaline to drop off around 3 PM.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.940
To stave off the sleepiness some of us indulge
in something high in sugar or fat.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.799
According to Pamela Peeke, an assistant professor
at the University of Maryland School of Medicine,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.969
this will raise our insulin levels and we’ll
crave sugar later.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.500
Our circadian rhythm is at odds with our modern
lifestyle in other ways too.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.479
When we first evolved food wasn’t readily
available in refrigerators when we woke up.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.859
So it’s possible that as the day progresses,
the food we eat is more apt to turn into fat

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.810
so the next day we have a convenient reserve
of energy and don’t have to worry about

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.810
our first meal.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.040
That’s the hypothesis of Steven Shea, director
of the Oregon Institute of Occupational Health

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.040
Sciences.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.190
Shea also noticed in his research that people
tend to be hungrier later at night, possibly

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.640
as part of this evolutionary adaptation.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.790
Combine that with the fact that since artificial
light we stay up later than ever and now have

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.080
ready access to food, and the result is some
people can’t resist a late night bite.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.580
Furthermore, if you are grabbing food late
at night, you’re more likely to make an

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.920
unhealthy choice.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.700
You might do it out of convenience, because
it’s easier to grab a bag of chips than

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.000
make a salad, or you might do it out of mental
exhaustion.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.270
If you’ve spent the whole day on your best
dietary behavior, late at night you’re more

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.840
willing to let yourself slip, or even reward
yourself with something fatty, salty, sweet,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.910
and delicious.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.870
Even the researchers who study this admit
that chrononutrition is an underexplored topic,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.060
with few studies done so far and many of them
relying on mice.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.980
While the studies we’ve cited point to a
link between late day eating and weight gain,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.000
plenty of others support the orthodox view
that net calorie count is the most important

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
factor.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.820
Once again more research is needed.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.160
I hope it involves cake.

Have 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.110
you tried shifting your caloric intake to
earlier in the day?

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.510
How did that work out for you?
