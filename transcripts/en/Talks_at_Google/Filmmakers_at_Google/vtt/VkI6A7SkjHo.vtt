00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
&gt;&gt; WISCHERKEN: Hello everybody. Welcome to
a Filmmakers@Google night in Santa Monica.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.140
I'm Julie Wischerken and I'm here to introduce
Chris Mason Johnson. Chris began his career

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.790
as a dancer and he once danced with Mikhail
Baryshnikov. He got a film degree from Amherst

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.450
College and worked as the Head of Development
at Open City Films and a script editor for

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.770
several studios. And he co-wrote, produced,
and directed his first feature, "The New Twenty,"

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.960
which will be screening tonight. And now Chris
will tell us a little bit about the movie

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.530
and please join me in welcoming Chris.
&gt;&gt; JOHNSON: Hello, everybody, eating Korean

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.979
barbecue at the Google office in Santa Monica.
All right, so this is an independent feature

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:52.069
film that, as Julie said, I directed and co-wrote,
and produced. It's genuinely independent.

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:59.469
I raised the money myself from private equity
and edited it on a laptop with final cut.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.670
So if you have questions about all that angle
on it, we can talk after the--after the screening.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.330
But for a brief intro, what I'd like to just
tell you is how the story began, actually

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:24.310
the film. It started in New York when my good
friend, Ishmael, came over and told me about

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.770
a bachelor party that he'd been to a few nights
before. It was a bachelor party for a mutual

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:42.740
friend. And it was one of those parties that
got pretty extreme. They had hired a couple

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:52.880
of strippers, they had a hotel room in a very
swank hotel, and I was not invited even though

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.100
we were all really good friends. And the reason
I wasn't invited is because I am not completely

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:14.900
heterosexual and they are. So there were sort
of these lines drawn. That is--we were a group

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.790
of friends, a group of buddies, right? We
went to college together, some straight, some

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.939
gay, we hung out together. There weren't the
usual divisions that you know from the stereotypical

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.019
films or TV shows that deal with those issues,
right? It wasn't like "Here's the segregated

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.079
gay show and here's all the buddies bonding."
It was a mix. But when it came to the bachelor

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:43.090
party, I wasn't invited. So clearly even though
we're dealing with the new male here for whom

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.950
these old divisions are not as strict, there
are still some divisions. Anyway, so the party

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:01.189
got very extreme and almost sort of, you know,
Carlos Castaneda-like in its mushroom enhanced

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:07.299
bacchanalia. And I was just fascinated by
this. You know, by the idea of this group

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.560
of guys hanging out together in this very
erotic way, something that simply could not

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.510
have happened even 20 years ago because there
was just too much tension around sensuality

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.469
between straight male friends. You just couldn't
do it. So I thought, "All right, this is some

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:32.540
kind of evolution here." At the same time,
there are still these lines drawn, again,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.000
because I wasn't invited. So he told me the
story of this party. And I said, "That sounds

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.819
like a pretty good screenplay idea." And he
said, "Well, why don't we write it." And I

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.060
said, "Okay." And we were both just ready
for that in our life at the moment, so we

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.689
embarked on this project that became a year's
long project. So the bachelor party in the

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:04.709
movie is not anything like what happened in
real life. So fiction evolves. So you won't

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:13.230
see anything of what I just described exactly.
So again, what I was interested in was depicting

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:22.940
this like a group of buddies who were not
all straight. And when you see buddy movies,

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.890
they're all straight. Now in the Judd Apatow
movies, a lot of the jokes are around homosexual

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.750
panic. I think the whole premise is built
around that. You know, "I love you, man."

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.540
The whole thing is built around that. But
nevertheless, they're all straight. So, I

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.450
simply haven't seen it before. And the only
place I'd seen a mix is in the family dramas,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.720
you know, "Six Feet Under", "Brothers and
Sisters", or if there's a mix of guys and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.750
girls, and it's sort of a pseudo family-like
reality bites. There'll be the one gay subplot,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.760
right? So I simply hadn't seen this mix. And
I was interested in it because it was something

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.070
that I think is happening in life. We're sort
of, you know, is this the post-gay generation,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.260
right? Obviously not, but in some sense, yes.
So, we're seeing it play out now with marriage

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.260
equality, right? The younger you are, the
more likely you are to be pro-marriage equality.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.600
So we're in this evolutionary moment where
these things are just not a big deal. People

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.160
would rather not talk about him. Yeah, he's
gay. So what? Get over it. It's not a big

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.780
deal, right? But at the same time, there are
still these divisions. So that's represented

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.670
in the movie in a couple of ways. Tension
between the guys who are buddies and who are

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:44.190
over it, but for whom there are still tensions
that often play out in humor. And then tensions

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.550
between an older generation who might be more
explicitly homophobic, and the younger generation

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:56.860
of guys. So, that was the original inspiration.
And the other thing I'd like to say before

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.400
we start the film is I didn't think that I
had written and directed a gay film. It was

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:13.340
just an ensemble drama about a group of people.
And I didn't want to ghettoize it as a gay

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:22.440
film because I felt the sort of moment of
great queer film had maybe passed. We'd had

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.530
a burst of it and then there had been some
films a bit--a little bit later. And I thought

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.270
we were in like a phase of these kinds of
pandering movies with like a shirtless hunk

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.751
and sort of soft core and I didn't even want
to see them and I didn't really want to be

00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:43.620
associated with them. That was sort of my
prejudice. But someone sent a screener to

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.300
festival programmers at Outfest and they called
us and they invited us. That's a big gay and

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.501
lesbian festival in Los Angeles every summer.
And we debated it long and hard, you know,

00:06:55.501 --> 00:07:00.270
"Should we ghettoize ourselves," et cetera.
And some people advise against it in very

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.770
strong terms. And they were very wrong. We
did it and it was the best thing we cold have

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:12.080
done, because, well, here I have. This is
what our poster was initially, which I think

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.240
was on your flyer. It's a group of faces of
the cast. And it says, "30 isn't what it used

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:29.810
to be." And then, you know, this is what we
became, which is a very different demographic

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:35.500
that's being targeted there. So, you know,
you're a tiny independent movie. We recently

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.900
had a theatrical in New York and LA, iTunes
July 1st. But you don't have a lot of marketing

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.810
money. And what the gay festival did for us
was it gave us an actual market we could target.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:54.480
And as it turns out, that market was really
hungry for smarter content that wasn't pandering.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.680
You know, that wasn't the latest Uncle Tom
version of gay film, right, that actually

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.590
reflected something from life. So that was
a wonderfully positive thing. The irony though

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:14.040
is that some of our most receptive audiences
have been women. We have a couple here tonight.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.760
Because it is a relationship film and women
have just responded really strongly to it

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.600
and straight young men, so it's sort of a
double-edged sword. It gave us a market that

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.360
as a tiny independent film we could target.
And that helped up financially. In New York,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.979
we were in the top 5 for Indie box office
per screen average of the quad opening weekend.

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:38.990
The other side of that double-edged sword
is--I do regret that I haven't been able to

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:46.390
reach a wider audience who really do respond
to this film, because in that other sense,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:56.760
it's not a gay film. So if you like it, tell
your friends. iTunes, July 1st, on demand,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.889
July 1st, nationwide in Canada. And without
further ado, enjoy the film. Thank you.
