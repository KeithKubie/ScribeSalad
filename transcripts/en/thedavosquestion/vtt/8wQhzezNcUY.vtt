00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
&gt;&gt; Hello YouTubers. This is Begum Aga Khan
and I'm very happy to join you today. Let

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.000
me tell you what I believe is one of the most
important things that all people should be

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.660
doing in 2009 in order to fight poverty. It
is called micro-finance and micro-finance

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.290
is proved to be one of the most effective
tools to lift people out of extreme poverty.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.840
And the good thing is, it can be done by everyone,
actually governments, businesses, banks and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.300
every single person like you and me. Let me
explain how it works. Think about 1.4 billion

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.700
people who are living in extreme poverty in
developing countries. They have to live every

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.820
day with less than $2, and they have no extra
for basics. In other words, they have no clean

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.760
water, they have no safe housing, no medical
care, and no education. Now the good thing

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.280
is that it takes a relatively small amount
of money to lift these people out of poverty

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.579
by granting them small loans called micro-loans.
For example, a small amount of money like

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.479
$150 can lift a whole family out of this vicious
circle of poverty and with this amount of

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.579
money they can start building their little
business and for the first time take control

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.659
of their life, for example [inaudible] and
Richard Stewart. Let me give you an example,

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.119
my Princess Inaara Foundation recently announced
a fund raising campaign in the German city

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.789
of [inaudible] and in yet in four weeks we
were able to collect more than half million

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:53.240
euro for poor families, for women and their
families in Southern India. And with this

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.579
money alone, we will be able to reach out
to by 2010 to more 100,000 more families than

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.759
we are reaching out to now. So in other words,
what I want to say is it works, it is fantastic

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.000
and all of us can do it. So please do join
in the fight against poverty. Let us invest

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.420
together in the poorest members of our society
thereby helping, shaping this world into a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.319
better [inaudible]. Thank you.
