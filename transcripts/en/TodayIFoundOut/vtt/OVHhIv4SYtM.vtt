00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:18.220
The Woman Who is the Mother of Us 
All

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.480
all humans can be traced back to a single
female known as Mitochondrial Eve.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.420
This woman is thought to be the “mother”
of all humans alive today.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.269
Seems like a big claim for scientists to make.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.940
So how do they know this?

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.430
The simple explanation is that when an egg
is fertilized by a sperm, the DNA from the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.890
father and mother join together in a process
known as recombination.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.820
Certain DNA is only passed down from the mother
or father.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.030
All mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) come exclusively
from the mother, as an exact copy.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.120
Over time however, there will occur predictable
mutations to mtDNA.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.430
Biologists can compare samples from individuals
to determine how closely they are related-

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.750
the fewer these predictable mutations, the
closer the relationship.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.130
The predictability of these mutations also
allows biologists to estimate the time at

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.200
which a certain mutation (i.e. ancestor) lived.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.689
Beginning in 1987, several studies have been
conducted that show all humans alive today

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.960
have the same female ancestor and she lived
approximately 200,000 years ago.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.770
A more detailed explanation is as follows.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.979
Mitochondria are a type of organelle found
in almost all complex cells.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.950
They are known as the power plants of the
cell because they supply an enzyme (more accurately

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.679
a co-enzyme) known as adenosine triphosphate
(ATP).

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.210
This ATP is the source for the chemical energy
needed by a cell to perform a wide range of

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.210
functions.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.210
The DNA found within mitochondria have two
benefits.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.149
They have 37 genes that rarely mutate, so
they can be easily used as the model for an

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.299
evolutionary clock, and these same genes have
subsections that mutate in a predictable manner

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.850
so biologists can use it as a reference for
age.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.929
Sperm have only a few mitochondria (and thus
mitochondrial DNA) in their tails.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.619
They use them to power their quest to the
egg.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.250
As the sperm enters the egg, only the chromosomes
found in the head of the sperm are preserved

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.760
and used in the recombination process to create
new cells.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.670
This is because the rest of the sperm cell
is broken down by enzymes within the egg.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.240
So the mitochondrial DNA in the tail is lost
and the only type to survive is supplied by

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240
the mother.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.720
As the human population grows from one generation
to the next, women transfer this DNA evidence

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.720
to their daughters.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.230
They, in turn, transfer it to their daughters.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.850
Should a woman have only a son, their mtDNA
is lost, because it will never be passed to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.850
his children.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.330
However, there have been a few rare cases
in which mitochondrial DNA was found recombined

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.820
from both parents.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.900
Some skeptics of the Mitochondrial Eve theory
use this to cast doubt on the hypothesis.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.070
This opposition is somewhat dubious as those
few cases occur in people who are typically

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.030
far too biologically deficient to have offspring.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.820
Thus, the prevailing assumption is that these
unfortunate people have something seriously

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.070
wrong with their DNA and the abnormal recombination
of mtDNA will never get into the human population

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.100
because of it.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.340
Even though biologists have shown that all
people are descended from one person, this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.040
does not mean that only one female was alive
at that time.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.240
It simply means only one set of genes have
been passed down from a single point in history.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.160
Most researchers agree that “Eve” was
not the only women alive because the fossil

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.870
record shows much older specimens.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.750
From “Java man” at about 800,000 years
to “Lucy”, the earliest known remains

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.270
which are approximately 1-4 million years
old.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.820
There are several theories about how just
one set of genes could have survived.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.850
The most likely is a bottleneck of the human
population that would set the stage for an

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.540
evolutionary “lucky mother”.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.400
There have been several possible bottlenecks
in history.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.430
One report, written in 1998, showed approximately
70,000 years ago humanity was down to around

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.380
15,000 people.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.800
It showed the reason behind the bottleneck
was an ice age that lasted about a 1,000 years.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.670
Other reasons bottlenecks could have happened
are: an asteroid impact or volcanic eruption

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.090
causing drastic climate change; a continuous,
widespread plague; or any situation that caused

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.960
male offspring to have a better chance of
survival, leaving relatively few women around

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.600
to pass on their genes.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.239
While no definitive proof exists that these
occurred, most researchers believe a combination

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:30.050
of one or all of these factors are behind
why we all have a common ancestor.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.139
There is another type of genetic test that
can trace all humans alive today back through

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.050
their father’s ancestors.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.889
This uses what is known as the Y chromosome
and shows that all people today can trace

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.400
their lineage back to a single father known
as “Y Chromosome Adam”.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.669
Before you start throwing fuel on any religious
fire, Y Adam lived at a completely different

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.979
time then Eve.

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.639
Approximately 60,000 -90,000 years ago.

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.639
How can this be?

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.360
Mitochondrial Eve is simply the most recent
common ancestor of mtDNA.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.919
Y chromosomal Adam is the most recent common
ancestor for Y DNA.

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.360
They did not have to be a couple for both
of their genes to be the source for all current

00:05:06.360 --> 00:07:00.360
humans.
