paradox is to study consumption at the
 

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.390
paradox is to study consumption at the
individual level relationship between

a low-income country you start by
 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.460

again I'd like to ask I don't know

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:47.380
again I'd like to ask I don't know
 

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.750
again I'd like to ask I don't know
whether we you come but it's a how do

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760
whether we you come but it's a how do
 

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.560
whether we you come but it's a how do
you decide or what is an ideal demanding

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:55.570
you decide or what is an ideal demanding
 

00:24:55.570 --> 00:25:01.020
you decide or what is an ideal demanding
system would like you you want to take

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.030
system would like you you want to take
 

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:05.580
system would like you you want to take
that very briefly and an ideal demand

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:05.590
that very briefly and an ideal demand
 

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.670
that very briefly and an ideal demand
system is a system that manages to pick

up a lot of variation in the data on

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500
up a lot of variation in the data on
 

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.200
up a lot of variation in the data on
demand sistant can help you understand

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.210
demand sistant can help you understand
 

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.840
demand sistant can help you understand
why people are choosing what you're

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:15.850
why people are choosing what you're
 

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.300
why people are choosing what you're
choosing as functions of the prices and

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:18.310
choosing as functions of the prices and
 

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.820
choosing as functions of the prices and
incomes that may be many other things

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:20.830
incomes that may be many other things
 

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.970
incomes that may be many other things
like demographic factors I think that's

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:23.980
like demographic factors I think that's
 

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.930
like demographic factors I think that's
the core of a good demand system there

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:27.940
the core of a good demand system there
 

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.120
the core of a good demand system there
are other things that we as economies

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:30.130
are other things that we as economies
 

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.730
are other things that we as economies
would like from a demand system but in

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:32.740
would like from a demand system but in
 

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.640
would like from a demand system but in
essence in the end we want to have a

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:35.650
essence in the end we want to have a
 

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.420
essence in the end we want to have a
system like managed to explain choices

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:39.430
system like managed to explain choices
 

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:48.140
system like managed to explain choices
people are making more questions

important research
 

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.960
important research
yeah I had the research on demand system

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:41.970
yeah I had the research on demand system
 

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.140
yeah I had the research on demand system
was done in the late 1970s and much of

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:45.150
was done in the late 1970s and much of
 

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:49.159
was done in the late 1970s and much of
his work in a great relationship between

00:30:49.159 --> 00:30:49.169
his work in a great relationship between
 

00:30:49.169 --> 00:30:51.500
his work in a great relationship between
income and consumption was done in the

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:51.510
income and consumption was done in the
 

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:56.149
income and consumption was done in the
latter part of the 1980s and from 90s

00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159
latter part of the 1980s and from 90s
 

00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:58.399
latter part of the 1980s and from 90s
forward he has done a lot of work on

00:30:58.399 --> 00:30:58.409
forward he has done a lot of work on
 

00:30:58.409 --> 00:31:01.880
forward he has done a lot of work on
developing the economics and he's still

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:01.890
developing the economics and he's still
 

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.289
developing the economics and he's still
active research is still a very active

00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299
active research is still a very active
 

00:31:03.299 --> 00:31:06.049
active research is still a very active
researcher very much so more findings to

00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059
researcher very much so more findings to
 

00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:08.180
researcher very much so more findings to
look forward to I probably fix it okay

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:08.190
look forward to I probably fix it okay
 

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.610
look forward to I probably fix it okay
as the politics just anything to learn

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:10.620
as the politics just anything to learn
 

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.799
as the politics just anything to learn
from this kind of research yeah I think

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:12.809
from this kind of research yeah I think
 

00:31:12.809 --> 00:31:15.110
from this kind of research yeah I think
you ought to as this policy makers you

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120
you ought to as this policy makers you
 

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.029
you ought to as this policy makers you
have a lot to learn from this research I

00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039
have a lot to learn from this research I
 

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:19.399
have a lot to learn from this research I
think all three of his core

00:31:19.399 --> 00:31:19.409
think all three of his core
 

00:31:19.409 --> 00:31:21.440
think all three of his core
contributions have a direct link to

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:21.450
contributions have a direct link to
 

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.560
contributions have a direct link to
policies or demand system is a tool you

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:24.570
policies or demand system is a tool you
 

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.510
policies or demand system is a tool you
can do to evaluate different types of

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520
can do to evaluate different types of
 

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.480
can do to evaluate different types of
economic policy proposals like changes

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:29.490
