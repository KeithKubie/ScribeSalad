00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's say in the distributed system, there are two events. I don't

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.610
know where they are happening. There's an event called a and there's

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.160
an event called b. Somewhere in the distributed system, these two events

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.620
are happening. And it so happens, when I look at the record

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.770
of all the time stamp associated with the events, I see that

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.410
the time stamp associated with a is less than the time stamp

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.086
associated with b. So I want to make sure that you understand

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:25.270
the premise of the problem here. What I am saying is that the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.110
time stamp that is associated with the event a happens

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.650
to be less than time stamp associated with the event

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.410
b. That's what I am observing, by looking at sort

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.010
of a log record of all the events that took

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.640
place in the system and now my question to you is. If C of a is less than C of

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.840
b, does that mean that a happened before b or

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.990
does it mean b happened before a or does it mean

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.460
a happened before b with the condition that it's either the case that

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.520
a and b are events in the same process or a is the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.030
act of sending a message and b is the act of receiving the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.050
corresponding message. So you have to pick

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.800
the right choice among these three choices.
