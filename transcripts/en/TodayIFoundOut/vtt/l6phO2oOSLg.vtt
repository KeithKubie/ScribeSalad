00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:32.559
It’s that time of 
year when tissue companies nationwide rejoice

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.930
at the excessive mucus caused by allergies.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.780
If you’re one of the unlucky, you might
ask yourself why we get them anyway?

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.130
Why would our immune systems react to seemingly
harmless things like pollens, dust mites,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.350
and the dander from cats and dogs?

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.780
There are two proposed theories here; the
most widely accepted involves an evolutionary

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.879
mechanism for expelling parasitic worms, a
frequent problem for our ancestors before

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.770
the advent of modern medicine and potentially
living in a more hygienic environment.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.850
A relatively newly suggested competing theory
is that the reaction is due to how the immune

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.780
system responds to a type of cell, known as
a mast cell, when it releases its chemicals

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.780
of inflammation.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.920
Before we can understand the two theories,
it’s important to know how the immune system

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.950
works in general when it encounters a potential
allergen.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.070
There are two ways it can deal with a foreign
pathogen- either kill it (type 1 reaction)

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.860
or attempt to expel it from the body (type
2 reaction).

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.510
Should you have a large pathogen, like say
a parasitic worm, the body would generally

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.900
illicit the type 2, expulsion tactic.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.200
A smaller microbe, like a bacteria or virus,
will generally trigger the type 1 response.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.799
What exactly is happening when the immune
system gets stimulated?

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.430
(In an attempt to avoid writing a book on
the topic, I will only touch on the parts

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.689
pertaining to allergies themselves and not
the immune system as a whole.)

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.099
All the cells of your immune system revolve
around a class of cells called white blood

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.099
cells.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.030
One type of white blood cell is a B cell.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.739
B cells have antibodies on their surface;
known as Immunoglobulins (Ig), they are Y

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.900
shaped proteins.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.230
When an allergen contacts your skin, eye,
nasal passage, mouth, airway, or in your digestive

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.650
tract, it will attach to the antibody on the
B cell.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.700
The B cell will then become activated.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.209
Once activated, they will begin to multiply.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.730
Some turn into memory B cells that will recognize
the same molecule later in life and be able

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.960
to more quickly mount a defense.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.930
Some turn into plasma B cells (effector cells).

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.099
These make more identical antibodies that
attach to the molecule its predecessor just

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.099
recognized.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.349
They’re so good at it that one effector
cell can produce about 2000 identical antibodies

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.970
per second!

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.300
Those antibodies will then attach to the invader
and mark it for recognition by other white

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.820
blood cells that will destroy the suspicious
molecule.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.080
They do this by attaching themselves in a
process called opsonization.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.519
Different allergens will end up producing
different antibodies.

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.310
In 1967, two research groups from Colorado
and Sweden identified a new type of Ig, known

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.030
as IgE.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.160
This little antibody proved to be the main
force starting a cascade of events that leads

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.970
to those sinister allergy symptoms.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.010
More recently, scientist have been able to
genetically engineer mice to stop making IgE.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.879
Those mice don’t get allergies.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:38.879
Science!

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.799
In any event, once produced, IgE begins circulating
around and attaches to the receptors (Fc type

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.650
I and II) on the previously mentioned mast
cell.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.939
These cells are responsible for most of the
processes involved in the symptoms you feel

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.630
when suffering from allergies.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.400
When stimulated, they begin secreting a barrage
of chemicals, called degranulation.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.790
One example is the release of histamine.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.549
Histamine is important for several of our
allergic reaction symptoms- things like the

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.220
constriction of your bronchioles, the dilation
of your arteries, the perception of itching,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.799
and the production of hives.

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.239
It’s also responsible for many of the processes
involved with inflammation.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.490
So to sum up on the how, or at least as it’s
generally understood (there is some controversy

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.650
here as we’ll get into in a moment) an allergen
enters the body, attaches to B cells; IgE

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.390
is created and stimulates mast cell degranulation;
inflammation ensues and all the symptoms you

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.770
feel begin causing their web of woe.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.140
The immune system stays activated until it
senses no more allergen to attack, and you’re

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.490
now you’re back to normal!

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.770
With the “how” covered, this bring us
back to the question of why we get allergies

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.560
to things that are seemingly harmless?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.020
No one has definitively answered the question,
but everyone seems to agree that IgE is the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.540
main antibody responsible for all the immune
system reactions and the inflammation it brings.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.980
So, what in natural selection made IgE an
important trait required for our ancestor’s

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.840
survival given today some consider it mostly
useless, and more than a little annoying for

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840
those with allergies?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.210
Until recently, the leading theory revolved
around parasitic worms.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.560
In 1964, scientist Bridget Ogilvie showed
that IgE was found to be in abundance in rats

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.820
infected with worms.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.600
Our ancestors also had a problem with worms.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.600
They didn’t have access to modern medicine
and hygienic environments that have reduced

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.120
the infection rate down to the current 20%
worldwide (with most that are infected residing

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.860
in underdeveloped countries).

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.560
Throughout much of history, everything from
roundworms, such as hook-worms, to flatworms,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.600
like tapeworms and liver flukes, were relatively
common.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.050
IgE and the symptoms it creates, like sneezing
coughing and diarrhea, all serve to expel

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.480
those nasty little freeloaders.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.560
As Dr. David Dunne from the university of
Cambridge states, “You’ve got about an

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.000
hour to react very dramatically in order to
reduce the chance of these parasites surviving…

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.720
Allergy is just an unfortunate side-effect
of defense against parasitic worms.”

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.700
So IgE’s ability to kick things into high
gear to quickly react to such an invader would

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.130
seemingly be very handy here.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.560
What do parasitic worms have to do with allergies?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.949
The idea here is that the reason we get such
a strong reaction to certain other less threatening

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.830
things that our immune system might be much
better off ignoring is that the proteins on

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.630
the surface of parasitic worms are similar
to the molecules we encounter in other aspects

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.750
of our lives.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.880
The B cells responsible for the immediate
immune system response react to a non-specific

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.259
class of molecules.

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:53.100
Thus, our immune system will respond to allergens
that are structurally similar to the proteins

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.380
found on the surface of worms.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.389
The body then attempts to rid itself of them,
whether they’re harmful or not.

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:05.080
The left-over response from our immune system
reacting to worms (and now similar protein

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.250
molecules) is why allergies continue to torment
landscapers everywhere, or at least as far

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.639
as this theory goes.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.750
While a long-standing theory and very widely
accepted in the medical world, the defense

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.479
against worm’s philosophy gets somewhat
undermined when you look at studies showing

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.020
IgE isn’t actually strictly necessary to
fight them off.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.850
The mice scientists have genetically engineered
to be unable to produce IgE are still able

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.840
to rid themselves of the parasites.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.740
That’s not to mention the fact that people
can have these types of allergic reactions

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.620
to things that have no possible biological
link to any protein found on a worm, such

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.169
as reacting to the metal nickle.

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:49.530
So even if this is a factor in why we have
allergic responses to seemingly otherwise

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.330
harmless things, it can’t tell the whole
story.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.750
This brings us to the slightly newer theory
as to why we have allergies.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.670
It also involves the idea of our bodies attempting
to expel allergens, but instead of the immune

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.801
system recognizing a structurally similar
protein molecule to that on parasitic worms

00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:12.190
and misinterpreting that the body has acquired
such a parasite, it is the immune system reacting

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.990
to actual damage caused by that invader- namely,
the destruction of those mast cells.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.509
When mast cells begins to degranulate, the
body begins making antibodies to several of

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:27.410
the proteins around the area affected to try
to get rid of whatever foreign agent.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.769
Should it inadvertently make an antibody to,
for instance, the proteins found on peanuts,

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:37.860
you will then get memory B cells to fight
against peanut molecules in future.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.269
Congratulations, you now potentially have
a peanut allergy.

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:46.070
Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov, professor of Immunobiology
at Yale University School of Medicine (and

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:51.050
arguably the biggest promoter of this theory),
likes to think of it like how we protect our

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.050
homes.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.620
If you’re not home and someone breaks into
your house, your alarm system won’t go off

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.130
based on recognizing the intruder’s face,
but by the fact that they broke a window.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:05.160
So in a nutshell, it’s not recognizing the
molecule, but rather simply creating antibodies

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.709
for things around mast cells degranulating.

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:12.940
In support of this theory, Dr. Medzhitov and
co. began investigating potential cell damage

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.800
caused by various allergens.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.690
For instance, when they injected mice with
an allergen found in honey-bee venom, PLA2,

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:24.490
they found that their immune systems did not
initially respond at all to the PLA2 itself.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.810
It wasn’t until the PLA2 ripped open cell
membranes that the immune system kicked into

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.430
gear producing IgE as a rapid response mechanism.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.970
And, as previously mentioned, other pathogens
in the area might potentially get implicated

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.860
as the “house burglar,” with your immune
system creating the memory B cells to react

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.100
to it later.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.740
Fascinatingly, no matter which side of the
why-we-get-allergies debate you’re on (or

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.529
even if you think both ideas are partially
correct or both incorrect), one thing almost

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:56.690
all researchers agree on is that allergy rates
are increasing.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:02.390
For instance, nearly 30% of adults and 40%
of children in the US are affected by some

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.560
sort of allergy.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.560
Why?

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.160
We’ve known for a long time that both genetics
and the environment play a part in getting

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.160
allergies.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.880
Technology has also allowed us to create countless
never-before-seen synthetic chemicals.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.450
Their associated molecules could potentially
trigger any number of reactions by the immune

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:24.010
system that our ancestors didn’t have to
worry about, perhaps being one factor in the

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.310
increased allergy rates.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.190
Another potential factor is something known
as the hygiene hypothesis.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.640
Many scientists believe that with the promotion
of good hygiene taught throughout the industrialized

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.310
world, which most definitely does have an
amazing number of significant benefits, there

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:43.290
may also be a downside in that children aren’t
being exposed to as many pathogens that their

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.750
immune systems can learn to respond to correctly,
or some even postulate potentially need to

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.890
respond to develop the immune system properly.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:55.480
The idea in the latter case is that for most
of human evolution, the immune system developed

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.070
being exposed to these pathogens as a matter
of course, and, similar to how we’ve evolved

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.700
to need many types of microbes in the digestive
system to survive, the idea goes that the

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.070
human immune system perhaps has evolved to
need to be exposed to certain things in order

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.880
that it later correctly responds to introduced
pathogens, rather than triggering an allergic

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.980
response to things it might be better off
ignoring.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:23.089
Thus the immune system later in life overreacts
to some things, or sometimes even reacts to

00:11:23.089 --> 00:11:24.500
parts of the body itself.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.640
Potential supporting evidence put forth in
support of this idea is the similar massive

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.540
rise in not only allergy rates, but of various
auto-immune diseases.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.390
In both cases, there hasn’t been a corresponding
rise in allergy and auto-immune disease rates

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:42.050
in individuals from underdeveloped countries
who get exposed to various pathogens more

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.730
similar to our ancestors throughout history.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.450
On the flipside, children who live in urban
environments, and particularly those without

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.010
siblings, have the highest allergy rates of
all.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.530
(Of course, that extra exposure to pathogens
comes with a cost in things like higher childhood

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.850
mortality rates from said exposure and the
like.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:05.149
So even if the hygiene hypothesis is correct,
it would appear there’s something of a trade-off

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.149
happening here.)

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:12.400
As is now presumably abundantly clear, no
matter how we get allergies, the why is unfortunately

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.680
still the topic of hot debate with little
in the way of concrete answers currently available.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.660
But whether you subscribe to the “recognition”
worm theory or the “alarm system” protecting

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.470
your house theory, rest assured that IgE,
once thought to be mostly useless outside

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.940
of its aid in expelling parasitic worms but
now thought by some to play a significant

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:37.079
beneficial role in early recognition and reaction
to various pathogens, is the molecule responsible

00:12:37.079 --> 00:13:34.930
for all

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.270
the madness.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.240
Along the lines of the idea that the immune
system needs to be exposed to certain things

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.529
to properly develop, one proposed treatment
for certain allergies and auto-immune disorders

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:49.660
is simply introducing parasitic worms to the
body, known as helminthic therapy.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.050
This therapy (usually) uses worms that have
limited negative long term impact on the human

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.420
body and in some cases ones that will be naturally
expelled in due course.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.300
While research in this area is still very
much in the preliminary stages, the early

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.280
results in some cases have been promising
enough to warrant continued research.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.269
For instance, as noted in one survey paper
on the subject, “In initial safety studies

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:15.930
patients with Ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s
disease were given viable, embryonated T.suis

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:22.079
eggs (TSO) and not only was the treatment
well tolerated but a significant disease remission

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:27.720
was observed and although the beneficial effect
was temporary, repeated doses of TSO sustained

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.830
this clinical improvement suggesting a promising
new therapy for IBD…”

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.100
However, it goes on to note that after many
other studies looking at this therapy for

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.639
various immune conditions, “…most of the
experimental data available suggest that once

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:45.570
the allergic reaction is established, helminth
infections can do little to alter this, raising

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.329
the inevitable question whether there is any
true benefit to gain from helminth therapy

00:14:50.329 --> 00:15:02.360
in already allergic individuals.”
