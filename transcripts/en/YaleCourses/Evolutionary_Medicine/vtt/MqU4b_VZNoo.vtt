00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.860
In the last series of lectures we considered the question of what is a patient

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.300
that naturally then prompts the question,
well,
what is the disease?

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.830
We offer classifications of disease that are based on evolutionary.

4
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:17.670
In mechanistic causation.

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.780
We do not see disease as being simply infectious or chronic or degenerative.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.790
We see diseases having a finer,

7
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:31.791
more nuanced kind of a structure that relates boasts of its evolutionary origins

8
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.300
and to the kind of mechanisms that mediate its impact.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.720
So these seven categories of disease are actually going to help us analyze

10
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:45.570
defenses,
maintenance and vulnerability.

11
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.010
The concepts are set up to connect to each other.

12
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120
The first point to make is that the risk of disease varies with both genotype

13
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.440
and with environment.

14
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.180
The way that this graph is set up,

15
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.330
the x axis is just an array of genotypes.

16
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.030
The y axis is the risk of disease going from low to high and every point on the

17
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:18.810
red line represents the genotype and an associated disease risk.

18
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.500
And if you look across that,
it's a rather complex.

19
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.700
We've deliberately sketched a rather complex case environment.

20
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:31.701
D poses a risk of disease for almost all genotypes because virtually every point

21
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:34.470
on the line is above it.

22
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:39.471
So there's some risk of disease and Environment d for All of these genotypes.

23
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.200
But if we look at environment a,

24
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.970
it is posing a risk of disease only for those genotypes that are above that dash

25
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:51.480
line.
There all of the other genotypes are not at risk.

26
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.480
And this is a general picture.

27
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.660
This is something like this could be sketched for any real case for any real

28
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:04.020
disease.
So here are the seven categories

29
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.350
and this deliberately recognizes that the causation of diseases complex.

30
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.480
And at the outset I should say that some diseases belong to more than one

31
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:20.481
category and when that happens it indicates that they have complex causes.

32
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.990
So category one diseases or diseases with genetic causes.

33
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.190
Category two diseases with environmental causes.

34
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.590
Category three diseases that are byproducts of defense systems.

35
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.090
Category four or diseases of homeostasis.

36
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.610
Category five diseases that are caused by lack of maintenance.

37
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.040
Category six diseases caused by stochastic developmental problems.

38
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.200
And category seven are diseases of pregnancy and early development that are

39
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:58.380
caused by maternal fetal and maternal.
Paternal conflict.

40
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.190
So this is one of the more evolutionary of the causes as are the genetic causes.

41
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.750
So diseases that belong to more than one category have multiple causes and an

42
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.610
example is type two diabetes.

43
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.840
It is a disease both of homeostasis and of maintenance.

44
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.390
So category one,
genetic causation.

45
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.040
Genetic diseases are usually caused by mutations in single genes.

46
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.620
They cause disease in any environment and they are often lethal or they often,

47
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.080
if they're not lethal,
they prevent reproduction.

48
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.770
An example might be trisomy 21 here is trisomy 21 three copies of the 21st

49
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.260
chromosome,
cystic fibrosis,

50
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.920
severe combined immunodeficiency and thalassemia.

51
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.830
No specific mechanisms of evolved to protect us against these.

52
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.520
Their prevalence is increasing slightly.

53
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:05.820
His medical progress rescues cases that were previously lethal.

54
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.490
Category two environmental causation.

55
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.833
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

56
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.210
<v 0>so is leading contributors to extrinsic mortality,</v>

57
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.450
the environmental causes or driving natural selection and we have therefore

58
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:27.010
evolved mechanisms to deal with things like this.

59
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.750
There was a gradient going from catastrophic insulted affects all genotypes to

60
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:35.950
mild challenges that just affect a few genotypes that evokes that first

61
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.650
explanatory gene by environment slide.

62
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.100
They include infections,
dysbiosis,
starvation,
malnutrition,
dehydration,

63
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:45.940
hypoxia,

64
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.140
hyper and Hypo thermia mechanical injuries and exposure to Venoms,

65
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.720
toxins and pollutants.
So here's a case of starvation.

66
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.790
This is a survivor of the Andersonville concentration camp.
In the US civil war

67
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.540
is technology and culture reduce the prevalence of these kinds of diseases.

68
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.220
These they then increased the prevalence of the next category,

69
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.100
category three diseases.

70
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.730
Category three diseases are byproducts of defense systems.

71
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.640
They result from the cost of defense,

72
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.820
from deficient and excessive defense and for malfunctions of defense systems.

73
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.040
So these are vulnerabilities often exposed by environmental mismatches.

74
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.620
Many of them are ultimately caused evolutionarily by a conflict between survival

75
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:39.250
and reproduction.
On the one hand and health and wellbeing on the other,

76
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.520
their prevalence has increased is that of the category to environmental diseases

77
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:50.470
has declined and they include immunopathology,
these autoimmune diseases,

78
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.820
asthma,
fibrosis,
Metta plays you haemodynamic and from Thrombo,

79
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:59.640
embolic diseases,
obsessive compulsive disorder,
phobias,
paranoia,

80
00:05:59.641 --> 00:06:01.470
anxiety and panic disorders.

81
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.480
All these can be seen as pro byproducts of defense systems.

82
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.730
<v 0>Then there are the diseases of homeostasis.</v>

84
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.490
They affect physiological systems that are designed to be plastic and
adjustable.

85
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.540
And this design intrinsically makes them vulnerable to dysregulation.

86
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.730
In part,
they result from inappropriate adjustment of homeostatic set points.

87
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.720
So homeostasis and plasticity both enabled diseases when the system is set and

88
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:34.130
locked in the wrong state,

89
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.070
they include obesity is the figure indicates type two diabetes,

90
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:42.140
atherosclerosis,
hypertension,

91
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.650
other cardiovascular diseases and addictive behavior.

92
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.760
They are often exposed by environmental mismatches.

93
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.680
Category five diseases are diseases of maintenance.

94
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.630
These are diseases that are not caused by the presence of some insult,

95
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.790
but by the absence of maintenance,

96
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.260
the decline of maintenance over time causes diseases of aging here evoked by the

97
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:13.220
contrast between an a healthy brain and the brain of someone with severe

98
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.390
Alzheimer's disease.

99
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.180
The diseases of aging affects structures and processes that are most in need of

100
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:22.700
maintenance and most costly to maintain.

101
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.660
These diseases are mediated by antagonistic ply a trophy.

102
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:31.840
If we focus on genetic causes and on trade offs,

103
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.180
if we focus on physiological causes.

104
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.890
<v 1>Okay,</v>

105
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.870
<v 0>the increase in frequency when a drop in in extrinsic mortality extends</v>

106
00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:45.340
lifespan.
So this is one of the consequences of self domestication.

107
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:50.341
We extend lifespan and diseases of maintenance start to appear because our

108
00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:54.520
bodies were not designed to keep us.
We'll maintain that long.

109
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

110
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.660
<v 0>Maintenance processes can prevent these diseases,</v>

111
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.130
but there are no mechanisms in place to secure them once they begin,

112
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.640
so they can be prevented naturally,

113
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.430
but they cannot be cured naturally.

114
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:11.680
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

115
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.120
<v 0>they include neurodegeneration,
Sarcopenia,
age related cancers,</v>

116
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.730
type two diabetes and arthritis.

117
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

118
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.860
<v 0>Category six diseases are caused by stochastic developmental problems.
Problems.</v>

119
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.840
They're either too rare or they're too expensive.
Revolution to fix.

120
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.890
They include trisomy 18 and 21 fetal hydrops diseases of premature delivery,

121
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.850
neonatal respiratory distress,
necrotizing Colitis,
jaundice,

122
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.580
and sudden infant death syndrome.
Sids.

123
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.230
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.230
<v 0>Most diseases in this category are prevented by OCT nutrition and early</v>

125
00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:56.670
spontaneous abortions,
which are the quality control filters.

126
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.910
Some like Preeclampsia have complex causes and they also belong in category

127
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.911
seven so category seven includes diseases that are caused by disruptions of

128
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:11.520
equilibria in conflicts between relatives.

129
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.430
These include diseases of pregnancy such as Preeclampsia or gestational diabetes

130
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.760
of early development,
including abnormal birth weights,

131
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.480
just station times and of blood group incompatibilities.

132
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.570
They may also contribute to,

133
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:31.500
but they're not solely responsible for their causation of mental disorders that

134
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.180
include autism and schizophrenia.

135
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.990
Something we'll return to when we discuss mental disorders.

136
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.320
Now diseases can be viewed from four perspectives.

137
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.810
The first is the patient's perspective.

138
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.040
The disease is a state of not feeling well.
There's pain,
nausea,
fatigue,

139
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.930
discomfort and depression.

140
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

141
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.140
<v 0>The physician's perspective is that a disease consists of abnormal conditions</v>

142
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.760
that produce symptoms compromising patient health who's causes are then sought

143
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.590
so that they can be corrected.

144
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:11.320
The evolutionary perspective of a pathogen is that a disease can produce

145
00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:15.670
symptoms in the host that promoters reproduction or transmission or they can be

146
00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:18.850
unintended byproducts of its interaction with the host.

147
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.470
<v 1>Okay?</v>

148
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.611
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

149
00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:25.700
Evolutionary perspective of the host is that a disease can be a byproduct of

150
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:30.500
prior natural selection.
It can be a substrate for current natural selection,

151
00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:35.501
v effects on reproductive success or it can be a defense mechanism in action,

152
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.570
so all diseases can be viewed from all four perspectives.

153
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.830
All diseases also have both mechanistic and evolutionary explanations.

154
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.600
They are not completely understood until both types of explanation has been

155
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:56.840
given.
For example,
Crohn's disease,

156
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.470
which presents with abdominal pain,
diarrhea and weight loss.

157
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.600
A mechanistic explanation would use the language of genetics development,

158
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.050
the biochemistry of nod receptors,
regulatory t cells,

159
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.840
and the anti inflammatory cytokine ill 10

160
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.660
and evolutionary explanation would talk about mismatch caused by modern hygiene

161
00:11:17.661 --> 00:11:20.540
leading to dysbiosis of a perturbed Microbiota,

162
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.330
focusing probably on a lack of worms.

163
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.200
Both types of explanation contain clues for treatment and we can't really see

164
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.360
why the disease exists the way it does until we have worked through both

165
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.600
no genetic and environmental causes of disease or each of two types.

166
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.200
Genetic causes can be defects or predispositions,

167
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.900
so defects are the category one.

168
00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:54.901
Diseases such as cystic by process predispositions on the other hand are often

169
00:11:55.721 --> 00:12:00.721
poly genic rather than monogenic and are involved more often in environmental

170
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:01.570
interactions.

171
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.450
Environmental causes can be either catastrophic or a cumulative.

172
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.250
Catastrophes include Predator attacks and infections with highly virulent

173
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:15.820
pathogens like SARS,
Mers,
Ebola.

174
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.250
Accumulative effects occur with things like smoking,
overeating,

175
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.990
and lack of exercise,
which affect risks of cardiovascular disease,

176
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:27.730
cancer,
and type two diabetes.

177
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.720
So the differentiation between sudden large effects and then continued smaller

178
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:40.570
accumulative effects is important both for genes and for the environment.

179
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.550
Here is an example of an accumulative environmental effect.

180
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.330
What do you see here is the risk,

181
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:52.510
the adjusted odds ratio over here on the y axis

182
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.610
of developing peripheral arterial disease as a function of the amount of second

183
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:02.800
hand smoke and countered in the environment.

184
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:07.480
So this is hours of exposure per week to second hand smoke and you can see that

185
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:11.920
up to about 20 hours a week.
It's not making too much difference,

186
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:17.410
but from that point on it climbs and it's actually climbing exponentially,

187
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:19.750
so it's curving upward on a regular graph.

188
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:24.751
This is an exponential access over here and increased exposure to secondhand

189
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:29.380
smoke is causing increased risk of peripheral arterial disease.

190
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.340
That is a standard kind of accumulative environmental effect.

191
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.730
Many of the genetic effects on disease are in fact mediated by interactions with

192
00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:48.061
the environment and we refer to that as g by e gene by environment.

193
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.190
Causation?
No.

194
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:53.830
When a disease is caused by an interaction,

195
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.480
it is a mistake to assign responsibility to just one component of the

196
00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:03.430
interaction.
The important effects are actually tied up in the interaction.

197
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.260
So the environmental risks of cancers such as tobacco and air pollution depend

198
00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:10.450
on genotype the see that.

199
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:14.920
Let's revisit the example of variation in an asset deal transferees that we saw

200
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:15.880
in a previous lecture.

201
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.390
A good example of the interactions of genes and environment in determining

202
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:27.370
disease risk is that of the steel transfer races and cancer risk.

203
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.650
We saw that with bladder cancer where those with the combination of the nat two

204
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:33.760
slow Acetylator,

205
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.140
the nat one fastest settled later and current or ever cigarette smoking,

206
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.890
we're 2.7 times more likely to get bladder cancer for colorectal cancer.

207
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.630
Smoking intensity,

208
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:51.631
increased cancer risk among carriers have both in 81 n a t two fastest subtle

209
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.690
leaders much more than in those who did not have those

210
00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.930
and for pancreatic cancer,

211
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:04.700
the nat one polymorphism interacts with dietary mutagenic intake.

212
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:05.901
For example,

213
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:10.901
barbecued meat to increase the risk of pancreatic cancer two and a half times in

214
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:12.980
men,
but not in women.

215
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.300
So to evoke those associations here we have smoking associated with colon cancer

216
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.750
and barbecuing associated with these light liver,
Mata,
uh,

217
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
liver metasticies coming from the pancreas visualized here against the darker

218
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:33.650
red background of the section deliver.

219
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.363
To summarize,

220
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.300
we placed diseases into seven categories that have both mechanical and

221
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.230
evolutionary causes.

222
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.320
Genetic causes can act either catastrophic Lee or through predispositions,

223
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.530
environmental causation connect either catastrophic Lee or through a cumulative

224
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.393
effects.

225
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.540
Many diseases result from g by e interactions that are missing in the classical

226
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:06.050
disease categories

227
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.640
important g by e interactions often occur when genetic effects are apologetic

228
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.010
and environmental effects or accumulative.

229
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.250
And depending on the causation,

230
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.240
organisms either evolved defense mechanisms to protect themselves against the

231
00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:27.140
disease maintenance mechanisms to help prevent disease,

232
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.430
or in some cases,
no such mechanisms at all.
