00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
important but I also realize that if I
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.949
important but I also realize that if I
just stood on my ethics and didn't have

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
just stood on my ethics and didn't have
 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.280
just stood on my ethics and didn't have
a strategy or a vision I wouldn't be
