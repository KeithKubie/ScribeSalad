00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, let's see. The circumference is 10,900, and that must be π  d.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That means that the diameter is 10,900/π, which is about 3.14.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This gives me a diameter of the moon of about 3,470 km.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, to calculate this length--well, this is something you've done plenty of.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is a  simple tree problem.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We have a right triangle, we have the opposite side, and we want the adjacent side.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In fact, we know that the tangent of this angle--the tangent of this is 0.5 degrees--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
has to equal the opposite side d, which is 3,470, over the side we want to calculate--L.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now we can massage this equation a little bit,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
bring L up and tangent down

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and plug this into our calculator,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we get an answer of 398,000 km.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This is really amazing what we've done.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I mean, you've learned a little bit of trig and geometry

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and from that you've calculated the size of the earth, the size of the moon,

00:01:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the distance between the earth and the moon. That's really impressive.
