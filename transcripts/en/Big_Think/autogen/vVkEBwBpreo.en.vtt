are you you know is it a passive
 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.889
are you you know is it a passive
experience as an active experience when

connect the digital to the physical so I

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579
connect the digital to the physical so I
 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.240
connect the digital to the physical so I
think that there's a large gray area now

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250
think that there's a large gray area now
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.400
think that there's a large gray area now
between too much screen time it just

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410
between too much screen time it just
 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.490
between too much screen time it just
needs to be defined a bit better as do

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500
needs to be defined a bit better as do
 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.680
needs to be defined a bit better as do
you mean too much of a passive watching

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690
you mean too much of a passive watching
 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.459
you mean too much of a passive watching
experience or do you mean the ability to

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469

do a lot of different things to be
 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.930
do a lot of different things to be
empowered to create to be given tools

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940
empowered to create to be given tools
 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.109
empowered to create to be given tools
for creative expression to be

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119
for creative expression to be
 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.700
for creative expression to be
problem-solving and collaborative while

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710

more good than bad if in fact it's an
active immersive experience as opposed

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940
active immersive experience as opposed
 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.800
active immersive experience as opposed
to a one-way passive experience we call

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810
to a one-way passive experience we call
 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.680
to a one-way passive experience we call
them florals so yeah we've done a lot of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690
them florals so yeah we've done a lot of
 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.960

Generation Z which I think in fairness

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509
Generation Z which I think in fairness
 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.900

comes from you know hey we were
Generation Y we were Generation X so you

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810
Generation Y we were Generation X so you
 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.690

just go down the alphabet but a lot of

people have different names plurals

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170
people have different names plurals
 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.410
people have different names plurals
because of the plurality of the way they

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420
because of the plurality of the way they
 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.359
because of the plurality of the way they
consume content and everything they do

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369
consume content and everything they do
 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.320

it really

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330
it really
 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.260
it really
if Millennials needed lists because they

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270
if Millennials needed lists because they
 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.609
if Millennials needed lists because they
didn't come of age truly the information

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619
didn't come of age truly the information
 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.290
didn't come of age truly the information
revolution was happening around them and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300
revolution was happening around them and
 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.210
revolution was happening around them and
they needed help filters sorting things

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220
they needed help filters sorting things
 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.580
they needed help filters sorting things
out this generation doesn't they are

really comfortable with choice and they
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.030
really comfortable with choice and they
actually want to control it and if you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040
actually want to control it and if you
 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.500
actually want to control it and if you
don't move quick enough for them like

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
don't move quick enough for them like
 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.330

Thomas Friedman thank you for being late

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340
Thomas Friedman thank you for being late
 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.920
Thomas Friedman thank you for being late
if you don't move quick enough for them

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930
if you don't move quick enough for them
 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.420
if you don't move quick enough for them
they just move on to the next thing

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430
they just move on to the next thing
 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.970
they just move on to the next thing
because they really they realize that

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
because they really they realize that
 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.790
because they really they realize that
they have a whole lot of choice and they

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800
they have a whole lot of choice and they
 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.520
they have a whole lot of choice and they
want to control that so I think the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530
want to control that so I think the
 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.440
want to control that so I think the
plurality of everything available to

plurality of everything available to
 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.420
plurality of everything available to
them is more indicative than just the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.830
that the next one is all about
creativity that you know if there was a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840
creativity that you know if there was a
 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.199
creativity that you know if there was a
time where people would refer to geeks

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209
time where people would refer to geeks
