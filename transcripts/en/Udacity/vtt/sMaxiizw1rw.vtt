00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi there.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.240
Welcome to our lesson on resumes.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.780
I'm Victoria, and
I can't wait to work with you.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.600
In this lesson,
we're going to revamp your old resume.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.820
Why does your resume need this?

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.770
Well, it's because of this number, six.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.260
This is the number of seconds
that recruiters on average

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.570
take to decide if
a candidate is a fit or not.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.450
Your resume needs to be a concise,
clear, and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.080
compelling story of the best
aspects of yourself.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.980
In addition, your resume needs
to be thoughtfully targeted for

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.580
the exact job you're applying for,
and formatted so

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.520
that recruiters can easily recognize and
read it.
