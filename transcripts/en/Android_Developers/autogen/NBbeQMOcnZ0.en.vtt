00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
like this product image set that set
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.890
like this product image set that set
this set is like why did I study

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
this set is like why did I study
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660
this set is like why did I study
computer science for this I don't think

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
computer science for this I don't think
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.210
computer science for this I don't think
so yeah

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220
so yeah
 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.950

bling did you see it let's look at your
 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.360
bling did you see it let's look at your
code in a little bit detail I see this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370
code in a little bit detail I see this
 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.830
code in a little bit detail I see this
set party why are you using calling from

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840
set party why are you using calling from
 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.550
set party why are you using calling from
on create right that's just a pain let's

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560
on create right that's just a pain let's
 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.090
on create right that's just a pain let's
get rid of it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100
get rid of it
 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.970
get rid of it
we don't want that instead let's look at

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980
we don't want that instead let's look at
 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.170
we don't want that instead let's look at
this on create let's instead just bind

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180
this on create let's instead just bind
 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.570
this on create let's instead just bind
your layout to this binding code and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580
your layout to this binding code and
 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.970
your layout to this binding code and
then set the product on there and let

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980
then set the product on there and let
 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.700
then set the product on there and let
the binding take care of all the work

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710
the binding take care of all the work
 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.660
the binding take care of all the work
hmm sound good

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670
hmm sound good
 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.280
hmm sound good
a little better let's see how about that

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290
a little better let's see how about that
 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.040
a little better let's see how about that
I'm Scott all right let's look at your

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050
I'm Scott all right let's look at your
 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.010
I'm Scott all right let's look at your
layout wow you have a lot of ellipses in

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020
layout wow you have a lot of ellipses in
 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.310
layout wow you have a lot of ellipses in
your layout man what's up with that all

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320
your layout man what's up with that all
 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.740
your layout man what's up with that all
right so to make sure that we understand

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750
right so to make sure that we understand
 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.280
right so to make sure that we understand
that it's a data binding layout first we

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290
that it's a data binding layout first we
 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.919
that it's a data binding layout first we
add this layout tag to the outside and

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929
add this layout tag to the outside and
 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.560
add this layout tag to the outside and
then we get this variable the the prod

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570
then we get this variable the the prod
 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.690
then we get this variable the the prod
variable that we set in the in the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700
variable that we set in the in the
 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.229
variable that we set in the in the
oncreate right and then we can use that

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239
oncreate right and then we can use that
 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.300
oncreate right and then we can use that
part of arable anywhere in our layout so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310
part of arable anywhere in our layout so
 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.720
part of arable anywhere in our layout so
instead of this ID we can now access

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
instead of this ID we can now access
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.810
instead of this ID we can now access
that pod lay a pod variable so for

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820
that pod lay a pod variable so for
 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.610
that pod lay a pod variable so for
example in the source it's a it's an

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620
example in the source it's a it's an
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.440
example in the source it's a it's an
image drawable so we can access it

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
image drawable so we can access it
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.199
image drawable so we can access it
directly the prod name the product name

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209
directly the prod name the product name
 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.460
directly the prod name the product name
it's a string and same with the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
it's a string and same with the
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.699
it's a string and same with the
description there is a bug door oh there

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709
description there is a bug door oh there
 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.930
description there is a bug door oh there
you go you set a price the crash shoot

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940
you go you set a price the crash shoot
 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.800
you go you set a price the crash shoot
all right well our price is well if you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810
all right well our price is well if you
 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.570
all right well our price is well if you
look at the code there it was a it's a

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580
look at the code there it was a it's a
 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.790
look at the code there it was a it's a
resource right and our resource is

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800
resource right and our resource is
 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.220
resource right and our resource is
coming as a string and it's doing a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
coming as a string and it's doing a
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.020
coming as a string and it's doing a
format we should do better in our

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030
format we should do better in our
 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.390
format we should do better in our
expression right I expect I think so all

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400
expression right I expect I think so all
 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.030
expression right I expect I think so all
right so one good thing is that now we

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
right so one good thing is that now we
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.660
right so one good thing is that now we
can access our layout our expression

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
can access our layout our expression
 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.190
can access our layout our expression
stuff directly in our layout so we can

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200
stuff directly in our layout so we can
 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.600
stuff directly in our layout so we can
have this access to this string resource

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610
have this access to this string resource
 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.850
have this access to this string resource
right there and pass a parameter we're

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860
right there and pass a parameter we're
 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.530
right there and pass a parameter we're
passing the product price as a parameter

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540
passing the product price as a parameter
 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.560
passing the product price as a parameter
in our resource no layout looks pretty

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570
in our resource no layout looks pretty
 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.970
in our resource no layout looks pretty
cool huh

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.910
okay so but in my application things are

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920
okay so but in my application things are
 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.070
okay so but in my application things are
not always static George I'm cool with

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080
not always static George I'm cool with
 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080
not always static George I'm cool with
your demo but I have this application

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
your demo but I have this application
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.940
your demo but I have this application
where sometimes I hear a different

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
where sometimes I hear a different
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.830
where sometimes I hear a different
layout right like yes there you go

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840
layout right like yes there you go
 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.420

it might be all say like how do I do
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.400
it might be all say like how do I do
this I can need to write more code to do

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410
this I can need to write more code to do
 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.759

handle that well you have to at least

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890
handle that well you have to at least
 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.460
handle that well you have to at least
tell us when it changes so let's look at

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470
tell us when it changes so let's look at
 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.979
tell us when it changes so let's look at
your product your product has you know a

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989
your product your product has you know a
 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.420
your product your product has you know a
price name and an image you have just

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430
price name and an image you have just
 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.009
price name and an image you have just
extend the base observable class and

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019
extend the base observable class and
 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.470
extend the base observable class and
then we mark the things that you can

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480
then we mark the things that you can
 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.819
then we mark the things that you can
change that are going to change as

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829
change that are going to change as
 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.190
change that are going to change as
bindable and then you have to tell us

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200
bindable and then you have to tell us
 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.840
bindable and then you have to tell us
when it changes so we have this notified

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850
when it changes so we have this notified
 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.330
when it changes so we have this notified
property change and the findable part

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
property change and the findable part
 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.029
property change and the findable part
but like my closest extended base cuz I

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039
but like my closest extended base cuz I
 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.510
but like my closest extended base cuz I
can't extend your class that it's not

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520
can't extend your class that it's not
 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.719
can't extend your class that it's not
come on all right all right fine we can

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729
come on all right all right fine we can
 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.060
come on all right all right fine we can
use it an observable interface instead

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070
use it an observable interface instead
 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.850
use it an observable interface instead
is that it better maybe this will give

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860
is that it better maybe this will give
 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.110
is that it better maybe this will give
you a little bit of help here well give

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
you a little bit of help here well give
 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.270
you a little bit of help here well give
you this property change registry so you

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280
you this property change registry so you
 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:46.450
you this property change registry so you
can just tell us when that happens okay

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460
 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.930
so yeah this is a little easier huh it

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940
so yeah this is a little easier huh it
 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.330
so yeah this is a little easier huh it
would be nice if we could just have

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340
would be nice if we could just have
 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.370
would be nice if we could just have
properties that are themselves

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380
properties that are themselves
 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.680
properties that are themselves
observable isn't it wouldn't it be yeah

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690
observable isn't it wouldn't it be yeah
 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.029
observable isn't it wouldn't it be yeah
here you can access them as if it was

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039
here you can access them as if it was
 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.250
here you can access them as if it was
just the same with the same expression

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260
just the same with the same expression
 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.230

you know you just say your prod damage

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240
you know you just say your prod damage
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.100
you know you just say your prod damage
and even though it's not a drawable

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110
and even though it's not a drawable
 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.870
and even though it's not a drawable
itself we pretend that it's a drawable

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880
itself we pretend that it's a drawable
 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.339
itself we pretend that it's a drawable
it's an observable field and it's

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349
it's an observable field and it's
 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.080
it's an observable field and it's
observable double double for price

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090
observable double double for price
 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.390
observable double double for price
double the price you shouldn't be using

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400
double the price you shouldn't be using
 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.469
double the price you shouldn't be using
double for your prices all right or if

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479
double for your prices all right or if
 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.779
double for your prices all right or if
you have more blobby data like let's

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789
you have more blobby data like let's
 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.279
you have more blobby data like let's
imagine you're coming from JSON and

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289
imagine you're coming from JSON and
 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:26.180
imagine you're coming from JSON and
you're still doing development

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190
you're still doing development
 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.190
you're still doing development
everything's up

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200
everything's up
 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.390
everything's up
err you don't know what your what's

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400
err you don't know what your what's
 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.060
err you don't know what your what's
gonna be like you can use a map and

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070
gonna be like you can use a map and
 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.960
gonna be like you can use a map and
that's pretty nice for prototyping seems

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970
that's pretty nice for prototyping seems
 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.560
that's pretty nice for prototyping seems
interesting abouts multiple layouts

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570
interesting abouts multiple layouts
 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.780
interesting abouts multiple layouts
multiple layers well yeah I guess you

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790
multiple layers well yeah I guess you
 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.330
multiple layers well yeah I guess you
have you have two different you have

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340
have you have two different you have
 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.830
have you have two different you have
different variables into empty snow yeah

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840
different variables into empty snow yeah
 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.870
different variables into empty snow yeah
boy that would be a pain whenever I have

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880
boy that would be a pain whenever I have
 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.600
boy that would be a pain whenever I have

binding will just say oh I only need

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970
binding will just say oh I only need
 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.260
binding will just say oh I only need
these what variables and I'll use those

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270
these what variables and I'll use those
 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.490
these what variables and I'll use those
in my layout the rest of them I'll just

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500
in my layout the rest of them I'll just
 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.680
in my layout the rest of them I'll just
not use it all you just set it and

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690
not use it all you just set it and
 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.200

just tying it so you can just set it
 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.280
just tying it so you can just set it
right there in your layout file but

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.290
right there in your layout file but
 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.420
right there in your layout file but
there's no attribute

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430
there's no attribute
 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.530
there's no attribute
there's no attribute for that well we

there's no attribute for that well we
 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.710
there's no attribute for that well we
can just kind of sneak in and say Oh set

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720
can just kind of sneak in and say Oh set
 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.960

going to go into some details on how it

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.130
going to go into some details on how it
 

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.190
going to go into some details on how it
actually works

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200
actually works

so as you're showed before the layouts

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.110
so as you're showed before the layouts
 

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.570
so as you're showed before the layouts
are little different now you have a

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:45.580
are little different now you have a
 

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.090
are little different now you have a

layout take in the route this tells us
 

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.420
layout take in the route this tells us
the set data winding layout and we pass

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:51.430
the set data winding layout and we pass
 

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.640
the set data winding layout and we pass
it into the layout grinder which

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:53.650
it into the layout grinder which
 

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.670
it into the layout grinder which
processes your layouts and then expose a

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680
processes your layouts and then expose a
 

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.380
processes your layouts and then expose a
new layout that the older Android

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:58.390
new layout that the older Android
 

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.180
new layout that the older Android
versions can understand which doesn't

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.190
versions can understand which doesn't
 

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.770

have the layout take anymore we move the

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:01.780
have the layout take anymore we move the
 

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.290
have the layout take anymore we move the
namespaces to your first child and it

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:04.300
namespaces to your first child and it
 

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.750
namespaces to your first child and it
also has some sub products from the

all these like public final fields for
your wheels with IDs and it creates the

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:13.660
your wheels with IDs and it creates the
 

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.770
your wheels with IDs and it creates the
setters for your variables so you can do

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:16.780
setters for your variables so you can do
 

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.510
setters for your variables so you can do
detail this is what actually is

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:18.520
detail this is what actually is
 

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.780
detail this is what actually is
happening we move that namespace to your

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:21.790
happening we move that namespace to your
 

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.610

first child gets it off the layout tag

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:23.620
first child gets it off the layout tag
 

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.440
first child gets it off the layout tag
and this is done while their application

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.450
and this is done while their application
 

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:31.200
and this is done while their application
is compiled by Gradle and then we remove

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.210
is compiled by Gradle and then we remove
 

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.540

your expressions add some text there so

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:33.550
your expressions add some text there so
 

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.430
your expressions add some text there so
we can find those weaves afterwards and

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440
we can find those weaves afterwards and
 

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.770
we can find those weaves afterwards and
if you had an idea we would keep it

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:37.780
if you had an idea we would keep it
 

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.490
if you had an idea we would keep it
there and also create the wheel as you

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:41.500
there and also create the wheel as you
 

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.110
there and also create the wheel as you
can see there directly matching the

because we know what type it is at

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.420
because we know what type it is at
 

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.210
because we know what type it is at
compile time which so we just create a

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:48.220
compile time which so we just create a
 

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:54.210
compile time which so we just create a
variable with that type okay so how do

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:54.220
variable with that type okay so how do
 

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.070
variable with that type okay so how do
we do this so one important aspect of

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.080
we do this so one important aspect of
 

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.870
we do this so one important aspect of
data binding is that almost everything

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880
data binding is that almost everything
 

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.850
data binding is that almost everything
is done at compile time so when we see

00:10:59.850 --> 00:10:59.860
is done at compile time so when we see
 

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.580
is done at compile time so when we see
an expression like this we while your

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:02.590
an expression like this we while your
 

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.550
an expression like this we while your
Java code is being compiled we go check

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560

so let's talk about something a little

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:56.150
so let's talk about something a little
 

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.550
so let's talk about something a little
bit more complicated in a set text right

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560
bit more complicated in a set text right
 

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.560
bit more complicated in a set text right
we accept text was a nice automatic

variable you can just set text it takes

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:01.520
variable you can just set text it takes
 

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.540
variable you can just set text it takes
in a string or actually test takes in a

special language right I don't like this
 

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.450
special language right I don't like this
is just - that we don't want to see that

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:49.460
is just - that we don't want to see that
 

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.060
is just - that we don't want to see that
in our expressions anyway so let's do

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:52.070
in our expressions anyway so let's do
 

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.830
in our expressions anyway so let's do
something a little simpler instead what

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:53.840
something a little simpler instead what
 

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.940
something a little simpler instead what
we're gonna do is create a binding

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:54.950
we're gonna do is create a binding
 

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.860
we're gonna do is create a binding
adapter and we're gonna use the the

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:56.870
adapter and we're gonna use the the
 

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.510
adapter and we're gonna use the the
Android source we're gonna override what

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:58.520
Android source we're gonna override what
 

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.790
Android source we're gonna override what
the default behavior is with our binding

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800
the default behavior is with our binding
 

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.500
the default behavior is with our binding
adapter and instead of doing the normal

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:02.510
adapter and instead of doing the normal
 

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.700
adapter and instead of doing the normal
stuff we're gonna try to do some special

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:03.710
stuff we're gonna try to do some special
 

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.710
stuff we're gonna try to do some special
so what we're going to do is I set this

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720
so what we're going to do is I set this
 

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.290
so what we're going to do is I set this
binding adapter of course this is an

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:07.300
binding adapter of course this is an
 

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.990
binding adapter of course this is an

to look for that static method but the

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:16.910
to look for that static method but the
 

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.290
to look for that static method but the
the attribute the annotation and here

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:20.300
the attribute the annotation and here
 

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.180
the attribute the annotation and here
we're gonna look for something that is

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:22.190
we're gonna look for something that is
 

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.920
we're gonna look for something that is
an image view and it takes in a string

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:23.930
an image view and it takes in a string
 

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.830
an image view and it takes in a string
as a parameter okay and now what we can

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:26.840
as a parameter okay and now what we can
 

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.080
as a parameter okay and now what we can
do is do anything we want in that class

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.090
do is do anything we want in that class
 

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.250
do is do anything we want in that class
so we have this nice Picasso we can use

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:33.260
so we have this nice Picasso we can use
 

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.320
so we have this nice Picasso we can use
the context from the view we can load it

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:35.330
the context from the view we can load it
 

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
the context from the view we can load it
load the image in there and it can be

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:37.340
load the image in there and it can be
 

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.300
load the image in there and it can be
done all off the UI thread and it's all

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:40.310
done all off the UI thread and it's all
 

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.890
done all off the UI thread and it's all
kind of magic now I can do image source

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:41.900
kind of magic now I can do image source
 

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.700
kind of magic now I can do image source
is equal to some value it's great but

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:45.710
is equal to some value it's great but
 

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:46.870
is equal to some value it's great but
what if you want to do something more

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880
what if you want to do something more
 

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.690
what if you want to do something more
interesting let's imagine you want to do

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:48.700
interesting let's imagine you want to do
 

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.070
interesting let's imagine you want to do
have a placeholder for your annotation

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:51.080
have a placeholder for your annotation
 

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.500
have a placeholder for your annotation
now you have to do this with Picasso in

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:53.510
now you have to do this with Picasso in
 

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.270
now you have to do this with Picasso in
the same call right you can't just say

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:55.280
the same call right you can't just say
 

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.270
the same call right you can't just say
you know in one call it's called the

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:58.280
you know in one call it's called the
 

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.220
you know in one call it's called the
load and the other one you do so what

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:00.230
load and the other one you do so what
 

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.450
load and the other one you do so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna merge it

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:01.460
we're gonna do is we're gonna merge it
 

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.750
we're gonna do is we're gonna merge it
all together into one binding adapter

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:03.760
all together into one binding adapter
 

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.490
all together into one binding adapter
and this one takes two kind of

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:06.500
and this one takes two kind of
 

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.530
and this one takes two kind of
attributes and they can work together

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:08.540
attributes and they can work together
 

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.480
attributes and they can work together
and it just you just take the parameters

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:10.490
and it just you just take the parameters
 

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.310
and it just you just take the parameters
in the order that you've assigned them

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320
in the order that you've assigned them
 

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.490
in the order that you've assigned them
in the annotation and now you can do

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:15.500
in the annotation and now you can do
 

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.890
in the annotation and now you can do
whatever you want in the method and this

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:17.900
whatever you want in the method and this
 

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.140
whatever you want in the method and this
case we're gonna load the URL off thread

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:20.150
case we're gonna load the URL off thread
 

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.580
case we're gonna load the URL off thread
and in the meantime we'll load this

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:21.590
and in the meantime we'll load this
 

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:31.240
and in the meantime we'll load this
placeholder image now sometimes you want

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:31.250
placeholder image now sometimes you want
 

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.950
placeholder image now sometimes you want
to have some kind of instance

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:32.960
to have some kind of instance
 

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.890
to have some kind of instance
information in your adapter and before

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:35.900
information in your adapter and before
 

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.230
information in your adapter and before
we were using static methods right but

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240
we were using static methods right but
 

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.130
we were using static methods right but
what happens if you want to use an

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:39.140
what happens if you want to use an
 

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.220
what happens if you want to use an
instance all right if there's a static

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.230
instance all right if there's a static
 

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.690
instance all right if there's a static
method it's easy we know what to do we

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:43.700
method it's easy we know what to do we
 

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.030
method it's easy we know what to do we
can call it directly just my class dot

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040
can call it directly just my class dot
 

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.610
can call it directly just my class dot
static method call very simple to do and

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:48.620
static method call very simple to do and
 

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.680
static method call very simple to do and
your the generated binding class that we

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:50.690
your the generated binding class that we
 

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.480
your the generated binding class that we
don't have how do you get the instance

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.490
don't have how do you get the instance
 

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.150
don't have how do you get the instance
so yeah I mean we strap take out this

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160
so yeah I mean we strap take out this
 

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.990
so yeah I mean we strap take out this
direct what happens where does the

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000
direct what happens where does the
 

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.120
direct what happens where does the
instance come from did you some kind of

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.130
instance come from did you some kind of
 

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.350
instance come from did you some kind of
instance so what we're gonna do is the

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360
instance so what we're gonna do is the
 

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.720
instance so what we're gonna do is the
binding framework is going to look and

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:07.730
binding framework is going to look and
 

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.550
binding framework is going to look and
see oh this is an instance binding

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:09.560
see oh this is an instance binding
 

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.500
see oh this is an instance binding
adapter we need to generate this method

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:11.510
adapter we need to generate this method
 

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.329
adapter we need to generate this method
on this class this data binding

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:13.339
on this class this data binding
 

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.460
on this class this data binding
component class and this method is going

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:15.470
component class and this method is going
 

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.900
component class and this method is going
to be called get whatever the name of

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:16.910
to be called get whatever the name of
 

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.650
to be called get whatever the name of
your your adapter method adapter classes

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:20.660
your your adapter method adapter classes
 

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.069
your your adapter method adapter classes
and now it's your job your job to

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079
and now it's your job your job to
 

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.960
and now it's your job your job to
implement this method in prevent this

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:25.970
implement this method in prevent this
 

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.060
implement this method in prevent this
class so you move to this class and then

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.070
class so you move to this class and then
 

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.310
class so you move to this class and then
you call set default component on it now

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320
you call set default component on it now
 

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.230
you call set default component on it now
there's also ones if you want to load a

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240
there's also ones if you want to load a
 

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.970
there's also ones if you want to load a
specific implementation for a specific

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:35.980
specific implementation for a specific
 

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.960
specific implementation for a specific
binding if you want but most of the time

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:37.970
binding if you want but most of the time
 

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:38.980
binding if you want but most of the time
you probably want just a default

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:38.990
you probably want just a default
 

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.080
you probably want just a default
component that you're going to load and

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.090
component that you're going to load and
 

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.100
component that you're going to load and
then you can then we know exactly what

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.110
then you can then we know exactly what
 

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.710
then you can then we know exactly what
instance we're going to load for your

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720
instance we're going to load for your
 

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:52.870
instance we're going to load for your
for your binding adapter very nice now

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880
for your binding adapter very nice now
 

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.490
for your binding adapter very nice now
you can also do this with components now

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:54.500
you can also do this with components now
 

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.960
you can also do this with components now
when you're doing with the component if

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:55.970
when you're doing with the component if
 

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.750
when you're doing with the component if
you have some kind of state you want to

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760
you have some kind of state you want to
 

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.060
you have some kind of state you want to
get imagine this is a cache for your

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.070
get imagine this is a cache for your
 

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.950
get imagine this is a cache for your
images right so you want to you know

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960
images right so you want to you know
 

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.690
images right so you want to you know
load the image from your cache first and

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:04.700
load the image from your cache first and
 

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.260
load the image from your cache first and
then possibly load it off thread in this

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:08.270
then possibly load it off thread in this
 

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.810
then possibly load it off thread in this
case you know we need to go and what

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:10.820
case you know we need to go and what
 

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.630
case you know we need to go and what
that instance is we're gonna pass it as

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640
that instance is we're gonna pass it as
 

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.730
that instance is we're gonna pass it as
a static method use a stack method but

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:15.740
a static method use a stack method but
 

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.720
a static method use a stack method but
we want to have some kind of instance

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:16.730
we want to have some kind of instance
 

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.010
we want to have some kind of instance
that we're gonna share around to all the

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.020
that we're gonna share around to all the
 

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.200
that we're gonna share around to all the
different binding adapters so in this

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.210
different binding adapters so in this
 

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.350
different binding adapters so in this
case we need to know

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360
case we need to know
 

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.500
case we need to know
what that static that state is so in

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:25.510
what that static that state is so in
 

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.450
what that static that state is so in
this case you implement your data

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:27.460
this case you implement your data
 

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.980
this case you implement your data
binding component but you add your own

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:28.990
binding component but you add your own
 

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.980
binding component but you add your own
method to it okay so when you have your

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:31.990
method to it okay so when you have your
 

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.300
method to it okay so when you have your
own method to it we don't know anything

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:33.310
own method to it we don't know anything
 

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.560
own method to it we don't know anything
about this method this is something that

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:34.570
about this method this is something that
 

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.570
about this method this is something that
you know about but we're gonna pass it

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:36.580
you know about but we're gonna pass it
 

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.880
you know about but we're gonna pass it
to you as the first parameter if you'd

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:38.890
to you as the first parameter if you'd
 

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.690
to you as the first parameter if you'd
like now you can do whatever you want so

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:42.700
like now you can do whatever you want so
 

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.370
like now you can do whatever you want so
we have our own cash here that we can

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:44.380
we have our own cash here that we can
 

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.690
we have our own cash here that we can
load our data from I still have talked a

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:48.700
load our data from I still have talked a
 

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.970
load our data from I still have talked a
little about best practices okay yeah

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:50.980
little about best practices okay yeah
 

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.860
little about best practices okay yeah
let's go through some existing practice

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:52.870
let's go through some existing practice
 

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:59.330
let's go through some existing practice

if design is this method you can just

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.110
if design is this method you can just
 

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.499
if design is this method you can just
create a subcomponent button plus the

00:24:22.499 --> 00:24:22.509
create a subcomponent button plus the
 

00:24:22.509 --> 00:24:25.259
create a subcomponent button plus the
data binding component and just returns

00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:25.269
data binding component and just returns

your image adapter this is very nice for

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159
your image adapter this is very nice for
 

00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:29.279
your image adapter this is very nice for
testing so that while the test is

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:29.289
testing so that while the test is
 

00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:31.200
testing so that while the test is
running you can basically set the

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.210
running you can basically set the
 

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.480
running you can basically set the
default or do nothing because no one was

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:33.490
default or do nothing because no one was
 

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.879

to call network during a test unless you

00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:35.889
to call network during a test unless you
 

00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:39.539
to call network during a test unless you
are testing network so I have this mock

00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:39.549
are testing network so I have this mock
 

00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:42.419
are testing network so I have this mock
version here that I inject during my

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:42.429
version here that I inject during my
 

00:24:42.429 --> 00:24:45.239
version here that I inject during my
test and it just does nothing uses the

00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:45.249
test and it just does nothing uses the
 

00:24:45.249 --> 00:24:48.550
test and it just does nothing uses the
default role

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:48.560
 

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.790
and that does nothing so this works all

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:51.800
and that does nothing so this works all
 

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.480
and that does nothing so this works all
of it

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:52.490

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080
 

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.170
hi so my question is about so when you

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:53.180
hi so my question is about so when you
 

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.270
hi so my question is about so when you
use data mining it's not always obvious

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:55.280
use data mining it's not always obvious
 

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.840
use data mining it's not always obvious
what's happening in the UX editor if you

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:58.850
what's happening in the UX editor if you
 

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.330
what's happening in the UX editor if you
understand what I mean so we would be

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:01.340
understand what I mean so we would be
 

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.610
understand what I mean so we would be
nice to have to be able to provide like

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:03.620
nice to have to be able to provide like
 

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.530
nice to have to be able to provide like
a default product or something to mock

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:05.540
a default product or something to mock
 

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.090
a default product or something to mock
so I can see what a UX looks like in in

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:10.100
so I can see what a UX looks like in in
 

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.460
so I can see what a UX looks like in in
the editor as well yeah that was one of

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:12.470
the editor as well yeah that was one of
 

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.430
the editor as well yeah that was one of
the first things that we talked about

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440
the first things that we talked about
 

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.540
the first things that we talked about
when we were talking to the Android

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:16.550
when we were talking to the Android
 

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.580
when we were talking to the Android
studio team and they were really excited

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:18.590
studio team and they were really excited
 

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.100
studio team and they were really excited
about data binding but you know they're

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:21.110
about data binding but you know they're
 

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.930
about data binding but you know they're
working on as you saw in the last talk

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:22.940
working on as you saw in the last talk
 

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.280
working on as you saw in the last talk
they were working on some pretty

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.290
they were working on some pretty
 

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.670
they were working on some pretty
exciting things right now and so they're

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:27.680
exciting things right now and so they're
 

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.930
exciting things right now and so they're
going to get to it but they're not there

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:28.940
going to get to it but they're not there
 

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:29.380
going to get to it but they're not there
yet

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:29.390
yet
 

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.780

I mean I can tell the cold collation is

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:31.790
I mean I can tell the cold collation is
 

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.150
I mean I can tell the cold collation is
coming it's very cost so that's that's

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:34.160
coming it's very cost so that's that's
 

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.220
coming it's very cost so that's that's
good news for data mining and there's

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.230
good news for data mining and there's
 

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:42.580
good news for data mining and there's
also things we should

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:42.590
 

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.490
is it possible to inflate view stop

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:45.500
is it possible to inflate view stop
 

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.680
is it possible to inflate view stop
according to that data binding

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:47.690
according to that data binding
 

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.500
according to that data binding
you said inflate new stuff new stuff new

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:50.510
you said inflate new stuff new stuff new
 

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.190
you said inflate new stuff new stuff new
stuff oh yes

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200
stuff oh yes
 

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.360
stuff oh yes
yeah so viewstub there's a special

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:54.370
yeah so viewstub there's a special
 

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.890
yeah so viewstub there's a special
implementation for you stub because you

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:56.900
implementation for you stub because you
 

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.940
implementation for you stub because you
stub is a as you saw we have final

00:26:59.940 --> 00:26:59.950
stub is a as you saw we have final
 

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.400
stub is a as you saw we have final
classes the final fields so we have a

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:03.410
classes the final fields so we have a
 

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.620
classes the final fields so we have a
viewstub proxy final field for that

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:05.630
viewstub proxy final field for that
 

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.840
viewstub proxy final field for that
because view step actually replaces

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:07.850
because view step actually replaces
 

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.150
because view step actually replaces
itself with a view so we can't do a

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:10.160
itself with a view so we can't do a
 

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.190
itself with a view so we can't do a
replacement for a final field right so

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.200
replacement for a final field right so
 

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.690
replacement for a final field right so
we have a few sub proxy and you can get

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:13.700
we have a few sub proxy and you can get
 

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.630
we have a few sub proxy and you can get
either the view stub or the or the

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640
either the view stub or the or the
 

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.390
either the view stub or the or the
replaced view with it depending on its

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:19.400
replaced view with it depending on its
 

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.490
replaced view with it depending on its
status okay and it is possible to pass

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:23.500
status okay and it is possible to pass
 

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.950
status okay and it is possible to pass
data model to like underlying clay out

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960
data model to like underlying clay out
 

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.090
data model to like underlying clay out
yeah so when you created you use the

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:31.100
yeah so when you created you use the
 

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.040
yeah so when you created you use the
same expression as if you are passing an

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:33.050
same expression as if you are passing an
 

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.500
same expression as if you are passing an
attribute and if there's a binding for

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:35.510
attribute and if there's a binding for
 

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.470
attribute and if there's a binding for
that cause we know to create the binding

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480
that cause we know to create the binding
 

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.390
that cause we know to create the binding
for that class and pass that variable as

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:40.400
for that class and pass that variable as
 

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.970
for that class and pass that variable as
the variable changes cool thank you

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:44.980
the variable changes cool thank you
 

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:49.060
the variable changes cool thank you

layout correctly yes sometime there is

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:52.340
layout correctly yes sometime there is
 

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.830
layout correctly yes sometime there is
just black screen or something like this

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840
just black screen or something like this
 

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.680
just black screen or something like this
I'm going to improve this and will it

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:56.690
I'm going to improve this and will it
 

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.260
I'm going to improve this and will it
work with data bound binding also so we

00:27:59.260 --> 00:27:59.270
work with data bound binding also so we
 

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.710
work with data bound binding also so we
are we're constantly improving the

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720
are we're constantly improving the
 

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.250
are we're constantly improving the
Android studio layout editor so that's

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260
Android studio layout editor so that's
 

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.720
Android studio layout editor so that's
gonna get better and better over time

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:05.730
gonna get better and better over time
 

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.320
gonna get better and better over time
absolutely okay thank you I was

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:09.330
absolutely okay thank you I was
 

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.840
absolutely okay thank you I was
wondering you shot the image loading

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:11.850
wondering you shot the image loading
 

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.700
wondering you shot the image loading
examples yes how would you go about

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:13.710
examples yes how would you go about
 

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.430
examples yes how would you go about
cancelling the loads when your you are

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440
cancelling the loads when your you are
 

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.100
cancelling the loads when your you are
torn down somewhere you you have the

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.110
torn down somewhere you you have the
 

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.409
torn down somewhere you you have the
bindings

00:28:20.409 --> 00:28:20.419
bindings
 

00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:24.230
bindings
so you can mullet so for example you

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240
so you can mullet so for example you
 

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.060
so you can mullet so for example you
create the binding like how what what

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.070
create the binding like how what what
 

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.440
create the binding like how what what
are you trying to Castle is the let's

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:27.450
are you trying to Castle is the let's
 

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.450
are you trying to Castle is the let's
say you were trying to load user image

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460
say you were trying to load user image
 

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.520
say you were trying to load user image
URL and then they mature I'll disappear

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:31.530
URL and then they mature I'll disappear
 

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.010
URL and then they mature I'll disappear
tour now I mean like in Picasa you can

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020
tour now I mean like in Picasa you can
 

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.070
tour now I mean like in Picasa you can
pass attack and then cancel every loads

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080
pass attack and then cancel every loads
 

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.539
pass attack and then cancel every loads
on those tags for example when your

00:28:38.539 --> 00:28:38.549
on those tags for example when your
 

00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:39.830
on those tags for example when your
fragment goes away or something like

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840
fragment goes away or something like
 

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.350
fragment goes away or something like
that you could be I mean one option will

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360
that you could be I mean one option will
 

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.270
that you could be I mean one option will
be passing that tag as well to the

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:44.280
be passing that tag as well to the
 

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.250
be passing that tag as well to the
binding adapter and now you can castle

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.260
binding adapter and now you can castle
 

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.039
binding adapter and now you can castle
through Picasa or if there's some

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:49.049
through Picasa or if there's some
 

00:28:49.049 --> 00:28:51.320
through Picasa or if there's some
variable in your model that can control

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:51.330
variable in your model that can control
 

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.419
variable in your model that can control
that then again the binding adapter can

00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:53.429
that then again the binding adapter can
 

00:28:53.429 --> 00:28:55.159
that then again the binding adapter can
handle the castling okay that's no

00:28:55.159 --> 00:28:55.169
handle the castling okay that's no
 

00:28:55.169 --> 00:28:58.399
handle the castling okay that's no
really a callback for tearing down you

00:28:58.399 --> 00:28:58.409
really a callback for tearing down you
 

00:28:58.409 --> 00:29:00.140
really a callback for tearing down you
compress a callback variable if you are

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:00.150
compress a callback variable if you are
 

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.289
compress a callback variable if you are
for for the wheel steering down no there

00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299
for for the wheel steering down no there
 

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:04.940
for for the wheel steering down no there
is no I mean you know when the view is

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:04.950
is no I mean you know when the view is
 

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.860
is no I mean you know when the view is
going away through the Android view life

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:06.870
going away through the Android view life
 

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.350
going away through the Android view life
cycle and there are callback methods

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360
cycle and there are callback methods
 

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.149
cycle and there are callback methods
that you can assign to this binding

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159
that you can assign to this binding
 

00:29:11.159 --> 00:29:13.220
that you can assign to this binding
class you can even say hey like stop

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.230
class you can even say hey like stop
 

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.460
class you can even say hey like stop
don't rewind I know they they ban the

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:16.470
don't rewind I know they they ban the
 

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.590
don't rewind I know they they ban the
data changes the generated binding

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600
data changes the generated binding
 

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.930
data changes the generated binding
Clause calls your Kovach I'm about to

Clause calls your Kovach I'm about to
 

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.120
Clause calls your Kovach I'm about to
rebuy it and then you can say no don't

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:23.130
rebuy it and then you can say no don't
 

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.090
rebuy it and then you can say no don't
stop boundary bind and you say that you

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100
stop boundary bind and you say that you
 

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.799
stop boundary bind and you say that you
are responsible to tell it to remind

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:27.809
are responsible to tell it to remind
 

00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:29.210
are responsible to tell it to remind
whenever you want which is very useful

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220
whenever you want which is very useful
 

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.100

upset if you update the views themselves

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:34.980
upset if you update the views themselves
 

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.100
upset if you update the views themselves
directly so if your I think it's

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:37.110
directly so if your I think it's
 

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.020
directly so if your I think it's
recycler view adapter you say not bond

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:39.030
recycler view adapter you say not bond
 

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.909
recycler view adapter you say not bond
change and then transit through the

00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919
change and then transit through the
 

00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:43.779
change and then transit through the
recycle reviews like item change for

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:43.789
recycle reviews like item change for
 

00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:50.169
recycle reviews like item change for
okay I think that answers my question

00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:50.179
 

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:53.090
what's the best way to debug the

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100
what's the best way to debug the
 

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.860
what's the best way to debug the
expressions that are in the view markup

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:56.870
expressions that are in the view markup
 

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:00.169
expressions that are in the view markup
because it's it's logic effective so if

00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:00.179
because it's it's logic effective so if
 

00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:01.610
because it's it's logic effective so if
there's a bug how do you do bug it how

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620
there's a bug how do you do bug it how
 

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.480
there's a bug how do you do bug it how
do you step through it

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:02.490
do you step through it
 

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.430
do you step through it
well they well you can step through the

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440
well they well you can step through the
 

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.320
well they well you can step through the
code this code the source code that we

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:06.330
code this code the source code that we
 

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.630
code this code the source code that we
generate is actually visible to you it's

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640
generate is actually visible to you it's
 

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.490
generate is actually visible to you it's
it's generated and you can step through

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500
it's generated and you can step through
 

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.080
it's generated and you can step through
it if you need to it's a little it's

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:13.090
it if you need to it's a little it's
 

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.550
it if you need to it's a little it's
it's a little bit on the uglier side

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:14.560
it's a little bit on the uglier side
 

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.190
it's a little bit on the uglier side
because it's generating code but you

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200
because it's generating code but you
 

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.090
because it's generating code but you
can't step through it okay but you

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:21.100
can't step through it okay but you
 

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.950
can't step through it okay but you
should try to limit like how what your

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960
should try to limit like how what your
 

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.390
should try to limit like how what your
expressions look like now we have some

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:24.400
expressions look like now we have some
 

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400
expressions look like now we have some
things that are make it a lot easier for

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:26.410
things that are make it a lot easier for
 

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.740
things that are make it a lot easier for
you so that you'll have fewer bugs for

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:28.750
you so that you'll have fewer bugs for
 

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.570
you so that you'll have fewer bugs for
example we have an old coalescent

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:30.580
example we have an old coalescent
 

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.970
example we have an old coalescent
