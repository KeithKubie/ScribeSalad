How Many Burgers Come from One Cow? ...and
8 other food facts.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.730
1.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.500
Other than the color of the shell, there is
no difference between commercial brown shelled

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.670
chicken eggs and a white shelled ones.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.650
Non-commercial eggs from chickens may taste
slightly different, due to difference in diet,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.080
but a chicken that lays white eggs will produce
an egg that is by taste and nutrition the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.930
same as the eggs produced by a chicken that
lays brown eggs with the same diet.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.930
(QF: 585)

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.930
2.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.289
An average beef cow (200 kg of usable meat)
produces enough meat to make about 4,500 hamburgers

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.289
at McDonalds.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.289
(QF: 482)

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:33.289
3.

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.480
About 3 billion pounds of potatoes are used
to make McDonald’s fries every year.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.940
This is about 8% of all potatoes grown in
the United States or a half a percent of all

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.989
potatoes grown in the world per year.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:43.999
(QF: 479)

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:44.999
4.

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.870
Common foods that are naturally radioactive
include potatoes, bananas, sunflower seeds,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.050
Brazil nuts, and kidney beans, among others.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:59.299
Brazil nuts are the most radioactive by far
at 6600 picocuries per kg or about 1.875 BED

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.559
(banana equivalent dose).

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.519
The radium in Brazil nuts does not come from
especially high levels of radium in the soil

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.729
where the trees grow, but rather the very
extensive root systems the trees develop,

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.369
which cover a much larger area of the soil
than most trees.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.369
5.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.380
The most expensive coffee is coffee where
the berries go through the digestive tract

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.950
of the Kopi Luwak (a small cat-sized Indonesian
animal).

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.700
The “beans” are then harvested from the
animal’s waste, cleaned, roasted, and sold.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.500
This coffee costs $100 to $600 per pound.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.930
Just like when you buy food, in the end, you
are essentially paying for poop.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.930
6.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.250
Archeological evidence suggests that the earliest
known purposefully fermented drink, specifically

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.609
beer, was made all the way back in the late
Stone Age around 10,000 BC, also making it

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.140
one of the earliest known prepared food substance
along with bread, which dates back to around

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.200
the same time.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.229
The earliest references to wine being made
are found in Egypt around 4000 BC.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.229
7.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.829
The now common “Fish and Chips” combo
originated in Britain around 1860.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.969
For nearly 200 years before that, fish vendors
had been serving fried fish on the streets

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:06.969
of Britain.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.930
Sometime around the mid-19th century, one
of them got the bright idea to serve thick

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.190
cut French fries with the fried fish, with
the first known “Fish and Chip” eatery

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.870
opened by Joseph Malin in 1860.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.160
After this, the popular combo rapidly spread
throughout Britain and the world.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160
8.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.390
Grapes explode when microwaved.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.390
(QF 503)

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.390
9.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.070
Mao Sugiyama from Japan had his testicles
and penis removed when he was 22 and served

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:42.430
them to dinner guests at $250 per plate, with
a total of 6 plates.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.440
(QF 545)
