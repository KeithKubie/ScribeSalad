00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
We've learned over the last
several videos that if we have

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.120
a system undergoing constant
pressure, or it's in an

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.490
environment with constant
pressure, that its change in

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.870
enthalpy is equal to the heat
added to the system.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.570
And I'll write this little
p here, because that's at

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.730
constant pressure.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.780
So if you have a reaction, let's
say A plus B yields C

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.530
and our change in enthalpy-- so
our enthalpy in this state

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.000
minus the change in the enthalpy
in that state-- so

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.860
let's say our change in enthalpy
is less than 0, we

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.520
know that this is exothermic.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.700
Why is that?

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.880
And once again, I'm assuming
constant pressure.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.850
How do we know this is
exothermic, that we're

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.050
releasing energy?

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.950
Because change in enthalpy,
when we're dealing with a

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.360
constant pressure system, is
heat added to the system.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.830
If the heat added to the system
is negative, we must be

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.170
releasing heat.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.710
So we're releasing
heat or energy.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.150
So plus energy.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.880
And we learned in the last
video, I think it was either

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.860
the last video or a couple of
videos ago, we call this an

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.110
exothermic reaction.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.430
And then if you have a reaction
that needs energy--

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:18.310
so let's say you have A plus B
plus some energy yields C,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.630
then what does that mean?

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.860
Well, that means that the
system absorbed energy.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560
The amount of energy
you absorb is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.040
your change in enthalpy.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.530
So your delta H is going
to be positive.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350
Your change in enthalpy
is positive.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.025
You've absorbed energy
into the system.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.270
And we call these endothermic
reactions.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.210
You're absorbing heat.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.880
Now, if we wanted to figure
out whether reaction just

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.170
happens by itself-- whether it's
spontaneous-- it seems

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.560
like this change in enthalpy
is a good candidate.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.820
Obviously, if I'm releasing
energy, I didn't need any

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.280
energy for this reaction to
happen, so maybe this reaction

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.370
is spontaneous.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.480
And likewise, since I'd have to
somehow add energy into the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.200
system, my gut tells me that
this maybe isn't spontaneous.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.220
But there's a little part of me
that says, well, you know,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.169
what if the particles are
running around really fast,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.800
and they have a lot of kinetic
energy that can be used to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.780
kind of ram these particles
together, maybe all of a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.470
sudden this would
be spontaneous.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.680
So maybe enthalpy by itself
wouldn't completely describe

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.930
what's going to happen.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.310
So in order to get a little
intuition, and to maybe build

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.430
up our sense of whether
a reaction happens

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.910
spontaneously, let's think about
the ingredients that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.640
probably matter.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.932
We already know that delta
H probably matters.

00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:40.210
If we release energy-- you know,
delta H less than 0,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.940
that tends to make me think
it might be spontaneous.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.420
But what if our delta S, what
if our entropy goes down?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.790
What if things become
more ordered?

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.920
We've already learned from the
second law of thermodynamics,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.960
that that doesn't tend
to be the case.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.870
And just from personal
experience, we know that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.950
things on their own just don't
kind of go to the macro state

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.720
that has fewer micro
states, you know.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.710
An egg doesn't just put itself
together, and bounce, and kind

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.080
of jump off the floor on its
own, although there's some

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.330
probability it would happen.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.760
So it seems like entropy
matters somewhat.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.720
And then there's the idea
of temperature.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.710
Because I already talked about,
when I talked about

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.360
energy here.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360
I was like, well, you know, even
if this requires energy,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.410
maybe if the temperature is
high enough, maybe I could

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.410
actually ram these particles
together in some way, and kind

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.110
of create energy to go here.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.770
So let's think about--
so let's see.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.320
let's think about the
ingredients, and let's think

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.240
about what the reactions would
look like depending on

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.580
different combinations
of the ingredients.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.390
So the ingredients I'm going to
deal with-- delta H seems

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.040
to definitely matter,
whether or not we

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.780
absorb energy or not.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.640
We have delta S, our
change in entropy.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.230
Does the system take on more
states or fewer states?

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.100
Does it become more
or less ordered?

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.520
And then there's temperature,
which is

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.880
average kinetic energy.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.890
So let's just think about a
whole bunch of situations.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.620
So let's think of
the first case.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.810
Let's think of the situation
where our delta H is less than

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.200
0, and our entropy is
greater than 0.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.630
I mean, my gut already
tells me that

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.490
this is going to happen.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.400
This is a situation where
we're going to be more

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.380
entropic after the reaction.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.860
So one way of looking
at entropy,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.550
you could more states.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.720
Maybe we have more particles.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.590
We've seen that entropy is
related to the number of

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.770
particles we have. So this
could be a reaction where

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.440
let's say we have this--
see, we want

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.250
to have more particles.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.280
So let's say I have that guy.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.060
And say he's got one guy like
that there, and then I have

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.460
another guy like this, and
let's say he's got a

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.260
molecule like this.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.390
Let's say that a more-- well,
I won't say stable or not.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:11.240
But let's say that when these
guys bump into each other, you

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.730
end up with this.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.110
And I'm making things
up on the fly.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.700
Maybe one of these molecules
bonds with this molecule, so

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.160
you have one of the
dark blues.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.180
I'll draw all the dark blues.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.680
Bonds with this light blue
molecule, one of the dark

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.880
blues bonds with the
magenta molecule.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.940
And maybe that brown
molecule just gets

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.570
knocked off all by himself.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.760
So we went from having
two molecules to

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.920
having three molecules.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.170
We have more disorder,
more entropy.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.990
This can obviously take
on more states.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.260
And I'm telling you that
delta H is less than 0.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.000
So by doing this, these guys,
their electrons are in a lower

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.920
potential, or they're in a more
stable configuration.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.090
So when the electrons go from
their higher potential

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.430
configurations over here, and
they become more stable, they

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.940
release energy.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.350
So you have plus-- and then I
just know that, because I said

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.590
from the beginning that
my change in enthalpy

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.470
is less than 0.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.110
So plus some energy.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.515
So it seems pretty obvious to me
that this reaction is going

00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:19.560
to be spontaneous in this
rightward direction.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.050
Because there's no reason why--
first of all, it's much

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.120
easier for two particles to
bump into each other just

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.330
right to go in that direction
than it is for three

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.520
particles-- if you just think of
it from a probability point

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.940
of view-- for three particles to
get together just right and

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.160
go in that direction.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.090
And even more, these guys
are more stable.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.420
Their electrons are in a
lower potential state.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.060
So there's no even kind of
enthalpic reason for them to

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.840
move in this direction, or you
know, kind of a energy reason

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.030
for them to move in
this direction.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.540
So this, to me, I kind of have
the intuition that regardless

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.550
of what the temperature is,
we're going to favor this

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.680
forward reaction.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.440
So I would say that this is
probably spontaneous.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.200
Now, what happens-- let's do
something that's maybe a

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.050
little less intuitive.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.090
What happens if my delta
H is less than 0?

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.850
But let's say I lose entropy.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.400
And this seems, you know, with
second law of thermodynamics,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.240
if the entropy of the
universe goes up.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.470
I'm just talking about
my system.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.730
But let's say I lose entropy.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.250
So that would be a situation
where I go from, let's say,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.860
two particles.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.490
Let's say I got that particle,
and then I have this particle.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.040
And then, if they bump into each
other just right, their

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.230
electrons are going to be more
stable, and maybe they form

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.480
this character.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.420
And when they do that, the
electrons can enter into lower

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.350
potential states, and when they
do, the electrons release

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.020
energy, so you have some
plus energy here.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.390
And we know that, because this
was the change in enthalpy was

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.230
less than zero.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.460
We have lower energy in this
state than that one, and the

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.570
difference is released
right here.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.390
Now will this reaction happen?

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.060
Well, it seems like-- let's
introduce our temperature.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.160
What's going to happen
at low temperatures?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.020
At low temperatures, these guys
have a very low average

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.770
kinetic energy.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.510
They're just drifting
around very slowly.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.740
And as they drift around
very slowly--

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.670
And remember, when I talk about

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.200
spontaneity-- I wrote sponteous.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.460
This is spontaneous.

00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:35.570
Sponteous should be another
thermodynamic.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.820
It's a fun word.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.440
When I talk about spontaneity,
I'm just talking about whether

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.320
the reaction is just going
to happen on its own.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.180
I'm not talking about
how fast, or

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.370
the rate of the reaction.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.550
That's a key thing to know.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.240
You know, is this
going to happen.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.720
I don't care if it takes, you
know, a million years for the

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.203
thing to happen.

00:09:00.203 --> 00:09:02.890
I just want to know, is it going
to happen on its own?

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.920
So if the temperature is slow,
these guys might be really

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.670
creeping along, barely bumping
into each other.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.790
But they will eventually
bump into each other.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.640
And when they do, they're just
drifting past each other.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.310
And when they drift past each
other, they will configure

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.510
themselves in a way-- things
want to go to a lower

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.270
potential state.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.880
I'm just trying to give you kind
of a hand-wavey, rough

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.090
intuition of things.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.590
But because this will release
energy, and it will go to a

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.690
lower potential state, the
electrons kind of configure

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.820
themselves when they get near
each other, and enter into

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.510
this state.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.990
And they release energy.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.510
And once the energy is gone, and
maybe it's in the form of

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.290
heat or whatever it is, it's
hard to kind of get it back

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.350
and go on in other direction.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.620
So it seems like this would
be spontaneous if the

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.450
temperature is low.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.210
So let me write that.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:57.250
Spontaneous if the
temperate is low.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.750
Now what happens if the
temperature is high?

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.340
Remember, these aren't the
only particles here.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.000
We have more.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.090
You know, I'll have another
guy like that, and

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.430
another guy like that.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.020
And then this, on this
side, I'll have,

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.330
you know, more particles.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.040
There's obviously not
just one particle.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.500
Then all of these macro
variables really make no

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.360
sense, if we're just talking
about particular molecules.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.450
We're talking about
entire systems.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.440
But what happens here if
the temperature of

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.150
our system is high?

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.280
So let's think of a situation
where the temperature is high.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.520
Now all of a sudden-- so on the
side, people are going to

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.550
be knocking into each other
super fast. You know, if this

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.610
guy bumps into this guy super
fast, you can almost view it

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.540
as a car collision.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.580
Well, even better, this could
be car collision.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.310
If these were each individual
cars, and the atoms were the

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.870
components of the cars, if
they're like smashing into

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.750
each other, even though they
want to be attached to each

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.220
other, they have screws and
whatever else that are holding

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.440
it together-- if two cars run
into each other fast enough,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.130
all that screws and the glue and
the welding won't matter.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.720
They're just going
to blow apart.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.350
So high kinetic energy--
let me draw that.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.910
So if they have high kinetic
energy, my gut tells me that

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.920
on the side of the reaction,
these guys are just going to

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.830
blow each other apart
to this side.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.800
And these guys, since these guys
also have high kinetic

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.340
energy, they're going to be
moving so fast past each

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.640
other, and they're going to
ricochet off of each other so

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.870
fast, that the counteracting
force, or the contracting

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.380
inclination for their electrons
to get more stably

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.170
configured, won't matter.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.720
It's like, imagine trying to
attach a tire to something

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.860
while you're running
past the car.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.380
You kind of have to do it-- even
though that's a more--

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.320
well, maybe the analogy
is getting weak, here.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.290
But I think you get the idea
that if the temperature's

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.590
really high, it seems less
likely that these guys are

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.730
going to kind of drift near each
other just right to be

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.740
able to attach to each other,
and their electrons to get

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.020
more stable, and to do this
whole exothermic thing.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.230
So my sense is that if the
temperature is high enough-- I

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.640
mean, you know, maybe say, oh,
that's not high enough.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.880
But what if it's super
high temperatures?

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.750
If it's super high temperatures,
then maybe even

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.860
this guy will bump into that.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.590
Instead of forming that, he'll
knock this other blue guy off,

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.840
and then he'll be over here.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.820
I should do the blue
guy in blue.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.010
And maybe he'll knock this
guy into his constituent

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.200
particles, if there's enough
kinetic energy.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.330
So here I get the idea that
it's not spontaneous.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.625
And even more, the reverse
reaction, if the temperature

00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:29.870
is high enough, is probably
going to be spontaneous.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.950
If the temperature is high
enough, these guys are going

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.130
to react, are going to bump
into each other, and the

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.380
reaction is going
to go that way.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.890
So temperature is high, you go
that way, temperature is low,

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.300
you go that way.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.580
So let's see if we can put
everything together that we've

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.560
seen so far and kind of come up
with a gut feeling of what

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.890
a formula for spontaneity
would look like.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.170
So we could start
with enthalpy.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.000
So we already know that look, if
this is less than 0, we're

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.256
probably dealing with something
that's spontaneous.

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:03.840
Now let's say I want a whole
expression, where if the whole

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.350
expression is less than 0, it
tells me that it's going to be

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.600
spontaneous.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:18.760
So we know that positive entropy
is something good for

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.510
spontaneity.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.770
We saw that in every
situation here.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.790
That if we have more states,
it's always a good thing.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.100
It's more likely to make
something spontaneous.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.670
Now, we want our whole
expression to be negative if

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.670
it's spontaneous, right?

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.420
So positive entropy should make
my whole expression more

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.350
negative, so maybe we should
subtract entropy.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.800
Right?

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.170
If this is positive, then
my whole expression

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.550
will be more negative.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.590
Which tells me, hey, this
is spontaneous.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.240
So if this is negative, we're
releasing energy.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.860
And then if this is positive,
we're getting more disordered,

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.650
so this whole thing
will be negative.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.360
So that seems good.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.530
Now what if entropy
is negative?

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.340
If entropy is negative, this
also kind of speaks to the

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.720
idea that if entropy is
negative, it kind of makes the

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.360
reaction a little less
spontaneous.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:13.610
Right?

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.100
In this situation, entropy
was negative.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.130
We went from more
disorder to less

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.560
disorder, or fewer particles.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.530
And what did we say?

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:29.070
When temperature is high,
entropy matters a lot.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.680
When temperature is high, this
less entropic state, they ram

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.940
into each other, and they'll
become more entropic.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.560
When temperature is low, maybe
they'll drift close to each

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.030
other, and then the enthalpy
part of the equation will

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.300
matter more.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.550
So let's see if we
can weight that.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.110
So when temperature is high,
entropy matters.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.630
When temperature is low,
entropy doesn't matter.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.880
So what if we just scaled
entropy by temperature?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.000
What if I just took a
temperature variable here?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.850
Now, my claim, or my intuition,
based on everything

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.800
we've experimented so far, is
that if this expression is

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.260
less than 0, we should
be dealing with

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.510
a spontaneous reaction.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.680
And let's see if it gels with
everything we say here.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.050
If the temperature is high--
so this reaction right here

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.630
was exothermic, in the
rightwards direction.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.750
When we go to the right, from
more of these molecules to

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.490
these fewer ones, I told
you it's exothermic.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.900
Now, at low temperatures, my gut
told me, hey, this should

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.510
be spontaneous.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.230
These guys are going to drift
close to each other, and get

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.520
into this more stable
configuration.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.370
And that makes sense.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:39.380
At low temperatures, this term
isn't going to matter much.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.300
You can imagine the extreme.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.370
At absolute 0, this term
is going to disappear.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.190
You can't quite reach
there, but it would

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.390
become less and less.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.330
And this term dominates.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.020
Now, at high temperatures, all
of a sudden, this term is

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.040
going to dominate.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.890
And if our delta S is less than
0, then this whole term

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.190
is going to dominate and
become positive.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:15:59.500
Right?

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.320
And even if this is negative,
we're subtracting.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.510
So our delta S is negative.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.590
We put a negative here.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.540
So this is going to
be a positive.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.530
So this positive, if the
temperature is high enough--

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.260
and remember, we're dealing with
Kelvin, so temperature

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.610
can only be positive.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.500
If this is positive enough,
it will overwhelm

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.810
any negative enthalpy.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.790
And so it won't be spontaneous
anymore.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.720
And so if the temperature is
high enough, this direction

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.940
won't be spontaneous.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.980
And this equation
tells us this.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:32.960
And then if we go to the
negative enthalpy, positive

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.380
entropy, so we're releasing
energy, so this is negative,

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.550
and our entropy is increasing--
our entropy,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.350
we're getting more disordered--
then this becomes

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.500
a negative as well.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.330
So our thing is definitely
going to be negative.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.300
And we already had the sense
that look, if this is negative

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.950
and this is positive, we're
getting more entropic and

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.060
we're releasing energy, that
should definitely be

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:51.610
spontaneous.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.840
And this equation also
speaks to that.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.890
So so far, I feel pretty good
about this equation.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.520
And as you can imagine,
I didn't think of

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.730
this out of the blue.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.850
This actually is the equation
that predicts spontaneity.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.030
And I'm going to show it to
you in a slightly more

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.709
rigorous way in the future,
maybe going back to some of

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:12.710
our fundamental formulas for
entropy and things like that.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.040
But this is the formula for
whether something is

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.589
spontaneous.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.940
And what I wanted to do in this
video is just give you an

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.440
intuition why this formula
kind of makes sense.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.630
And this quantity right here
is called the delta G, or

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.180
change in Gibbs free energy.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.850
And this is what does predict
whether a reaction is

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:29.390
spontaneous.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.250
So in the next video, I'll
actually apply this formula a

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.090
couple of times.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.640
more of how you can actually
get this from some of our

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.120
basic thermodynamic
