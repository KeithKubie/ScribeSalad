00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.370
&gt;&gt; So we’re at Google [INDISTINCT] and now
here we have Paul Berry with us from Huffington

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.990
Post. And, Paul, I’d like you to tell us
a little bit about the print connecting integration

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.330
you did on Huffington Post and that you demoed
at your session yesterday.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.189
&gt;&gt; PAUL BERRY: Great. So, it was--it’s something
that we’ve managed to put live in a lot

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.160
of traffic, and it’s getting great feedback
from users. And it’s--statistically, it’s

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.870
been a big hit; it’s kind off the chart
with the page views that it’s generating.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.309
And the concept is that we always had these
slideshows that were really catchy and really

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.460
well done, and it was a perfect opportunity
to let users get involved and make it social

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.210
so that they could share it out to their activities
stream. They can invite their friends; they

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.250
can send it to Facebook, and the integration
with Friend Connect was really pretty straightforward

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.710
for us. It falls right into our model of making
sure that they can become Huff Post users

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.009
without ever signing up to Huff Post but just
logging in, you know. And so, we’re seeing

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.719
a lot of people everyday to sign in and create
accounts using Friend Connect and also take

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.520
their accounts that they had before as Huff
Post users and say, “How awesome, I can

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.750
connect that to my Friend Connect.” So,
it’s been really exciting and I think the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.229
really key thing for us was a couple of pieces
of it was to show, one, on the users, how

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.350
are they voting so that they’re part of
that slideshow, you know. And it’s just

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.650
not the slideshow and the caption and the
title we chose as editors but, here’s the

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.890
community and you see them stacking up and
you see how they’re rating things. And then

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.820
more--even further, you know, that they can
rearrange the order and make their own top

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.070
five and send that out, so.
&gt;&gt; And so each user has their own URL for

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.099
their own slideshow that they can share with
their friends?

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.920
&gt;&gt; PAUL BERRY: Yeah, exactly. So that’s
the key is that whenever it will go out to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.650
the world that when they’re sharing it,
they’re not just sharing the slideshow,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.070
they’re sharing their version of the slideshow
and that process encourages the friends they

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.530
invited to also do theirs as well.
&gt;&gt; From a technical perspective, how did you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.620
that? Are you using the Friend Connect [INDISTINCT]
50 pi or the [INDISTINCT] on the service side?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.800
&gt;&gt; PAUL BERRY: So, actually, we’re using
both. And, it’s--we have a really flexible

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.440
CMS and with--it being largely done in PHP
on the front end side, it was really easy

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.440
and great with the rest API. And then, at
the same time, there’s some perfect places

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.740
to make those JS calls, and between that both
it’s like a scalable for us and efficient

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.880
and yet at the same time, really totally customized.
So it’s not like an extra added weird plug-in

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.580
on the side, it’s part of Huffington Post;
totally integrated, so…

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.230
&gt;&gt; That’s what I love in your--in the demo
you gave the other day. It’s like completely

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.930
integrated, so you’re in deep integration
in you site...

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.370
&gt;&gt; PAUL BERRY: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Of the social layer.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.310
&gt;&gt; PAUL BERRY: Yeah. So I think that’s what’s
really interesting is that for small publishers,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.420
you guys are able to make it as easy as, “Hey,
you know, I can do a 5-minute thing.” But,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.810
at the same time, for larger publishers, with
high traffic, we can do more, you know, and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.980
pull off a crazy couple of weeks and special
thanks to Sergei Lazarin [ph] who pulled off

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.090
an incredible amount of code for this, and
integration. And, it was really rewarding

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.290
for him, too, as he went through the code
and worked through it. So, you know, it’s

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.221
kind of the early days of, of social for everyone
and, and for Friend Connect, and it’s so

00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:56.932
clear that this has legs. So…
&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks very much, Paul. That’s

00:03:56.932 --> 00:03:57.932
great.
&gt;&gt; PAUL BERRY: Yeah, cool.

00:03:57.932 --> 00:03:59.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
