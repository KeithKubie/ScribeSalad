[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:05.490
BILL GRIFFIN: Thanks
so much, guys.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.281
So I'll try and talk
for about half an hour

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:11.810
or 40 minutes or something
about the origin of the project,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.190
or give it a little bit
of context and explain.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.400
The first thing I suppose
I need to kind of demystify

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.230
is that very frequently
people assume

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.970
that it's some kind
of wish-granting app

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.660
where like miraculously
you're gonna

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.310
kind of make stuff happen.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.940
The app doesn't do that.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.270
It takes one positive
action every day

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.172
in the direction of travel
in terms of what it is

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:34.380
that people have articulated.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.300
But I'll specify that
a little bit more.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.716
And then, as I say, talk about
the history of the project,

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:41.610
where it came from,
exemplify some of the actions

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.800
that the app takes,
and then talk

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.950
a little bit about what the
conceivable future of it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.959
might look like.

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:49.500
And then, as I say,
I hope at the end

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.960
we'll have time for questions.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.652
I've always got to
caveat this talk

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:55.860
by saying that we've had a
couple of technical issues

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.570
with regards to
setting up the slides.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.660
So if at some point
the screen goes dark,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.410
then you'll have to
forgive me while I try

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.970
to remember how to reboot it.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.900
So just a tiny bit
about my background.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.300
I've always worked in the
kind of media sectors.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.290
So mainly in television,
and for a brief spell

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.380
for a couple of years at
the radio station KISS FM.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.570
I've worked for a bunch
of advertising agencies

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.880
for Channel 4, and
also Comedy Central,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.000
the Viacom-owned brand.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.890
And I about probably
four years ago I just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.700
turned 40, a classic midlife
crisis style of thing.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.440
And I've had this idea.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.220
And I thought if I
don't now do something

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.680
about putting it into the
world and making it happen,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.470
maybe it will never
kind of manifest.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.680
And there were three principle
kind of creative influences

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.760
that I had.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.534
Not necessarily things that
I was utterly obsessed with,

00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:52.950
but they're just things that
caught my attention, that I'd

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.560
maybe bought a book or looked
into them a little bit further.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.907
The first of these was a
project called Post Secret.

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:01.740
I don't know whether
anyone's heard of this.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.350
But a guy in the States
called Frank Warren,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.160
not to be confused with the
English boxing promoter,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.860
asked people to hand make
a postcard on which they

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.240
articulated something that they
had never told another living

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.020
soul, and to anonymously
send it to him.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.660
And he received literally
hundreds of thousands

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.810
of postcards, this guy.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.450
He's done six books now.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.910
He does exhibitions,
speaking tours.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.760
What started as a
kind of reasonably

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.960
understated and scruffy Tumblr
blog became this phenomenon.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.290
And I was interested, I
suppose, at the little snapshots

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.480
that this gave into
people's lives.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.570
There was no back story.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.969
Although often it's possible
to kind of imagine what

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:47.760
it might have been.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.676
And you didn't really
know what happened next.

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:53.370
But just this idea of a brief
glimpse into someone's kind

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.070
of soul was something
that I found really

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.600
kind of engaging in terms of the
authenticity of it, I suppose.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.127
Super unpolished, very
authentic, as I say,

00:03:03.127 --> 00:03:04.710
and something which
kind of resonated.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.560
Very frequently kind of
melancholic, as well.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.860
I smile all the time so that
no one knows how sad and lonely

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.660
I really am.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.930
The type of stuff that in this
increasingly kind of polished

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.330
world of social
media we would be

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.471
unlikely to post, say,
on Instagram or something

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:20.970
like that.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.340
Something that felt like
because of the anonymity,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.620
people's identities
weren't associated with it,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.197
felt like it was coming from
a kind of truer place to me.

00:03:28.197 --> 00:03:30.530
There was another thing that
I really, really did like--

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.260
and this I did buy
all the books--

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.080
are called "Found Magazine."

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.790
And this, again, was a kind
of pretty understated project

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.070
started by a guy
called Dave Rothbart.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.670
And he just produced
a compendium of notes

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.154
that either people sent
him or that he found.

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:47.820
And that was it.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.600
And again, it provides a
similar kind of little snapshot

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.430
into people's lives.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.880
And there was something
super fascinating about it.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.079
And they were
simultaneously disposable.

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.370
Literally, they were trash
that he found in the street,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.961
but also I thought kind of
potent and really interesting.

00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:08.460
Call me.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.215
Dad died.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:11.970
I wonder what's kind
of going on there.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.040
What's the nature of
that relationship.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.240
This one here I really like.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.709
Mario, I fucking hate you.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.570
You said to me
that you had work.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.209
Then why is your car
here at her place?

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.029
You're a fucking liar.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.420
I hate you.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.230
I fucking hate you.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.860
Amber.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.360
PS.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.950
Page me later.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.890
So those kind of
things were, as I say,

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.140
it told you everything
about someone and nothing

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.790
about someone simultaneously.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.460
And I was really into that.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.170
Also, and this has
become a tiny bit

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.210
of a kind of millennial
cliche, you could argue.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.250
It has maybe 15 million
followers on Facebook now.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.390
This Humans of New York project
that you'll be familiar with.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.160
Photographer called
Brandon Stanton

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.350
just meeting people in New
York and taking photos of them

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.210
and hearing what it is that they
have to say about their lives

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.960
in a paragraph or two.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.510
And there's some
extraordinary kind

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.570
of wisdom contained therein.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.460
There's some amazing
pathos contained therein.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.752
There's some super-inspiring
stuff as well.

00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:10.460
But again, I guess
what links these three

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.190
projects that as I say, I
was kind of preoccupied with,

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.970
was they just provided this
limited little snapshot, almost

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.745
like a Polaroid, as I
say, of someone's soul.

00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:22.120
So I was thinking about this
kind of concept for a while.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.930
And I was also
looking, I suppose,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.170
without doing some
wholesale like, you know,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.440
competitive analysis of what
the marketplace looked like.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.230
I was seeing the kind of
apps that were out there.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.570
At the time there were
a few anonymous ones--

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.610
Whisper, which is
still quite a big deal.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.980
One called Secret,
which has kind of segued

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.190
into being something
else, and another app,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.500
which was super popular for
a while on college campuses

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.457
in the States called
Yik Yak, all of which

00:05:47.457 --> 00:05:49.040
were anonymous apps
which again, allow

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.100
people within your network
to say something which they

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.100
probably wouldn't say
were they in a position

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.660
to have to associate their
own identity with it.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.710
So I thought, you know, let's
create an anonymous place where

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.770
people can post the things
they most want in the world,

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.960
whatever those things may be.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.810
And that was my initial
iteration of the idea.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.100
So I'm a reasonable devotee of
the lean startup methodology,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.510
and a lot of the
Paul Graham essays--

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.740
you know, the Y
Combinator founder.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.730
And what I didn't do was
to go out and try and raise

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.150
VC capital or
anything like that.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.370
I did a super scruffy, low-cost
iteration of this primary idea.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.470
And its sole function
was just for people

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.530
to articulate in 100 characters
or less, as I say, the things

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.770
that they most wanted,
whatever those things may be.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.500
And I kind of thought when
I was like building it

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.640
with a developer
guy, well, maybe that

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.520
will just be like what it is.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.260
But when I looked
at it, and we tried

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.650
a little bit of a beta test,
and I got some user feedback,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.260
paradoxically, something
which was designed

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.360
to be a little
inspiring ended up

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.260
feeling slightly kind
of flat and listless.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.870
Because what was happening was
there were people, as I say,

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.620
were articulating their hopes,
dreams, desires, aspirations.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.750
But if nothing was
happening as a consequence,

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.830
it ended up feeling like
a slightly deserted kind

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.020
of Pinterest board where
people had like put this stuff.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.160
But it just was a repository for
half kind of forgotten dreams

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.540
and thwarted ambition.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.940
So it ended up, as I
say, feeling a little bit

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.900
kind of tired and strangely,
a slightly depressing place

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.840
to hang out.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.900
So the thing that
I suppose catalyzed

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.750
it-- and I wouldn't want to
over-exaggerate the extent

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.940
of the success of the project.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.820
It's not like it's some
Snapchat style phenomena.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.660
But the thing that people seem
to kind of gravitate towards,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.270
or that galvanized
it, was this idea

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.410
of taking meaningful,
real world action.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.290
So I'm really very
interested in technology,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.930
but equivalently interested--
as we all are, I'm sure--

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.690
about the kind of things that
happen away from keyboard.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.180
So I thought, could you
do an interesting thing?

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.540
And I was quite into these
projects where the app

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.460
itself was like a
nicely designed thing.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.050
Take Airbnb, for example.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.890
That's a cool app.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.848
You could design it in
loads of different ways.

00:08:12.848 --> 00:08:14.490
Website looks nice.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.760
Endlessly kind of changed and
iterated to try and perfect it.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.680
But the amazing thing
about being Airbnb

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.180
was the fact that
millions of people

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.740
were having these
extraordinary weekends

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.000
where they met
someone who became

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.200
a friend in a foreign city.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.630
That was really what
the user experience was.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.000
That was the real kind
of UI right there.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.850
So I thought, is
there something cool

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.720
that you could do to bring
these aspirations a little bit

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.559
closer?

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.539
Not to miraculously,
like I said at the start

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.730
of the presentation,
and as it says up here,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.540
not granting wishes
in the way that you

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.720
might see in a kind of
children's fairy story

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.460
or schmaltzy Disney thing.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.570
But just, I suppose,
adhering to the credo

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.910
that any action is
better than none.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.290
Is there something
that we can do

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.590
about each of these
wishes that makes them

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.110
a three-dimensional real
thing, a couple of steps

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.737
closer to that
professed aspiration,

00:09:04.737 --> 00:09:07.070
rather than it just hanging
around on the internet being

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.890
like another tweet or something.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.700
And that was all the
kind of thinking was.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.182
So the site's actions are unique
and freshly created every day.

00:09:15.182 --> 00:09:16.640
And they can be
anything, depending

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.530
on the nature of the wish.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.910
And you see, like
those three projects

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.610
I was talking
about at the start,

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.550
you see things which are
happy or sad or melancholic or

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.434
uplifting.

00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:28.850
The interesting thing about
it-- or one of the interesting

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.920
things that I've
found about it--

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.580
is that no two wishes
are kind of alike.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.350
And a wish which is super
kind of sad and heartbreaking

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.050
seems to sit quite happily
alongside another wish which

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.690
might be, as I say, uplifting
or euphoric in some way.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.420
So there were only
a few guidelines,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.120
which people have been
pretty good at adhering to.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.500
Of the many thousands of
wishes there are on the site,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.160
I've probably had
to delete like six.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.860
I think most of them are
from the same person.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.524
And as it says here, basically--

00:09:59.524 --> 00:10:01.190
I don't know how well
you can read that.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.310
Don't be lame.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.080
You know, it's not that
funny to kind of write oh, I

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.614
wish I could fly or whatever.

00:10:06.614 --> 00:10:07.280
Don't be greedy.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.510
So say, I wish I had a
free Rolex or whatever.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.260
That's not going to
get any traction.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.350
And the way in which the site
was working in terms of its UI

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.887
is that the wish that was
most up-voted each day,

00:10:17.887 --> 00:10:19.970
the wish that came to the
top of the list, the top

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.440
of the charts, as
it were, that was

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.050
the one that was going to have
some action taken against it.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.800
Don't be a dick.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.860
So any form of
behavior that advocates

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.180
kind of breaking the law or
some kind of racial hatred

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.180
or something like that.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.850
That was just going
to get taken down.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.540
Don't be gross.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.530
Don't be too selfish.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.030
Et cetera.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.810
Et cetera.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.180
PS, we've heard the thing
about unlimited wishes loads.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.100
It's hilarious.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.390
So people seem to
kind of understand.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.330
It self-governed
pretty well, the site.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.220
And if occasionally there
is something weird on there,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.190
someone will typically
email me and say, you know,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.080
you should check out this wish.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.930
It looks a bit odd.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.030
But as I said, they were
all completely anonymous.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.307
100 characters or less.

00:10:51.307 --> 00:10:53.056
And the wish that got
to the top every day

00:10:53.056 --> 00:10:57.230
at 6:00, that was the one that
had action taken against it.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.990
So let me give you some
examples of the actions

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.510
that the app takes.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.550
So quite a lot of Trump
stuff at the moment,

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.730
for obvious reasons.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.157
So this is-- I
think the wish was

00:11:08.157 --> 00:11:09.990
I wish that Donald Trump
wasn't such a dick.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.036
But I've had variance
of that loads of times.

00:11:12.036 --> 00:11:14.160
So that's a thought that
probably everyone has had.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.950
What you get from
this project is

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.739
that I actually wrote a letter
to him at the Trump Foundation.

00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:20.280
Weird that he never
wrote back to me.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.821
I don't know.

00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:22.270
He must be busy.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.370
But it's just a kind
of slightly snarky,

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.800
why did you once tweet "tiny
children are not horses"?

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.150
Everyone knows that already.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.170
What were you thinking
when you said,

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.330
"If Ivanka weren't my daughter,
perhaps I'd be dating her."

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.650
Can you not see
that's kind of gross?

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.640
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.710
And that stuff, in terms
of growing the site,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.270
goes over pretty
well on Twitter back

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.769
when Twitter was
still like a thing.

00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:43.750
That's a dig at your
competitor there.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.400
And so sometimes I'll do
something in the spirit

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.256
of the wish itself.

00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:50.130
So that's clearly a
tongue-in-cheek, slightly

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.650
ironic wish.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.839
And so the response
is equivalent.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.880
When people wished--
there's quite a lot of stuff

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.430
about the elderly, you know.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.460
There's a phenomenon
in this country--

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.296
and to a certain
extent in the States--

00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:04.920
where there's an
epidemic of loneliness

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.020
amongst old people
in this country.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.890
And very frequently, I
forget what the statistic is,

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.710
but it's a high percentage of
people, or a surprisingly high

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.860
percentage of people,
will go like two weeks

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.290
without having any form
of human interaction

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.810
beyond the most prosaic one
with a shopkeeper or a postman

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.600
or something.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.014
So when people wish for a
treat for the elderly, myself,

00:12:25.014 --> 00:12:27.430
or my girlfriend-- thank you
very much for helping me with

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.110
that--

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.590
visited an old people's
home over the Easter weekend

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.750
and festooned it with hundreds
of daffodils and chocolate

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.500
eggs.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.030
When people wished that their
commute wasn't so boring,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.720
I changed the
signage on the Tube.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.480
So it's very easy to download--
as I discovered-- the London

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.860
Underground typeface.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.980
And I just adjusted the
signs to give people

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.400
a bit of a smile on
their way to work.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.550
So as I say, it's
one thing every day.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.134
And I don't, like,
go into a thing

00:12:54.134 --> 00:12:56.550
where I say, I'm going to do
every tube train or whatever.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.710
It's what you're buying
in inverted commas,

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.470
although it's free,
what you're buying into

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.560
is 24 hours worth
of resourceful,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.140
industrious, hopefully
creative kind of action.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.600
But everything starts and ends
within that 24-hour period.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.600
I never say, I'll get
back to you in three weeks

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.214
once I've got 1,000
signatures or something.

00:13:16.214 --> 00:13:17.880
This was a wish from
a woman in Scotland

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.990
whose daughter had been badly
bullied in secondary school.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.030
So she came down to London.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.880
And we arranged a really
nice day out for her.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.530
I use "we" in the royal sense.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.440
I mean I arranged a
nice day out for her.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.780
And she went-- what did she do?

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.490
We met for breakfast.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.160
And then she went
to the Royal Ballet

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.900
and had a kind of
backstage tour there.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.983
She was really interested,
like a lot of teenagers

00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:44.640
are, in a potential career
in the performing arts.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.030
So she met a ballet dancer and
had a kind of backstage tour

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.530
there.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.030
And then the ballet dancer
gave her ballet shoes,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.110
which was really sweet.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.330
Then she went to
Pineapple Dance Studios

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.090
and met with someone who'd
been a backing dancer for One

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.980
Direction and lots of
people, and gave her

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.690
a kind of dance class.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.170
Then she went to meet a friend
of mine who I knew from my time

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.340
at KISS FM who's a super
nice, very, very sweet,

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.820
charismatic woman who
is one of the DJ's.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.480
She does the afternoon
drive-time show.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.156
And so she had a cup
of coffee with her

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:18.780
and talked to her
about this experience

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.240
that she was having in school.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.660
And then in the evening
she went to a performance

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.920
of "Mamma Mia."

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.120
And she wore all
black and was sitting

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.280
at the side of the stage
with the stage manager,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.544
and saw how that kind of
whole show was put together.

00:14:34.544 --> 00:14:36.210
And a couple of those
things were people

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:36.960
that I knew already.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.790
But a couple of those
things were people--

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.360
and this happens quite a lot--

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.570
who were already on the site.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.820
All four of those people
had been bullied themselves

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.810
when they were little.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.850
And they said, oh, I see
you've got this wish coming up

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.610
about bullying.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.860
Well, I would be really happy.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.710
I'm an actress now.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.210
She should come
down to "Mamma Mia."

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.880
Or this person at
the Royal Opera House

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.400
can help in this particular
way with the ballet, et cetera,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.120
et cetera.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.030
So very frequently I'll
be coordinating something

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.064
which the community
itself is volunteering

00:15:03.064 --> 00:15:05.480
in terms of what it is that
they might like to do to help,

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.396
which is kind of nice.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.105
You remember a while
back where Boko Haram,

00:15:11.105 --> 00:15:14.172
the Islamic fundamentalist
group in northern Nigeria,

00:15:14.172 --> 00:15:15.880
kidnapped those
schoolgirls, some of whom

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.720
have now been released.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.450
And so I went to the
Nigerian Embassy first thing

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.810
in the morning before it opened
and had written the night

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.810
before the name of
each of the missing

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.250
girls on a Post-it
note, and then

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.190
covered their doors with
that as a kind of gesture.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.380
And very frequently, as
I said, it is a gesture.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.690
So I'm not claiming
that as a consequence

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.150
of me doing that, the girls
were miraculously recovered.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.590
It's just an articulation,
a visualization,

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.090
a 3D iteration of that
which would otherwise just

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.350
be a bit of social media
kind of ephemera, I suppose.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.570
You know who I mean
by Katie Hopkins?

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.580
It's like a female Piers Morgan.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.460
Someone wished that she
would sign a gagging order.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.080
And by a very
strange coincidence,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.240
I was reading a
magazine in the week

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.344
before this wish
came to the top.

00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:05.635
And I saw that she was due
to do a speaking event where

00:16:05.635 --> 00:16:07.593
she was going to be in
some debate about Brexit

00:16:07.593 --> 00:16:09.110
or something.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.720
And so I went along
to that debate.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.490
And I folded over
a piece of paper,

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.850
got her to sign the bottom
here with her lame signature,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.860
which has a pathetic
little heart.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.960
And little did she
know that clearly it

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.050
wasn't legally binding.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.672
It was just like a joke.

00:16:22.672 --> 00:16:24.880
But she said, in fact, I'm
so embarrassed with pretty

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.870
much everything I've ever done.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.170
OK.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.169
Now that joke only works
if you know who she is.

00:16:28.169 --> 00:16:31.270
But she's a fairly
reprehensible human being.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.950
Very frequently they
are about things,

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.010
social ills that we can
see around us-- the wishes.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.900
So if people wish for
help for the homeless,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.790
I'll just go out,
again, not miraculously

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.880
claiming to rid the
world of the problem

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.850
that it has with
homelessness, but just

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.580
visit half a dozen people,
take them some sleeping bags,

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.757
a cup of coffee, sandwiches at
lunchtime, whatever it may be.

00:16:51.757 --> 00:16:53.590
When people wish for
more love in the world,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.464
but quite often they're
quite abstract things

00:16:55.464 --> 00:16:58.710
like that, which as an
expression of something

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.030
or a nice sentiment, but
they're kind of woolly.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.270
So I'll try and do something
kind of crisp and specific

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.970
with regards it.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.276
So on this occasion,
people wished

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.609
for more love in the world,
and then distributed flowers

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:10.190
all over London.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.079
And so people can
take them back,

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.369
give them to their
boyfriend, girlfriend,

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.680
partner, whatever, tell them
how much they love them.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.736
That was pretty popular.

00:17:15.736 --> 00:17:18.069
There was this thing I wasn't
aware of, this phenomenon.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.339
But there's a very popular wish
where people felt that when

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.940
they went to an up-market
department store--

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.869
Harrod's or Selfridges
or whatever--

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.609
they were frequently
condescended to

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.450
by people who worked
on makeup counters.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.640
I didn't know that
that was a thing.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.330
But apparently it was.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.300
Lots of people said, oh, yeah.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.760
That happens to
me the whole time.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.777
So I put this sign in Harrod's.

00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:37.360
"Customers should
be advised that they

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.740
may be subject to
withering looks

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.330
and occasional
condescending comments.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.290
We trust this will not detract
from your shopping experience."

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.480
This again was the
community helping.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.600
So this was a really
sick boy in Florida

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.070
who just wanted to get
a lot of birthday cards.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.892
And so Crowdwish members
sent them to him.

00:17:54.892 --> 00:17:56.350
This was the thing--
remember, this

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.037
was another arcane
bit of tax law.

00:17:58.037 --> 00:18:00.370
I actually think it was with
EU legislation, rather than

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:04.300
something that was maybe under
our kind of aegis in the UK.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.250
But feminine hygiene
products were

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.920
taxed as a luxury item,
which was obviously insane.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.830
And there was quite lot of
stuff online about that.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.314
So I sent this tampon
in this luxury packaging

00:18:14.314 --> 00:18:15.730
to the Chancellor
of the Exchequer

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.370
with a sarcastic note.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.870
This was people wishing there
was less bigotry in the world.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.630
So I sent-- have you ever seen
that website, Ship Your Enemies

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.620
Glitter?

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.542
It was like a big deal
a couple of years ago.

00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:28.000
You know, because glitter is
a fucking nightmare, isn't it?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.999
It you open an envelope.

00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:33.430
And so I sent this--

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.250
EDL or something it was
called, like a horrible kind

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.280
of far right extremist group.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.780
So I sent the
leader of that one.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.890
To think of the kind of
campus thing I could do.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.585
So I had a vision whether
or not this manifested.

00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:44.230
I don't know.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.600
Sometimes it would be
nice to see, to be there

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.710
when this stuff happens.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.720
But I had a vision of this
guy getting covered in glitter

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.428
and reading this.

00:18:50.428 --> 00:18:52.810
Sorry, not sorry.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.660
When someone wished for
a half-decent boyfriend,

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:01.510
I put up a kind of missing
sign, presumed non-existent,

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.340
just not a dick, basically.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.800
And again, what happens with
these things is you only

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.959
need to put out one sign.

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:08.500
I had actually put
up more than that.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.780
But I think I put up less
than half a dozen signs.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.790
And then someone sees
it, takes a photo of it.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.165
And by the end of the day, I
had a load of people getting

00:19:15.165 --> 00:19:17.170
in touch saying, either
I am that boyfriend,

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.700
so if you find
someone, then I am

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.340
the candidate who ticks
all this kind of criteria.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.330
I have my own teeth,
positive bank balance,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.383
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:25.347 --> 00:19:26.930
Or a lot of people
saying look, if you

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.420
do find this
mythological man, who

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.190
I'm convinced doesn't
actually exist,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.606
then let me know, because I'd
love to have to have a date.

00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:35.010
So I probably put together
seven or eight couples.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.800
And again, I don't
follow that narrative.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.549
I just say, look, I'll
introduce you guys.

00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:41.500
I hope you have a
good time, basically.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.860
When people wish that--

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.010
this is like a political
thing by the way.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.047
But you know, Jeremy Corbyn
was getting quite a lot of shit

00:19:48.047 --> 00:19:48.880
for looking scruffy.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.530
And he did look
pretty bad, I thought.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.950
He did look kind of scruffy.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.950
And David Cameron--
didn't he say

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.907
something to him at the
PMQs about my mother

00:19:55.907 --> 00:19:57.490
would be ashamed of
you, or something.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.970
I can't remember what it was.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.050
But anyway.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.051
A friend of mine runs
this shirt company

00:20:03.051 --> 00:20:04.050
called Charles Tyrwhitt.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:04.830
So I called him--

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.230
Nick Wheeler he's called--

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.510
and said, can you send
me some smarter clothes?

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.620
And I swear that I have seen
Jeremy Corbyn wear this.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.620
I swear I have.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.120
I noticed that he
didn't declare it.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.500
Because I thought, how
am I going to find out?

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.958
Because the kind
of guy that he is,

00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.700
I just dropped if
off at his kind

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.100
of where he does his surgeries
as an MP in Islington.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.855
And I thought, how
am I going to know?

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:26.336
And because whatever
you think about Corbyn,

00:20:26.336 --> 00:20:27.710
the guy's got
integrity, I think.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.540
He's got political integrity
and integrity as a person.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.960
And I thought, I'm sure
he's going to declare--

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.840
like working for the BBC
or lots of institutions--

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.220
if someone gives you a
present above a certain value,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.010
you've got to make a
declaration about it

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.343
so that you are not susceptible
to bribery, particularly

00:20:42.343 --> 00:20:44.140
as an MP.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.606
But I haven't seen him make a
declaration about his shirts.

00:20:46.606 --> 00:20:48.230
It may well be that
he just passed them

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.561
on to his nearest charity shop.

00:20:49.561 --> 00:20:50.060
Who knows?

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.630
But I'm pretty positive
that I've seen that.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.700
So like I say, that's happened.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.110
Something of that ilk.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.030
Those are just a
few quick examples.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.430
And there are literally
hundreds of others.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:09.650
That's happened every 24
hours for the last 1,136 days.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.910
People are really into it.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.400
You know the Paul Graham guy.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.990
And if you haven't read
Paul Graham's essays about--

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.490
well, about
everything basically.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.120
But the guy is super
articulate and incredibly kind

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.050
of perceptive.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.320
But one of the things
that he's said in his--

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.170
he writes an essay
about getting traction

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.030
for whatever your new
business is initially,

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.340
and how it is you find
your first customers.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.720
And he said-- and this
really resonated with me--

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.500
you're much better
off creating something

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.400
that 100 people absolutely love
rather than 1,000 people think

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.070
is kind of OK.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.840
And that I thought was going
to be my kind of guiding

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.074
light with this project.

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:50.240
That's what I'm going to do.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.240
Find something that
people are super into,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.520
rather than the kind of
slightly ambivalent thing

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.632
that occasionally I
might dip in or out of.

00:21:57.632 --> 00:21:59.090
And because these
are frequent what

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.430
you'd call in TV world
appointment to view slot,

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.530
because every day at
6:00, something new

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:08.420
is getting published, there's
a reason to keep coming back.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.801
So people's reactions
have been amazing.

00:22:10.801 --> 00:22:12.550
I would defy you
actually without sounding

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.950
too kind of self-congratulatory
and annoying about it

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.730
to find a website which
has as positive feedback

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.950
as this one does.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.990
It's great for press,
because you're always

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.910
doing something,
or invariably doing

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.690
something which is either
positive or mischievous,

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.180
and totally, like I was
saying, the juxtaposition

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.790
of things which are slightly
kind of anti-authority

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.360
meets things which are just
kind of kind and positive.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.920
You know, existing in that space
is good for social sharing.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.300
And then yeah, and now as a
lucky percentage of you have,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.160
I did a book deal about a
year ago to write a book.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.080
And basically what
I've done there

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.470
is to take 99 of
the most popular,

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.440
or wishes that just
appealed to me.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.270
So it's a selection of 99 of
the 1,000-plus that there have

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.770
been.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.490
And it attempts to articulate
in a reasonably kind

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.040
of lighthearted
fashion how it is

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.680
that you can get a little
bit closer to the aspirations

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.032
that you might have.

00:23:13.032 --> 00:23:14.740
And so it's like a
kind of self-help book

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.790
for people who would never
read self-help books.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.831
And as you said at the
start of the conversation,

00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:21.910
it's designed to dip in
and out of classic book

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.469
to have by the bath, basically.

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:27.010
And so other publishers around
the world have picked that up.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.040
I don't know that everyone's
going to do these 99 covers.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.210
That was an idea that I
had that I never thought--

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.100
initially I thought,
let's do 5 covers.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.450
Because I was quite into this.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.200
You know, sometimes
you'll see a magazine

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.283
like "Vogue" published
with five different covers,

00:23:41.283 --> 00:23:43.450
or "GQ" for their Man
of the Year awards.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.130
And one will have Tiny Tim, and
one will have Michael Caine,

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.630
or whatever.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.046
And I thought, that must work
quite well on the newsstand.

00:23:49.046 --> 00:23:51.410
Otherwise, they wouldn't do
the incremental investment

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.190
to do that.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.190
I wonder whether that could work
for a display in a bookshop.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.239
And it does actually
look nice in the--

00:23:57.239 --> 00:23:58.530
when you see them all together.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.863
This is at the publishing house.

00:23:59.863 --> 00:24:02.360
This is something I took this
photo the week before last.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.390
When you see all 99
together, there's

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.902
a kind of visual gratification.

00:24:05.902 --> 00:24:07.610
And I guess it's
illustrative in the fact

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.040
that these-- without being
too hackneyed about it--

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.500
these wishes are
super kind of diverse.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.820
And no two are like.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.544
That was the underlying point.

00:24:15.544 --> 00:24:17.460
And the designers did a
brilliant job on that,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.620
you know.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.750
The tone of it is
designed, as you'll see,

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.695
to be kind of light-hearted
and accessible.

00:24:22.695 --> 00:24:24.320
So I wish I could
have a dirty weekend.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.195
I wish they made gentleman
like they used to.

00:24:26.195 --> 00:24:28.581
I wish I could find the best
slice of pie in the world.

00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:30.830
Which I have found the best
slice of pie in the world.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.470
But that's another story.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.900
So it's not-- I hope, anyway--

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.510
too kind of earnest
in that regard.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.010
So those of you who
have got a copy,

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.690
I really hope you
enjoy reading it.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:45.020
Do post a review on Amazon
if that is the case.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.840
Meanwhile, so I'm thinking,
what can I do with this thing?

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:53.000
I've managed to make it kind
of not too expensive to run.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.930
As I say, I'm a massive disciple
of the lean startup ideology.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.230
So you would be surprised how
little it has cost to do it.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.850
But you can see
from those examples

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.860
that I gave you, it
doesn't cost that much

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.530
to send a bunch of places to a
far right leader, for example.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.830
They don't need to be
enormous, grandiose gestures,

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.292
these things.

00:25:11.292 --> 00:25:13.250
But I was thinking, how
am I going to make this

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.940
like a commercial proposition?

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.180
And in a way, is it
going to spoil the fact?

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.850
Because no one's ever
been charged for anything.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.620
Is it going to kind of soil
it or somehow compromise it

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.760
if it becomes something which
has got this commercial overlay

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.850
on top of it?

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.840
So my solution to
that, such as it was--

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.730
I may well be proved completely
wrong, but this is my endeavor,

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.070
and I'll try and be
successful in achieving it--

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.760
was to say, OK.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.510
So let's see if we can make it
kind of cross-platform entity.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.060
I've got ideas
around live events.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:43.850
There's a website.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:44.474
There's an app.

00:25:44.474 --> 00:25:47.062
There's a book, as I say, which
you have in front of you now.

00:25:47.062 --> 00:25:48.020
And then I thought, OK.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.450
Let's see what we could
do with a TV show.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.000
Because wish
fulfillment in TV terms,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.560
it's been a huge kind of genre.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.990
And if you can get
it right, then it's

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.450
fantastic, because
it's heartwarming.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.900
It appeals across a huge
kind of demographic.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.880
And particularly large
commercial stations like ITV

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.436
are really into programs
where the whole family

00:26:09.436 --> 00:26:11.810
is gathered in front of the
screen rather than a singular

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:12.410
demographic.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.900
They don't really sell a
singular demographic in the way

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.640
that a niche website might.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.780
They sell reach.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.587
And they sell particular
kind of profiles

00:26:20.587 --> 00:26:22.670
around adults with children,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.440
So if you can get it
right, then it's cool.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.815
But I didn't want
to do something

00:26:25.815 --> 00:26:29.060
which was so kind of vanilla
or lowest common denominator

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.150
that it felt like
it wasn't adhering

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.300
to the spirit of
the project today.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.070
And so I got a
little bit of cash

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.600
from a network in
the States, actually.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.230
And then I linked up with a
guy called Ryan McPherson, who

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.550
I only knew by reputation,
who runs a slightly

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.270
shadowy collective of--

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.890
it's like an anarchic
kind of art collective

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:59.040
of graffiti artists
and civil activists who

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.580
exist as this kind
of shadowy force

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.971
who can be marshaled
when given an instruction

00:27:03.971 --> 00:27:04.720
from their leader.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.010
I know that makes it sound
slightly kind of cult-like.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.919
But they do very cool things.

00:27:08.919 --> 00:27:10.710
And so I thought he'd
be good to work with.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.110
So he's based in Las Vegas.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.900
So I flew out to LA.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.380
He came down from Las Vegas.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.260
We had a little pot of cash
that the network had given us.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.010
And so I'll show you now
the film that we shot,

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.810
which is like what they
call a sizzle reel,

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.460
which you then take
out to broadcasters

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.835
and see whether
or not they think

00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:29.780
there might be potential
in developing it further.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.250
So you can see
there, like I say,

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.630
a kind of combination
of things which

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:40.370
are random acts of kindness
meet the articulation,

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.840
I suppose-- and
obviously I realize

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.870
that Donald Trump is like
a super kind of lazy target

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.100
for anything satirical.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.800
And I realize also that he
was democratically elected.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.840
But it is additionally
the case that there's

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.190
an overwhelming number
of people who are

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.350
pleased to see him lampooned.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.339
And so as I say, the
site isn't miraculously

00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:02.630
claiming that they'll be able
to remove him from power.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.180
You're just doing something
to kind of visualize

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.660
the wish that people have made.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.900
And so the ambition, as I say--

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.180
oh, wait, I've gone too far--

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.600
is to have this brand that
lives in every vertical

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.760
or a significant
number of verticals.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.550
So a web presence
app exists, iOS app.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.170
I haven't done an
Android app yet.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.110
I'm sorry about that.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.050
I should have done.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:28.420
The book, which exists.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.650
The TV, which it depends who
is it that one partners with.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.025
Like I say, if
you do it for ITV,

00:28:33.025 --> 00:28:35.660
you might going to do something
slightly different to that,

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.440
which is going to be a
little bit too edgy for them.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.080
So it depends who
your partner is.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.650
There are a number
of people who are--

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.880
if you were looking 10,
even five years ago,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.614
and you had a TV
idea in the States,

00:28:49.614 --> 00:28:51.030
you could either
go to a network--

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.820
NBC, CBS, Fox, et cetera--

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.040
or you could go to a cable
operator to get your ideas

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.730
and wait.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.640
Now those people are
still buying stuff,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.140
although they're increasingly
risk-averse creatively.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.235
But there's a new
generation led by Netflix

00:29:03.235 --> 00:29:05.490
of obviously
on-demand players who

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:07.740
are interested in
innovative content.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.230
And Amazon have
joined that fray now,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.350
putting significant
budgets into originated

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.540
but scripted and unscripted.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:21.630
And I think we'll see now a new
wave of Snapchat style people

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.940
who are wanting to get into
the content provision game.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.250
And I noticed with
interest this week

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:31.020
that Facebook group developed a
slingbox style app that enables

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.370
you to watch Facebook videos.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.355
Videos, obviously
amazing for them.

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:36.480
They're putting strategically
a whole load of stuff

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.640
around going live,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.980
And that enables you to
watch that stuff on your TV.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.284
So this convergence that
we've read about and heard

00:29:43.284 --> 00:29:45.450
about for so long of all
the screens coming together

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:49.420
into a single entity,
that time is upon us.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.020
The other aspect-- and
I'm not like a crazy kind

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.270
of data head kind of person.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.660
But it is interesting to
me-- and obviously one

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.540
needs to use and harness
that data in a way which

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.550
is respectful and appropriate.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.510
But the idea that people
volunteer information

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.624
about the things they
most want in the world,

00:30:08.624 --> 00:30:11.040
and then something meaningful
happens as a result, I think

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.920
is a kind of powerful one.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.874
One of the reasons,
he said, stating

00:30:14.874 --> 00:30:16.290
the blindingly
obvious that Google

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.170
is the extraordinary
company that it is in terms

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.220
of its cultural impact and
in terms of its moneymaking

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.460
abilities is that if I put
into Google as a search term

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.560
"flowers in Brighton"
or "flights to Paris"

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.560
or "therapist in London"
or whatever it may be,

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.380
that's a pretty strong
indicator that I'm in demand

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.510
for those things, thus
people competing to bid

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.220
on those key search terms.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.090
And so I wouldn't want to take
this into a kind of territory

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.520
whereby one was aggressively
exploiting that.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.810
I'm not suggesting that you
guys do that, by the way.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.526
But the idea that--

00:30:50.526 --> 00:30:52.710
and I haven't fully
developed this thought.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.720
So you have to bear with me,
as it is only partially formed.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.640
But the idea of fleshing
out and making a bit more

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.370
human and a bit more
rounded and a bit more

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.360
as we are as individuals
those kind of requests whereby

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.944
your prosaic transactional
requirements have

00:31:09.944 --> 00:31:11.610
a kind of counterbalance
of things which

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.490
are a bit more intrinsic and a
bit more kind of interdirected.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.580
That feels interesting
to me potentially.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.660
And I think that we will
see outside of search--

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.160
let's just assume
that you guys have

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.743
nailed search, which I think we
can say that you kind of have.

00:31:25.743 --> 00:31:28.034
But outside of that in terms
of brand-building stuff--

00:31:28.034 --> 00:31:30.450
and search isn't always the
strongest way to build a brand

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.580
and make a contribution to that.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.070
But I think the most
resonant brands in the future

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:38.710
are going to be looking for
these cross-platform solutions.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.580
They're looking for meaningful
data, not anonymous reach.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.220
And that is one of the reasons
why commercially for example,

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.965
a organization
like "The Guardian"

00:31:46.965 --> 00:31:49.646
and the massively
kind of deferential

00:31:49.646 --> 00:31:52.020
towards "The Guardian" in
terms of their editorial stance

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:52.561
in the world.

00:31:52.561 --> 00:31:54.929
But one of the issues
that they had commercially

00:31:54.929 --> 00:31:56.970
is I think they went
through a period of thinking

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.695
that reach and scale
was going to be enough.

00:31:59.695 --> 00:32:00.950
Oh, we're in Australia now.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:01.950
We're in the States now.

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.780
We've got this bureau, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.238
Actually advertisers
need something

00:32:05.238 --> 00:32:07.640
and want something slightly
more sophisticated than that.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.348
And anonymous reach
is increasingly quite

00:32:09.348 --> 00:32:11.190
a tricky thing to monetize.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.160
You know, they want
meaningful insight.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.830
Again, stating the
blindly obvious.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.410
But engaging content,
not broadcast messages.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.740
Rich experiences, not just
conventional kind of media.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.740
And also, I think particularly
for the kind of Generation X,

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.880
a--

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.570
I don't mean this like some
kind of quasi-religious sense.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.660
But being possessed of
a higher purpose, not

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.010
a purely transactional thing.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.370
What is it beyond enriching
your small group of shareholders

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.570
that you're honored to do.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.540
What contribution is your
brand making to the world?

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.190
I think that's a super
important kind of thing.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.870
And finally, you know, we're
all super adept at zoning out

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.335
advertising messages.

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:51.960
If they do reach us,
we're likely to be

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.770
cynical about them.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.400
But we try as hard as
we can to avoid them.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.270
We have ad blockers,
pop-up blockers.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.710
We have spam filters.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.630
We have signs on our
letterbox saying no junk mail.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.870
We have PVRs that enable
us to fast forward

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.520
through the ads times 30.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.869
And so I think increasingly--

00:33:07.869 --> 00:33:09.410
I'm not one of those
people who says,

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.500
oh, that game's over,
blah, blah, blah.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.940
I don't think it is over at all.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.070
But what is the case is
that it is irrefutable

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.424
that if you are associated
with an action as a brand,

00:33:17.424 --> 00:33:19.590
that is something which has
taken place and happened

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.380
in the real world.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.580
And so if I was creating
a kind of mini-model

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.030
in terms of how it is
that brands should engage

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.510
with their consumers
in the future,

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.600
I would say that do
something meaningful.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.910
Do something special that
resonates with people.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.070
And then use media
to shine a light

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.620
on what it is that you've
done, and encourage people

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.830
to kind of share it.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:40.680
And I think that if
one gets that right,

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.500
that can be quite
kind of powerful.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.630
So like I say, I don't
know whether people still

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.620
talk about moonshots.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.078
You know, you used to hear that
phrase "moonshots" in terms

00:33:49.078 --> 00:33:53.930
of something which
feels like a large idea

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.740
that you probably
won't necessarily

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.390
be successful in achieving.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.400
But nevertheless, you
don't let that prevent you

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.057
from setting out
on the endeavor.

00:34:01.057 --> 00:34:02.640
And I think here--
and this, as I say,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.410
I've done this
completely on my own.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.320
Occasionally my
girlfriend helps me out.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.310
Intimately I have an intern.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.219
But I kind of find that managing
the interns-- that basically

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.929
easier just to kind
of do it myself.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:16.320
So this is how far I've got
on my own with no money, no VC

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.090
capital, anything of that kind.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.820
And fundamentally,
when you boil it down,

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.169
this is a place where anyone can
share the things they most want

00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:25.710
in the world.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.260
They can articulate
those things.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.190
And a meaningful outcome
occurs as a result.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.590
And that, to me, feels
like a pretty big thought

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:39.239
that I've only gone like a tiny,
tiny distance of scratching

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.610
1% of the surface of.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.500
But that's my kind
of like guiding star

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.250
in terms of the core principle
from which I will not

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.030
kind of deviate.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.239
And as I say, were one to
amplify that as an idea,

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:56.580
I think that conceivably
is a genuinely huge thing.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.390
So you know, it's really
not like a big deal--

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.850
this thing.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.120
And because I haven't quite
worked out a monetization

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.280
model, I was in this
slightly weird situation

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.670
where normally everyone's
super-obsessed with getting

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:09.170
users.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.130
And we've got these
growth hacking techniques.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.630
And there's entire
industries that

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:15.090
have grown up around how it
is that you acquire and hold

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:16.975
on to users, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:35:16.975 --> 00:35:17.850
This isn't like that.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.870
Because I didn't really
know what I was doing.

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.910
I just wanted to do
something cool every day.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.576
And I know that sounds
a bit ridiculous.

00:35:23.576 --> 00:35:25.530
But that is genuinely
the activity

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.350
that I've been engaged with.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:31.020
But there are a load of
wishes on the site now.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.310
There are too many, actually.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:34.770
And one of the things that I--

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.460
one of the aspects of the
experience which doesn't work--

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.490
and I could do an entire
longer presentation about all

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.190
the flaws in this
idea, I hasten to add--

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.580
is that if you put a wish
on the site at the moment,

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.740
like layers of
sedimentary rock, you've

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.940
got to kind of get through
loads before it gets to the top.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.520
It's not quite as tricky as
one necessarily might think.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.615
But that can be a
bit de-motivating.

00:35:58.615 --> 00:36:00.520
And back to my original problem.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.200
When I put that thing on there,
and then nothing happens.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.116
No one agrees with me.

00:36:03.116 --> 00:36:04.030
No one likes my wish.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.321
That's the kind of thing that
can be disproportionately

00:36:06.321 --> 00:36:07.050
depressing.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.160
And so sometimes I wonder in
this ephemeral, disappearing

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.310
photos age in which
we live, maybe

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.850
I should just reset the
board every day at 6:00.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.310
And all the wishes
should vanish.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.500
And then people remake them.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.630
But maybe that itself
would be like a laborious

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.425
and de-motivating
experience to have

00:36:21.425 --> 00:36:22.924
to once again put it on there.

00:36:22.924 --> 00:36:25.090
So there are loads of things
still to kind of crack.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.730
But currently, if
hypothetically speaking,

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:31.380
I stop taking wishes
today, and just thought,

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.344
I'll action all the wishes
that are on the site currently,

00:36:34.344 --> 00:36:36.760
it would take me over 30 years
to get through all the ones

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.560
that are currently there,
which I haven't got time to do.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.059
Anyway.

00:36:39.059 --> 00:36:40.826
I'm at of the 45-minute mark.

00:36:40.826 --> 00:36:41.950
So I've slightly gone over.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.160
Thank you very
much for listening.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.090
I really appreciate it.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:45.520
It's a great
privilege to be here.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.395
We've got a little bit
of time for questions,

00:36:47.395 --> 00:36:49.729
if anyone's got anything that
they would like to ask me.

00:36:49.729 --> 00:36:53.152
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:59.014 --> 00:36:59.555
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:59.555 --> 00:36:59.830
Sorry.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.060
I cam in a little
bit late, and--

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.030
BILL GRIFFIN: You
probably have no idea

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.680
of what I'm talking about.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.305
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:04.320
What am I doing here?

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.820
No.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.944
Just, you may have explained
this at the beginning.

00:37:06.944 --> 00:37:08.710
I was just wondering
how you fund it all.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.930
Is it sort of self-funded?

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.370
BILL GRIFFIN: Well, it's a
kind of combination of things.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:17.220
It's at the kind of
size now where say--

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.567
and this is a true example.

00:37:18.567 --> 00:37:19.900
So it's an easy one to give you.

00:37:20.724 --> 00:37:22.390
Quite a lot of the
wishes seem to relate

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:25.655
to a low level of anxiety
where people are articulating

00:37:25.655 --> 00:37:27.280
the fact that their
lives haven't quite

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.779
turned out in the way that they
hoped they might, basically.

00:37:29.779 --> 00:37:33.517
So say the wish was I wish I
didn't feel so anxious, which

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:34.600
I've had a bunch of times.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.120
I could then-- as I've done--

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.122
reach out to-- there's a little
brand called Rescue Remedy.

00:37:40.122 --> 00:37:41.080
Do you know that brand?

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.510
It comes in a
little [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.930
And you put a couple--

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.320
It might be psychosomatic.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.090
I've got no idea.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.630
But it claims to work.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.980
Chills you out and stills
an overactive mind.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.560
So I can say to them--

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.750
and herein, I think, lies
something potentially again,

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:56.820
quite big.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.570
Because what advertising
does historically

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.736
is advertising vomits all
this stuff into the world,

00:38:00.736 --> 00:38:03.610
and hopes that it mops up a
few people who are in market

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.620
for what it is that
it's got to offer.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.050
Whereas what it is
that I'm offering

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.300
is a whole load of people
who have self-electedly

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.049
raised their own hands to
say, I am feeling anxious.

00:38:14.049 --> 00:38:15.340
So that's really valuable data.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.460
So I can in my, as I say,
low level way-- it is just me

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.720
in my bedroom kind of thing.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.310
I can say to people--

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.444
I can say that due
to Rescue Remedy,

00:38:23.444 --> 00:38:25.360
I've got a lot of people
here who have already

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.709
told me that they feel anxious.

00:38:26.709 --> 00:38:28.250
You claim to make
this great product.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.010
Why don't you send a
sample of your product

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.030
to each of these people?

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.200
And if it's as good
as you claim it is,

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.640
I'm sure you'll have
some customers for life.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.380
Or if it cures their anxiety,
you probably wouldn't, would

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:35.500
you?

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.550
But you get the point.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.060
The fact is that
it's really valuable

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.360
to be able to have a
conversation with a brand

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.660
and say, I've got
people who are in market

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.710
for what it is that you do.

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:55.540
And so I've been able to do
that, which enables, therefore,

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.280
the end user to
get a good result.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.780
I put this wish on
a random website.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.800
And now someone's
actually sent me

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.840
a physical thing in the mail.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.360
That's cool.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.310
So that's a great
result for them.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.470
And it hasn't cost
me anything to do it.

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.090
So that's one way
in which I do it.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.770
Sometimes I spend
my money on it.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:13.210
But I try not to for
obvious kind of reasons.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.930
And sometimes-- and I'm
reasonably good at doing this--

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:21.040
I'll create a solution which
I think is potentially potent,

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.770
but doesn't necessarily have
a huge budget attached to it.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.990
So the examples that I gave--

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:28.150
I'm not sure what point you
came into the presentation,

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.920
my friend-- but
the examples that I

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.080
gave were all pretty
low cost things

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.350
that people seemed to enjoy.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.980
So it doesn't need
to cost the earth.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.880
My worry-- and I easily
could have, I think--

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.490
this has slightly lessened
now, because we're

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.770
in an economically more
uncertain time because

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.367
of Brexit, et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:46.367 --> 00:39:47.950
But there was a time
a couple of years

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:52.600
ago where it was quite easy
to get, let's say, 200 grand

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:58.570
or something seed money from
a wannabe tech investor.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.660
The issue then becomes
their business plan

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.160
becomes your business plan.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.270
And I didn't want--

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.705
the management of
minority investing

00:40:06.705 --> 00:40:08.870
is a pain in the ass
at the best of times.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.302
But I wasn't quite sure how
to make money out of it,

00:40:11.302 --> 00:40:12.760
and whether or not
the way in which

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.680
I thought I might
ultimately make money

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.210
was going to be something
that they enjoyed.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.230
So I just thought,
I'm just going

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.457
to retain 100% of the equity
and just do it myself.

00:40:19.457 --> 00:40:21.790
I don't know whether that was
the right decision or not.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:22.873
But that's what I've done.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:30.900
AUDIENCE: And so in
this sort of world

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.060
of fake news, how
have you thought

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:37.350
about sort of guarding against
becoming a propaganda machine.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.999
I'm thinking about the
Donald Trump thing.

00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:43.290
Now that he knows that that
happened, which he probably

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:44.354
didn't like very much--

00:40:44.354 --> 00:40:46.020
BILL GRIFFIN: I doubt
he loves too much.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.566
He seems pretty thick-skinned.

00:40:48.566 --> 00:40:50.190
AUDIENCE: But now
that that's come out,

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.010
maybe now people will start
to look at your platform

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.930
and take it much more
seriously, and then

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.350
sort of try to
battle against it.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.910
So how have you thought
about how you might--

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:02.220
BILL GRIFFIN: Well,
I mean, my response

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.530
is maybe a tiny bit in terms
of what I've done so far

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:05.610
might be inadequate.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.620
I'd be happy to concede
that it has been.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.636
What I've done is to when I
write out-- what I generally

00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:13.260
do is like post the
photo of the thing,

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.480
and then do a couple of
hundred words of copy,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.890
sometimes a bit less.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.780
And I'm at pains to
point out that we

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.965
don't have a kind of
political dog in the fight,

00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:21.840
et cetera, et cetera.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.270
So stress the neutrality
of the platform.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:30.430
And what I've also found is
that in the case of UK politics,

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:31.915
I have done--

00:41:31.915 --> 00:41:33.960
so I did that Corbyn thing.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.892
That slightly sarcastic
attack on the leader

00:41:35.892 --> 00:41:37.100
of the opposition, I suppose.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.100
"Attack" is too strong a word.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.141
But you know what I mean.

00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:40.560
A bit of a diss.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.440
I did a Ed Miliband
thing where people

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.545
wish that their MPs spent
more time in the constituency

00:41:46.545 --> 00:41:48.890
that they're ostensibly
meant to represent.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.500
So I sent Ed Miliband a
map of his constituency

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.840
in North Yorkshire,
where he apparently

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.180
was very infrequently seen.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.490
I've done a bunch of
David Cameron things.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:04.680
I did a thing once
with another politician

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.449
whereby it was a
kind of trade thing,

00:42:06.449 --> 00:42:08.740
basically where he wasn't
doing enough with free trade.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.140
So I sent him a load of
bananas, et cetera, et cetera.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:15.040
So if I was to evaluate it,
everyone has been kind of-- not

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.790
as I say, that anyone is
losing any sleep over it.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.190
But everyone's been
tarred with the same brush

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.050
in that to the extent.

00:42:24.316 --> 00:42:26.940
AUDIENCE: If they're starting to
see that something will happen

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.524
if a wish with them attached
to it starts becoming a thing,

00:42:31.524 --> 00:42:32.940
that they might
start going right.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.750
This wish about
Donald Trump being

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.190
shown for who he is actually
needs to be stopped.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.480
And then they try to stop
it from becoming the wish.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.650
You know that sort of--

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.441
BILL GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:42:41.441 --> 00:42:43.145
I guess you'd have to kind of--

00:42:43.145 --> 00:42:46.020
the stars that I've taken
so far-- and as I say,

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.730
if a sufficient
number of people feel

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:48.810
that this is something
they want to see

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:50.420
happen, I'm not a
political person.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.580
But I will make your wish--
naked Trump statue, whatever--

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.160
I will make it kind of manifest.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.342
But whilst doing that, I'm going
to stress that personally, I

00:42:58.342 --> 00:43:00.300
don't have an opinion
about Donald Trump, which

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.591
is a service that brings
things to life that otherwise,

00:43:02.591 --> 00:43:04.680
as I say, would remain
tweets or whatever.

00:43:06.009 --> 00:43:08.550
SPEAKER: I think maybe we have
time for maybe one or two more

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.140
questions.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.819
There is one here.

00:43:11.819 --> 00:43:12.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.068
BILL GRIFFIN: Hi.

00:43:13.068 --> 00:43:15.640
AUDIENCE: What's your trickiest
wish been to manifest?

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.850
Have you had one that's
ever really stumped you?

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:21.390
BILL GRIFFIN: Well, because
I suppose I have a bit of a

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.560
get out, because I'm
not, like I said,

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.140
I'm not guaranteeing to kind
of make this stuff come true.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.740
I'm just doing a tiny gesture.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.620
So generally I only
set out to do something

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.450
that I know I can
achieve by 6:00.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:36.630
And I learned the hard
way early on where

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:40.200
I would find myself thinking
about what the train times were

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.540
down to Kent, so I could
do some prank on Nigel

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.620
Farage or something.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.280
And then I think, I haven't
got time to do this.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.446
I'm going to have to give
them a downloadable poster

00:43:47.446 --> 00:43:48.430
or something instead.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:54.030
So generally, I don't
come unstuck that often.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.890
I haven't missed one, yet.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:59.520
But definitely some of them
are more testing than others.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.760
And I'll think to myself, OK.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.350
What am I actually
going to do here?

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:06.330
And typically, those are the
more conventional wishes where

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:08.850
someone will say, my
son is really ill.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.545
And he just wants
to go to Disneyland.

00:44:10.545 --> 00:44:13.949
And because one thinks about
wishes in that kind of sense,

00:44:13.949 --> 00:44:15.990
I think, because you've
seen that on TV programs,

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.540
or you've read about
it on the press,

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.170
or you saw some Go Fund Me that
went really well, or whatever.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.980
So quite often,
those are the times

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.542
when I feel like I'm
disappointing people a bit.

00:44:25.542 --> 00:44:27.000
Because I will help
them with that.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.490
I'll publicize their campaign.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:29.500
I'll tell the story.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.500
And I'll amplify it so
that people who follow me

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.142
on social media or whatever, all
of which is kind of positive.

00:44:34.142 --> 00:44:35.850
But there's a part of
me that's thinking,

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.260
when they put that
wish on the site,

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.610
they thought they were
going to be getting tickets

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.734
to Disneyland the next day.

00:44:39.734 --> 00:44:41.910
So that's the kind of time
where I think, oh shit.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:43.380
You know, that's something
that they're maybe

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.296
going to find that a
little bit underwhelming.

00:44:45.296 --> 00:44:47.339
But although having
said that, no one's

00:44:47.339 --> 00:44:49.380
ever gotten in touch with
me and said, oh my God.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.088
That was so lame when
you did that thing.

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:51.616
I hate you.

00:44:51.616 --> 00:44:52.740
They might have thought it.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.040
AUDIENCE: I'm interested to know
your thought process around how

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.770
you keep control of the actions,
and whether or not you've

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.480
considered sort of outsourcing
to the people on the site.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.869
Cause when you said about the
old people home, with the users

00:45:14.869 --> 00:45:16.660
you could have scaled
that so everyone did.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.210
But then as we went
through the presentation,

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:19.960
I was like, oh no.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.440
You probably want to keep
control of most of these.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.260
BILL GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.469
I've got someone I
know a little bit--

00:45:25.469 --> 00:45:27.010
I don't know her
very well, but we've

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:28.630
had coffee a couple of times--

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:33.160
has got a site which relies on
peer-to-peer wish fulfillment.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.600
So I go on there.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.680
And I say, I live
in Shepherd's Bush.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.721
And I'm having problems
with my boiler.

00:45:38.721 --> 00:45:40.970
Both of those facts are
actually true, coincidentally.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.240
And then someone else
says, I will totally

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.530
help you with your boiler.

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:45.696
And I say, oh, that's great.

00:45:45.696 --> 00:45:48.820
We've made this fantastic
Craigslist style connection.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.820
But simultaneously I'm mindful
of the several serial killers

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.950
who have stalked Craigslist.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:56.316
And so I'm thinking,
there's a vulnerable woman

00:45:56.316 --> 00:45:57.190
who lives on her own.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.540
She doesn't know what
to do with her boiler.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.460
She hasn't got the cash
that it necessitates

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.760
to get Pimlico
plumbers out, which

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.880
is in my experience,
many hundreds of pounds.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.410
And so this guy, who
I have effectively

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:11.870
brokered an introduction
to, is going

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.239
to manifest on her doorstep.

00:46:13.239 --> 00:46:14.780
I don't know who
that fucking guy is.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.430
He could be absolutely anyone.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.110
And so that's one
of the reasons.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.850
And that kind of stuff--
aside from how hideous

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.540
some kind of incident would
be of that nature, obviously--

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.870
but that shit can kill a
platform in seconds, rightly.

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:31.430
You know, I'm amazed that Airbnb
have come back so many times

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.530
from people trashing
apartments in New York,

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.140
and having amphetamine-fueled
gay orgies,

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.640
and all this kind of crazy
stuff that's happened there

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.830
on many, many occasions.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.597
And in fairness to
Brian Chesky and co.

00:46:41.597 --> 00:46:43.430
They've always managed
that incredibly well.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.180
But I didn't want to
be dealing with that.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.680
And so I thought that
if I'm in charge of it,

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.340
that works better.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.820
And it de-risks it.

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.740
And editorially, I can
sign off my own kind

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.800
of idea, which in
implementational terms

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.264
just makes it way simpler.

00:46:59.264 --> 00:47:00.680
It's like working
for an ad agency

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.139
and pitching an
idea to the client,

00:47:02.139 --> 00:47:04.554
and then going to sit in the
client's chair and say, yeah.

00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:05.340
I buy your idea.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.250
It makes it much, much
easier, because I've

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:08.570
got to do something every day.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.460
There are, however,
occasions where

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.734
if it's publicizing
someone's fundraising

00:47:14.734 --> 00:47:16.900
idea or a little boy wants
a load of birthday cards,

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.590
or whatever.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:18.100
I just say, look.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.230
Send me all the birthday cards.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:20.980
I'll package them up
into a single parcel,

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.040
which makes more sense.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.320
Easier, domestic.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.032
Cost of a stamp of
an international.

00:47:25.032 --> 00:47:25.990
And I'll send them all.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.570
And that works
really, really well.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:29.710
Or people will get in
touch with me directly.

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.293
And again, it says
on the site, if you

00:47:31.293 --> 00:47:33.079
think you can help
out, then email me.

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:34.745
And then I can slightly
vet that person.

00:47:34.745 --> 00:47:39.550
So they'll say, look, I'm great
at public speaking or helping

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:41.622
people overcome
confidence issues.

00:47:41.622 --> 00:47:43.080
And here's my
credentials for that.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:43.960
And then I can say, OK.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.460
Let's meet and have
a cup of coffee.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.254
And I've met loads
and loads of people.

00:47:47.254 --> 00:47:48.670
Because very
frequently the wishes

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.197
relates to our career
dilemmas and so on.

00:47:51.197 --> 00:47:52.030
So I just say, look.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.480
Come in.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.563
We'll have a conversation.

00:47:53.563 --> 00:47:54.254
And we'll meet.

00:47:54.254 --> 00:47:56.170
And that's invaluable
kind of feedback to get.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.878
Oh, how did you find
out about this site?

00:47:57.878 --> 00:47:58.780
Blah, blah, blah.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.380
About 98% of the time I
retain that control myself,

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.210
just because, as I say,
it would terrify me

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.827
to broker two strangers,
introduce them to each other.

00:48:07.827 --> 00:48:08.660
That could be weird.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:11.630
Is that it?

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:12.287
Is it time up?

00:48:12.287 --> 00:48:13.120
It's half past 1:00.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.290
You need to get back, guys.

00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:18.070
SPEAKER: Thank you very
much for coming, Bill.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:19.300
It's been really fascinating.

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.300
BILL GRIFFIN: Thank you
very much for listening.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.350
I really appreciate it.
