00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.830
Data and interoperability standards
are the virtually ubiquitous plumbing

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.540
that underly all contemporary health
informatic systems and tools.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.790
Given the complexity of health care,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.740
it should not be surprising that
this is a complicated topic.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.210
In fact,
we're dividing it into two lessons.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.260
In Lesson 5A, we'll focus on how health
data is represented, Data Standards.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.670
In Lesson 5B on how it is packaged
into documents, transported,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.559
and shared, Interoperability Standards.
