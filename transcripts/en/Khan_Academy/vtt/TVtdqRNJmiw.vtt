00:00:00.971 --> 00:00:03.701
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:05.784
is add 48,029 to 233,930.

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:10.005
And like always, pause this
video, and I really encourage

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.625
you to try to figure it out on your own,

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.349
and let's see if we get the same answer.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.067
And if we don't, why?

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:17.494
Alright, so the way I'm
going to tackle this,

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:19.129
I assume that you've had a go at it,

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:20.826
I'm going to take the larger number.

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:21.914
I'm going to write it on top.

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:23.247
I'm really doing the standard method.

00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:27.129
There's multiple ways where you
can add multi-digit numbers,

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:30.056
but what I'm going to do is
really the most typical method.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:32.087
And then I'm going to write
the smaller number below it,

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:34.328
but I'm going to match up the place value.

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:36.589
So I'm going to write the ones place

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:38.798
in the same column as the
ones place on the top number.

00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:42.131
So this is the 10,000s place, so 48,029.

00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:47.645
So nine ones is zero ones,
two tens, three tens,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:49.433
so on and so forth.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.600
And now I am ready to add.

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:55.815
So let's start in the ones place.

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:57.394
And if I'm adding numbers,

00:00:57.394 --> 00:00:59.661
it's always a good idea to
start in the ones place.

00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.828
Zero ones plus nine ones is nine ones.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.813
Then I can go into the tens place.

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:09.980
Three tens plus two tens is five tens.

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.314
This is going well, alright.

00:01:13.314 --> 00:01:16.054
Then I go to the hundreds place.

00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:18.086
Nine hundreds plus zero hundreds,

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:19.758
well, that's just going
to be nine hundreds.

00:01:19.758 --> 00:01:21.265
So far, so good.

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:23.810
Alright, now something
interesting is going to happen

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.570
in the thousands place.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.322
Three thousands plus eight thousands,

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.099
well, that would be 11 thousands.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.266
But we can rewrite 11
thousands as 1000 and one 10000

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:39.437
sometimes you might see this
described as carrying the one.

00:01:39.437 --> 00:01:44.018
Three plus eight is 11
where you carry the one.

00:01:44.018 --> 00:01:46.467
But all you're really doing is regrouping.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:50.896
3000 plus 8000 is 11000, we
write the 1000 here and we

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:54.548
write the 10000 right over
there, the 10000 place.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:58.715
And now so we have one 10000
plus three 10000s plus four

00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:03.342
10000s so one plus three
plus four that's eight 10000s

00:02:03.342 --> 00:02:04.175
or 80000.

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:08.642
And then last but not least
we have these two hundred

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:10.447
thousands right over there and we're done.

00:02:10.447 --> 00:02:13.447
281,959 did you get the same answer?
