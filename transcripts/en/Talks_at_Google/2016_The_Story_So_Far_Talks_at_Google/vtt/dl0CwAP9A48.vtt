00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.680
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very much
for coming or listening online.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.805
My name's [? Trinh Tsao ?].

00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:08.570
I'm an engineer at Google.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.990
Today, I'm very honored to
introduce my teacher, Chan

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.810
Master YongHua.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.710
Born in south Vietnam,
Master YongHua

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.680
received a BS from
the University

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.980
of Minnesota and an MBA
from University of Chicago.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.540
After working in corporate
management in 1995,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.110
he left the corporate
life to become a monk

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.250
and to study with the
Great Chan Xuan Hua.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.370
In 2005, after 10 years
of meditation training

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.820
and over three years of solitary
retreat, he became a teacher.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.040
He is currently the
abbot of Lu Mountain

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.960
Temple in Southern California.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.420
For the last 11 years, he has
lectured on Mahayana Buddhism,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.660
taught Chan, also
several books, and also

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.310
is currently appearing on a
weekly [INAUDIBLE] TV show.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.236
I encountered Chan
and Master YongHua's

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:04.819
teaching 2 and 1/2
years ago after getting

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.160
exposed to meditation through
our own Search Inside Yourself

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.660
class.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.290
I was looking for ways to
establish a meditation habit

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.210
to manage the stress for a
busy life-- for my busy life

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.070
as a [? coder ?] and a new mom.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.340
But the breakthrough
did not happen

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.382
until I went to a Chan
retreat in Lu Mountain Temple

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:28.590
at a friend's recommendation.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.000
The two-week retreat was a
very transformative experience

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.140
for me, and meditating
more than 12 hours a day,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.600
that's more than
I have ever done

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.200
before without feeling bored.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.670
And then I went through a few
noticeable stages of progress,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.430
experienced great
peace and relaxation,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.420
and came back feeling
much healthier,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.680
physically and mentally.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.990
Ever since then, I have been
meditating almost every day.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.610
And I see myself
become a better person,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.950
and be more compassionate, less
selfish, healthier, and more

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.620
productive at home and at work.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.780
So that's why I believe Chan
is a really powerful meditation

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.280
method, and I would like to
bring to Google so that more

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.220
people can benefit from it.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.750
Without further
ado, please join me.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.336
Welcome Chan Master YongHua.

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:23.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:28.780
MASTER YONGHUA:
Thank you, Trinh.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.300
That's quite an introduction.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.802
Thank you all for coming.

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:33.500
I'm Master YongHua.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.040
Can call me Master,
just to keep it simple.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.850
This is one of my students,
venerable [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.970
He's been with me how long now?

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.320
SPEAKER 3: About five years,
if you count the whole time.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.280
MASTER YONGHUA: The
whole time five years.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.940
So today, we'd like to
give you an introduction

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.440
to our form of meditation,
the Chan meditation.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.393
Ours is really kind of
hard core meditation.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.040
The Chan meditation is quite
different from the meditation

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.400
that most of you are used to.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.730
Most of you are probably
aware the Hinayana meditation,

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.060
which stresses-- the teachers
stress about mindfulness.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.690
You hear the word
mindfulness, usually

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.410
it's Hinayana meditation.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.130
Or you hear about practicing
loving kindness, loving

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.730
compassion, or maybe Vipassana,
that's Hinayana meditation.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:51.514
We are more involved than that.

00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:52.930
Oh, and by the
way, this is very--

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.040
we are very casual, so
feel free to ask questions,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.160
express your opinions.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.230
Chan meditation is quite
different from Tibetan

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.940
Buddhism.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.870
Tibetan Buddhism,
by the way, stresses

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.860
mantras or tantric practices.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.149
You recite these mantras as
part of the main practice

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.760
for the prayers.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.592
We are-- Chan is more
hard core meditation.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.810
So what does it mean
to the practitioners?

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:39.890
Chan meditation has a
wide range of pursuits,

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.180
from world pursuits
to transcendental

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.200
all the way to enlightenment.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.790
Frankly personally,
I practice Chan

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.360
to try to become enlightened.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.980
And so what it means is
that the Chan practitioner

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.850
will be given a
better foundation,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.140
be able to build a better
foundation for meditation.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.030
And we have a wide range
of methods of practice.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:16.740
And therefore our history,
my practice of Chan,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.170
my teaching of Chan
in the last 11 years

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:26.240
or so, we have been able to
help people get faster results,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.130
whether they come
from-- I have students

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.590
who came from yoga, from
Hinayana meditation, from Zen.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.217
Master [INAUDIBLE] here was a
Zen practitioner for 10 years.

00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:41.300
SPEAKER 3: About 10 years.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.110
MASTER YONGHUA: And
how did we meet?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.800
SPEAKER 3: We met
at a cafeteria,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.564
at a Buddhist cafeteria.

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:49.980
MASTER YONGHUA:
At another temple.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.210
SPEAKER 3: At
another temple, yes.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.293
MASTER YONGHUA: Big temple
in southern California.

00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:56.330
I'm sure you've heard
of it, Hsi Lai Temple.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.670
And I was minding my
business eating my lunch,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.410
and he came over and said--
he started talking to me.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.960
I was kind of annoyed,
because when we eat lunch,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.610
we don't talk.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.780
We don't open our mouth, because
we have a precept against that.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.740
We have a rule of comportment
where when we chew,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.160
we don't talk.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.850
So I was rather annoyed,
but he kept on insisting.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.150
And so he said he was on his
way to his teacher's meditation

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:37.330
at temple in the mountain in
a further area, a remote area.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.670
And he said he
was practicing Zen

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.530
for-- had been practicing
Zen for 10 years now.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.740
I looked at him and said, how
come you practice meditation

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.610
for so long and yet you really
have no concentration power

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.110
at all?

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.126
SPEAKER 3: The first
thing that he said to me.

00:06:56.126 --> 00:06:58.000
MASTER YONGHUA: Chan
language is very direct.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.760
We don't beat around the bush.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.160
And that piqued his
interest, I think.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.560
And he decided to come and
learn more about concentration.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.650
Concentration in
Chan meditation is

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.430
we focus on developing
concentration power.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.370
Concentration is measured by
the term called samadhi power

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.840
or dhyana.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.330
So Chan meditation
is very precise.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.770
You measure your progress by
your level of concentration.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.940
So the higher the
level concentration,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.020
you will advance you.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:50.520
This was started-- our style
of practice came from China.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.640
Chan is a Chinese word.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.160
And it was brought to
China by an Indian monk

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.950
by the name of Bodhidharma.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:06.730
He's the first Chinese
patriarch in Mahayana.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.560
And so he founded
the Chinese Chan.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:20.360
He didn't speak much Chinese.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.600
And yet he was able to teach
meditation to his students.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:35.210
So Chan is a practice
beyond words.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.360
And it directly
points to the mind.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.201
And if you see the mind,
you see your nature,

00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:43.159
you become enlightened.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.032
So the objective of meditation
with our kind of practice

00:08:50.032 --> 00:08:55.225
is to really open ourselves.

00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:58.370
All right?

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.780
AUDIENCE: Sorry, would you
mind turning up the volume?

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.760
Is that possible?

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we can.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.194
But any louder, and
it'll start to feed back.

00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:11.110
MASTER YONGHUA: I'll try
to speak up a little.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.445
And then later.

00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:23.070
around 8th century
or so, the Japanese

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.220
came to China to study
Chan because they

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.550
wanted to further their
understanding of Mahayana

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.515
teachings.

00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:36.290
And they found that the
best way to understand,

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.010
to penetrate the deeper
meaning of the teachings,

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.180
then you need to
go through Chan.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.860
So the Japanese
monks came to China

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.900
and learned Chan for
about three years.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.960
They brought it back to
Japan and called it Zen.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.560
So Zen is like a subset
of Chan, you ask me.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.660
It's hard to really
perfect anything

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:08.120
at all, to really study
well in three years' time.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:14.700
In our world, PhD takes about
7 to 10 years, let's face it.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.670
And then my late
master, my late teacher

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.920
is a Chinese monk by
the name of XuanHua.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.210
Has anyone heard of him?

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:34.050
He's what is called a
patriarch of orthodox Buddhism.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.102
Buddhism is organized around--
Chinese Buddhism is organized

00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:41.310
around lineages of patriarchs.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.340
So, for example, the
major lineage of Buddhism

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.470
is originated by
Shakyamuni Buddha.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.190
And then he designated first
patriarch, venerable Kasyapa.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.020
And the second
patriarch and my teacher

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:01.050
was the last known
patriarch in Buddhism.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.780
And the distinctive
characteristic

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:09.580
of all these patriarchs is that
they're all Chan patriarchs

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.650
as well.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.840
They understand Chan.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.200
They thoroughly understand Chan.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.070
So that's why I learned
my trade from my teacher.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.030
So our temple is a
tiny, tiny temple.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.200
And we quietly go about
practicing our way.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.610
I don't know how
[? Trinh ?] got to us.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:40.260
And today I brought a few
of my students with me.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:47.530
And Chan is able to benefit
a wide range of practitioners

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.250
from very young to very old.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.050
Some of the students that
you notice in these pictures

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.780
is that-- our practice
is kind of more

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.420
rigorous than the typical
meditation practice.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.040
You notice, for example,
we sit in Full Lotus.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.535
It's called Full Lotus.

00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:08.775
We cross our legs.

00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:12.440
And you try to do that,
it hurts like hell.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.220
It's very, very painful
for most people.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:27.440
These students practice
Chan because-- see

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.680
I have some pictures here
of-- that's Anna right there.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.084
She's from Mexico.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:46.120
We have students from various
ethnicities, Mexican, Korean.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.620
The third picture of
this man right there

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:55.942
is a layperson who practiced
meditation for over 10 years.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.160
And he came to us,
and he learned Chan.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.720
And he got so happy, and
he got so much healthier

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.640
that he decided
to become a monk.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.490
Just like a Master [INAUDIBLE]
here, he was a layperson.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.350
And he decided that he
got so much out of Chan,

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.850
he wanted to learn
more about it.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:24.450
And why did you decide
to do it full time?

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.990
SPEAKER 3: Well
ultimately, I wanted

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.940
to learn the skills to
be able to help others.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.390
I've seen a lot of
different teachers,

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.190
and after meeting Master,
I encountered some problems

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.530
in my meditation practice.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.955
And then other teachers were
not really able to help me.

00:13:39.955 --> 00:13:42.080
I realized Master was able
to help me a lot better,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.315
so that's when I started
following his instructions.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.830
MASTER YONGHUA: We have
also with us Shana.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.940
Shana?

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.560
Right there.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.250
Shana came to us
about five years ago.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:15.960
And she-- and then we have a
young girl right there sitting

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.930
in Full Lotus.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.845
That's Tex Beaumont next
to her, the country singer.

00:14:21.845 --> 00:14:26.510
He used to be quite
famous in the UK.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.050
And then we have
students from Portugal.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.500
The last picture
at the lower row

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:41.100
is an assistant professor
from the University of Lisbon.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:47.130
She came and learned
meditation from us as well.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.765
Next slide.

00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:53.670
The reason I teach
Chan all these years

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.770
is to help people improve.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.160
Improvement, as I
said earlier, is

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.214
measured in terms of
concentration power.

00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:10.502
You practice meditation in
order to be able to concentrate,

00:15:10.502 --> 00:15:11.460
increase concentration.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.860
Next slide, please.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.950
So I give you some examples--
to do some examples of some

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.400
of the students.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:30.270
This couple here
lives in San Diego.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.490
They commute to us
every single weekend.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:37.010
They'd been bouncing around
from temple to temple.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:43.580
She's a therapist, has a PhD
in psychology or something

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.600
like that.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.948
And she's very
sensitive with energies.

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:57.460
And she came to us and
with her practice--

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.070
she had back problems.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:05.201
And with the practice, she
got better, she got healthier.

00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:07.170
And actually, it's
a funny thing.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.940
After about four months or so,
her samadhi power increased.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.010
Her level of concentration
power increased.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.090
And as a result,
she looked younger.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.050
And her husband is Jim.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:33.050
Jim is a manager, and he
also got a lot out of it,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.945
increase in energy.

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:42.616
And he's a lot calmer
during the day.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.600
Next one, please.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.340
That's Shana right there.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.490
She has her own company.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.860
And she came to me.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.810
What is-- why you
came to us, Shana?

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:57.410
You remember?

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.510
SHANA HAN: I was depressed.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.670
MASTER YONGHUA:
She was depressed.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:14.060
And so she came to
me, and she said,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.570
I want to learn
meditation because I

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.970
am hoping that
meditation will help

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.700
me fix one big problem my life.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.200
That is I have a problem
getting along with my father,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.060
and it hurts me deeply.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.530
And so I said, yes, Chan
meditation can help you.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.930
And so she believed me.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.140
And I asked her to
get into Full Lotus.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.642
And she doesn't like pain.

00:17:46.642 --> 00:17:47.510
OK.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:52.110
And she was highly
motivated, and therefore she

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.350
dealt with the pain.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.740
And she quickly improved.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.490
So after one year,
she asked me, I

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.570
want to go back to Korea
to visit my parents.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.390
Haven't seen them
for a few years.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.372
I said, no, it's
too soon for you.

00:18:07.372 --> 00:18:09.260
Don't go back.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.210
The second year-- another
year passed, and she said,

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.250
can I go back now?

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.440
And I said, yes,
you may go back.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.030
You may go back for--
but don't stay with them

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.520
for more than two days.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.040
And she came back.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.790
And of course, as
usual, she doesn't

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.050
listen to my instructions.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.240
She stayed on the third day.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.390
And she called me and said,
my father is driving me crazy.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.140
I want to kill him or
something like that.

00:18:37.852 --> 00:18:41.046
And the third year, that
was around last year,

00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:44.392
a couple years ago,
she said, I really

00:18:44.392 --> 00:18:45.850
want to go back
and see my parents.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.880
I said, yes, you're ready.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.900
And she came back, and
what happened, Shana?

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.062
Could you share it with us?

00:18:55.062 --> 00:18:55.986
SHANA HAN: This year?

00:18:55.986 --> 00:18:56.849
This visit?

00:18:56.849 --> 00:18:58.140
MASTER YONGHUA: Yeah, whatever.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.520
SHANA HAN: Oh, well, I'm
all good with my father now.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.930
[INAUDIBLE] now.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.140
MASTER YONGHUA: So
Shana came back.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:12.560
And her father, instead of
picking fights with her,

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.010
he was eating off her hands.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.620
And so the point
I'm making here is

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.150
that if you really have
needs in your life,

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.360
and you're willing
to work hard, then

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.050
Chan could be helpful to you.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:38.610
Because we pass
on-- we would like

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:43.250
to pass on that
knowledge to help people,

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:53.190
to help improve your life, to
help you get what you want.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:59.040
Whatever it is you want,
Chan can be very helpful.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.050
And as a result, what's
so nice about Shana,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.380
I'm very proud of that fact, is
that she got a lot out of Chan.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.340
And she decided to share it.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.580
So she started teaching
Chan on her own.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:24.550
She spent her own money, her
own time to teach people Chan.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.696
It's not-- do we have
more pictures of her?

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:35.550
And people seem
to appreciate it.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.330
It turns out she has
more students than I do.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.910
I can't figure it out yet.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.300
Next slide, please.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.350
So what is-- how
do we teach Chan?

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.070
We're very conservative.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.880
I follow the Chan
training that I picked up

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.030
from my late master,
Master XuanHua,

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.920
is from the Guiyang
village in Chinese Chan.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.050
There are five major Chan
houses, Chan lineages.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.310
The Guiyang is the
first lineage in Chan.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.940
And to me personally--
I'm probably

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:21.290
biased-- it's probably the
more advanced lineage of Chan.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.200
And later, it
disappeared because it's

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:30.348
so advanced that people
have a hard time following.

00:21:30.348 --> 00:21:35.560
In the Chan tradition,
the Chan patriarch,

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.060
once they become
enlightened-- you

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.060
don't become a patriarch
unless you are enlightened.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:46.080
And once you become enlightened,
then the responsibility

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.780
is to pass on that knowledge
to the next person.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:00.281
The next person does not
necessarily have to be a monk.

00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:01.833
Can be a layperson.

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:04.524
And it happened in our history.

00:22:04.524 --> 00:22:08.820
In fact, our fifth patriarch,
fifth Chinese patriarch,

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:16.160
passed on the knowledge of
Chan to the sixth partriach,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:16.910
very famous.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.822
Sixth patriarch,
very well known.

00:22:18.822 --> 00:22:22.290
And he was a
layperson at the time.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.510
So Chan does not discriminate.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:31.310
We want to pass on the knowledge
to help you get what you want.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:37.360
So in Chan, there is
personal guidance.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:43.970
We guide each individual
to become a better person.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.410
And once you become
a better person,

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:51.690
I hope-- the small
contribution of Chan

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:57.176
is that you bring your
knowledge, bring your goodness

00:22:57.176 --> 00:22:59.290
and pay it back
to the community.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.910
I'm personally indebted
to this country

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.830
and to the generosity
of the people here.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:12.370
I came here as a foreign student
in December '74 from Vietnam.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:20.940
In April '75, my
country fell, and I

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:26.130
was able to receive
assistance from this country

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.281
to finish my education.

00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:32.740
And for that, I'm very grateful.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:38.310
And I feel that
the spirit of Chan

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.820
is the spirit of gratitude.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.980
I'm grateful.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.860
I'm teaching Chan to
express my gratitude

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.180
to my teacher, venerable
XuanHua, Master XuanHua

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.280
because he gave
Chan to me for free.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.710
Like all his teachers
before, our patriarch

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.650
taught Chan for free, just
for the simple purpose

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.170
of helping people.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.230
And so he taught me Chan.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.540
And I appreciated it.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.061
That's why I pass on Chan
to whoever wants to learn.

00:24:09.061 --> 00:24:09.560
OK.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.840
So in order to learn
Chan, I found out

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.760
the last 11 years
of teaching, is

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.150
that if you really
have some real needs,

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.250
it's much easier
to make progress,

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:27.600
much easier to learn Chan.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.100
So it's a very
personal relationship

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:36.005
in Chan training between the
teacher and the students.

00:24:36.005 --> 00:24:36.880
It's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:50.230
You practice meditation, the
increase in concentration

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:54.210
will result in increase
in Qi, the life

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.140
force within your body.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.830
Qi is a life force
that circulates

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.875
throughout your body, through
energy channels like meridians,

00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:10.710
as the acupuncturists
or Taoists call it.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:15.540
So with this
increase in Qi flow,

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.170
you are able to unblock
the energy blockages

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.020
throughout your body.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.550
For example, if you
folks use your brains

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.200
a lot during the
day-- so what it means

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.860
is that you pull up a lot of
your blood to your brains,

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:40.300
where it needs the nutrients
for you to function.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:46.920
And so what it does is that when
you pull all the blood, meaning

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.690
your Qi rises to your head,
then the rest of your body,

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.890
the blood is not as strong.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.860
The Qi flow is not as strong.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.910
And therefore, you tend
to develop blockages of Qi

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:04.829
in your body.

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:07.750
So if you meditate-- you
don't need to do Chan.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.720
You can do Zen.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.900
You can do any
form of meditation.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.570
The meditation is a
process where you slow down

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.650
your mental processes.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.950
You stop thinking,
in other words.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:30.420
And when you do that, then you
are no longer making demands

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.220
on your Qi in your body.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.820
And therefore, it goes back
to its normal circulation

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.220
throughout your body.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.680
And that's why meditation,
any form of meditation,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:49.445
will help you become healthier
and restore balance, physically

00:26:49.445 --> 00:26:52.350
and mentally.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.730
Now what's the
difference in Chan

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.560
is that Chan is
specifically-- the way

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.630
we teach Chan is to help you
improve your concentration.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:08.820
Increase in concentration
[INAUDIBLE] increase in Qi.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.430
When the Qi flows more
strongly, more vigorously

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:16.480
throughout your body, it will
unblock the energy blockages

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.120
throughout your system.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.780
For example, when you
think excessively,

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:28.130
you will have Qi blockages
up here in your brains.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.340
So after a while, you use
your brain excessively,

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:35.730
your mental processes
excessively, then

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:41.480
at some point in time,
your mind is slower.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.800
You can't think any more.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.170
That's a sign right there that
you have blockages of energy.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.870
That's when you
need-- that's when

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.945
it's a good time for you
to stop, take a break,

00:27:53.945 --> 00:27:59.170
get up, go get a candy bar, a
cup of coffee, or something.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.520
Take a walk around the campus.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.180
Or even better yet, if you have
some real meditation skills,

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.500
all you have to do
is cross your legs

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.850
and meditate for a few minutes,
and you restore your balance.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:23.580
So if you practice
meditation and improve,

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.130
increase your
meditation skills, it

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.690
means that-- in meditation,
any form of meditation,

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:34.350
it measures meditation
skills by your concentration,

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:40.030
your ability to focus
in a sustained fashion.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:47.080
And so if you develop the
concentration ability,

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.810
the stronger your
concentration, the higher

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.290
your level of concentration,
the higher your concentration

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:57.420
power, the higher
level samadhi power.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.030
The higher samadhi
power is associated

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:05.020
with a higher level or Qi
flow throughout your body.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:10.010
And again, the stronger Qi flow
will unblock energy blockages

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.570
throughout your body,
will make you healthier.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.460
Furthermore, let's say that
you go from one samadhi

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.090
level to the next samadhi level,
meaning that your Qi flow is

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:30.150
a lot stronger than before,
meaning that-- the Qi flow,

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.200
it rises from your navel.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:41.540
It rises up in this major artery
of Qi, of energy in your body.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.370
It rises up.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.460
As you concen-- as
you start meditating,

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.020
this area is called the dan
dian, like your battery.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:57.300
And the longer you meditate,
your energy builds up here.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.250
As it builds up,
it naturally rises.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.470
It rises, rise, rise,
rises like this.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.110
So it clears up-- first
thing, it clears up

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.540
your stomach problems,
issues you might have.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.480
Heart burns?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.320
Very easy.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.102
Cross your legs.

00:30:12.102 --> 00:30:16.390
In fact, I met with
a medical researcher

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:23.445
at Cal State Long Beach, and
she said that she researched

00:30:23.445 --> 00:30:26.230
on the posture of meditation.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.500
And they found that if
people sit in Full Lotus,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:38.380
both legs crossed, it increases
their digestive system,

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.790
improves the digestive system.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:46.150
So those of you who have
ulcers-- because people

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:50.230
develop ulcers because
you worry too much.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.700
One very good form
to help restore

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.670
your health is to
meditate, will help

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.390
your ulcers heal a lot faster.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.960
So first it will heal
your stomach issues.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.620
And then it rises,
keeps on rising,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.400
will heal your lung issues.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:17.110
Asthma or people who smoke
definitely need to meditate.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:23.190
Then it rises, helps your
voice, your voice box.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:28.850
And finally it rises to the
top of your head, the peak.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:33.540
And what it does is if you
have increase in samadhi power,

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.090
this Qi rises.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:36.540
This Qi is a lot stronger.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:41.680
It turns out-- and I hope that
someday the medical researchers

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.080
will be able to document
that-- it turns out

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.553
that with the increase in
samadhi power, or concentration

00:31:50.553 --> 00:31:55.700
power, I believe
eventually scientifically,

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:01.350
people will be able to
show that you have more--

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.550
how you say that?

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:07.500
The connectors, connections
in your brain matters.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.400
So you open these
channels of energy.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:17.240
That's why your mind
is faster, and you

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.670
are able to see clearer.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.870
Any questions about it?

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:30.600
I know I'm going out a
little bit on a limb.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:36.940
But hopefully, this is a
hint that I hope that medical

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:42.600
researchers will take a stab
at it and be able to document

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.080
the fact that with the people
who have better meditation

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.440
skills, actually the brain
should be heavier and should

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:59.490
have more active brain
areas in grey matter.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:00.095
All right.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.682
Yes?

00:33:03.682 --> 00:33:04.890
AUDIENCE: I like measurement.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.600
And I was wondering if you could
say more about how you measure

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.112
your ability to concentrate.

00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:10.270
MASTER YONGHUA: Absolutely.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.180
That's a good question.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.305
Thank you for the question.

00:33:12.305 --> 00:33:16.621
The question is how do you
measure the concentration

00:33:16.621 --> 00:33:17.120
power.

00:33:19.772 --> 00:33:22.840
The concentration
power is measured

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:30.190
in meditation, any form of
meditation, by samadhi level.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.030
Can we go to the
next slide, please?

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.410
The next slide.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:33.910
OK.

00:33:37.622 --> 00:33:43.285
From the Buddhist
teaching-- this is Buddhist.

00:33:43.285 --> 00:33:48.990
From Buddhist teaching, we are
living-- we live in our world--

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:53.650
our world consists
of three realms,

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:59.900
if you will, desire realm,
form realm, and formless realm.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.390
Where we live is
called desire realm.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.930
Desire realm is characterized
by a lot of desires.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.040
We want nice cars.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.560
We want a good job.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.179
We want recognition.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.940
We want to be loved.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.449
OK.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.760
All those are desires.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.440
And when our desires
are met, we're happy.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.889
Right?

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:27.989
In this desire realm,
from the Chan perspective,

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:31.020
there is no concentration power.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.790
People who live in the desire
realm are called scattered.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.560
They have zero samadhi level.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.190
So far, so good?

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:45.500
When you learn to
meditate-- a lot of people

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.520
I know would meditate
for a long, long time.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.290
They feel good.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:49.956
They feel happy.

00:34:49.956 --> 00:34:52.010
They feel relaxed.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.260
It reduces their stress.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:00.375
But they cannot go to the next
level of conservation power

00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:01.430
called 1st dhyana.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.500
So that's why-- so at the
1st dhyana to 4th dhyana,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.640
you belong to the form realm.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.340
So you transcend.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.845
That's why the non-Buddhist
meditation techniques

00:35:18.845 --> 00:35:20.220
that you heard--
something called

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.970
transcendental meditation.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.920
Have you?

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.260
Transcendental
meditation, all it means

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.510
is that you transcend
the realms you're in.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:36.260
So from our jargon, you
transcend the desire realm.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.040
You move to a higher
realm, like the form realm

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.220
or the formless realm.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:49.440
So what happens when you
move from the desire realm

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.300
to the form realm?

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.310
You move from zero
concentration, zero samadhi,

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.370
to 1st dhyana.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:06.310
What happens is that you
are able to concentrate

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.870
in a more sustained
fashion, longer than before.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.723
All right?

00:36:12.723 --> 00:36:15.990
Your Qi level increases.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:20.630
You have more
energy than before.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.250
You're able to work longer.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.900
For example, when you
go to the 1st dhyana,

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.198
you are able to
reduce three desires.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:40.770
Those people who make it from
zero samadhi to the 1st dhyana

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.210
or first samadhi level,
they have less desire

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:47.394
for-- you remember?

00:36:47.394 --> 00:36:48.060
SPEAKER 3: Food.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.101
MASTER YONGHUA: For food.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.530
Easier to lose weight.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.980
They have less desire for
what, Master [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.980
SPEAKER 3: Sleep.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.896
MASTER YONGHUA: Sleep.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.070
And then finally, what else?

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.830
SPEAKER 3: Have sex.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:11.370
MASTER YONGHUA: Who said that?

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.301
Can we share that?

00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:16.800
No?

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.760
So mentally, your mental
make-up, yes, you still

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.820
have desire for food.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.310
Yes, you still want to sleep.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.780
Yes, you still want to have sex.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:38.610
But it's not as
overpowering as before.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:42.020
So that's 1st dhyana.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.180
All right?

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:49.320
So as you get to next level, 2nd
dhyana, 3rd dhyana, 4th dhyana,

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.890
you're at the peak
of the desire realm--

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.820
I'm sorry, the form realm.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.480
Then from the 4th
dhyana to the next level

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.120
is called 5th samadhi.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.380
That's why we distinguish
them by dhyana versus samadhi.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.160
Dhyana is still
in the form realm.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.310
Samadhi is in the
formless realm.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:13.437
So you go from 5th to
6th, then 7th and 8th.

00:38:13.437 --> 00:38:15.501
8th is the top of our world.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.870
I'm sure that some
of you know are

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:26.430
aware of-- probably are aware of
the people in the 8th samadhi.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:30.260
You go to an ashram in
India and see these people

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.650
as you walk on these
temples and these ashrams.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:36.140
And you see these
gentleman who sat there

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.350
on the side with the hair
around the head, right?

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:45.270
And then they-- that's
because they are attached

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.560
to-- have so few attachments.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.850
So it's a long answer
to your question.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:01.815
Basically, if you
practice meditation,

00:39:01.815 --> 00:39:06.080
the experienced teachers will be
able to guide you and help your

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.460
improve zero samadhi to 1st
dhyana to 2nd dhyana and 3rd

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.290
dhyana and 4th dhyana and so on.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.640
The reason, for example,
why I told Shana

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.840
back there that the first year
you can't go back to your dad

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.450
yet-- because she says,
my father whenever

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:29.050
I get into a fight
with him-- I told her--

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.835
I'm sure she doesn't remember.

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:34.260
I said if you still hurt
when you fight with him,

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.910
then you cannot
control yourself,

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.870
and you cannot help him.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.180
So you can't go back yet.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:51.620
So the second year,
she got to 2nd dhyana.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.598
So she's still talking
to her dad on the phone.

00:39:54.598 --> 00:39:57.830
And she says, I can last
for about 15 minutes,

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.800
and then I go crazy.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.690
We both yell at each other.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.690
I said, then that's
why you can't go back.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:09.080
Because if you really want
to connect with your father,

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:14.170
you have to get to the point
where he's used to hurting you.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.477
And if you still
feel hurt by that,

00:40:16.477 --> 00:40:19.746
you cannot connect with him.

00:40:19.746 --> 00:40:22.970
You lose your composure.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:29.520
So the third, she
got to 3rd dhyana.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.440
3rd dhyana, she's stronger
than her dad already.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.810
So that's why I told her that
she could go back to Korea

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.944
and do as she wished.

00:40:39.944 --> 00:40:42.740
And that's what happened.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.680
So what happened
between her and her dad

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.070
is that-- I told her,
you know, [INAUDIBLE],

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:51.922
but she didn't believe me.

00:40:51.922 --> 00:40:54.590
I said, your dad is--
I admire your dad

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:57.370
because he loves you dearly.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.390
And she said she started
fighting with her dad

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.650
since she was six or seven.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:03.651
I said, you don't
understand him.

00:41:06.739 --> 00:41:07.780
Can I finish this or not?

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.340
I'll get back to your question.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.120
He's tough on you because
he wants to make sure

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.910
that no other man can hurt you.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.591
And after she came back
from Korea in the third year

00:41:22.591 --> 00:41:26.780
and dad realized he could
no longer hurt her feelings,

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:33.810
make her feel bad, then he
admitted to her that he doesn't

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.740
have to be mean to her anymore.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.390
It was an act.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:39.962
Yes?

00:41:39.962 --> 00:41:41.460
AUDIENCE: Is all desire bad?

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:46.627
And isn't loss of desire often
associated with depression?

00:41:46.627 --> 00:41:48.585
MASTER YONGHUA: Oh, does
it lead to depression?

00:41:51.415 --> 00:41:52.290
Where is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.460
I have a nun back there
who's sleeping right now.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.450
She's dozing off.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.290
I think we enjoy
your lunch so much.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:05.218
And thank you for having
such a nice lunch.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.750
She's not depressed.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:16.700
So the loss of desire, or
your desire not being met

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:20.800
does not necessarily
mean you are depressed.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.590
Depression has a
different reason.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:27.710
It's a lot more involved than
I have time to go into today.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.740
In short, depression is a lot
more prevalent than you think.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.668
First of all, it
is very contagious.

00:42:36.668 --> 00:42:41.050
You remember the expression,
you make me feel so depressed.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:43.940
You are affected already.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.990
So it's very contagious.

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:51.310
And it's a mental illness that
is, to me, personally even more

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:56.120
dangerous than cancer because
it's a lot more contagious.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:01.580
You spread it to the
people close to you.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.020
So it's very, very, very--
it spreads like wildfire,

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.490
and people are not aware of it.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:12.310
And there's no real cure for it.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.560
You take Prozac, and you
take all these medications.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.800
All it does is
compresses your mind

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.240
so that you can now
go beyond this range.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.280
You don't feel too bad.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.190
You don't feel too good either.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:25.810
But it doesn't fix
the real problem.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.820
So it really has nothing to
do with-- it doesn't have

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.530
much to do with depression.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.095
What's the reason?

00:43:39.095 --> 00:43:42.255
Why do you ask about the
loss of desire or a desire

00:43:42.255 --> 00:43:43.422
not being met?

00:43:43.422 --> 00:43:45.430
Is there a reason for it?

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:48.050
AUDIENCE: I was generally
curious about desire,

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:52.250
because I didn't think that
all desire is a bad thing.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:55.720
And I'm also curious about
your personal experience.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.567
You mentioned that you'd gone
to University of Minnesota

00:43:59.567 --> 00:44:01.150
and then you'd gone
to business school

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:03.270
and lived the corporate life.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:06.160
And I'm actually curious
about your experience

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.760
kind of through these
different realms

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.850
and seeing diminished desire.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.830
And I'm curious if you
actually think about life

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:16.940
before becoming a
monk and an abbot,

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.759
whether you miss that, whether
you miss having desires, which

00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:22.300
is something that I'm sure a
lot of people in this room have.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.258
MASTER YONGHUA: Oh, no.

00:44:23.258 --> 00:44:25.120
I still have desires.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.680
We are living in desire realm.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.590
Don't think that you practice
meditation, all of a sudden,

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.270
you have no desire.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:33.900
That's baloney.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.720
As long as we live in desire
realm-- we all are in desire

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.060
realm-- we have desires.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:42.720
I would like to have a red
Ferrari one of these days.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.810
I keep on telling that-- tell
my students that for 11 years.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:52.780
And they still have not
given me a red Ferrari.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.850
Doesn't mean my
desire's any less.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:58.480
The desire, as you
practice meditation,

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.600
let me put it in the term
that's more relevant to you.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.730
My life is quite
different from yours.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.265
In your practice, you
practice meditation,

00:45:08.265 --> 00:45:13.860
and say you go from zero
samadhi to 1st dhyana.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:18.080
You have less desire, and
your life will change.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:23.130
And the only means, by the way,
that you have less desire when

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.350
you are in 1st dhyana-- when
you're out of 1st dhyana,

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:29.510
you have desires.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:30.944
Does it make sense?

00:45:30.944 --> 00:45:32.610
AUDIENCE: So do you
miss having desires?

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:36.470
Do you miss desiring food, and
do you miss desiring power?

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:38.130
Do you miss desiring sex?

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.480
MASTER YONGHUA: No, I don't.

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.730
I still enjoy food.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.844
I still enjoy power.

00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:47.553
I still enjoy punishing and
giving my students a hard time.

00:45:47.553 --> 00:45:50.210
I still enjoy things.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.065
I enjoyed the lunch today.

00:45:52.065 --> 00:45:54.580
I enjoy coming here
and meeting with you.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.805
It's fun for me,
because the first time

00:45:56.805 --> 00:46:01.654
I'm able to come to a place
where people have the brain

00:46:01.654 --> 00:46:03.550
power.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:06.810
So it's fun to be here.

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:09.460
So it's not what you think.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:20.930
When it comes to desires,
it's personal choice.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:28.130
So to be blunt, the
sexual desire or desire

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:35.640
for food or those
desires are good,

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.850
are desirable in desire realm.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.150
Once you go into
the higher realms

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.480
where you have better
concentration-- with better

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.060
concentration, now
you have a choice.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.320
Do I stay in desire realm
and connect with people,

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.570
connect with my wife,
connect with my son,

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:59.320
connect with my friends, and go
have a drink, go have a steak.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.040
That's you are in
the desire realm.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.080
You are still there.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:07.410
You choose to
enjoy those things.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:11.040
And then you can choose for
a time, when you meditate,

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.720
and you say, I'm going to
transcend this and grow

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.200
to bring my consciousness
to a higher level.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.540
I'm freeing myself
from all those things.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.912
And what will you get?

00:47:20.912 --> 00:47:24.400
You get something
called peace and bliss.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.550
It's a different
form of pleasure.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:32.700
The pleasure and desire
realm is sensory pleasures,

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:38.230
meaning you enjoy these
flavors, this fragrance,

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:45.340
this sound of sweet words, or
this beautiful classical music.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:54.870
Those are the pleasures based on
your senses, your sense organs.

00:47:54.870 --> 00:48:00.107
When you go into dhyana,
or the higher concentration

00:48:00.107 --> 00:48:05.350
level, your higher
level of consciousness,

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:10.610
you will be able to mentally
as well as physically enjoy

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.110
a different kind of desire.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:13.990
It's called peace.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.590
Your mind is more peaceful.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.090
And it feels more blissful.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.822
You feel lighter.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:30.130
This is a lightness
happening that

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:36.030
is quite different from
the central pleasures.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.630
At the lower levels, the
1st dhyana, the 4th dhyana,

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:44.620
the 5th samadhi to
lower levels, you

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:54.260
won't be able to really
understand the finer subtleties

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.930
of this peace and bliss.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:00.040
But at much higher level,
beyond 8th samadhi--

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.250
I teach my students to
reach 9th level samadhi

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:06.960
and higher-- this
peace and bliss

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.090
will be so much better,
if you ask me personally,

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.068
than sexual pleasures.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.490
Yes?

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.970
AUDIENCE: It sounds like
sitting in Full Lotus is very

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.935
fundamental to the practice.

00:49:21.935 --> 00:49:23.476
MASTER YONGHUA: It's
our secret, yes.

00:49:23.476 --> 00:49:25.850
AUDIENCE: May I ask
how you teach students

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:30.320
that have extreme difficulty
or impossibility in sitting

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.200
in Full Lotus?

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.130
MASTER YONGHUA: The question
is, how do we teach my students

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:39.180
in getting into Full Lotus.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:42.610
I can't always-- I am
not always able to teach

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:43.830
them to get into Full Lotus.

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:48.760
It's not always the case.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.990
For example, my first
student was in his 70s,

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:57.140
and he was able to sit
with two legs propped up

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.310
like two [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.010
And then after a year
or so of practice,

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.860
he was able to get
into Half Lotus,

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:07.850
meaning you only
cross one leg over.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:13.010
And he still cannot get
into the Full Lotus.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:17.270
But that's beside the point.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:20.820
Full Lotus is like a
goal, is like an end goal

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:22.530
there, and you go towards it.

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.300
So the Full Lotus
is that if you're

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:30.306
able to get into
Full Lotus, then

00:50:30.306 --> 00:50:33.450
you're able to make
progress a lot quicker.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.350
If you're not able to,
it's more of a journey,

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.220
where you attempt to get there.

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:45.120
And the process of trying to
get there is when you grow.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.300
So we are not
focused on results.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:56.520
You're focused on
trying to get there.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:02.040
So, for example, some
of my better students,

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:06.762
even more advanced
than Master v here,

00:51:06.762 --> 00:51:11.170
they don't necessarily
sit in Full Lotus.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:13.810
They sit in Half Lotus.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.520
And they are much higher level.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.240
So each person is
different, because the fact

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:23.375
that-- so Full Lotus is like
an expedient, like a skill.

00:51:23.375 --> 00:51:26.880
It means that it sets a goal
out there and to challenge

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.390
you to get there.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.840
That's all.

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.343
Does it help?

00:51:32.343 --> 00:51:33.610
Yeah.

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:35.555
So how do you measure?

00:51:35.555 --> 00:51:38.410
Finally, let me close
out with the question

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:39.890
right-- his question.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:47.390
You measure it by concentration
power, very clear.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:49.840
Whether you're a
Buddhist or non-Buddhist,

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.940
it doesn't matter.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:56.500
Your concentration power
is expressed, in Buddhism,

00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.170
in terms of 1st dhyana,
2nd dhyana, 3rd dhyana.

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:04.050
Whether you call this 2nd,
1st dhyana, it doesn't matter.

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:09.140
For example, I met with
non-Buddhist meditation

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:13.180
practitioners, like I told you
about, the Hindus, the gurus,

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.840
in the Indian ashrams,
ashrams in India.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:19.390
They're 8th level samadhi.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:21.330
It doesn't matter
what you call it.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.250
But we call it
8th level samadhi.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:28.490
So there are clear gradations
in meditation in terms

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.910
of concentration power.

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:33.350
All right?

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.220
Any other questions?

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.390
Yes, sir.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.160
AUDIENCE: So you've
mentioned how,

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.300
through progressing through
these various levels,

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.230
it's important to have a
teacher to guide you through.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.900
So I was wondering
is there any way

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.350
to pursue Chan meditation
recreationally on our own?

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.110
And if so, do you have
any recommendations

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:52.920
on how to go about doing that?

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.045
MASTER YONGHUA: Absolutely.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:01.560
If you are able
to find a teacher,

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.340
then you progress a lot quicker.

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.245
Because what is the
nature of progress?

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:17.880
You are not
progressing because you

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.880
don't know how, you don't
know the importance of making

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.490
progress.

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:23.540
Progress is fun.

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.740
Progress is productivity.

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.770
Progress is creativity.

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:31.400
It's important to you
because what is creativity?

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.120
Is it something so
nebulous, so vague,

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:38.590
like only a select few
can have access to?

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:40.280
No such thing.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:44.240
Creativity is because
you're able to look at it

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.250
from a different perspective.

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.880
For us, if you
practice meditation

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.960
and you increase to the next
level of concentration power,

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.660
aren't you looking at it
from a different perspective?

00:53:55.660 --> 00:54:00.986
And I submit to you, then,
when you progress in meditation

00:54:00.986 --> 00:54:05.650
and your concentration
power increases,

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:10.400
your creativity
will also increase.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.260
Because you now have a
different perspective.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:19.730
Now your brain has more--
will have more connectivity.

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:28.330
Now in terms of
recreationally, absolutely.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:34.100
As I said in my earlier
slide, you can go from-- you

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:39.650
can go from worldly pursuits
all the way to enlightenment.

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:43.120
You can practice on your own.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:47.170
I prepared a book called
"Chan Meditation Handbook."

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:49.020
I highly recommend you read it.

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.251
It's in English.

00:54:51.251 --> 00:54:53.150
And you can read
it and you follow

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:56.900
that to practice meditation.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:01.590
And if you have questions,
you can call us.

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:06.350
You can contact us, and we'll be
glad to-- either through email

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:09.470
or phone call-- we'll
be glad to guide you,

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:11.090
to answer your questions.

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:15.640
Now why is it that you
are not making progress?

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.960
Because you don't know how.

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:23.930
To go from zero samadhi,
for example, to 1st dhyana,

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:25.940
there are certain
things you can do

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.540
to increase your chances
of getting there quicker.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:31.500
So with the guidance,
this is where--

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.740
the Chan training
traditionally is

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.910
a teacher-pupil relationship.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.760
So the teacher recognizes
where the student is stuck,

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:45.010
and he or she helps
devise the means to help

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:48.980
the student unstick herself.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.855
Now you can do it with
the help of a teacher,

00:55:51.855 --> 00:55:54.590
or you can do it through
the different meditation

00:55:54.590 --> 00:56:01.940
techniques, whereby you
are able to free yourself

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:07.050
through the actual mere fact
of practicing meditation.

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:11.290
So in brief, to
answer your question,

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:12.930
I highly recommend you meditate.

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:16.040
All of you should meditate.

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.990
Not necessarily
with Chan or Zen,

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:19.830
or doesn't matter
wherever you go.

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:22.090
Just meditate because
it's good for you.

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:28.624
Will restore balance, reduce
stress, improves your health.

00:56:28.624 --> 00:56:38.792
And for you who are in
the business of creation,

00:56:38.792 --> 00:56:42.930
of breaking new
frontiers, I feel

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:48.420
that you need to-- in order
to be able to consistently do

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:54.420
that, for long
sustained fashion,

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:59.870
you need to improve your
concentration systematically.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:03.319
You need to improve it.

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:04.360
Thank you all for coming.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.810
[APPLAUSE]
