1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,460
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,760
I remember what he went on
stage in New York after nine 11.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,250
Who did Richard Gere did and uh,

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,640
was trying to tell the audience
that they should choose love.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,610
And that went on state
state where on stage she,

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,060
he was on stage at some sort of a
benefit. Oh, right. After nine 11.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,470
It was right after nine 11. And he
was saying essentially that, you know,

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,540
great message was at the time people
were just bloodthirsty and they booed him

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,900
and they're like, fuck you. Fuck you.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,450
He's basically saying let's
not have military action.

11
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:39,930
More people shouldn't die because of
some things that these people did to us.

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,110
He's saying try to figure out a different
way to do this. Yeah. I mean he's, he's,

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,660
he's a Buddhist I believe.
I mean, he's like,

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,620
he's really close pals with
the Dalai Lama. Yeah. But, but,

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,830
but in the interest of talking
about what we're talking about,

16
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,820
revenge means a lot.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,210
It's kind of hard to tell America to
not get revenge on somebody. Right.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,720
We love revenge. Well, yeah.
Well, we love getting back.

19
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:02,580
People that have tried to fuck with us,
even if we go,

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,120
even if we go way deeper than they did
were warlike monkeys. Yeah, we love it.

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,170
We we,
we,

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,160
when we think we're being attacked
like retribution and revenge is,

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,450
well we're just talking about
earlier about like chimps.
Chimps do that too. Yeah,

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,030
natural. It's nature. Nature,
nature. You want to get revenge.

25
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,320
Motherfuckers like we were talking about
that guy and got ripped apart by the

26
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,530
chimp rent to bring a birthday cake.
Dude.

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,730
See the other chimps that did
it because they were jealous.

28
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:31,080
They were angry that that jealous of
chanting this compassion didn't get shit

29
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,610
and someone fucked up and left the gate
open and they came out fuck that dude up.

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,660
Ripped his limbs off toward his face part.
Just because he wouldn't give them,

31
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,160
didn't bring cake for them. Where
they female chimps. No, there are man,

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,160
where's my cake?
Losing it.

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,600
Cake must be so must've been good as
fucking cake to a chimp that doesn't

34
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:54,540
understand what cake is.
Like how the fuck did you do this?

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,950
But they do understand what cake is.

36
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,830
Why will they understand it once you get
it to them, to gem. Yeah. It's something,

37
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,340
it's,
it's,

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,580
that's like a powerful orb you brought
that tell you when we were in Costa Rica

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,240
and uh, there's, there's monkeys
everywhere there. It's crazy cool, cool.

40
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,950
Last monkeys, but they're
a little sketchy. I know.

41
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:11,260
I got married down there and oh, he did it
Costa Rica. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're out.

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,560
They're out of their fucking mind. We
were hanging out with them and, uh,

43
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,520
there's a thing called a quad a
Monday. You know what that is? No,

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,170
they look like a,

45
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,130
like a raccoon monkey
thing to weird creature.

46
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,620
Runkee and uh,
they would come up,

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,600
we were staying at this resort and they
would just come right down the pathway

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,770
to where your, uh, your door to your room
was, had they just hang out with you.

49
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:38,280
Like these quad Monday's just hang out
and you can feed them grapes and shit.

50
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,970
They would take them right out of
your hands, but like no danger at all.

51
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:45,300
They were like super chill and friendly.
So we gave this quad on Monday,

52
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:49,350
some grapes, and then he laid down
and took a nap under my chair.

53
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,410
I just took a fucking nap,
like a dog, like a dog,

54
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,670
like the most chill dog of all time. I'm
like, God damn, these things are cool.

55
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,160
Like we were just sitting
there. Just check. Oh, go ahead
buddy. Tickets, take a nap.

56
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,920
You're safe here.
I gave him some grapes and shit.

57
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,230
People want them want chimps at
their house. People love the idea of,

58
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:08,860
of having them. So the monkeys
came over and we only had a,

59
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,730
that's what a quantum Monday looks
like, dude. They're the shit. There's,

60
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,920
there's such cool little animals.
It does kind of look raccoon ish.

61
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,790
My daughter's game of a fake name. Let
go. They were calling him a Kink, a chew.

62
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,760
They just decided to call it a
Kinkajou. What's more fun? Yeah,

63
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,280
they could choose their own word up,
I think.

64
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,080
I don't think that's a
real word a lot of Monday,

65
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,860
but that little little guy was so cool.
So she's an interesting little fella.

66
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,520
When you just gently take grapes
right out of your hand gently,

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,300
right the most chill dog of all time.
So anyway,

68
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,140
we were out of grapes and these
a monkey showed up and they're,

69
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,620
they're like hanging out like a little
looking like, what do you got for us?

70
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,590
These guys are hungry. No real month.
Oh, that's on a monkey. That's like, um,

71
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,820
I don't know what that is.

72
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,750
I don't know what it could water Monday
is what family is what is then anyway,

73
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:55,960
we gave these, uh, my, or like, I don't
know if we should give these monkeys,

74
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,840
these Oreos that's kind of fucked up.
Like it's not good for them.

75
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,940
So I'm going to look at, one of
them only had one hand. I'm like,

76
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:05,770
well that's not good for me to
fucking hand bit off. So I gave him,

77
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,881
gave him that,

78
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:11,290
he snatched it from me and he opened it
up and then started chewing the white

79
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,740
stuff off the cream. He's one of
us, but he already knew about,

80
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,320
he's probably begin Oreos for his whole
life from people that stay at the resort.

81
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,420
He knows the trick. Did he, outside of
hotdogs, he knew what the fuck to do. Oh,

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,380
will do let they make you at this.
You know, they're all open air houses.

83
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:29,610
You rent on the beach,
you know that everything,

84
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:31,650
everything's pretty open except for the
bedroom is the only thing that's closed

85
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:34,320
off.
And they had latched locks,

86
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,030
padlocks on the refrigerator. And I was
like, what are you guys lock that up?

87
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:41,550
And they're like, the monkeys know
how to get into all that shit.

88
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,280
They know how to open the door and
they know how to get in the drawers.

89
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,490
He's like, dude, they knew how to,
they know how to open up egg cartons.

90
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,570
They know how to open the lid and take
eggs and close the lid. I'm not kidding.

91
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,300
He's like, they're that smart.
So in the middle of the night,

92
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:55,530
the first night that we were there,

93
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,390
I hear that gate kind of rustling and
then I hear movement and I'm like,

94
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,540
someone's in the fucking house cause
it's on the beach. It's wide open.

95
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,680
So of course I like grabbed something is
the biggest thing I could find next to

96
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,550
me. I'm out there. I'm
like, Hey, hey, you know,

97
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:11,730
like a nut bag in my fucking daughter.
I'm yelling. Of course I look it.

98
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,910
They're just monkeys chilling,
trying to like get shit in the house.

99
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:18,180
They're trying to find shit laying
around food, drinks, whatever it was.

100
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,900
And of course I go back to bed and every
night I would hear them come and go.

101
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,610
But you'd hear them try the refrigerator.

102
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,390
You would hear him pulling on it to
see if the latch was like if we left it

103
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:29,790
unlocked. They're smart,
they learn, they learn,

104
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,700
they learn all the little tricks
of where you put stuff. Cabinets.

105
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:35,430
I could hear a cabinet opening and
closing. Yeah, there were smart man.

106
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,900
That's so weird. It's like a
little person. It is almost
a little sneaky. Yeah.

107
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,180
There's a little person fuck use.
And they,

108
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,050
and they put purposely up up in
this place that I was at, um,

109
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,870
they purposely string wire
from house to house to house.

110
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:53,310
So the monkeys kind of cad freedom to go
up above because if they would go down

111
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,430
by the road, it would cause more traffic
and disturbances and all that stuff.

112
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:57,890
So they keep them up in the canopy.

113
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,030
So they put rope purposely house to house
and tree to tree that humans put up.

114
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,390
So they have easier pathways to get
down to the water because they say when

115
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,820
they're down on the ground, it's
more distracting. There's, you know,

116
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,270
it's a lot harder to drive. They,
they create little message down below.

117
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,960
So if they keep them up high, it's
better for them. It was crazy man.

118
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,550
What a wild little creature.

119
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,360
They can swing from tree to tree and
they fly up and down the tree tops like

120
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:24,760
that. There's got him hanging from Shit.
Just one most like people. Sometimes you,

121
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:28,160
I'd see one just hang and it'd be
staring right at you. Almost like people,

122
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,580
they're so good. They're the right
fucking there. Well the weirdest,

123
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,040
the weirdest thing is that if,

124
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,640
if evolution is happening all the time,
let's do this little monkey.

125
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,870
Is this in breaking into a
house? Yeah. Watch. Watch US
watch how smart. Look here.

126
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,360
Give me those chips. I love
these fucking chips. I love that.

127
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,020
It looks like he's looking right at
the person too. Yeah, he is. Oh Wow.

128
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,130
And he just takes off with the chips.
Do they know which ones they feed them?

129
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,500
They know what you want to say.
Like guys, just be nice to him.

130
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,320
What happens if you feed them? You can't
know. They tell you not to feed them.

131
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,950
What happens?

132
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,180
Because while then they
know to keep coming back and
where they can get food for

133
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,890
like monkeys. No, they say if the
NAV and they say if you don't,

134
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,900
if you show when you stop feeding
them after you fed them enough,

135
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,950
then they start to get aggressive.
So then you shoot one and kill them,

136
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,980
send a message,
right.

137
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:13,310
And then they all come back and kill you
a lot of fucking 12 gauge and you blow

138
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,760
the little face off one of those cuts
and you make your draw and you go, hey,

139
