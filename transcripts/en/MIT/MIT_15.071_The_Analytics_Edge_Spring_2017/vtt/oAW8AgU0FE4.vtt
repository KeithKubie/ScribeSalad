00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.420
Our third example is about
the Framingham Heart Study.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.000
This study represents one of
the most important studies

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.580
of modern medicine.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.610
It is an ongoing
study of the residents

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.380
in Framingham, Massachusetts.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.760
It started in 1948, and is
now on the third generation.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.320
Much of the now-common knowledge
regarding heart disease

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.610
came from this study.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.310
For example, the fact
that high blood pressure

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.770
should be treated.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.050
Clogged arteries are not normal.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.460
Cigarette smoking can
lead to heart disease.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.530
Let us give some statistics
about heart disease.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.140
Heart disease has been
the leading cause of death

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.680
worldwide since the 1920s.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.680
7.3 million people died from
coronary heart disease in 2008.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.940
Since 1950, age-adjusted
death rates have declined 60%.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.370
In part, due to the results
of the Framingham Heart Study.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.400
What is the data in this study?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.560
There were 5,209 patients
enrolled in 1948.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.980
The patients were given
a questionnaire and exams

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.840
every two years, measuring
their physical characteristics,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.720
their behavioral
characteristics,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.140
and medical test results.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.210
The patient population, the
exams, and the questions

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.810
expanded over time.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.090
The approach the Framingham
Heart Study utilized

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080
was a regression to
predict whether or not

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.580
a patient would develop heart
disease in the next 10 years.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.670
The model tested and adjusted
for different populations.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.479
The results of the study
are available online

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.950
so users can calculate
their risk of heart disease

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.400
based on total cholesterol, HDL,
and systolic blood pressure.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.850
So what is the edge?

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.440
It provided necessary evidence
for the development of drugs

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.270
to lower blood pressure.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.490
The study further paved the way
for other cliniical prediction

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.460
rules that predict clinical
outcomes using patient's data.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.010
Finally, the study
demonstrated how

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.850
a model allows a
medical professional

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.270
to make predictions
for patients worldwide.
