JUDAH AKERS: How's
everybody doing?

00:00:17.047 --> 00:00:18.130
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.110
We love Detroit.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.090
It's, like, one of those cities
that we like to try and travel

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.420
through, especially as of late.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.850
We go to that coffee shop.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.311
What's it called?

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:26.285

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.155
JUDAH AKERS: Yeah, Starbucks.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.103
We come to Google
to go to Starbucks.

00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:35.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.350
But we've been here a few times.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.835
We've played Royal Oak.

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:41.567
And then we played Magic Bag.

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.795
And then last
night, we played DTE

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:45.775
with Incubus and
Jimmy Eat World.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:49.167
So Michigan has been an
early part of our story

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:50.000
from the very start.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.732
One of our first ever house
shows outside of Nashville

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:55.624
was in Grand Rapids.

00:00:55.624 --> 00:00:56.890
So it feels good to be back.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.875
So thanks for having us, Google.

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.500
And this first song
is one of our--

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.530
I guess it came out
about five months ago.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.976
And it's kind of written
out of this place

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:10.518
of this emotional roller
coaster of the year I

00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:12.289
went through last year.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.992
2016 was just kind of like super
high highs and super low lows

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:16.636
for me.

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:19.750
My first nephew was born.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.098
And I just wasn't prepared
for the emotional reaction

00:01:23.098 --> 00:01:26.092
I would have, just like
these bolts of joy.

00:01:26.092 --> 00:01:28.270
And about a month
after that, my grandpa,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.747
who I was very close with,
suddenly passed away.

00:01:30.747 --> 00:01:33.688
And so it was just kind
of like a big bummer.

00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:36.104
So it was just kind of like
this beautiful thing happened.

00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:39.026
And then this really
sad thing happened.

00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:41.155
And I don't know.

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:43.571
It's just like things like
that happen in a person's life.

00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:45.827
And it makes you think
about, like, your life,

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:47.660
and like, what are you
doing with your life.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.620
And what the heck would I even
tell this little human being

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.453
that came on the Earth
about life, because I

00:01:54.453 --> 00:01:55.494
don't know what the heck.

00:01:55.494 --> 00:01:57.420
You know?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090
And the general
synopsis that I got

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.720
is that you can control
certain things in your life,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.020
and you don't have
control over other things.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.290
And odds are you should
probably do something

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.780
about the things
you can control.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.740
And with our music,
we really want

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.614
to implore people to go out
and live the life that you want

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:18.870
and be full of life because
this is the one that you got.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.605
So this one's called
"Suit and Jacket."

We get tweets all the time.

00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:31.086
It's like, oh, actually,
401(k)s are amazing.

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:32.084
I know.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.579
It's not the purpose
of this song.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.074
So when you hear that
line, don't judge me.

were telling Jason,

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.340
we got to do a couple of
tours over in Scandinavia.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.679
And after the first show, like--

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:37.220
I don't know.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.830
We're from Nashville and
maybe a lot like people

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.262
in Detroit, people in
the South, especially.

00:06:45.262 --> 00:06:46.595
And last night was pretty great.

00:06:46.595 --> 00:06:47.390
It was amazing too.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.150
It's like our Detroit shows
have shown this as well.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.544
But people in the
South just, like,

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.710
are crazy at a lot of shows,
especially when there's

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.240
a banjo.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.004

00:06:57.004 --> 00:06:58.670
You know, that was a
redneck joke, but--

00:07:01.628 --> 00:07:03.836
It's just that we like to
have fun at our live shows.

00:07:03.836 --> 00:07:10.165
And our first show in Sweden was
at this small cafe-pub thing.

00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:14.930
And we were surprised.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.050
It was after our first record.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.620
400 people showed up in this
very small town in Sweden.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.270
And we were like, this
is going to be awesome.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.455
And after our set, we got
back in the green room area.

00:07:28.455 --> 00:07:31.430
And we were like, we suck.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.440
Like, nobody-- we're not like
translating internationally,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.150
blah, blah.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.730
We're like, we need to quit.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.900
And then we all of a sudden
start hearing clapping like--

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.250
[SLOW CLAPPING]

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.290
And all of the 400
people in this small cafe

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.500
were like clapping in unison.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.570
And that's how they called
for an encore in Sweden.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.712
And we finished the
song, go back out.

00:07:53.712 --> 00:07:54.920
They call for another encore.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.169
It's like, we're a young band.

00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:58.682
We don't know too many
songs past our set list.

00:07:58.682 --> 00:08:00.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.340
Anyway, we found out that
in Sweden, people were just

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.130
like shy or more bashful.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.892
They way they come to shows is
just they're going to listen.

00:08:09.892 --> 00:08:11.310
They're going to clap.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.590
They're not going to be
standing up and jumping around

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.130
or whatever.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.530
So I don't know where I
was going with that story.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.120
All I'm saying is
that you were louder

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.970
than that crowd in Sweden.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.360
That makes us feel a
lot better, more secure

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.610
with what we're doing up here.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.170
So I appreciate that.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.400
But after that tour-- we
did a tour in the winter.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.510
And if you know
Sweden, in the winter,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.789
it's like the sun comes out,
like, one hour of the day

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:33.630
if you're lucky.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.340
And it was just like
this beautiful--

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.039
like, we did like 28 shows
in 30 days or something

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:39.760
in the winter.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.690
And it was just kind of this
beautiful, overwhelming tour.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.300
And then we went
back in the summer.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.840
And it's the complete
opposite in the summer.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.967
The sun sets at midnight,
comes right back up.

00:08:50.967 --> 00:08:52.550
People are, like,
walking their babies

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.930
by the river at 11
o'clock, sipping on a beer.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.810
It's like, you have to
go to sleep sometime.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.430
So it's just like this very,
very polar opposite country.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.540
It feels like a
different country

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.730
when we went there
in the summer.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.980
So we kind of fell in love
with Sweden, in particular,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.760
Stockholm.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.220
And we wrote a song about
Stockholm in the summer.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.200
That's this song.

BRIAN MACDONALD: Thanks, y'all.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.510
So we wanted to play
a cover song for you.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.380
A little bit about us, so
these are traditional bluegrass

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.040
instruments.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.510
I don't know if you guys know.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.560
I'm from Chicago.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.960
I didn't know what a mandolin
was until I moved to Nashville.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.819
But yeah, me and Nate, we all
met in college in Nashville.

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:56.360
And me and Nate had just kind
of picked out these instruments

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.940
and started messing around.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.560
And that was around the
time that we met Judah.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.924
So I guess bluegrass has a
big influence on our sound

00:14:05.924 --> 00:14:07.340
because we play
these instruments.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.320
But in reality, our influences
are pretty widespread.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.210
And when we were
growing up, we listened

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.090
to all kinds of hip-hop,
and rock, and all that.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.710
So that's more how we play.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.550
But this is traditional
bluegrass song

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.624
that we like to do.

00:14:23.624 --> 00:14:25.582

It's gonna be a
little awkward, but--

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.900
So we do this thing at
or show where Nate--

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.396
it looks better on
Nate,because he's got the beard

00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:52.310
and the banjo.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:57.230

into athletic position,

you feet like that.

But you can turn a chainsaw off.

00:17:36.618 --> 00:17:39.063
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:41.997
SPENCER CROSS: We
have an official--

00:17:41.997 --> 00:17:43.496
I don't know what
I'm talking about.

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:47.740
But we have an official banjo
talk that Brian always tells.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.710
And Nate started
with the punchline.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:57.200
It's what's the difference
between a chainsaw and a banjo?

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.996
A chainsaw has an
on and off switch.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.135
[WEAK LAUGHTER]

00:18:01.135 --> 00:18:02.426
BRIAN MACDONALD: That was good.

00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:04.467
JUDAH AKERS: Thank you, man.

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:06.800
BRIAN MACDONALD: They don't
get the banjo jokes up here,

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.784
up in the North.

00:18:08.784 --> 00:18:10.700
JUDAH AKERS: Well, thanks
a lot for having us.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.783
It really does mean a lot.

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:13.242
We're gonna be back in the area.

00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:16.679
I guess Grand Rapids is not
really the area here, is it?

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:20.116
But i think we
have plans to keep

00:18:20.116 --> 00:18:21.589
coming back here to Detroit.

00:18:21.589 --> 00:18:24.044
We told our agent that
we want this place

00:18:24.044 --> 00:18:26.990
to be one of our places
we call home on the road.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.406
So thanks so much
for having us again.

00:18:30.406 --> 00:18:33.364
And this last song is our single
called "Take it all Back."

00:18:33.364 --> 00:18:38.610
And we kind of wrote this
song out of a this place

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.530
of redefining what
success means to us.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.010
After our very first record,
we had the opportunity

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.630
to play on the David
Letterman show.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.550
And it was right
before he retired.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.192
And we never even
saw it in our stars.

00:18:52.192 --> 00:18:53.900
Because we were coming
out with a record.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.635
He had already announced
he was retiring in May.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.490
The record was coming
out in February.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.240
So we were just like, dang it.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.745
We missed that one, blah, blah.

00:19:03.745 --> 00:19:06.140
He ended up really liking
the record or whatever.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:11.914
And we ended up getting to
play in March-ish or something

00:19:11.914 --> 00:19:13.919
like that.

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:14.460
I don't know.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.918
It was just like
this moment for us

00:19:15.918 --> 00:19:19.180
as young band,
especially, of like,

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.160
we did something
cool, and especially

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.520
to be on stage with Dave.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.810
And you kind of watch
legends as a kid growing up.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.720
And he's like a
legend of himself.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.370
He's kind of the
guy, for me at least,

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.880
that was always on
at night or whatever.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.430
And it's just kind of
funny how moments like that

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.467
can happen in your life.

00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:42.550
And maybe you can relate
to this with whatever you

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:47.950
do as well, whether it's
business or whatever.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.490
Moments like that can
be such a positive thing

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.690
and have just great
influence on you,

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.840
but can also blur
your intentions.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.360
For us, musically,
like I said earlier,

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.896
we just want to make music
that's life-giving to people

00:20:01.896 --> 00:20:03.270
and hopefully can
help people out

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.240
because that's the way
music has been for us

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.936
and the way we like
to receive music.

00:20:07.936 --> 00:20:10.750
When moments like that
happen, and success

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.590
can become more about
Instagram followers

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:17.710
and selling more tickets
and know x and y,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.390
playing more late night
TV shows or whatever.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.747
And those things have
its place for what we do.

00:20:22.747 --> 00:20:24.580
I mean, of course, we
have to pay our bills.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.792
But if that's what
success is, then

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.250
we're never going
to reach success,

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.624
because it doesn't matter if
you're Bono or Taylor Swift,

00:20:30.624 --> 00:20:32.210
you can always
sell more tickets,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.890
and you can always have
more Instagram followers.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.214
Taylor Swift's doing OK
on Instagram followers.

00:20:37.214 --> 00:20:39.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.175
But this song is just
in a simple nature,

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:45.670
like no matter how many
people are singing, the banjo,

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.590
or whatever, we're
waking up to the fact

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:52.210
that success is about us making
a lot of good music for people.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.050
So thanks so much for coming.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.975
I hope everybody has an
amazing week, an amazing day.

00:20:56.975 --> 00:20:58.840
I can't wait to be back.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.838
This is called
"Take it all Back."

00:21:00.838 --> 00:21:04.226

SPEAKER: Thanks again
to Judah &amp; the Lion

00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:55.410
for playing a couple
of songs for us.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.000
That was awesome.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.791
Let's give them one
more round of applause.

00:24:57.791 --> 00:24:59.705
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:25:01.693 --> 00:25:04.200
And thank you, guys.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.860
You guys were in Detroit, DTE.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.780
You guys are heading
to Cleveland tomorrow,

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.280
which is close to
my hometown, as we

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.780
were talking about earlier.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.370
Thanks for spending
your day off with us.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.980
We really appreciate it.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.890
Other than drinking
coffee at Starbucks

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.870
and hanging out with
tech nerds at Google,

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.682
what do you guys
typically do on a day off?

00:25:24.682 --> 00:25:26.640
If you weren't coming
here, what would you guys

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.017
be doing this afternoon?

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.828
JUDAH AKERS: We're
pretty sporty.

00:25:34.828 --> 00:25:37.528
I don't know if you guys
play Spikeball or KanJam,

00:25:37.528 --> 00:25:39.205
or throw the frisbee.

00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:41.600
We try to stay active.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.704

coffee in the city, write.

BRIAN MACDONALD: Golf.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.762
JUDAH AKERS: Golf.

great for golf.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.170

questions here at Google,

as you saw from

for the reciprocation.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.362
We appreciate it.

00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:13.487

brought to you by Google.

SPEAKER: Nate, this question
is being directed to you guys,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:20.800
or to you.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.030
Excuse me.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:26.170
True or false, the banjo
is the sexiest instrument

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.744
in a rock band.

00:26:28.744 --> 00:26:31.100
NATE ZUERCHER: I'm the only
single one in the band.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.597
So I don't know.

00:26:32.597 --> 00:26:35.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:35.365 --> 00:26:35.990
SPEAKER: False.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.918
NATE ZUERCHER: Am I
keeping people away or--

00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:42.040
SPEAKER: Nate, I've
read a couple articles

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:47.420
where you classify Judah &amp;
the Lion's sound as booty pop

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.600
and banjo music.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.969
I think we got a sense of that.

00:26:50.969 --> 00:26:52.010
Was it hard for you guys?

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.334
You guys are known for your
energetic shows, right?

00:26:54.334 --> 00:26:55.750
So I've seen you
guys live before.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.870
You guys like to move
around a lot on stage.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.140
Was it hard for you guys, for
the most part, to sit on stools

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.710
and play quietly for the most
part for us here at Google?

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.376
Do you guys want to
jump around with us?

00:27:06.376 --> 00:27:07.580
We could have done that.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.870
BRIAN MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.110
Well, being so early
in the morning,

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.940
I think it kind of
balanced it out.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.220
But you saw in the third
song, like, a couple of us

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.410
wanted to stand up and
tap the toes a little bit.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.660
SPEAKER: Could you guys talk--

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.290
I'm sure you've told
this story many times.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.120
But I think it's
really interesting

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.453
because you guys all come
from very distinct backgrounds

00:27:24.453 --> 00:27:26.320
and different places
around the country.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.780
But you all bring
similar musical tastes

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.310
that have led to what you
guys sound like today.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.040
Do you guys mind
recapping for us

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.360
here where you guys each
came from, how you guys met,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.260
and then how you guys formed
the progression of the sound

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.050
that you guys have today?

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.435
BRIAN MACDONALD: Yes, for sure.

00:27:45.435 --> 00:27:46.840
SPEAKER: That's a
three-part question.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.300
So if you guys can remember
all those, that's bonus points.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.700
Sorry about that.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.545
BRIAN MACDONALD: So
I grew up in Chicago.

00:27:53.545 --> 00:27:57.520
I started learning on piano
when I was, like, nine,

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.280
and kind of evolved from there.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.290
I picked up guitar.

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.840
And right before
I went to college,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.060
which is where we
met at Belmont,

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.780
I started playing mandolin.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.410
So that's kind of my story.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.046
JUDAH AKERS: Yeah, Spencer
grew up playing jazz drums

00:28:15.046 --> 00:28:16.670
and played in marching
band and grew up

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.280
on bands like Boston and--

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.020
who were some other influences?

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.750
Chicago, all the cities.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.400
And then Nate,
both of his parents

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.140
were in the Colorado Symphony.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.470
And his dad grew up
teaching the trumpet.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.640
And his mom is, like, this
virtuoso piano player,

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.380
who taught Nate to play
trumpet first and then piano.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.770
But Nate was like this metal,
punk rock kid growing up

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:47.300
and somehow ended
up with a banjo.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.110
And then I grew up
like super jockey.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.910
I loved basketball and AU.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:58.310
And in my dad's car, it would be
like, Eminem, 50 Cent, Run DMC,

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.460
A Tribe Called Quest,
that type stuff.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.360
And then my mom's car was more
like Tom Petty, REO Speedwagon,

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.820
REM, Queen, those
type of sounds.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.280
So it's just kind of funny.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.130
And Miles Davis had
this quote, going

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.000
into your next question
about how we got together

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.510
and how our sound formed.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.780
He said, it could
take you a lifetime

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.750
to figure out how you sound.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.790
That's not word-for-word, but
that's the general idea of it.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:25.130
It's like I think
we discovered--

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.420
because we met in
college, kind of randomly,

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.390
at a school called Belmont
University in Nashville.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.690
And it was my junior year.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.970
I was playing
baseball and starting

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.560
to take writing more seriously
just because I'd always

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.300
do it like since a young kid,
but never really recorded

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.080
anything.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.130
I had this idea to record this
EP just so my mom would shut up

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:53.890
about it, just so she would
be satisfied with her EP

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.460
that I was going to make her.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.610
And then I asked--

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.780
Nate was a friend
of my roommate's.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.050
Nate and Brian were friends.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.090
And then Brian and
Spencer were friends.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:08.450
And so it all just
randomly came together.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.980
And that first time
we met, I remember

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.730
calling my mom, just
maybe heavy, or not heavy,

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.690
but emotional.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.970
I just remember I called
my mom crying, just

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.820
like, I think I've found
the song of the South

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.210
that I really like.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:25.400
Because I come
from this really--

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.950
I didn't know I was a redneck
until I moved to Nashville.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.930
It's like one of those moments.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:35.930
So I grew up in this town
where banjo and mandolin were

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.850
very familiar
instruments for me,

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.770
but I'd never written
music for them.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.530
So it was almost
like I was going back

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.480
to my roots a little
bit with the sound.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.840
And just over the
course of time,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.530
we spent so much time in
the van traveling and trying

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.890
to cultivate our live show
and talking about new records

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.907
and just thinking about
that Miles Davis quote

00:30:57.907 --> 00:30:59.990
of just trying to figure
out what Judah &amp; the Lion

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.300
sounds like.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.610
Over the course of
time, when Nate's

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:08.090
doing the auxiliary
chord, DJing in the van,

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:12.430
playing EDM and Naked and
Famous, and Manchester

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.000
Orchestra.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.960
And Brian's got it.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.100
He's playing Billy Joel.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:20.850
And Spencer's playing
Florida Georgia Line

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.740
and Boston, Chicago.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.530
We run the gamut of influences .

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.980
And we really
wanted to make music

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.240
that wasn't limited by that.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.560
Because this day and age, Google
knows just as good as anybody,

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.330
with the world we
live in, people

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.450
have access to all
different types of music.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:47.910
And most everybody that at
least are maybe fans of us

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.920
like all music genres.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.110
There might be one
or two that you hate.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.960
But that's kind of like
the general synopsis.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.090
So we wanted to make music
that we all liked and enjoyed

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.920
but that was unique to us.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.530
So that was a bit
of a long answer.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:03.430
SPEAKER: That was perfect.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.440
JUDAH AKERS: But it
hits all the points.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.790
SPEAKER: And you mentioned
some of this being cultivated

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.830
in the long van trips.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.340
You guys did something like
200-some shows or 150--some

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.739
shows in 2015.

00:32:13.739 --> 00:32:14.530
And that continues.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.090
You guys are touring a ton.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.370
Can you talk a little bit
about this current tour?

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.890
And what are the
differences between where

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.000
you guys are at now--

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.770
I heard that you guys have
upgraded the van to a bus now.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.780
So that's a big
step for any band.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.874
So how it started, you guys
were touring around in the van

00:32:31.874 --> 00:32:33.040
doing a ton of shows a year.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.440
You guys are now playing DTE,
which is absolutely massive.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.990
What's that been
like for you guys

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.490
making that progression from
the grassroots touring, DJing

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:46.210
your own van to now being on
these big tour buses touring

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.690
around with some huge bands?

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:54.050
BRIAN MACDONALD: Yeah, mad
respect to Cletus, our van.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:58.150
It's a white Ford, 15
passenger, parked in Nashville

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.284
in a parking lot.

00:32:59.284 --> 00:33:00.700
SPENCER CROSS:
That sounds so sad.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.512 --> 00:33:03.220
It's pining away.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.145
BRIAN MACDONALD: No,
it still takes us

00:33:05.145 --> 00:33:06.520
to the airport
from time to time.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.394
SPENCER CROSS: But she's
an old van, probably

00:33:08.394 --> 00:33:10.934
like 10,000 miles [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:10.934 --> 00:33:11.870
BRIAN MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.160
No, it's been super
cool being in a bus.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.650
I think it just helps
our morale, being

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:21.330
able to get eight hours
of sleep and spread out,

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.480
have personal space.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.370
There's more time in
the day, because we're

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.580
driving at night and sleeping.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.476
And it's just one less thing
to have to think about.

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:34.750
But yeah, I think it's been--

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.419
I don't know.

00:33:35.419 --> 00:33:37.710
I don't know if I have anything
more to say about that.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.680
Cletus lives.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.030
SPEAKER: I've always
wanted to be on a tour bus.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.920
But it sounds like Cletus
did a pretty good job too

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.510
for you guys.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.030
So that's awesome.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.170
Can you guys talk a little bit
about your newish album, so

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.030
"Folk Hop N' Roll."

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.060
I read a quote from you, Judah.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.270
And I think I heard too
that this album was written

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.110
or produced in about two weeks.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.110
That was a very
quick turnaround.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.720
And I also read this
quotation from you, Judah,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.730
that a lot of the
songs were written

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.282
with your live show
in mind, that you

00:34:05.282 --> 00:34:07.240
wanted to put a lot of
energy into these songs,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.670
and you wanted them to
resonate in your live shows.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.830
Can you talk about, I
guess, just the process

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.989
of putting together
a record so quickly,

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.080
and then also letting some of
your musical influences shine

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.790
through and some of
that stage presence

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:22.159
as well in the songs
that you guys wrote?

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.700
SPENCER CROSS: I
was gonna say, yeah,

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:27.447
I think as far as
the quickness, there

00:34:27.447 --> 00:34:28.780
are a couple of factors at play.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:33.000
One was that we didn't have that
much money to record longer.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.360
And also, our producer
at the time, Dave Cobb,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.489
together, we had
this mindset of just

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:47.460
like going in and capturing
that kind of natural sound

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.070
just like right off the bat.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:52.500
He's really big on just
capturing what feels right,

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.350
rather than slaving
away to get it perfect

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.454
and get the perfect take.

00:34:56.454 --> 00:34:58.370
It's more about just
getting that-- maybe it's

00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.800
the first take
that sounds great.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.110
Maybe you didn't
play it perfect,

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.693
but that's what's
going on the record.

00:35:02.693 --> 00:35:04.470
So it takes less time.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.320
But it's kind of
freeing in a way.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.845
But yeah, with that album,
speaking of the band,

00:35:09.845 --> 00:35:11.220
after the first
album, there were

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:15.750
a lot of songs written with
these new relationships

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.840
with the mandolin
and banjo in mind.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.390
But as we spent more
time together in the van

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.940
and got to know
our musical tastes

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.010
and our different
inspirations, we really

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.910
wanted those to shine through,
because that's who we are.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.590
And we didn't want
to be limited by,

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.795
oh, we should sound like this
because we have a mandolin

00:35:34.795 --> 00:35:35.670
or banjo in our band.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.690
Like, we should play this
kind of music, when we really

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.030
love hip-hop, and
we really love rock.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.930
And Nate loves EDM.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.770
And so we wanted to have all
these different influences

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.390
speak through.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.030
And so when we
approached the album,

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.290
we tried to flip
it around and not

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.292
be inhibited by any kind of box.

00:35:58.292 --> 00:36:00.000
So that was the
inspiration for doing it,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.860
just speaking honestly and
musically and lyrically

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.790
and seeing what happens.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:11.610
JUDAH AKERS: Yeah, and I
think to piggy-back off that,

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.990
we've always been an indie band.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.960
And radio, we never
really thought radio

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.990
would be a part of our story.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:20.520
It just kind of happened
in the last six months.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.440
And so when we wrote records,
it was for the live show

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.700
because that was what we were
doing to grow and to maintain

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.200
the ship.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.010
And our live show is
really important to us.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:39.060
We always like going to
shows concerts that we go to.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.710
We want to see like--

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.840
we want to be entertained.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.520
I want to go to a
show and not be bored.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.260
And if somebody
is up there, just

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.801
playing the song or whatever,
not interacting with the crowd,

00:36:48.801 --> 00:36:51.130
it doesn't really
connect with me.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.180
And so even some of the lyrics
or whatever in the song,

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.880
they're kind of
simplistic in nature,

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.527
just to ring true
in a live show,

00:36:59.527 --> 00:37:01.860
because that's especially
what we were doing at the time

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.390
to grow.

00:37:04.981 --> 00:37:07.230
SPEAKER: Another question,
just since we're at Google,

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.090
we always try to
ask one somewhat

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.230
technology-based question.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.938
Nothing too hard.

00:37:10.938 --> 00:37:12.780
Don't worry about it.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:18.570
We talk a lot about the
culmination of the music mixing

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.300
with technology, things
like social media,

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.750
things like selling your
music online, streaming music.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.360
Where do you guys stand in
this whole kind of scenario

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.620
where it comes to
either fan interaction,

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.460
posting videos on YouTube,
streaming on things

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.460
like Spotify or Pandora?

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.030
Do you guys see that as
being a huge benefit to you

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.830
as a band that's come
up in the digital age?

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.929
Or do you wish there was less
of that, more vinyl, more

00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:46.470
cassettes, things like that, to
make things a little bit more

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.270
physical, more easy on you guys?

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.000
NATE ZUERCHER: I think--

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.660
we get asked similar
questions to that often.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:58.860
In the age that we grew up,
downloading and streaming

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.230
became popular when we
were in elementary school.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.210
And so it's what we've
known, I guess, in some ways.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.780
And so we hear all the time
that people are-- essentially

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.447
from record label folks,
they're making less money

00:38:09.447 --> 00:38:10.530
when people are streaming.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.260
But we're just excited
that people have

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.206
access to what we're doing.

00:38:16.206 --> 00:38:17.580
But with our
career, we've always

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.580
known the way we make
money is from live shows.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.690
And so we're not really
that point at all

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.539
where we can get upset that--

00:38:25.539 --> 00:38:27.330
I'm almost like, here,
just take our music,

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.320
like, just spread it around.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.120
And when we got started
too, we gave everything away

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.760
on noise [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.920
I don't know if you--

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.870
basically, you
give your EP away,

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.400
and they give you
email in return.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.481
And it's free.

00:38:39.481 --> 00:38:40.730
And they can tip if they want.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.152
But it's just a way to--

00:38:43.152 --> 00:38:46.227
I think we got 40,000
emails off our first EP.

00:38:46.227 --> 00:38:47.685
And that was how
we toured it first

00:38:47.685 --> 00:38:50.190
was sending out
notifications to those people

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.590
and letting them
know we were around.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.520
But yeah, I mean,
it's cool to have--

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.740
I have hundreds of CDs
at home of all the bands

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.215
that I loved growing up.

00:39:01.215 --> 00:39:02.840
So in that way, it's
cool to appreciate

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.230
and have a physical thing.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:08.310
But I think we're just glad
that people can listen to us.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:11.500
And it makes it easy to share.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.134
Yeah.

00:39:12.134 --> 00:39:13.800
SPEAKER: Yeah, my
friends make fun of me

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.250
because I still have a pile of
CDs sitting in the passenger

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.222
seat of my car.

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:19.680
They think I'm some
old-school guy.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.517
But I like being
able to hold on--

00:39:21.517 --> 00:39:23.850
JUDAH AKERS: You'll be the
hipster in, like, five years.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:24.558
SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:39:24.558 --> 00:39:26.060
I'm already working
on it, right?

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.140
SPENCER CROSS: You have to
wait until CDs are cool again.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.931
SPEAKER: I'll start
wearing flannel shirts.

00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:30.340
It'll be perfect.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.760
So you mentioned touring
is huge for you guys.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.409
We already touched on the fact
of your history of touring.

00:39:35.409 --> 00:39:36.700
We talked a little bit earlier.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.539
You guys are wrapping
up your summer tour

00:39:39.539 --> 00:39:40.830
here towards the end of August.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.560
And then you're going
off on another round

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.460
through the States.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.043
And then you're
heading over to Europe

00:39:46.043 --> 00:39:49.110
for a lot of dates
across the continent.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.690
What do you guys hope
to get out of that?

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.720
We talked about connection with
fans and growing your fan base

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.010
and spreading your music.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.080
What's your ultimate
goal for a big tour

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.652
like that for you guys?

00:40:00.652 --> 00:40:02.360
JUDAH AKERS: I think
we've always dreamed

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.010
of being an international band.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:08.630
And it worked out go to Sweden
and Scandinavia the first time

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.810
because this label over
there just had a grant,

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.992
I think, even from the
government to bring us over.

00:40:14.992 --> 00:40:16.700
And so we didn't lose
money on that tour.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.540
But I think what's difficult
for a young band getting over

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.440
to Europe is it's
really expensive.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:27.380
And so we're just hoping to kind
of like establish a foundation,

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.830
like a little bit what we
did here in America with just

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:31.522
like grassroots.

00:40:31.522 --> 00:40:32.480
We're going over there.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.940
We're opening up for
band called Kaleo.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.023
They're an Icelandic band.

00:40:35.023 --> 00:40:36.655
They're a really,
really cool band.

00:40:36.655 --> 00:40:38.240
And we did a couple
of shows with them

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.440
here in Canada as well.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.410
And so I don't know.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.880
We're just hoping to get
over there and experience

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.390
different cultures,
new people, hopefully

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.790
bring our music into
that place so it

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.860
can be a place where we
can continue go back to

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.235
and connect with.

00:40:53.235 --> 00:40:54.235
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:40:54.235 --> 00:40:56.030
Well, listen,
guys, we appreciate

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:59.030
you coming in to Google
Detroit, to Google in general.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.200
The music was fantastic.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.480
We wish you guys
the best of luck.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.790
It seems like there's huge
things coming for you guys.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:06.230
And we're really
excited to be a part

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.360
of that journey for you guys.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.680
Thank you guys once
again for coming in.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:08.870
We appreciate it.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:09.710
JUDAH AKERS: Yeah, thank you.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.293
BRIAN MACDONALD:
Thanks for having us.

00:41:11.293 --> 00:41:13.360
