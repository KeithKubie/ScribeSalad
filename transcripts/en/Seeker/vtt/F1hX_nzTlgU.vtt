00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.420
You may have heard of Alan Turing, father
of computer science and the mathematical genius

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.220
who cracked the German Enigma Code during
World War II -- a feat that Winston Churchill

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.350
once remarked was “the secret weapon that
won the war.”

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.580
But what you probably didn’t know was that
during his short lifetime, Alan Turing also

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.190
proposed a theory to help explain a series
of patterns that recur over and over again

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.460
throughout the natural world -- like the spherical
organization of cells in an embryo, the spiral

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.400
arrangement of petals on a flower, the whorled
tentacle pattern of a Hydra, the waves on

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.180
a sand dune, the spots on a leopard and even
the stripes on a zebra.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.280
Turing’s desire to understand nature’s
recurring patterns stemmed from his fascination

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.980
with Embryology.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.900
Turing wanted to know how the small, uniform
ball of cells in an embryo could differentiate

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.480
and morph into a fully formed, complex being.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
His hunch was that there had to be some mathematical
principle underpinning the recurring patterns

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.590
in an embryo’s development.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.720
So in 1952, Turing published a paper called
“The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis”.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.030
Within it, he proposed that the diversity
of patterns we see in nature can be explained

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.820
by a mathematical model, called the “reaction-diffusion
system”.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.560
Essentially the system can be broken down
like this: let’s say we have two identical

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.189
cells within an embryo.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.660
In the mix are two chemicals that can either
activate or inhibit a specific reaction within

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.780
an embryo’s cells.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.979
Turing called these “morphogens.”

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.439
As these morphogens diffuse through the embryo
they causing the cells around them to transform,

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.200
ultimately creating patterns like spots, stripes,
spirals, hexagons and whorls.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.210
But this is just one example of the “reaction-diffusion
system” at work.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.990
Morphogens can really be any two opposing
components that work together to stop and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.990
start a reaction, like chemicals, genes or
proteins.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.970
Morphogens can really be any two chemical
substances that work together to stop and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.960
start a reaction, like hormones, proteins
or acids.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.119
And changing the rate at which these components
interact, diffuse and decay determines the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.409
way those elemental patterns like waves, spots
and stripes appear.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.829
Today, many theoretical biologists and mathematicians
believe that Turing's system could also be

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:13.720
applied to the patterns found in the vegetation
on a landscape, weather systems, and even

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.919
to the formation of galaxies.

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.040
Sadly, Turing never found out whether his
theory was right.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.980
In an age of intolerance, he took his own
life in 1954, following a conviction for “gross

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.219
indecency”, the charge for being openly
gay.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.919
And for a long time afterward his ambitious
model was forgotten.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:37.709
But in the sixty years that have passed, some
experimental data has to emerged to prove

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.580
that Turing really was onto something.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.680
Perhaps the biggest breakthrough to date is
a 2012 study that applied Turing’s model

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.409
to the formation of digits in the paws of
mouse embryos.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:54.510
It turns out that of digits are, on a fundamental
level, a series of stripes.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.419
During the early stages of development within
an embryo, the paw or hand is a continuous

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:00.699
plate of tissue.

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:06.170
But over time, the cells change to either
form digits, or to die and create the spaces

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.309
between them.

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:11.639
What researchers found was that the entire
process fit the reaction-diffusion system

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.650
proposed by Turing.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.400
actually conducted by three morphogens - which
in this case were three genes.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.419
In this case, two genes controlled the production
of morphogens that formed digits, while a

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:23.609
third gene controlled the production of morphogens
that caused cell death, forming the gaps between

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.620
digits.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.729
In other words, those three genetic pathways,
working in opposition to each other, create

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.680
the “stripes” that are digits and gaps.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.810
What researchers called, the perfect example
of Turing’s “reaction-diffusion system”.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.299
Of course, more research is needed to determine
whether Turing’s model could really be applied

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.170
to all the patterns that we see in the natural
world.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.709
But at the very least, Alan Turing should
be remembered as a mathematically visionary

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.859
who changed the way we see our world.

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.260
Another trailblazing mathematician called
Ada Lovelace, became the world’s first computer

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.260
programmer.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.559

Ada is partly responsible for all the amazing

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.480
computer tech we rely on today.
