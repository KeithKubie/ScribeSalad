00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:40.190
Britain 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.780
was taking a beating from the German ships
and submarines and were looking for something

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.870
to build a ship out of that couldn’t be
destroyed by torpedoes, or at least could

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.890
take a major pounding without incurring a
fatal amount of damage.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.219
With steel and aluminum in short supply, Allied
scientists and engineers were encouraged to

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.510
come up with alternative materials and weapons.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.970
A scientist named Geoffrey Pyke was the king
of alternative ideas (as you’ll see in the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.340
Bonus Facts below).

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:23.070
One of his ideas was to build a 2,000 foot
long, 300 foot wide and two million ton carrier.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.780
Pyke named his project Habbakuk, a biblical
reference that seemed to mirror the project’s

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.670
goal: “…be utterly amazed, for I am going
to do something in your days that you would

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.180
not believe, even if you were told.”

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.070
(Habakkuk 1:5, NIV) Unlike in the Bible though,
the ship’s name was spelled with two b’s

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.960
and one k, which is thought to be simply a
spelling error that was repeated so many times

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.479
that it became official.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.930
Besides the ship’s size, what was so different
about Pyke’s vessel was that it would be

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.650
built of ice.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.650
There is no real limit on the availability
of ice; it’s easy to make, fairly durable

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.020
(except in warm temperatures), buoyant, and
very easy to repair when damaged.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.470
Further, repairs can be made extremely quickly
with the right equipment, even during a battle.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.430
The ship was also to include 40 dual-barreled
gun turrets, as well as other anti-aircraft

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.709
guns, and an airstrip that could accommodate
up to 150 fighter planes or twin-engined bombers.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.290
Pyke was able to sell Winston Churchill on
his plan in 1942, including Churchill stating

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.909
it should be given the highest priority.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.860
In testing, though, it was discovered that
ice might not be as strong as the ice-bergs

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.570
that Pyke modeled his idea on.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.829
It turned out that ice frozen into blocks
for the hull could be broken very easily with

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.599
something as small as a hammer.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.590
The project was temporarily abandoned as a
result.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.310
However, later that year, a New York polytechnic
firm added cellulose- sawdust, wood chips

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.790
and paper shreds- to water and froze it for
a much more promising base structure for such

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.790
a ship.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.819
Not only was it stronger than straight frozen
water- with as little as 4% of wood pulp added

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.310
it made it as strong as concrete, pound for
pound- it was also much slower to melt and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.360
more buoyant.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.950
Pykrete, named after Geoffrey Pyke, could
also be cut like wood and easily milled into

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.950
shapes like metal.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.580
There was one problem though- melting and
refreezing would cause warping in the structure.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.599
Tests showed that a pykrete ship would eventually
sag unless consistently cooled to around 3°

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.390
Fahrenheit.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.170
To maintain this, the ship’s surface would
have to be covered in insulation and it would

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.150
need a refrigeration plant and duct system.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.260
To test the feasibility of getting around
this problem, a small scale version of the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.989
Habakkuk was constructed in Alberta, Canada’s
Lake Patricia to experiment with insulation

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.430
and refrigeration possibilities and to see
how it would stand up to artillery shelling.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.790
The test ship was 30 feet wide by 60 feet
long, weighed 1,000 tons and was kept refrigerated

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.780
with a one-horsepower engine, which was sufficient
to keep it from melting even through the hot

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.780
summer months.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.489
In ballistic testing, it was determined that
a direct torpedo hit would only cause about

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.810
a 10 foot crater in the hull, which was insignificant
given the size of the proposed ship.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.750
Thus, it would be nearly impervious to torpedo
attacks for all practical purposes, as it

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.730
would take a huge number of torpedoes and
other bombs to sink the ship.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.860
So even if the ship was broken up, the Axis
powers would have had to invest a massive

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.720
amount of their resources in a given area
to do it (particularly considering the arsenal

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.940
of aircraft the ship carried), which would
have weakened them significantly on other

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.489
fronts during the attack.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.590
If they were unsuccessful, the ship could
be easily and quickly repaired right on the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.590
spot.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.810
So overall, the test ship made the full size
version seem like it might actually work out.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.270
At this point, it was estimated that construction
on the real Habakkuk would cost $2.5 million

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.199
(about $32 million today), which is a bargain
for a ship like this.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.720
There were still some hurdles to overcome,
though.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.520
The rudder on such a ship would have to be
massive.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.470
How to effectively mount this in the structure
in a way that would be resistant to attack

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.449
was a problem, as was controlling such a rudder.

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.949
Also, the amount of wood pulp needed would
have impacted paper production; while this

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.460
ship used significantly less steel than most,
the steel tubing it did need for reinforcing

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.979
the structure would have depleted reserves
for conventional, proven warships; a huge

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.669
amount of cork would also be required to insulate
the ship; and, finally, the ship’s top speed

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:19.840
of just six to seven knots (6.9 to 8.1 mph)
was deemed too slow, even with it being fairly

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.889
torpedo-proof in terms of the main structure
itself.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.199
In the end, these problems, combined with
the fact that during the planning phase the

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.129
range of aircraft had increased significantly
to the point where the need for a floating

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.939
island became less necessary, ultimately sunk
the plan.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.180
While the plan to build Habakkuk was short-lived,
its prototype was surprisingly resilient.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:06:29.089
It took three hot summers to completely melt
the smaller version 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:07:21.300
of 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:14:34.740
the boat.
