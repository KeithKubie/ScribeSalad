00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.010
TODD KERPELMAN: Hi, I/O Live.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.810
It's Todd Kerpalman
And I am here

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.170
with Asad Naweed, who is a
software engineer on AR Core.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.354
So Asad, what's new in the
world of augmented reality?

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.270
ASAD NAWEED: Hi, Todd.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.030
So today at I/O,
we're announcing

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.330
two new features in AR code
that we're really excited about.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.920
We are announcing Augmented
Images and Cloud Anchors.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920
TODD KERPELMAN: OK, those
sound very impressive,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.669
but what are they?

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.070
What's Augmented Images?

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.750
ASAD NAWEED: So
Augmented Images is

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.010
a set of APIs inside AR Core
that allow developers to create

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.750
AR apps that can recognize
images in the real world,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.590
and then anchor virtual
content with respect to them.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.680
So if your app can recognize
an image that's, say,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.720
this portrait up
here, then it can

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.930
make that image come to life,
and overlay virtual content

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.600
on top of that image, and make
it do interesting things that

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.601
weren't possible before.

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:04.099
TODD KERPELMAN: So
what kind of apps

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.310
do you see taking advantage
of Augmented Images?

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.601
ASAD NAWEED: One other thing
that I'm really passionate

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.880
about is education.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.910
And children's
education, in particular,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.710
you could create an app
that recognizes the images

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.860
in a children's storybook.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.410
And if kids, previously,
when they're just

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.840
reading a storybook can
now point their cellphones

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.510
at the storybook, and
then see the story

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.939
come to life, on top of their
books, right there and then.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.480
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, let's
check out one of these demos

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.750
here.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.500
ASAD NAWEED: Yeah.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.770
So this is Augmented Images.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.900
And we'll see that AR
Core finds this image

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.290
and then makes it come
to life like that.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.370
TODD KERPELMAN: Whoa.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.119
ASAD NAWEED: So this
is what I was talking

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.620
about when I meant immersive
experiences is that, as we move

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.290
the phone slightly at an
angle, we see that the 3D

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.080
model actually turns with us.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.330
And if we end up
going a little closer,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.700
we'll see that the effect
is much more pronounced.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.060
You can actually take a look
at the structure of the cubes

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.650
as they are there.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.640
And it's so much more immersive
than the standard 2D painting,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.820
because now, you have this box
that's reaching into the wall.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.390
And the image is
no longer there.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.910
And it's actually
even superimposed

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.800
by this 3D model that's
dynamic and can move.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.180
And I can get different
perspectives on it,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.770
depending on where I am.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.050
So yeah, that's what's
really exciting about this.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.830
TODD KERPELMAN:
And is it a phone

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.200
with any special hardware,
any special features?

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.000
What is this that we're
looking at this on?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.500
ASAD NAWEED: So this is just a
phone that's running AR Core.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.500
And AR Core doesn't have any
specific hardware requirements,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.170
short of maybe just a good
camera and a good gyroscope,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.040
an accelerometer.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.447
But that's about it.

00:02:52.447 --> 00:02:53.530
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.599
And here, we have
another augmented image.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.890
Let's see what's going on here.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.598
ASAD NAWEED: Yep.

00:02:57.598 --> 00:03:00.580
So this is another image that
the app knows how to recognize.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.830
And now that it's done
that, we can see what

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.940
grows as we move the phone up.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.570
And this then grows
into a massive tree

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.060
that an artist has put
together that's rooted

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.110
at the augmented image.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.870
So if you keep going
all the way up,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.420
you'll see that it becomes
a really, really, really

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.600
nice tree.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.410
And as you bring the
phone down, the tree

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.860
will automatically sink back
into the augmented image

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.250
that it detected.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.570
So these are the kinds of
visual experiences and things

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.360
that come to life,
rooted at images,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.890
that the app knows
how to recognize.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.348
And that's what we're really
excited to see what developers

00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:42.684
are going to do with.

00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:44.350
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow,
that is super cool.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.030
I could actually just
stay here all day

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.490
and watch the tree
grow and shrink,

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.450
but I think I have
other interviews to do.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.120
ASAD NAWEED: [LAUGHS] No, you're
more than welcome to come back

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.977
when you're done.

00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:54.060
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.570
Well, if you need
me, folks, I'll

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.225
be hanging out here making
augmented reality trees grow.

00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:00.850
And then the second
piece of technology

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.599
you were talking about
were Cloud Anchors.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.610
So what is that?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.510
And what does that allow
me to do, as the developer?

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.780
ASAD NAWEED: Cloud Anchors
allow you to create and host

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.560
anchors, AR Anchors,
and share them

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.540
between different people
and different devices.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.748
And that's really exciting
because then suddenly, you

00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:23.590
have the ability to create
apps that two people can

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.980
use together to anchor
content in the world

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.740
and see where other people have
anchored content in the world,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.860
as well.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.980
One other thing that
we're really excited about

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.640
is that THE Cloud Anchors
are actually cross-platform.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.290
We're also really
excited to announce

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.170
that anchors created
on AR Core devices

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:48.610
will also be recreateable on iOS
devices running AR Core on iOS.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.940
And that opens up the door to
so many different possibilities

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.660
and a significantly
larger user base.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.767
So now, iOS developers can
also use AR Core Cloud Anchors.

00:04:56.767 --> 00:04:57.850
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.240
So basically, we are setting
up a multi-player game

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.120
where both devices, an
iOS and an Android device,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.055
are agreeing on the same
augmented reality space

00:05:07.055 --> 00:05:07.930
that they're sharing.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.190
Is that basically
what's going on here?

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.690
ASAD NAWEED: Yes, that's exactly
what's going on here, Todd.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.710
I have in my hand an iPhone
that's running AR Core on iOS.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.830
And Brian has an Android device.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.895
And we are going to play
the same game together.

00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:22.410
And--

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.660
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
let's give this a try here.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.076
ASAD NAWEED: Now that's-- you
can see right there is where

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:28.630
Brian has placed his board.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.140
And I will place mine here.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.830
And when I am ready,
we are now going

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.160
to play a game where I have to
fire onto Brian's light board.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.750
And when I do that,
it effectively

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.670
lights Brian's board up.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.400
And then, he has to
color all of my dots

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.560
before I manage to do
the same thing for him.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.900
And he is seeing these boards
in the exact same place

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.370
that I'm seeing them in.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.030
And I can see him
playing the game with me.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.625
And the only reason why
this shared area experience

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:09.100
is possible is because of
the magic of Cloud Anchors.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.880
Ooh.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.530
So yeah, just to kind of
reiterate, this is an iPhone.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.820
It's not an Android device.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.440
And we do have AR Core Cloud
Anchors supported on both iOS

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.360
devices and Android devices.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.580
And we're really excited
to see what developers

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.690
are going to do with this.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.273
TODD KERPELMAN: That
is super awesome.

00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:29.680
I can't wait to play some
really fun, augmented reality

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.100
multi-player games
around my living room.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.040
ASAD NAWEED: [LAUGHS]
Well, definitely, yeah.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.380
It's a blast for everyone,
like the whole family.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.960
Yeah.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.470
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh my
gosh, that was super cool.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.810
If you want to see more
exciting videos like this one,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.780
head on over to g.co/io/guide
for lots more videos featuring

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.390
