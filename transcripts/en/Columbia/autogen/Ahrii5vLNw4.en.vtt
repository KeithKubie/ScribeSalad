within the university because that's
 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.599
within the university because that's
always a little bit more difficult road

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609

is a little bit trying like trying to
 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.960
is a little bit trying like trying to

takes a little bit of research and a lot

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230
takes a little bit of research and a lot
 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.750
takes a little bit of research and a lot
of time and some development to think

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760
of time and some development to think
 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.250
of time and some development to think
about how to how to switch gears and

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260
about how to how to switch gears and
 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.840
about how to how to switch gears and

our current implementation though we're
 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.430
our current implementation though we're
keeping that in mind so we did a lot of

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440
keeping that in mind so we did a lot of
 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.430
keeping that in mind so we did a lot of
research on some projects or products

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440
research on some projects or products
 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.570

phase of our webcast program now it's
 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.110
phase of our webcast program now it's
important to note that as a research

homegrown all of our systems and we did
 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.760
homegrown all of our systems and we did
all of our own development on the

basically oh they also had substantial
 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.430
basically oh they also had substantial
cost structures which we just we felt as

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440
cost structures which we just we felt as
 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.380

systems to do this automatically we

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210
systems to do this automatically we
 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.640
systems to do this automatically we
weren't sure that we wanted to make that

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650
weren't sure that we wanted to make that
 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.710
weren't sure that we wanted to make that
investment and have recurring annual

that we would be able to do this
 

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:12.989
that we would be able to do this
ourselves so we really were faced with

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:12.999
ourselves so we really were faced with
 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.879
ourselves so we really were faced with
the choice between customizing our

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:04.229
product called podcast producer and so
we we started inquiring and asking them

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:04.239
we we started inquiring and asking them
 

00:08:04.239 --> 00:08:06.360
we we started inquiring and asking them
what is what is podcast producer

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:06.370
what is what is podcast producer
 

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.610
what is what is podcast producer
what does it do and you know we knew

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:08.620
what does it do and you know we knew
 

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.650
what does it do and you know we knew
that that some of those commercial

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:10.660
that that some of those commercial
 

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.420
that that some of those commercial
products probably weren't going to work

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:12.430
products probably weren't going to work
 

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.140
products probably weren't going to work
for us we're kind of wrapping up our

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:15.150
for us we're kind of wrapping up our
 

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.330
for us we're kind of wrapping up our
investigations I guess you could call it

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:18.340
investigations I guess you could call it
 

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.420
investigations I guess you could call it
and so we found out that podcast

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:21.430
and so we found out that podcast
 

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.980
and so we found out that podcast
producer is basically an enterprise

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:22.990

technologies and when we talked to them

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:37.330
technologies and when we talked to them
 

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.060
technologies and when we talked to them
a little bit we immediately recognized

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.070
a little bit we immediately recognized
 

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.560
a little bit we immediately recognized
that there was an opportunity to

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:40.570
that there was an opportunity to
 

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.409
that there was an opportunity to
leverage the technology to develop the

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:43.419
leverage the technology to develop the
 

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:44.790

application so we basically decided that

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:51.430
application so we basically decided that
 

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.010
application so we basically decided that
we were going to try and do this within

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.020
we were going to try and do this within
 

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:58.140
we were going to try and do this within
the sky framework and what that means is

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.150
the sky framework and what that means is
 

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.760
the sky framework and what that means is
that podcast producer is a core

00:08:59.760 --> 00:08:59.770
that podcast producer is a core
 

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.120
that podcast producer is a core
component of that and it basically runs

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.130
component of that and it basically runs
 

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.690
component of that and it basically runs
on Apple hardware and the there is no

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:06.700
on Apple hardware and the there is no
 

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.210

additional fee for the actual server

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:09.220

it's a core component of there or not

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:11.980
it's a core component of there or not
 

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.160
it's a core component of there or not
for the server but for the podcast

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.170

operating system so we're piloting it as

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:19.870
operating system so we're piloting it as
 

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.560
operating system so we're piloting it as
a core component and we feel like this

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:22.570
a core component and we feel like this
 

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.320
a core component and we feel like this
this hybrid approach basically allows us

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.330
this hybrid approach basically allows us
 

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.690
this hybrid approach basically allows us
to focus on our specific needs at the

other universities out there that are
 

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.720
other universities out there that are
much more manual and there's always the

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:57.730
much more manual and there's always the
 

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.310
much more manual and there's always the
possibility that you might be able to

00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320
possibility that you might be able to
