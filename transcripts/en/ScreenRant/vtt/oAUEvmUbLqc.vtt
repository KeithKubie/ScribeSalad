00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.750
Film trailers were originally created to display
an upcoming movie’s general synopsis, encouraging

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.700
people to give the movie a chance.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.960
Now film trailers have become their own art
form.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.000
With a killer editing job and an unforgettable
soundtrack, a movie’s trailer can evoke

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.160
a variety of emotions in a two minute spot.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.369
However, not all movies can live up to their
incredible trailers.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.800
Here are 10 Amazing Trailers that Were Better
than their Movies.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.110
Suicide Squad
After years of Marvel releasing one awesome

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.010
superhero movie after another, DC has trailed
behind attempting the same with lackluster

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.010
results.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.250
The summer of 2016 seemed to mark a change
for DC.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.140
After the spring release of Batman V Superman
disappointed, it was up to the Suicide Squad

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.859
to bring some much needed vigor to Gotham
City.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.629
The first trailer for Suicide Squad is hard
to beat with its Bohemian Rhapsody soundtrack,

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.260
big guns, fast cars, and likeable antiheroes.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.390
The trailers that followed were equally eye
popping with copious amounts of Harley Quinn

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.390
screen time.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.119
The film was certainly entertaining but failed
to live up to its truly spectacular trailer.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.580
Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace
The Phantom Menace was one of the most highly

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.520
anticipated films of the 1990s.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.020
Star Wars fans were practically salivating
over the first trailer and once it was released

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.070
it appeared that it was worth the wait.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.829
The iconic music and the lightsabers were
all accounted for as well as an appearance

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.270
by none other than the always insightful Yoda.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.930
Along with the familiar Star War elements,
there were new characters like Darth Maul

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.270
and Jar Jar Binks.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.890
But, alas, The Phantom Menace just did not
live up to its hype or the energetic trailer

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.329
and the introduction of Jar Jar Binks only
made it worse.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.460
The Blair Witch Project
Watching The Blair Witch Project trailer today

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.869
is a completely different experience than
it was when it was released in 1999.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.250
When the film was first promoted as a real
found footage piece, it was a time when found

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.869
footage movies were not a dime-a-dozen.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.560
There were viewers who believed that the three
campers, who went searching for The Blair

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.600
Witch, actually went missing.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.530
This was thanks to the pitch perfect marketing
of the film.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.849
The trailer is distressing with its troubling
footage and limited reveal of the events in

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.410
the film, making it even more mysterious.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.710
The film itself has frightening moments but
the simplicity of the trailer is more ominous

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.190
than a feature length film could manage.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.690
The Strangers
The Strangers is definitely one of the most

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.110
frightening horror films made in the last
decade but the trailer is hard to beat.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.180
The 2008 film starring Liv Tyler and Scott
Speedman follows a couple whose secluded farm

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.810
home is invaded by three mysterious strangers
in creepy masks.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.260
While the film holds up and is scary enough
to avoid staying home alone for a while, the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.360
trailer is so unsettling it makes the actual
film feel like a relief.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.810
There’s the eerie music playing on a record
that begins to skip, the appearance of a masked

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.810
figure coming out of the darkness, the extended
silence when suddenly an ax goes crashing

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.950
through the front door.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.280
It is a truly nerve wracking trailer which
culminates with a final moment of dialogue

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.330
explaining that the only reason the couple
was chosen was because they were home.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.519
Who needs the movie?

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.620
The trailer is enough to spark more than enough
nightmares.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.030
Watchmen
Director Zack Snyder certainly has a way with

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.170
making films visually stunning which is probably
why the trailers for his films are so much

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.010
better than the actual film.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.430
Films like 300, Sucker Punch and Watchmen
are each a feast for the eyes but the execution

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.560
of the story tends to fall short.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.370
Watchmen may be the biggest disappointment
considering the beloved graphic novel already

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.430
had unreasonably high expectations from fans.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.140
The release of the first Watchmen trailer
alluded to Snyder pulling off the impossible

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.500
with a film that could not look any cooler.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.270
The spectacular visuals accompanied by the
Smashing Pumpkins song, "The Beginning is

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.530
the End is the Beginning" makes for a phenomenal
trailer.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.670
Unfortunately, the film is just a little too
long and is unable to sustain the same element

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.670
of cool.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.890
Spiderman 3
The trailer for Spiderman 3 gives audiences

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.450
the impression that not only is the film going
to live up to the two previous films but also

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.700
get darker, crazier, and more entertaining.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.760
The presence of Venom provides even more of
a thrill to comic book fans.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.959
Unfortunately, the film is not an epic superhero
film but rather a much too long final entry

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.560
to the Tobey Maguire Spider Man franchise.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.600
Peter Parker turning bad is just ridiculous
in large part because Tobey Maguire’s bad

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.450
Spidey is not as much sinister as it is laughable.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.360
There are weird dance scenes and awful hairstyles
that find their way into the cluttered mess

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.820
of Spider-Man 3.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.140
No one would ever suspect how much of a bummer
the movie actually was based on the engaging

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.720
and thrilling trailer.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.720
&nbsp;

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.800
Pearl Harbor
The trailer for the 2001 film Pearl Harbor

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.480
paints a much different picture than the actual
film.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.950
The trailer shows a few sentimental scenes
of children outside, couples in love, and

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.720
the general Norman Rockwell style of American
life in 1941 until harrowing scenes of the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.610
Pearl Harbor attack inform the audience that
this film will be filled with a history lesson

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.600
and finely executed action scenes.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.440
The trailer also shows actors Kate Beckinsale,
Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck rounding out

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.570
an exciting historical war film.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.480
The actual film is less Historical drama and
more “Dawson’s Creek Goes to War” with

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.980
Michael Bay as director.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.380
The film somehow manages to make a real life
devastation take a back seat to the insane

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.970
explosions of a big budget film.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.490
Where the Wild Things Are
Where the Wild Things Are was a tricky project

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.580
to take on as a feature length film.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.570
The classic children’s book by Maurice Sendak
is a brief tale of a boy who gets a bit rambunctious

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.880
with his mother which causes him to be sent
to his room without dinner.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.270
He decides to take a trip to where the wild
things are, becomes the king, and returns

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.060
while his dinner his still hot.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.020
That’s pretty much the tale, so it makes
sense that the Spike Jonze film gets a bit

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.650
lost trying to extend such a simple story.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.150
The trailer, however, is two minutes of amazement
set to Arcade Fire’s “Crown of Love”.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.670
The pain, imagination and wonder of childhood
is on full display in a trailer that makes

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.040
everyone nostalgic for a time when they sailed
over a year, and in and out of weeks and through

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.360
a day to where the wild things are.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.460
Joy
David O. Russell’s film loosely based on

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.830
Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano’s life
could have easily become a dull film about

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.940
a housewife who thought of a great idea.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.180
That was not the story Russell wanted to tell.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.040
Apparently Joy had a life that was fascinating
enough to become cinematic.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.070
The actual film is not lacking and while it
may not compare to the previous Russell/Lawrence

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.500
pairing Silver Linings Playbook, it is definitely
on par with American Hustle.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.670
However, the trailers for Joy are such knockouts
that it is hard to live up to the expectations.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.230
The music, the stunning visuals and the delivery
of some of best lines in the film come together

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.600
in trailers that promise an Academy Award
quality film.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.751
While Lawrence was nominated, the rest of
the film was mostly pushed to the side.

00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:52.210
The film may have been a mild disappointment
but only compared to its fantastic trailers.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.650
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
There were plenty of expectations for a Batman

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.080
versus Superman film which pitted the two
DC giants against each other in a knock out

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.480
drag out fight.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.560
The second official trailer may be the best
by providing scenes of Clark Kent and Bruce

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.140
Wayne officially meeting while Lex Luther
comments on Clark Kent’s strong handshake.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.580
The trailer also shows us the big bad Doomsday
who is there to cut in with his own fight

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.230
against the superheroes.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.270
Wonder Woman shows up at the end to really
bring home what kind of spectacle the film

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.330
promises to be.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.890
The film is entertaining enough but it also
goes off the rails quite a few times before

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.890
the fine ending.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.560
There was no need to drag out the backstories
when there is action to be had and new problems

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.760
in Metropolis and Gotham to be solved and
the trailer seems to understand that better

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:57.070
than the film

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.440
What do you think of our list?

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.010
Were there any movies that didn’t live up
to their incredible trailers?

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.330
