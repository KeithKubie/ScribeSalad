00:00:00.981 --> 00:00:02.122
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.122 --> 00:00:05.380
is use the online graphing
calculator Desmos,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.957
and explore the relationship
between vertical

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:10.680
and horizontal asymptotes, and think about

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.601
how they relate to what we know

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.189
about limits.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.136
So let's first graph two over x minus one,

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:20.406
so let me get that one graphed,

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:22.960
and so you can immediately
see that something interesting

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.627
happens at x is equal to one.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.237
If you were to just
substitute x equals one

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:31.367
into this expression, you're going to get

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:35.986
two over zero, and whenever
you get a non-zero thing,

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:39.496
over zero, that's a
good sign that you might

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:43.202
be dealing with a vertical asymptote.

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.489
In fact we can draw
that vertical asymptote

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.099
right over here at x equals one.

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:50.721
But let's think about how
that relates to limits.

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:53.688
What if we were to explore
the limit as x approaches one

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:57.432
of f of x is equal to
two over x minus one,

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.168
and we could think about it from the left

00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:01.061
and from the right, so if we approach one

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.358
from the left, let me zoom in a little bit

00:01:03.358 --> 00:01:06.775
over here, so we can see as
we approach from the left

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.483
when x is equal to zero, the f of x

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:12.093
would be equal to negative two,

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:15.042
when x is equal to point five, f of x

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:17.173
is equal to negative of
four, and then it just gets

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:19.459
more and more negative the closer we get

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.958
to one from the left.

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.694
I could really, so I'm
not even that close yet

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:29.861
if I get to let's say 0.91,
I'm still nine hundredths

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:36.539
less than one, I'm at
negative 22.222, already.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.910
And so the limit as we
approach one from the left

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.199
is unbounded, some people would say

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:43.794
it goes to negative
infinity, but it's really

00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:45.925
an undefined limit, it is unbounded

00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:47.673
in the negative direction.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.779
And likewise, as we
approach from the right,

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:55.103
we get unbounded in the
positive infinity direction

00:01:55.103 --> 00:01:57.905
and technically we would
say that that limit

00:01:57.905 --> 00:01:59.904
does not exist.

00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:01.972
And this would be the
case when we're dealing

00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:06.006
with a vertical asymptote
like we see over here.

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.705
Now let's compare that
to a horizontal asymptote

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:11.823
where it turns out that the limit

00:02:11.823 --> 00:02:14.013
actually can exist.

00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:17.930
So let me delete these or
just erase them for now,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.130
and so let's look at this function

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.956
which is a pretty neat
function, I made it up

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:22.423
right before this video started

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:25.423
but it's kind of cool
looking, but let's think

00:02:25.423 --> 00:02:29.964
about the behavior as
x approaches infinity.

00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:33.269
So as x approaches infinity,
it looks like our y value

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.010
or the value of the
expression, if we said y

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.416
is equal to that expression, it looks like

00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:40.680
it's getting closer and
closer and closer to three.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.174
And so we could say that we
have a horizontal asymptote

00:02:44.174 --> 00:02:47.193
at y is equal to three, and we could also

00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:49.304
and there's a more rigorous
way of defining it,

00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:52.581
say that our limit as
x approaches infinity

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:55.650
is equal of the expression
or of the function,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.150
is equal to three.

00:02:58.152 --> 00:03:00.171
Notice my mouse is
covering it a little bit

00:03:00.171 --> 00:03:02.495
as we get larger and larger, we're getting

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:03.948
closer and closer to three,

00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:06.082
in fact we're getting
so close now, well here

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:08.571
you can see we're
getting closer and closer

00:03:08.571 --> 00:03:10.238
and closer to three.

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:13.317
And you could also
think about what happens

00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:15.469
as x approaches negative infinity and here

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.077
you're getting closer
and closer and closer

00:03:17.077 --> 00:03:18.649
to three from below.

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.845
Now one thing that's
interesting about horizontal

00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:23.283
asymptotes is you might
see that the function

00:03:23.283 --> 00:03:25.692
actually can cross a horizontal asymptote.

00:03:25.692 --> 00:03:27.662
It's crossing this horizontal asymptote

00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:30.537
in this area in between and
even as we approach infinity

00:03:30.537 --> 00:03:32.639
or negative infinity, you can oscillate

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.621
around that horizontal asymptote.

00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:38.788
Let me set this up, let me
multiply this times sine of x.

00:03:40.297 --> 00:03:41.933
And so there you have it,
we are now oscillating

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:44.600
around the horizontal asymptote,

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:47.116
and once again this limit can exist

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:49.752
even though we keep crossing
the horizontal asymptote,

00:03:49.752 --> 00:03:52.108
we're getting closer and
closer and closer to it

00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:53.858
the larger x gets.

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:56.727
And that's actually the
key difference between

00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:58.178
a horizontal and a vertical asymptote.

00:03:58.178 --> 00:04:00.336
Vertical asymptotes if you're
dealing with a function,

00:04:00.336 --> 00:04:03.122
you're not going to cross
it, while with a horizontal

00:04:03.122 --> 00:04:05.676
asymptote, you could,
and you are just getting

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:07.102
closer and closer and closer to it

00:04:07.102 --> 00:04:11.262
as x goes to positive infinity or as x

00:04:11.262 --> 00:04:13.024
goes to negative infinity.
