do you afterwards when you realize what

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240
do you afterwards when you realize what
 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.680
do you afterwards when you realize what
what you were finding out you're finding

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690
what you were finding out you're finding
 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.660
what you were finding out you're finding
so how did you react when you and your

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670
so how did you react when you and your
 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.519
so how did you react when you and your
colleague the initial reaction well

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529
colleague the initial reaction well
 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.310
colleague the initial reaction well
first the first reaction was we have

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320
first the first reaction was we have
 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.700
first the first reaction was we have
made some big mistake in our calculation

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
made some big mistake in our calculation
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.050
made some big mistake in our calculation
because this looks like it's important

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060
because this looks like it's important
 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.180
because this looks like it's important
and that hadn't been we hadn't said when

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190
and that hadn't been we hadn't said when
 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.100
and that hadn't been we hadn't said when
we started out we were going to see

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110
we started out we were going to see
 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.600
we started out we were going to see
what's happening to the hose own layer

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610
what's happening to the hose own layer
 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.670
what's happening to the hose own layer
we had said what's what's going to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680
we had said what's what's going to
 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.030
we had said what's what's going to
happen to the chlorofluorocarbons and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
happen to the chlorofluorocarbons and
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.680
happen to the chlorofluorocarbons and
then when we found out what was

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690
then when we found out what was
 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.110
then when we found out what was
happening to them and followed a little

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120
happening to them and followed a little
 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.760
happening to them and followed a little
bit further we realized it would have a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770
bit further we realized it would have a
 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.040
bit further we realized it would have a
major effect on stratospheric ozone

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050
major effect on stratospheric ozone
 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.500
major effect on stratospheric ozone
layer and therefore was a very it was a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510
layer and therefore was a very it was a
 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.420
layer and therefore was a very it was a
major environment global environmental

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430
major environment global environmental
 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.720
major environment global environmental
problem so it that was the realization

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730
problem so it that was the realization
 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.720
problem so it that was the realization
that this had suddenly turned from being

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730
that this had suddenly turned from being
 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.149
that this had suddenly turned from being
an interesting scientific exercise into

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159
an interesting scientific exercise into
 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.739
an interesting scientific exercise into
a global problem but was very

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749
a global problem but was very
 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:15.420
a global problem but was very
eye-opening and worrying
