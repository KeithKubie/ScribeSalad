00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:05.865

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:09.515

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:19.995
We all know that Sir Ian McKellen can act, but what makes him a great actor?

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:20.495
And more specifically, what makes him great on film?

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:23.455

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:25.945

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:26.445

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:26.945
There are a lot of answers to this question:

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:29.805

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.375

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:32.875
His mastery of the material, a grasp of interpersonal relationships,

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.855

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:36.355
An ability to listen and be at ease in the awkward zone of a film set.

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:38.885

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:39.385
But acting, I think, is more than just putting yourself in the shoes of the character.

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:42.435

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:45.425

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:47.995

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:48.495
It's a craft, and part of that craft is understanding and gaining control of all the involuntary things we do.

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:51.335

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:53.795

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:54.295
Inflections of the voice, the gestures of the body, and the expressions of the face.

00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:57.275

00:00:57.275 --> 00:00:59.795

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:00.295
In the Lord of the Rings, Ian McKellen's eyes, in particular, carry a heavy load.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:03.235

00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:05.765

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:06.265
Gandalf is the moral center of the story. He's also the one who understands the significance of events in the broadest sweep.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.695

00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:09.195
This means that Gandalf has to broadcast a whole lot of story information to the audience.

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:11.720

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.220
Gandalf: The Ring has awoken. It's heard its master's call.

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:16.135

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:19.125

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:21.385

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:21.885
But there's always two levels to any piece of exposition: the information itself, and how the character feels about it

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:24.605

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:25.105

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:25.605
Or its importance to the main story.

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:28.505

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.395

00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:33.935

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:34.435
Getting across that second level is important, especially in fantasy where info is often obscure.

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:34.935
Now, you can write it into the dialogue itself,

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:37.465

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:40.155

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:42.555

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:43.080
Or, if you have Ian McKellen, you can just cut to an extreme close-up.

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:45.655

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:48.975

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.635

00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:52.135
It's McKellen's eyes that are communicating the gravity of the situation.

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.865

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:55.365
It's something beyond worry, beyond concern, beyond even fear.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.295

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:00.825

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:01.325
Gandalf widening his eyes, but glazing them over looks crazed, desperate,

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:03.665

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.165
Like the very possibility of Sauron obtaining the Ring threatens to paralyze him with hopelessness.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:07.115

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:09.335

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:09.835
McKellen dials in the look just right,

00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:12.515

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:13.015
And, in doing so, establishes the stakes for the entire trilogy.

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:13.515
What's even more impressive is how he builds to this wild look

00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:15.655

00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:18.095

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:18.595
All across the first part of the movie,

00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:21.645

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:23.725

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:24.225
Gradually trapping us inside Gandalf's mind

00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:24.725
Carrying the audience through the stages of unease

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.245

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:27.745
So that his agitation is ours too.

00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:30.295

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:30.795
Again and again, Peter Jackson turns to McKellen to guide us,

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:31.295
To bring us deeper into the story and the peril.

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:33.625

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:35.635

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:38.145

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:38.645
It's a great gift for a director to have an actor whose reaction shots say just as much

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:41.165

00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:41.665
As his dialogue, sometimes more.

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:44.375

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:44.875
In fact, reaction shots are often the thing that activates a line of important dialogue.

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:47.435

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:49.895

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:50.395
Sometimes, in film, we don't really hear something until we see someone hear it.

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:52.925

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:53.425
Take this moment at the Council of Elrond,

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:55.945

00:02:55.945 --> 00:02:56.445
When Frodo makes the momentous decision to carry the ring to Mordor.

00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:58.925

00:02:58.925 --> 00:02:59.425
I always tear up a little at this part,

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:00.445

00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:01.775

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:02.280
But not when Frodo says his line,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.980
Just after it.

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:10.275

00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:10.775
It's the simple act of Gandalf shutting his eyes

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:12.445

00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:14.995

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:15.495
That brings it home for me.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:15.995
The emotion is almost indescribable:

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.155

00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:18.655
A mix of love, fear, resignation, pride --

00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:21.185

00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:21.685
Really, putting it into words defeats the purpose.

00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:24.155

00:03:24.155 --> 00:03:26.095

00:03:26.095 --> 00:03:26.595
It's all the significance of that choice in the look.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:27.095
So much of Lord of the Rings is reaction.

00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:27.595
So much of it is eyes.

00:03:27.595 --> 00:03:29.625

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:32.155

00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:32.655
The scene where the Fellowship meets Galadriel, for example, is basically all eyes.

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:35.495

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:38.075

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:38.575
As I watch McKellen's performance,

00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:39.075
I'm fascinated by his choices.

00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:41.015

00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:41.515
When he returns as Gandalf the White in the Two Towers,

00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:42.015
He emerges with these eternally calm eyes,

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:44.005

00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:44.505
But then he widens them,

00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:47.185

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:47.685
And his face takes on this odd, trance-like quality,

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:50.425

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:50.925
Indicating, with a subtle change, that a move closer towards divinity

00:03:50.925 --> 00:03:53.725

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:56.185

00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:56.685
Is also a move further from humanity.

00:03:56.685 --> 00:03:59.195

00:03:59.195 --> 00:03:59.695
I wonder if another actor would have made a choice like that.

00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:02.285

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:04.125

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:04.625
There are about 40 muscles in the human face,

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:05.125
Because I don't think that it's the obvious one.

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:07.575

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:08.075
And they all work together to create a variety of expressions.

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:10.635

00:04:10.635 --> 00:04:11.135
In real life, we're not always aware of the faces we're making.

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:13.705

00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:14.205
But an actor has to be

00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:16.695

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:17.195
Because that's where the audience is looking a lot of the time to read the emotional arc of the story.

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:19.455

00:04:19.455 --> 00:04:19.955
To appreciate how hard this is,

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:22.525

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:23.845

00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:24.345
I invite you to try replicating some of Gandalf's faces in the mirror.

00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:27.305

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.895

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:30.395
See if you can key into that same conviction that McKellen does.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:30.895
See if you can key into that same conviction that McKellen does.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.835

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:33.335
See if you can make your eyes literally travel,

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:34.560

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.060
As Gandalf's do, when he describes the afterlife to Pippin.

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:38.225

00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:38.935
Gandalf: And then you see it:

00:04:38.935 --> 00:04:39.935

00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:40.965

00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:41.720
Pippin: What, Gandalf?

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:43.615

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.020
See what?

00:04:45.115 --> 00:04:46.635

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.440
Gandalf: White shores,

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:52.965
And beyond,

00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:54.575

00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:57.335

00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:00.415

00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:00.915
A far great country and a swift sunrise.

00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:01.415
Narrator: Looking back across the series,

00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:03.415

00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:03.915
I was amazed by the range of expression in McKellen's eyes.

00:05:03.915 --> 00:05:06.095

00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:06.595
It's not the only tool in his toolbox,

00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:09.505

00:05:09.505 --> 00:05:10.005
And it's not the only thing that makes these films work so well.

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:13.055

00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:15.345

00:05:15.345 --> 00:05:15.845
But that range expands and deepens the emotional universe of the story.

00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:18.805

00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:20.675

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:21.175
It's a layer of performance that eliminates the need for bad dialogue.

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:21.675
And, if nothing else,

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:23.365

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:23.880
It's the kind of acting that close-ups were made for.

00:05:34.315 --> 00:05:36.495

00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:36.995
This episode was brought to you by NordVPN.

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:37.495
Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching.

00:05:37.495 --> 00:05:39.955

00:05:39.955 --> 00:05:40.455
You know, it seems to me like

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:42.965

00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:43.465
We're in a constant struggle for our privacy and security online.

00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:46.135

00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:48.115

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:48.615
One thing that helps ease my mind in this battle is

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:51.685

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.085

00:05:54.085 --> 00:05:54.585
Using a VPN so that prying eyes can't see my private info and IP address

00:05:54.585 --> 00:05:57.035

00:05:57.035 --> 00:05:57.535
And NordVPN is my favorite one that I've tried.

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.415
