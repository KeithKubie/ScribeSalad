00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:03.574
(gentle uplifting music)

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:09.670
- They're growing perfect.

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:17.140
(computer chiming)

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.620
Math was always my difficulty in school

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.060
until I started using Khan Academy.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.540
I got better math scores
and state testing scores.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.783
They just help me be more
confident about myself.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.470
My dream is to work for
NASA, and go to space,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.470
and see how it looks, like
the stars, and explore space.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.690
Helps me achieve and makes
me feel more successful

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.710
and more confident that
I can succeed that goal.
