&gt;&gt;Ryan: Thanks for coming out everybody. It's
my great pleasure to introduce Mr. Andrew

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.440
Baggarly. He's a beat writer for the San Jose
Mercury News. He's been on the beat for about

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.940
14 years now. He's covered the Angels and
Dodgers before but we can forget about that

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.050
part. [laughter] He's been with the Giants
since 2004. He writes an awesome blog called

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.609
'extrabaggs' and you can follow him on Twitter
too. So without further ado, Mr. Baggs.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:31.220
[applause and cheers]
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Well thank you Ryan. I

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.620
appreciate that introduction. It's great to
be here, a real honor to be here amongst so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.969
many bright people. And before I go any further,
I want to introduce my partner, Aliya, who's

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.460
here today and please join me in congratulating
Stanford University's newest Sociology Professor.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.860
[applause] Okay so I'm seeing a lot of Giants'
regalia around the room. I know a lot of you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.890
are Giants' fans and I want to know how many
of you predicted the World Series, the 2010

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.329
championship. At least somebody in this room
is gonna claim that they predicted it. Anybody?

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.860
Show of hands. Anybody? [audience chatter]
Nobody. Well guess what? If you did predict,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.400
I wouldn't have given you credit for it because
you would have predicted a team that had Bengie

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.970
Molina behind the plate, an outfield of Mark
DeRosa, John Bowker, and Aaron Rowand. Todd

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.520
Wellemeyer is number five starter. And nobody
knew who Andrés Torres was at that point.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.060
That team didn't win the World Series as you
know. The team that did win had Pat Burrell

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.840
and Cody Ross. Buster Posey came up in mid-season.
Madison Bumgarner of course and that team

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.410
sort of picked along the parts as they rolled
along and won the World Series. And that was

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.030
a much different team than began the season.
And that's what made this book so much fun

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.440
to write was not only did they win a World
Series for the first time in 53 years and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.840
that was enough to brand them legends in San
Francisco but also the way they did it. Sort

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.480
of just accepting everyone as they were and
picking up parts as they rolled along and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.600
sort of just anybody who joined the team was
part of the family. And they became greater

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.500
than the sum of their parts which is what
every team hopes to be. And that's certainly

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.771
what they were.
So, as Ryan mentioned, I've been on the Giants'

00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:15.390
beat for – this is my eighth season. The
Giants are off today so as am I. And I've

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.320
been working for the San Jose Mercury News
since 2006. I worked for the Oakland Tribune

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.110
before that. And before that, I covered the
Angels for a few years and the Dodgers for

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.390
a few years before that.
And as you know, the newspaper business is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.080
an up and down business right now. The optimists
would say it's challenging. The pessimists

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.610
would say it's a death spiral.
[laughter]

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.750
I prefer to go with challenging. But it's
– there's no substitute for, for being there

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.460
and being around the team every day and that's
something that only happens because the folks

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.180
at the San Jose Mercury, my editors, have
gone to bat to make sure that when they do

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.069
make cuts in the budget, when they do lose
people, they still prioritize not only having

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.860
someone to staff the beat but all the expenses
of going on the road and being there for six

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.740
weeks of spring training in Scottsdale, Arizona,
and then all the road games during the season.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.550
It adds up to quite a bit of an expense. And
they make sure they keep the commitment to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.319
having me there on the beat. And that's what
allows you to write with any kind of context,

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.130
with any kind of perspective is just to be
there every day and to form relationships

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.800
with the players so that they can trust you
and be able to tell you their stories. And

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.390
then I'm able to pass them along to, to the
readers.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.480
So I owe quite a bit to them for making that
commitment and keeping with that commitment.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.210
I will say that I am very fortunate that the
Giants did not win the World Series in my

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.690
first year covering the beat because I don't
think I would have fully been able to appreciate

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.500
what it meant to people, what it meant to
the history of the Bay Area, baseball in the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.650
Bay Area. All the traditions of the franchise
because it would have been my first year on

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.250
the beat. But having covered the team for
six years before that, having covered them

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.790
through the Barry Bonds era and seeing all
the changes as they happened and really getting

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.280
to know so many fans and the season ticket
holders that sit right in front of me in the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.830
press box. And being able to engage them really
let me know just what it meant for the Giants

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.430
to win the World Series. Obviously, it meant
quite a bit.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.960
I will say that I think the way I've gone
about covering the beat and covering the team

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.610
comes from my personal experience growing
up as a Chicago Cubs fan. I see the Cubs hat

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.460
in the front row. God Bless You. Maybe one
day. [laughter] Maybe one day there will be

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.430
a Cubs band of misfits book. But my older
brothers were born and raised in Illinois

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.080
as was I. We moved to California when I was
very young so I don't really remember growing

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.459
up there. But it was branded into me to be
a Cubs fan. So that's the cross I had to bear

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:57.050
– being a Cubs fan growing up in Los Angeles.
But I always wanted to know about what was

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.840
going on with the team and really not only
the balls and the strikes and the X's and

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.699
O's but also just what the players were all
about and how they got along and what they

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.229
did – the pranks they pulled and all that
good stuff. And it really shows a lot about

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.220
their personalities and, and all the traditions
of the organization and welcoming back old

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.420
heroes. And all the context that goes with
the games. 'Cause there's a game every day.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.349
There's always something new on the field
but there's always something extra stuff that

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:29.599
I loved as a fan and I wanted to really bring
to my coverage and so I've been very fortunate.

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:35.050
I've grown to know this team and this franchise,
this organization, the Bay Area well enough

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.089
to be able to do that, hopefully. And I, I
skipped a lot of classes when I was an undergrad

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:45.460
at Northwestern University. I took the El
train and went to a lot of Cubs games, sat

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.650
in the bleachers. I'm gonna sound old but
the bleacher tickets were only 6 bucks back

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.139
then.
But it was optimism every year and every year

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.550
you hoped maybe this is the year they'll do
it. Maybe this is the group of guys even though

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.889
they're predicted to finish 20 games under
500. Everybody starts fresh every year and

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.240
you hope that maybe the magic'll happen. And
I gotta imagine the Giants fans felt the same

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.210
way even though last year's team wasn't really
expected to do much of anything. Maybe contend

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.620
for a Division but not have the kind of line
up that could win a World Series. They didn't

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.860
strike fear in anybody and certainly they
were able to do it and they were able to realize

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.710
those hopes and so not all optimism is false
optimism.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.420
So whether it's pathos or ethos – I never
remember which is which – but I kind of

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:41.199
got it what it was like to be a Giants fan
growing up as a Cubs fan. In – when you

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.169
look at the history of the Giants organization,
it was a history of sluggers, of offense,

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:51.899
of Willie Mays and Willie McCovey, and Orlando
Cepeda, and you had a great pitcher come along

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:56.729
every once in awhile like a Juan Marichal.
But a Barry Bonds was the greatest offensive

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.000
force really that the game has ever seen and
the Giants were not able to win a World Series

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.689
with any of them. So whatever group of players
would accomplish this would go down as legends.

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:13.919
And for it to be a team like this as opposed
to a slugging or a hulking team or a team

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.340
that was fueled by steroid controversy or
whatever made it even more pure. And I think

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:25.499
it made it even a better group to embrace.
So one thing that I'd like to talk about a

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:31.219
little bit is just team chemistry. And it's
something that really applies to any work

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:37.409
situation or any family situation. It's, it's
– how do you get productivity out of people?

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:42.570
How do you get the most out of people? And
does winning breed chemistry or does chemistry

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:47.210
breed winning? And I've heard that argument
so many times or people talk about it so many

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.110
times. Which is which or what needs to happen
first?

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.680
And I think, if anything, what this year's
team taught me is that when you start to hear

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.559
people say things like, 'I want to win for
the guy next to me more than I want to win

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:05.811
for myself', it's something that you can't
really, you can't really force. It has to

00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:10.909
happen organically. There were so many years
when Barry Bonds was with the Giants and they

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:16.910
would do little pranks or singing competitions
to try to engender some team chemistry.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.460
And they would work and people would laugh
and smile and at the end of the day, they

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:26.069
pretty much went back to who they are which
was 24 guys and one guy in the corner of the

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:27.069
room. So
[laughter]

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:32.650
But I mean that's pretty much the way it went.
You know it's not to say that the Giants couldn't

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.649
have won a World Series with Barry Bonds.
They got within six outs of winning a World

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:41.060
Series with Barry Bonds in 2002. Bad memories.
[laughter]

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:46.060
But I think it took something special. It
almost took these guys. They knew that no

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.250
one expected them to win and if they had a
tough loss, which they had a lot of tough

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.769
losses. They had a 15 inning game at Coors
Field – went extra innings that they lost.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:59.100
They had a game against Cincinnati where they
came back from 10 runs down, biggest comeback

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.500
in Giants' history and they ended up losing
that game 11 to 10. And they came back and

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.380
they would win the next day. So it was something
special in that group. They had some kind

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.980
of chemistry where they almost didn't care
what anybody thought about them. They were

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.610
just gonna go out and try to win for each
other every day and wipe the slate clean.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.290
And when you gotta win 11 games over three
post-season series, you're gonna have tough

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.860
losses mixed in there. And that's when the
Playoffs started. I thought maybe this team

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.660
might have something here. They might be able
to do it. And I think that one thing that

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:38.029
was neat about me with the book to do was
in my newspaper reporting. There's always

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:42.290
a new newspaper the next day no matter how
good or how bad your story was, there's always

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.360
blank pages to fill and they come at you every
single day. Never get a day off from having

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.709
a newspaper. It comes out every day.
So even if there is a huge earthquake, they'll

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:57.360
probably find a way to print a newspaper.
So no matter – there are some stories that

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.639
are really stories that I am proud of or more
proud than others. And they're here one day

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:06.560
and gone the next. And it was one nice way
for me to be able to take my reporting not

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:13.430
only from 2010 but from previous years as
well, whether it be Tim Lincecum and when

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:18.110
he first came to the league. And all the things
in his back-story going back to when he was

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:22.389
a kid and his dad teaching him his unique
mechanics. And seeing him through his Cy Young

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:26.680
seasons and how he had to – he wasn't ready
to be the kind of pitcher that he needed to

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.850
be to win a World Series.
In fact, if you recall, he had a terrible

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:36.910
August where he was 0 and five and really
was struggling. He was, he was having a crisis

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:42.550
of confidence and it took him being sort of
yelled at by the General Manager to realize

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.530
that just winning two Cy Young awards isn't
enough. He needs to be there to win for his

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.380
teammates. And if he only gets one run of
support, then he's gotta win one to nothing.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.399
And he walked out of that meeting and he said,
'I get it now. It's about more than myself.'

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:00.230
And then you saw what he did in September
and beyond. He turned into that guy who could

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:05.129
match up against a Roy Halliday or a Cliff
Lee where he didn't look anywhere capable

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:11.319
of being that pitcher just a month earlier.
And you go into his sort of personal growth

00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:15.990
and, and he did a lot of growing last year.
And now he looks better than ever after an

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:21.220
off season spent working out. He just threw
a shut out the other day and was throwing

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.579
96 miles an hour in the 9th inning. And we
would not have seen that a year ago. So the

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:31.449
stories are even continuing.
But you go on to Lincecum and there were other

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:37.319
stories from the past where maybe he wasn't
that kind of, that player, that kind of teammate.

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:41.800
One neat story that kind of disappeared the
day after I wrote it that I was able to put

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.460
in the book was from his rookie year. And
he had overslept. He's a little bit of a slacker.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.160
[laughter]
He overslept for a flight and, and he didn't

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.930
make the bus that left the ballpark. And to
miss a team flight is very rare. It never

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.760
happens. Even though these guys are ballplayers,
you think they slack off some times but you

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.200
never miss a team flight, especially if you're
a rookie which Lincecum was in 2007. So he

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:14.649
had to buy his own plane fare to Cincinnati
and he got in about three or four hours after

00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:19.470
the team. The team didn't play that day. They
were starting the series the next day. So

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:25.269
no real harm done. But the next day, Barry
Bonds, who was still a Giant at that time,

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:30.400
called a meeting. And he had everybody in
the clubhouse in the room and he yelled at

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.792
Timmy, chewed him out and took the itinerary
and stuck it up against his chest and said,

00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:39.560
'This thing isn't leaving your sight the rest
of the trip.' And so Lincecum, as you can

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.290
imagine, probably needed some new pants right
around then.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:46.290
[laughter]
But then the trip went on to St. Louis after

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:51.839
Cincinnati and they made Timmy carry all the
players' luggage up to the room.

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:54.689
[laughter]
And gave him one little brass cart for about

00:12:54.689 --> 00:13:00.560
a traveling party of 45 or 50 and he was delivering
bags until three in the morning. And he's

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.389
never missed a team flight since.
[laughter]

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:06.980
So that, that was just a story that was fun
to write. It told you a lot about him, a lot

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.629
about where he had to come from to where he
had to get to. And it was a story I was able

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:16.250
to include in the book. So there's a lot more
reporting in there than just 2010. There's

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:22.149
a lot of stuff that precedes it. And probably
the furthest back that I can go in my career

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:28.689
as a reporter that had, had stuff that's applicable
to this book was when I covered the Angels

00:13:28.689 --> 00:13:36.339
in 2000 to 2001. And Bengie Molina was a rookie
catcher the year I was a rookie beat writer.

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:43.750
And, and Bengie is a big-hearted guy. He's
got a pretty amazing story to tell. He basically

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:49.930
wasn't drafted. He went back to Puerto Rico
and he decided that he was going to quit baseball.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:55.749
No one gave him a chance. So he played in
a couple of semi-pro games. And then he took

00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:59.779
his spikes and he knotted the laces together
and he threw them up into the power lines.

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:05.829
And that was his symbolic act that, 'I'm done
with baseball. I'm throwing my, I'm throwing

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:10.319
my cleats to the trade-winds here.' And then
he was going to ask his dad if he had a lead

00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:15.249
on a job at the Westinghouse factory that
his dad worked at for 12 hours a day.

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:21.230
And it so happened that that very week, a
scout from the Angels had come to see Bengie's

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.040
brother. If you know the Molina family, there
are three catchers, all brothers. And they

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.100
all have World Series rings. So Bengie's the
oldest, José was the next, and the scout

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:37.500
– his name was Ray Poitevint – he came
to see José. And, and he happened to go across

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.399
the street and saw Bengie hit a ball to right
field in that last semi-pro game. And he thought,

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:46.560
'I like that swing'. And then he saw Bengie
run. And he thought, 'I don't like that, [laughter]

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.170
I don't like that trot.' [laughter]
You know Bengie is probably the slowest person

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.769
who's ever played major league baseball. So
he thought, 'You know what? If he could catch,

00:14:54.769 --> 00:15:00.089
maybe he could be a serviceable player.' So
he's working on Jose one day and he said,

00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:05.310
'Hey, your brother. Is your brother here?
' And Jose runs back to get Bengie and he

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.589
says, 'Quick. Grab everything. Grab, grab
your glove. Grab your shoes. '

00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:11.889
'My shoes? They're up in the power lines.
[laughter] What do I do?'

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:17.269
So he borrowed somebody else's shoes, I guess,
and he made a couple throws. He never caught

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:21.490
– if you believe it, [laughter] Bengie was
a shortstop and an outfielder in junior college.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:27.029
Yeah, probably wasn't too pretty either. [laughter]
But he signed for 500 dollars. And 500 is

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:29.870
what it took to get his big league career
started. And he said, 'I would have signed

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:37.209
for, for nothing.' So he went to the Angels
system and he was told, 'You can't, you can't

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:42.009
start games. You're basically here to catch
in the bullpen.' So he didn't have a lot of

00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:45.600
time to develop as a catcher. So he went to
winter ball where the same thing happened.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.540
They basically used him to catch bullpens.
But he knew if he was going to be a pro baseball

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.620
player, he had to learn how to catch. And
the only team he could play for was on the

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.500
other side of the island. And he was driving
in a -- well you can read about it in the

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.540
book but basically he had a car that was not
road safe that he was driving in to get to

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.000
the ball field every day. Tires screeched
every time he made a right turn. The tires

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.910
were too big for the car. Yeah, it's a miracle
that he was able to get back and forth without,

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.579
without crashing that car. But he was able
to catch every day and he got better and better.

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:23.019
And he eventually became a big league catcher.
And those are stories he told me 10 years

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:27.850
ago when I was covering the Angels and they
were able to have some new life in the book.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:32.970
And for me, it was very easy to start the
book where I did in Chapter One because you

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:39.740
know what happened with the Giants last year.
Bengie was traded in the very end of June

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:46.200
to clear the catching spot for Buster Posey
and Bengie found out about it when they were

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.819
on a flight that was descending into Denver
to start a road trip against the Rockies.

00:16:51.819 --> 00:16:55.620
And the reason he found out about it is, the
Texas Rangers were currently in bankruptcy

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.110
and Major League Baseball needed to clear
the finances on the deal. So some of the details

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:05.110
leaked out before the trade became official.
And players were walking up to him and saying,

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:11.000
'Hey. Good luck. Sorry to hear it.' And so
Bengie was really caught off guard by this

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.550
and he stood on the team bus that day and
basically said, 'You guys are a special group

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.130
of players and you're gonna do something awesome
this year. And you've got my phone number.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.130
Call me any time.'
And not only was he right, but he would end

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.350
up catching for the Texas Rangers playing
against them in the World Series. So that

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:34.560
to me was probably the most improbable, pretty
neat moment of the entire year. When you look

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.640
at all the way, all the ways believe in fate
or whatever. And so I thought, 'I gotta start

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.890
there.'
And from there, it was very easy to roll on

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.941
to Chapter Two and write about Buster Posey
and what happened with the Giants' farm system

00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:51.461
and how he was sort of wearing a halo for
everybody in rebuilding this farm system.

00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:55.500
And he was able to do things that no rookie
catcher really is supposed to do, keeping

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.130
his poise throughout all of the post season.
So from there, it was just, it was fun to

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.490
roll through the whole year but also do back-flashes
into some of these guys' background whether

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:12.170
it be Juan Uribe or, or Madison Bumgarner
or Pat Burrell or Aubrey Huff. I never thought

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.970
that one of my biggest journalistic scoops
would be writing about the Rally Thong first.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.621
[laughter]
But so be it.

00:18:17.621 --> 00:18:21.080
[laughter]
I'll tell you a quick story about that actually.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.860
The company that makes the Rally Thong. If
you didn't know, Aubrey Huff with thirty games

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:32.790
left to go in the season started wearing this
red man's thong underwear. Apparently he and

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.910
his wife were going through Macy's one day.
She said, 'Why don't you get that for me and

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.800
wear it one night?' And he said, 'Okay. I
don't know why you want that but sure.' So

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.470
he decided to show up at the ballpark as they
are still trailing the San Diego Padres and

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.950
he said, 'Thirty games left and this thing's
got twenty wins in it.' And wouldn't you know,

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.050
they won and clinched the division on the
last game of the regular season and they went

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.780
exactly 20 and 10. So the Rally Thong did
its job.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.890
But yeah, he would walk around pretty much
with the Rally Thong on and nothing else,

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.400
which, if you're in the clubhouse, you just
have to try to avert your eyes basically.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.150
[laughter]
Yeah, he's, he's, yeah. He's proud of his

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.130
body. So hey good for him.
[laughter]

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:18.150
But anyway so that was the story behind the
Rally Thong. And the company that makes the

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:23.760
thong found out about what Huff was doing
and generating a little publicity. So unsolicited,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.890
they sent like three giant dress size boxes
filled with thong underwear. And the day that

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.270
they arrived, I think it was during the Division
Series. It might have been during the NLCS.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:38.110
Huff was distributing them to everybody. He
was like Santa Claus. He even threw one at

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.350
Bruce Bochy. And Bochy said, 'I don't think
that's a good idea.'

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.160
[laughter]
So anyway, I'm talking to him about this and

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.560
we had our, our Mean Joe Greene moment, the
old Coke commercial where he throws the jersey

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.260
to the kid. He threw me a thong and he says,
'There you go. There's one for you too.' So

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.370
I have one in a drawer that will never, ever,
ever be worn.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.900
[laughter]
But it was just such a group of characters

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.200
and that's kind of what it took. It took them
being a little rambunctious and not really

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.440
caring what the outside perceptions were.
There are a lot of moments in the book that

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.050
were, I think, a little more poignant. There
are some funny moments. And one of the moments

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:25.220
that I think was one of the most moving last
year was Willie McCovey. And if anybody knows

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:30.360
Willie McCovey's story, I think that he sums
up what it means to be a Giant or a San Francisco

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.740
Giant story more than anybody, even better
than Willie Mays. 'Cause Willie Mays was almost

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:41.520
so great he was almost a little bit unapproachable.
And McCovey always had to play second fiddle

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:47.080
to Mays. He was from Mobile, Alabama. And
Hank Aaron was from Mobile, Alabama, so he's

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.870
not the most famous person from where he's
from. But he was the guy who got the respect

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:56.090
of pitchers more than anybody else. Until
Barry Bonds came along, he held records for

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.080
intentional walks and no one ever wanted to
pitch him or face him because he was such

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.051
a fearsome hitter.
And in 1962, just a handful of years after

00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:10.750
the Giants moved from New York in 1958, they
were meeting the Yankees in the World Series.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:17.861
And they had a team full of Hall of Famers.
And they were in Game Seven and Willie Mays

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:24.800
had doubled to put the winning runs on base
in a one to nothing game. And here came McCovey.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.490
And Bill Terry threw the pitch and McCovey
hit it hard. He hit a line drive that was

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:35.970
right at the second baseman, Bobby Richardson.
And that was it. If it was three feet higher,

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.330
then the Giants would have won the World Series.
As it turned out, the Yankees won the World

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.620
Series. I mean, one at bat was win or loss
right there. And it was one of the greatest

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.160
endings in World Series' history but it's
not the one you really hear about because

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.420
it would have been a great ending if he had
gotten the hit. To have the guy catch the

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.900
ball almost was – that's not the Bill Mazeroski
or Joe Carter. People remember walk off hits.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.540
They don't remember walk off catches so much.
But they were so close. The Giants were so

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:08.260
close with McCovey. And then in later years
he had a lot of health problems. He still

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.530
battles with a lot of knee and back problems
and last July, I kind of noticed he wasn't

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.090
at the ball park, McCovey. He'd always shown
up and was always in his suite and I hadn't

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.550
seen him for several weeks and I asked around.
I asked Mike Murphy, the long time trainer,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:27.090
and it turned out that he had a back surgery
that was so extensive, it lasted eight hours

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:34.480
and I think that they fused about six or eight
vertebrae. I mean it was very extensive. And

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.180
he made his goal, McCovey, to get through
his rehab and to come back to the ballpark

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.960
for that final home series where they were
going to give out the Willie Mack Award. And

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.880
that's the award they give, the most inspirational
Giant as voted by the players. Bengie Molina

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:55.420
won it twice during his time. And that was
his goal during his rehab every day – was

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.770
to get back and present that award. And so
here's a guy who had inspired the players

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:05.960
for years and now the players were inspiring
him. And he made it back and he did make it

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.120
on the field. And for anybody who watched
him walk out there on his crutches and knew

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.600
what he had to do to be there, it was a very
moving moment. And he gave the award to André

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.330
Torres who was a very fitting recipient given
all he had overcome in his minor league career.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:27.660
And to see the Giants get the rings this year,
to see McCovey get his ring finally was, was

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.850
pretty cool. That was pretty neat. So I stopped
being a journalist there for a moment and

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:36.730
just really appreciated what I was seeing.
But that's why I wanted to title that chapter

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:43.520
where they're closing in on the Division 'The
Home Stretch' because Willie McCovey's – his

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.210
nickname was 'Stretch' because he was so tall
and stretched at first base to catch throws.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:54.981
And so it was 'The Home Stretch' – two words.
'Home'. 'Stretch'. And so that's why I decided

00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:59.060
to title that chapter the way I did and --.
So there was a lot more than what happened

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:04.360
on the field. There was what happened around
the team as well. And I think that anybody

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.370
who was at the parade and raise your hand
if you were at the parade. Anybody? I know

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:12.160
some of you were. There was a million people
out there. A lot of you. It's something that

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.830
no one will ever forget who was there. And
that's one thing that was really neat and

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:22.460
told me I gotta write a book to try to put
all this in some sort of form that's a little

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:28.280
more permanent than my newspaper work. And,
and I knew that it would be something that

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.960
would, would be appreciated and would resonate
with people. And I've had people tell me,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.380
'I'm gonna read this book every spring training
for the rest of my time as a Giants fan and

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.580
remind myself everything that happened that
year.'

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:47.560
And I've had a lot of other people tell me
that they were riding Caltrain and reading

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.680
it on the way to work and they had to stop
because they were crying and people were looking

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.800
at them funny.
[laughter]

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:58.120
To hear that was, was just really, really
gratifying and really neat. And so it's, in

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:05.840
some ways what I do is to inform and to entertain.
And we live in such an awesome information

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.930
age and there are so many more ways that you
can connect with people and get information

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:15.330
out there and you guys are such a big part
of that. I know I use Google every day as

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.380
a reporter to help, help me research and,
and even if it's something I don't know the

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.050
definition of a word or I know there's a phrase
or I want to make a historical reference or

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.770
something. It's just so easy to call it up
and, and you save my back too. Because I used

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:34.220
to carry around a whole big wheelie bag full
of reference materials. And I can leave everything

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:40.500
at home now. I have everything on my laptop.
So it's, it's what you do every day is inspire

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:48.980
people by making it so easy to access information
and, and, and learn about the players and,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:54.500
and the team. And so, so that was just a lot
of fun to be able to do this project and I

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.350
really hope you enjoy reading it. And thanks
for allowing me to be here today. And I'll

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.010
be happy to take any questions you may have.
[applause]

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:14.820
&gt;&gt;Ryan: There's a standing mic right here
if anyone wants to ask any questions.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:23.670
[pause]
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Hi. I really enjoy

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:29.310
your, your work. I read it every day. If I
miss it, I have to go back through the archives

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:35.000
and read it. Otherwise I feel like I am out
of touch. But what, what was your most maybe

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.620
intimidating moment from last year from your
own personal perspective because you have

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.640
to be -- in August, it was a tough time and
the team was going through some, some tough

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.530
moments. And it'd be interesting to hear some
of the stories from your, from your personal

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:53.070
perspective about what you felt like, 'Oh
my God. This is not going well.' And 'Holy

00:26:53.070 --> 00:27:00.520
crap, I can't believe I have to drag my, my
butt in here to, to ask a question or report

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.140
on something like this '.
&gt;&gt; Andrew Baggarly: You know when you're a

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:08.350
reporter and you're dealing with day to day
deadlines, that's the most intimidating thing.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.120
You don’t really worry if the team is doing
well or not doing well because you're writing

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:19.430
a story regardless. And people ask me, 'Were
you rooting for the team to win?' And basically

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:26.200
I was rooting for no extra innings, no rain
delays [laughter], no late lead changes because

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.980
that makes me use my delete key a whole lot
more than I like to on deadline. And we're

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.750
pretty lucky to have Brian Wilson who's a
pretty good closer. He didn't blow too many

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:40.210
saves. When I covered Armando Benitez, [laughter]
I hit the delete key a lot more so -- But

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.480
that was the baseball gods getting me back
for covering Eric Gagne with the Dodgers the

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.290
year he didn't blow a save the whole year.
So you know in terms of my motivations or

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:52.810
what was intimidating, it was pretty much
– I mean it boils down to practicalities

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:57.600
for me on a daily basis 'cause you gotta get
your copy in. You gotta get it in by a certain

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.710
time. For night games, I basically have to
send the second the game ends or within two

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:07.390
minutes basically. And there are a lot of
times I have to – we don't send in progress

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.620
stories so I gotta be ready to send it, go
downstairs, get some quotes, get some new

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.760
information, rewrite as much as I can, and
then send it again within another 20 minutes.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.450
So this last road trip actually was very difficult
because the Giants won or lost in the ninth

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:28.960
inning about four times. And all these walk
off wins at home are very exciting but they're,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:34.400
they're pretty stressful on the old beat reporters.
So obviously the Giants aren't scoring runs

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.580
in bunches so much. So when they're winning,
they're winning close. And that means that's

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.780
probably the most intimidating thing having
to rewrite really fast.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.490
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: I've got a hypothetical
for you.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.830
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Dusty Baker managing

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.500
instead of Bruce Bochy. Would they still win
the World Series?

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:57.060
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Wow. It's a great question.
I, I don't know. It's hard to say. One thing

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.961
that I think was, was neat about last season
is – those of us who are around Bruce Bochy

00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:08.490
every day realize that there's a lot more
going on upstairs than comes across in a sound

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:12.860
bite. He, he kind of looks like a big old
galoot when you see him on TV [audience chatter]

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.250
but there was a time last year, I don't know
if you remember. We were in Dodger Stadium

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:23.420
and Don Mattingly was the interim manager.
Joe Torre and the bench coach, Bob Schaefer,

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:28.500
I believe is his name, had gotten ejected
and so Mattingly's the hitting coach. And

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.020
he's managing the team. He goes up to make
a pitching change and he doubles back to the

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:38.780
mound to answer a question. And that constituted
two mound visits which means the pitcher has

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.240
gotta come out of the game. And Bruce Bochy
was out of that dugout in a half of second,

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.210
arthritic knees and all. And he said, 'Hey,
this is the rule.' And he quoted the rule

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.760
and he was right. And the Dodgers lost that
game. They brought in another pitcher who

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.020
wasn't ready and, and I think it was Andrés
Torres who got the hit and they won. And they

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.830
obviously had to win every single game to
win the Division last year. And that's I think

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.230
when people started realizing in the Bay Area
that Bruce Bochy's got a little bit more going

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:11.900
on upstairs than if you listen to his admittedly
very, very dull pre-game interviews sometimes.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:17.010
[laughter]
So but and then in the Playoffs, obviously,

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:21.530
he could do no wrong. He managed very differently.
I think he manages a certain way in the regular

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.770
season because he knows it's a marathon. And
sure Édgar Rentería might be terrible. And

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:31.490
Aaron Rowand might be terrible. But he knew
that it takes all 25 guys to put in a piece

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:36.290
at some point to win a game. And sure enough,
who would have ever thought Édgar Rentería

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:43.420
would be the World Series MVP when he looked
doner than done earlier in the year. And Aaron

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.690
Rowand had a couple of big plays for them
too. You just don't give up on guys so you

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:51.940
manage very deliberately and very patiently
and with a lot more patience than a lot of

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:58.321
fans have. But when he got in the Playoffs,
he was very, very – he was managing a lot

00:30:58.321 --> 00:31:04.370
more with a lot more urgency. And that meant
making moves and if a guy was struggling,

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:11.810
then you took him out and they used three-quarters
of their playoff rotation in Game Six in Philadelphia

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:17.320
which wasn't even an elimination game. Which
took some real stones to do. And obviously

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.520
they won in Philadelphia. He drew a line in
the sand and really managed with a lot of

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:29.060
guts. And so I don't think any other manager
wins the World Series. It's hard to say because

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.200
it is hypothetical but I think the Giants
had the right guy there, Bruce Bochy.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.200
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: You mentioned team
chemistry and how important it was for this

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.820
team in particular to win. And that compared
with Barry Bonds era, having someone like

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:50.810
that in the clubhouse. Being someone who's
in the clubhouse, how do you see that changing

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:57.450
or, or staying the same from last year to
this year? Obviously losing a Rentería who

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:03.340
was really inspiring I heard towards the end
of the stretch run. And how is Tejada doing?

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:10.010
And what's the climate around that? I know
there's talk about Reyes being available for

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:15.970
trades and I don't know what you know of José
Reyes as a person or what that clubhouse is

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:21.240
like. But what would that do to the intangibles
and the chemistry on a team like this?

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.580
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Well, it's an interesting
question because Bochy has never a managed

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.921
a team that's won the World Series and most
of these guys haven't played on teams that

00:32:28.921 --> 00:32:32.790
have won the World Series. And even the few
that have, like Pat Burrell, he ended up with

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.900
Tampa the year after he won with Philadelphia.
Rowand ended up with Philadelphia the year

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.860
after he won it with the White Sox. So a lot
of these guys are in new circumstance and

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:46.620
it's, it's good from the standpoint that they
don't panic. If things aren't going right,

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.340
they realize, 'Hey. We've done it before.
We know what it takes within this room to

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:57.140
win.' But you also have to guard against complacency
which so far, you look at the way Tim Lincecum

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.840
has pitched and he hasn't pitched complacent
at all. You look at Aubrey Huff – maybe

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.720
putting on a few pounds and you wonder, 'Has
he allowed himself to get a little complacent?'

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.130
And he obviously is off to a bad start. So
there's some guys because their personality

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:14.200
might affect in different ways and that's
probably Bochy's biggest challenge is to guard

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.810
against that complacency and stop them from
thinking, 'Well, it worked out for us last

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.230
year. So we'll just skip the work and it'll
work out for us again.' Because obviously

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:29.091
that isn't the way it works.
In terms of trading for José Reyes, it's

00:33:29.091 --> 00:33:33.500
not realistic because if you trade for someone
at this point in the year, you have to massively

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.790
overpay for them. I think the Mets know that
a number of teams are gonna want a José Reyes.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:41.150
They're probably going to give up a number
of minor league players. Right now, if the

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.320
Giants want to get a José Reyes, it's gonna
cost them Zach Wheeler and Brandon Belt which

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.870
is their top pitcher and hitting prospect.
And that's – no way that's gonna happen.

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:53.480
And if you look at Brian Sabean's resume as
a General Manager, he'll give up prospects.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.800
He will give up players who were regarded
in this minor league system but he'll give

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.170
them up for players that he can plug in for
a few years. And when they trade for AJ Pierzynski,

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:06.250
they thought AJ'd be one of those guys. He
wasn't eligible for free agency for several

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:11.510
years. He was arbitration eligible. Well obviously,
he was a gigantic failure in his one year

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:15.730
as a Giant and they got rid of him.
But José Reyes would be a Giant basically

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.730
until the end of the year and he knows he
would make a hundred million dollars on the

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:23.050
open market. There's no way you're gonna sign
him to a contract before he would hit free

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:28.100
agency. And so for the Giants to get him,
if they do, it's gonna be right at the trade

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.640
deadline which is July 31st, and it's going
to have to mean that they don't have a whole

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.520
lot of competition for him because I don't
see them giving up a lot of their premium

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.790
prospects. And Bill Neukom is the new owner.
And he's made building from within the farm

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.690
system such a huge priority. So I don't see
that happening. They're gonna have to probably

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.120
muddle through and maybe get a lesser shortstop
if there's – there's no question that they

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.639
have a problem at shortstop and that Tejada
is best suited at third base.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.440
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Hi.
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Hi.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.840
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: I was just kinda
curious – do you have a sense for, for how

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:03.100
much the front office is using some of these
advance stats – like Sabermetrics, the UZR,

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.170
Devor, to kind of analyze and manage their
players?

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:10.430
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Yeah. I think they are.
They're doing it probably a lot, probably

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:17.230
a lot less than other organizations. But they
do. It is part of the calculus. I think that

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:21.370
Brian Sabean trusts his scouts more than anybody.
And when he's making a decision at the end

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:25.640
of the day, he'll take it into account but
I don't think he allows himself to be swayed

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:30.030
if he has a strong opinion already. There
are a couple of people in the front office

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:34.830
who, who do a lot of analytics. In fact they
do a lot of their own analytics and they won't

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:41.580
even talk about their methods. So Jeremy Shelley
is one. Yeshayah Goldfarb is another.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:47.840
So they, they do delve into that and it's
a part of, of player evaluation. And Bill

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:54.150
Neukom being someone who was from, on the
ground floor of Microsoft and understands

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:59.450
the value of information, is somebody who
is going to continue to champion that and

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:05.610
make sure that is a part of player evaluation
and baseball operations. But knowing Brian

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:10.760
Sabean the way I do, I think that he's open
minded to it. But if he has a strong opinion,

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.750
he's going to go with the scouts most times
and his scouts obviously served him very well

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:21.470
last year both in the players that they got
and the reports that they had on how best

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:25.410
to attack some of the hitters that they faced
in the post-season.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:29.040
But I've tried to ask them and they're very
secretive about, about their methods. They

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.790
don't want to say exactly what they really
place a high priority on. But they did tell

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:39.610
me that there are some formulas that they've
created that are even non-proprietary. Things

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:42.050
that are just in-house that they, that they
do use.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:47.320
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Hi. I love your
blog. I wanted to ask you how as a reporter

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.850
you deal with guys who have sort of fallen
out of favor with the club. Guys like Fred

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:55.160
Lewis and Travis Ishikawa, and Kevin Franzen.
Could you just tell us a little bit about

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.330
your experience with guys like that?
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Yeah. I mean it's -- these

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:04.290
guys are professionals. I would have a very
hard time covering college sports to be honest.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:08.900
And there's nothing wrong with covering college
sports on the beat. Obviously, I love to know

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:15.860
about my alma mater and -- but it's very difficult
to cover college sports I think because you

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.430
have to write critically about, about players
and when they're making millions of dollars,

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.070
it's a little bit easier to write critically
about them because they realize it's part

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:29.250
of the bargain. They get to live the lifestyle
and they get the benefits for their family

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:33.470
and if it means that when they go 0 for 4
and strike out with the bases loaded and I

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:39.610
ask them about it, it's not fun to be quizzed
on failing in front of 40,000 people but that's

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:44.260
part of the bargain that you sign when you
are a major league player. So it's a little

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.030
bit easier because you get cooperation from
the players. The ones that are professionals,

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:53.561
the ones that understand my job – as long
as you're fair and you don’t take a lot

00:37:53.561 --> 00:37:59.190
of unnecessary cheap shots and you're accurate,
then, then you really have nothing to worry

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:05.110
about. But there are, there are days when
we get yelled at and sometimes realize that

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:09.310
has to happen because if it doesn't happen,
I'm probably not doing my job the right way.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:14.060
When it comes to players who have fallen out
of favor with the organization, you just try

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:20.060
to put things in context. And if it's a player
who is on the outs and you kind of realize

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.530
it, well, then you're writing who's going
to get playing time and who's not. And in

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:28.570
the case of Fred Lewis or a Kevin Franzen,
obviously they weren't in the organization's

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:33.800
plans and you just try to put that in context.
You give people the right expectations for

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.310
who's gonna be out there on a given day. And
not only do fans want that, but people with

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:42.810
fantasy teams too. [audience chuckles] They
want to know who to draft so that all goes

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:47.350
into it. But whenever you're dealing with
a player who's struggling oftentimes it'll

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.180
be someone who's a nice guy. Aaron Rowand
is a very, very nice guy. And he's had his

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:56.890
struggles as a Giant and you have to write
about that. And this is part of the job and

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.000
that's when you just hope that you're as professional
as you can be and the players as professional

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.450
as they can be too.
So…

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:10.550
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Is Timmy really
5'11 and what's that funky stretch that Brian

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:14.960
Wilson does before every pitch?
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Let's see. Timmy's 5'11

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.790
in spikes.
[laughter]

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.810
I would, I would say he is a true 5'11". He
is about my height, pretty much. If anything,

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:28.150
he might just be a tiny bit taller than me.
So he's not, he's not a little midget. Now

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:34.900
Mike Fontenot is very small. [laughter] He's
about 5'6", I think and I only covered one

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.970
major league player smaller than him and that
was Chad Fonville with the Dodgers back about

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:44.960
12 years ago. He might have been 5'3". He
was really small. But – and what was the

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.300
second part of your question?
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: About the stretch

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.610
that Brian Wilson does.
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Right. Right. You know

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:55.190
I think he's, he has a tight back sometimes
so he's probably just stretching his back

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:59.200
muscles a little bit. And obviously he has
been a little out of sorts his last couple

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.080
of appearances. And he's refusing to tell
them that he's hurt. So they're just kind

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.250
of, they're wondering right now if maybe his
oblique or his back is a little tight in addition

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:13.040
to his ankle that he turned the other day.
He's becoming Mr. Mysterio more and more every

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.820
day. [audience laughter] It's hard to get
a straight answer out of Brian Wilson. I asked

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.490
him in spring training if he was happy with
where his pitches was going, were going, and

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.730
he looked at me and he said, 'Well. Forward.
So yes.' [audience laughter] Thank you, Brian.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:24.730
Thank you very much. Appreciate that.
[laughter]

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:25.730
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7 : To go back to
the Brian Wilson question, what's that new

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:30.040
pitch that he has? I know he doesn't have
a name for it but what would someone who knows

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:37.360
baseball call it?
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Well, he refuses to label

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:43.390
his pitches. Even the pitch that he, he threw
to strike out Ryan Howard to win the NLCS.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:47.550
Was it a slider or was it a cutter? And he
referred to it as both. And I kind of – I

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:51.170
don't think he wants anybody to know what
he's doing but the pitch that he's throwing

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:56.290
that's really sort of diving in on the hands
of a lefty – that's sort of a two seam fastball.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:01.130
I think – and it's just got a lot of run
to it. And that's pretty much what it is.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:07.240
And you realize that Dave Righetti, the Giants
pitching coach, probably is doing a lot more

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.330
behind the scenes than people realize. 'Cause
there are a lot of people who are throwing

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:15.990
that pitch not only in the Major Leagues but
in the minor league organization too. And

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:20.240
it's, it's one of the reasons the Giants give
up so few home runs. Not only because they

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.350
have a big home run, a big home ball park
but because a lot of guys are keeping the

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:27.730
ball down and that's a big pitch for a lot
of guys on the staff.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:32.020
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Can you demonstrate
the difference between a cutter and a slider

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.560
and a four seam fastball and a two seam fastball
and a slerve and all those other things?

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.330
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: You gotta ball?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: [laughs]

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.340
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: It would be a little hard
without a ball. But basically a four seam

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:47.400
fastball is a straight fastball. It's what
you throw with maximum velocity. It's one

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.010
of the first pitch you learn to throw and
you try to learn to control it and work both

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:56.620
sides of the plate. And you throw it across
the horseshoe so basically your finger's in

00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:02.670
contact with four seams which is why it's
called a 'four seamer'. A two seamer, you

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:08.340
throw it with your fingers on the seams. Like
almost like a fork ball – you throw them

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.720
outside the seams. They're right on the seams
for a two seamer. And because of the way the

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:17.800
pressure, the finger pressure, it'll sink.
As it gets drag, it'll sink in the strike

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:22.420
zone. So basically a two-seam fastball is
a sinker. And then a slider -- you have your

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:27.119
two fingers together. You have them on one
seam and you're basically pushing it off and

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:31.850
extending and that allows it to sort of sweep.
And then a curve ball you're throwing like

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.890
that and that gets more twelve to six, they
say, break.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:39.140
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: What about a cutter?
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: And a cutter is basically

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.600
a, a – I think it's just a four seam fast
ball but you have different pressure with

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.369
the lower fingers or your thumb. I think,
basically, it just has to do with finger pressure

00:42:48.369 --> 00:42:53.280
more than anything else. And a cutter will
kind of have a little snap back. So it won't

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.610
move completely straight like a four seamer
will. But there are times you want to throw

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.230
it completely straight. I mean if Tim Lincecum
has two strikes on a guy and he really wants

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:07.080
to blow him away and he wants to throw a four
seamer up here, that's a hard pitch to hit.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.710
And it's, it's a pitch designed to get a swing
and a miss because you are not going to get

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.140
it called for a strike. [audience member coughs]
So that all goes into what do you throw and

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.500
Buster Posey is a rookie catcher. And to make
all those decisions last year in big games

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:26.400
and he knew the scouting reports inside and
out. The guy was honor roll, Presidential

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.140
Honor Roll his whole time at Florida State.
He knew he was about to be drafted and get

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:36.200
a 6 million dollar bonus and he kept taking
his, writing his papers and taking his finance

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:42.680
degree anyway. And he was once asked by a
reporter from USA Today, he said, 'Other than

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.150
school and baseball, what do you do?' And
he said, 'Well what else is there?' [audience

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:50.570
laughter] So for him, he doesn't have the
school anymore so he's just, he's a student

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.300
of the game and that's really, knowing those
scouting reports and knowing the pitchers'

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:59.430
strengths and what to call was such a big
part of what they were able to do last year.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:04.970
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: I have one question.
Do you have any insight to whether or not

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.970
the Giants are ever going to drop the whole
territorial rights, stranglehold on San Jose?

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:19.930
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Well, let's see. Bill Neukom
was the chief legal – he headed up the Legal

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:25.150
Department at Microsoft for a long time. About
20 years. He took on the Federal Government

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:31.120
and anti-trust legislation. I don't think
he's afraid of anybody and he's gonna continue

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:36.671
to defend the territorial rights as far as
he can go. The reason it's so important to

00:44:36.671 --> 00:44:41.890
the Giants is because, if you look at their
stadium signage, if you look at their season

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:48.410
ticket base, if you look at all of their minority
owners, there's –Silicon Valley is incredibly

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:54.940
well represented and they realize the financial
and corporate strength here in Silicon Valley.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:59.960
It almost doesn't matter what your market
size is anymore. It matters what you can draw

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.640
from what your corporate base is like. And
that's why you've got a team like the Arizona

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:10.020
Diamondbacks in Phoenix being a huge metro
area. But the average income in Phoenix is

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.231
the lowest of any major league city and that's
why their ticket prices are so low and they

00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:17.430
still can't get anybody to come to the ballpark.
So I think the Giants realize that the South

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:24.890
Bay is a big part of their revenue stream,
a big part of their, their base of season

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:28.790
ticket holders and sponsors. And they don't
wanna let go of that. They don't want the

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:33.510
A's to move there. And if the A's – basically
it's a siege mentality. They're trying to

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.890
starve them out. And if the A's don't wanna
build in, in Oakland, I would love to see

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:41.430
them build a park in Jacklin Square. It would
be great. I lived in Oakland for a few years

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:45.810
and I happen to like Oakland and I'd like
to see the A's stay there. But if that can't

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.420
happen, the Giants are going to do everything
they can to try to keep the A's out of San

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:56.270
Jose. And this blue ribbon committee, I have
the very fun job of trying to talk to Bud

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.890
Selig every All Star Game when he does his
luncheon with the baseball writers and ask

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:04.360
him about the A's and the San Jose question.
And I get to see him do his soft shoe tap

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.620
dance, every single time. [laughter] And,
and he basically says, 'Well the committee's

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:15.190
still meeting. So.' [laughter] The committee
has been meeting for a long, long time. So

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:20.190
basically though if Bud says that it's something
that they are going to let the A's pursue,

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:24.150
it takes a three-quarters vote of the owners
to overturn the territorial rights. Plus it

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:29.700
means so much money for the owners. So I really
do believe that if he says, 'This is the position

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:35.390
that I'm advocating', the owners will follow
suit. So basically they just need to convince

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:41.381
Bud Selig that that it would be bad for both
teams in the Bay Area to have the A's in the

00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:45.780
South Bay. And the jury's still out.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Thank you.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:52.740
&gt;&gt;Ryan: We'll take one more and then you're
gonna do some book signing, right?

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.210
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Yeah.
[pause]

00:46:55.210 --> 00:47:02.070
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: My question is,
what would you say thus far is the sort of

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:08.980
differences if any in the clubhouse camaraderie
slash expectations. This season, 45 wins and

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:15.040
there have been 11 walk off wins. How does
the mentality compared to last year when there

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.790
were no expectations? This year we're defending
the World Series?

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:21.380
&gt;&gt;Andrew Baggarly: Yeah. Yeah. It's a good
question and right now, they're 14 and 3 in

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:27.040
one run games and 11 and 0 at home. And on
pace to break the Major League record for

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.970
walk off wins. Again, not so great for the
journalists on deadline but [laughter] I mean

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:38.900
just tremendously exciting games. And I think,
if anything, we were talking about that complacency

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:43.240
earlier and how do you ward it off and the
fact that they get a sellout crowd there on

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:49.530
a midweek, Tuesday game in May against the
Diamondbacks, who's not a premium opponent,

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:53.920
when it's a school night. And they're selling
the place out. And the people are going nuts.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.580
I, I kind of think it's going to carry these
guys along and it's going to be a big factor.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:02.260
I don't see a whole lot of differences from
last year. It's such a similar team. They're

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:07.850
obviously winning in a similar style even
with fewer runs than they scored last year.

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:14.780
So I think they realize that to a degree it's
a little unsustainable to go 14 and 3 in one

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:20.390
run games and the bullpen can't pitch as well
as it's pitched all year. The starters are

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:23.900
gonna have days where their arms are dragging.
And they're gonna have to score more runs

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.600
and I think that they realize this. Whether
it means that they just, they'll bring up

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.640
Brendan Belt at some point to help the offense
or they'll make another trade or adjustment.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.210
You have to constantly be looking for ways
to get better. And that's certainly what they

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:41.480
did last year in overhauling the roster during
the year. So they do realize that they've

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.590
gotta go out there and produce and if they
don't, then somebody else is probably going

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:51.790
to get their at-bats. So they're still finding
their identity as an offensive team but certainly

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.730
they're pitching as well as they ever have.
And I think we just all saw that pitching

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.980
wins championships. So you have to like their
position right now because they're in first

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:05.421
place by what -- three and a half, four games
and you know that there's a lot they're not

00:49:05.421 --> 00:49:11.750
doing right. So who knows? Maybe we'll have
a sequel. [audience chuckles]

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:16.590
So thank you everyone for coming out. I really
appreciate it.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:17.140
[applause]
