00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.928
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.384
Good evening, everyone.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:19.800
My name is John
Paul Jones and I'm

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.480
the Dean of the College of
Social and Behavioral Sciences.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.700
Thank you.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.330
On behalf of the
College's faculty,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.380
staff, and students I
want to welcome all of you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.590
here tonight for the first
annual SPS Annual Lecture

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.220
and, without a doubt, this is
going to be a very hard act

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.290
to follow.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.030
Before we get started, I
have a few people to thank.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.860
The first is Al Bergesen, head
of the Department of Sociology,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.870
who recommended
this series as a way

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.180
to showcase the best of the
social and behavioral sciences

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.150
to our local community.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.490
Second, I'd like to
thank two faculty

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.940
who have been long associated
with Professor Chomsky

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.930
and who helped make
his appearance here

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.150
tonight possible, Massimo
Piattelli-Palmarini and Thomas

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.520
Bever.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.290
Both teach in our world-class
Department of Linguistics.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.690
And, in fact, there are so
many faculty with research ties

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.990
to Chomsky in the
Department of Linguistics

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.700
that this department
is sometimes

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.941
referred to as MIT West.

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:47.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.550
I'd also like to thank
the head of the Department

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:57.295
of Linguistics, Simin Karimi,
as well as the many faculty,

00:01:57.295 --> 00:01:58.920
staff, and students
from the department

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.260
who have been working
so hard on this event.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.580
On the screen behind me is
a list of some of the donors

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.160
who have helped sponsor
tonight's lecture.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.800
I would especially like to thank
our co-sponsor, Confluencenter

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.894
for Creative Inquiry and
its director, Javier Duran.

00:02:16.894 --> 00:02:20.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.210
Financial support has also
come from members of the SPS

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.190
Magellan Circle and
tonight's event is especially

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.220
underwritten by Magellan Circle
member, Elise Collins Shields

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.820
and her husband,
Creston Shields.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.632
Thank you very much.

00:02:38.632 --> 00:02:42.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.900
I'd also like to thank the
support of the Arizona Daily

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.750
Star, the College of Education
and its dean, Ron Marks,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.310
and the College of
Humanities and its dean, Mary

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.310
Wildner-Bassett.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.320
Thank you.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.580
Others contributing
to this event

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.280
include the School
of Anthropology,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.610
the Cognitive Science
Program, the Department

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.210
of Communication, the
Department of Computer Science,

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.397
the School of Geography
and Development,

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.730
the Department of Gender and
Women's Studies, the School

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.900
of Government and Public Policy,
the Department of History,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.440
the School of Journalism,

Studies, the School of Middle
Eastern and North African

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.080
Studies, the Department
of Psychology,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.570
the Department of Sociology,
and the UA bookstores.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.400
And thanks to everyone
in the dean's office

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.330
and in SPS development and
the Centennial Hall Group

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.480
who have put all
of this together.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.060
Thank you all very much.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.170
Well, now, what can I say
about tonight's speaker?

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.890
Who, after all, has been as
intellectually influential

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.110
as Noam Chomsky?

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.530
The author of 100 books
and countless articles,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.160
he is the founder of
modern linguistics.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.010
His ideas have not only
revolutionized linguistics,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.490
they have indelibly
shaped anthropology,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.240
cognitive science, childhood
education, computer science,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.970
the languages, mathematics,
psychology, philosophy,

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.649
and speech.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.540
In fact, you can find
self-described Chomskyites

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.050
in every field that
asks the question, what

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.720
does it mean to be human?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.850
If there was a Nobel Prize for
social and behavioral sciences,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.070
he would have won it long
ago with his original book,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.150
the first book,
Syntactic Structures,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.450
which appeared in 1957.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.500
He is, according to
the Chicago Tribune,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.870
the most cited living
author and he's

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.456
third most cited in the
world behind Plato and Freud.

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:56.907
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.260
Professor Chomsky gave a
research talk yesterday

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.920
to a small group--
1,200 faculty, students,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.100
and community members and
the US Student Union--

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.610
and I have to say, I was
overwhelmed by the response.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.850
Tucson, by all rights,
you have a claim

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.035
on the title the
Athens of the West.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.340
And, of course,
there is Chomsky--

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.020
the public intellectual, the
self-described libertarian,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.890
socialist, and
anarchist, a critic

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.551
of established politicians on
both the left and the right.

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:46.412
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.340
An activist who has
influenced millions,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.570
Professor Chomsky is well known
for his relentless critiques

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.770
of US foreign policy
from his outspoken stance

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.510
against the Vietnam War and his
first political book, American

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.210
Power and the New Mandarins,
to his forthcoming 2012 volume,

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.880
a collection of essays titled
Making the Future, Occupations,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.250
Interventions, Empire,
and Resistance.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.750
The topic of tonight's
lecture, education for whom

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.690
and for what, draws on
another line of critique.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.100
One based on a
lifetime of thinking

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.930
about education's role in the
pursuit of democracy, justice,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.600
and freedom.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.130
For us at the
University of Arizona,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.860
these issues are of
utmost importance

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.490
as we grapple with how to
maintain quality and access

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.370
in the face of over $180 million
of budget cuts in recent years.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.840
Today, only 16% of the
total university budget

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.040
comes from the state,
a figure that is half

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.500
of what it was 10 years ago.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.590
Of course, these cuts have
occurred not just in Arizona,

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.450
but in all states
and they go directly

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.870
to the question of whether
higher education should

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.660
be a public good, a common
investment in our children's

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.380
and our state's
futures, or, instead,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.730
solely a private matter
left to would-be students

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.370
and their families.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.620
Professor Chomsky's remarks
tonight will undoubtedly

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.110
spark reflection on this and
many other questions related

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.020
to education.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.490
And now I'd like
to say a few words

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.915
about tonight's proceedings.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.440
Following Professor
Chomsky's talk,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.380
we have allotted approximately
30 minutes for a question

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.270
and answer period moderated
by Arizona Public Media's

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.630
Christopher Conover who
was up here a minute ago.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.700
Mr. Conover has over 23 years
of experience in broadcast

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.800
journalism and has been a
mainstay at KUAT and KUAZ

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.920
since 2005 and I'm very grateful
to him for his help tonight.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:11.760
Finally, throughout
the evening I

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.870
ask that whatever your opinions,
you respect those of our guest

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.940
and your neighbors in
the audience for tonight

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.010
we have a unique
opportunity to engage

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.070
in thoughtful, civil discourse
with one of the greatest

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.450
intellectuals and public
figures of our time.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.590
Please join me in giving
a warm Tucson welcome

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.230
to Professor Noam Chomsky.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.317
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.096
Thank you very much.

00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:07.072
Mic check.

00:09:07.072 --> 00:09:08.536
Mic check.

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:09.520
Mic check.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.918
Mic check.

00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:11.850
Thank you--

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.782
Thank you--

00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:14.180
-- for supporting--

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.972
-- for supporting--

00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:16.346
I can't hear what
you are saying.

00:09:16.346 --> 00:09:17.418
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.480
I'm truly glad you
came to say hello.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:34.710
Sorry.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.570
I couldn't hear it, but I'm
sure it was very important.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.390
So I hope everyone else did.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:49.930
Well, I'm going to concentrate
mostly on higher education,

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.410
but that can't really
be disconnected

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:58.270
from what happens
from infancy so I'll

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.460
say some words about
early education too.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.010
In the background, there
are contrasting conceptions

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:12.560
of whom education is
for and what it is for,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.530
so let's take a look
at whom it is for.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.310
There are two fundamental
views that go far back.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.700
One view is that higher
education is basically

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.780
for the elites,
for the privileged.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.400
The rest of the
population should

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.260
be dumbed down, maybe allowed
entry into vocational schools

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.160
to learn trades.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.710
There's a more
general conception

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.860
that lies in the background
and which, strikingly,

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.590
holds across the mainstream
political spectrum.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.860
It's more instructive
almost always

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.610
to focus on the left
liberal extremes,

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.450
so I'll keep to that--
the less harsh extreme.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.920
So, for example, the
leading public intellectual

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.940
of the 20th century,
Walter Lippmann--

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:11.090
who was kind of a Wilson,
Roosevelt, Kennedy liberal.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:18.330
His view was that we
have to distinguish

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.040
between the
intelligent minority,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.690
called the responsible
men, and what

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.870
he called the ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders-- that's

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:33.400
the general population--
who have to be spectators,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.260
but not participants in action.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.770
And the responsible
men-- incidentally anyone

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.700
who ever discusses
this is always

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.780
part of the intelligent
minority by definition--

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.270
so the intelligent minority,
the responsible men who

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.290
are in charge of
decision-making,

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.880
they have to be
protected, in his words,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:59.530
from the roar and the trampling
of the bewildered herd.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:05.060
He developed the concept
of manufacture of consent--

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.220
it's a new art of
democracy, which

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.040
has to be used to keep the
ignorant and meddlesome

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.710
outsiders from interfering.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.360
He was actually relying
on his own experience--

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.830
these were writings
in the 1920s.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.210
Incidentally, they are
called progressive essays

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.430
on democracy.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.900
He was relying on his experience
in the first and, in many ways,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:36.070
only official US propaganda
agency, the Committee on Public

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.330
Information, a term that
Orwell would have liked.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.000
It was the Creel Commission
established during the First

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.990
World War to try to drive a
pacifist population into raving

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.970
warmongers and it worked
pretty successfully.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.970
It was led by the responsible
men, the intelligent minority

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.250
who were, more or less,
unaware that they themselves

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:07.740
were the targets of an earlier
propaganda agency, the British

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.440
Ministry of information--
another Orwellian phrase which

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.260
was essentially
designed to control

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.030
the thought of American elites.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.700
So they would,
therefore, participate

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.030
in the great task of bringing
America into the First World

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.690
War on England's side.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.850
Another member of
the Creel Commission

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.410
who was also very impressed
by it was Edward Bernays.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.850
He's one of the main founders
of the modern public relations

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.750
industry and his views
were about the same.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.820
There has to be an intelligent
minority in control

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.640
and we have to have a
technique-- he called

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.540
it engineering of
consent-- to make sure

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.140
that the rabble
stays in their place

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.122
as spectators, not participants.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.920
The basic view goes
back much farther.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.150
So, for example, long before
this Ralph Waldo Emerson

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:19.260
was considering the question
of why political leaders are

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.160
interested in having
public education--

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.760
mass public education
was just beginning--

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.930
and he said that the ground on
which eminent public servants

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:34.310
urged the claims of
popular education is fear.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.090
That in their words,
he says, this country

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:41.050
is filling up with thousands
and millions of voters

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.380
and you must educate them to
keep them from our throats.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.740
Meaning, educate
them the right way,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.880
keep their perspectives
and their understanding

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.840
narrow and
restricted, discourage

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.530
free and independent
thought, and frighten them

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.040
into obedience.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.230
That's something that is done
over and over in the schools

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.900
as well.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.090
We've all experienced it.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.200
If you go back still
farther to the framing

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.890
of the Constitution, it
was based essentially

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.880
on the same principles.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:21.920
James Madison, the
major framer, his view

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.880
was pretty much the same.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.220
He said we have to make sure
that the public is marginalized

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.440
because otherwise
there'll be trouble.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.860
And in fact, if you read the
speeches at a Constitutional

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.060
Convention, he
urged the Convention

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.940
to think about what would happen
in England-- that was obviously

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.969
the model.

00:15:42.969 --> 00:15:44.760
What would happen in
England if they really

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.850
had a democratic vote?

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.930
He said, well, what
would happen would

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.690
be that the majority
of the population

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.940
would use their voting
power to take away

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.190
the property of the rich-- to
carry out what these days we

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.870
would call land reform
and obviously that would

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:07.035
be unjust-- so, therefore, we've
got to guard against democracy.

00:16:07.035 --> 00:16:08.410
Actually it's kind
of interesting

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:17.090
that whether consciously or
not, Madison was reformulating

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.970
an argument that goes back
to the first main major study

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.700
of political theory,
Aristotle's book, Politics.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.550
Aristotle reviewed the
many forms of government

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.680
there could be and
didn't like any of them,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.650
but decided that democracy
would be the least bad.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.640
He is, of course, mostly
thinking of Athens,

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.610
but he raised the same dilemma.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.230
He said this same
problem that Madison did.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.380
He said that one of the
big problems of democracy

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.160
is that the majority of the
poor would use their voting

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.910
power to take away and divide
up the property of the rich,

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.730
which is unjust.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.940
So Madison Aristotle
faced the same problem,

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.920
but they drew
opposite conclusions.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.550
Aristotle's conclusion
was we should

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.640
eliminate inequality-- make
everyone middle class, more

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.420
or less.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.230
And he proposed actual
measures for this--

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.180
what we would call today
welfare state measures--

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.250
and that would
overcome the problem.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.520
So reduce inequality,
overcome the problem.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.819
But Madison's solution was the
opposite-- reduce democracy.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.330
So design a system in
which the public will not

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.880
be able to exercise
the kind of free vote

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.450
that would threaten one of the
main goals of government, which

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.140
he said is to protect the
minority of the opulent

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.890
against the majority.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.565
So same problem, but opposite
conclusions-- reduce democracy.

00:17:50.565 --> 00:17:52.690
And if you look at the
framing of the Constitution,

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.360
that's the way it's designed.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.900
So, again in Madison's words,
the constitutional framework

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.840
has to ensure that power is
in the hands of what he called

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.500
the wealth of the nation, the
responsible men, the men who

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.040
have respect for
property and its rights

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.930
and, therefore, will ensure
that the opulent minority is

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.800
protected from the majority.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.180
And that's why, in the original
framing of the Constitution,

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.790
power is primarily in
the hands of the Senate--

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.690
the Executive at that time
was kind of an administrator.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.160
So power is in the
hands of the Senate--

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.740
which, remember,
people didn't vote for.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.570
That was much later.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.130
And the Senate, he said,
would be the wealth

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.250
of the nation, the
people who would

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:48.230
make judicious and
responsible decisions.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.490
Actually in
Madison's defense, it

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.030
should be mentioned that he was,
at this point, pre-capitalist.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.970
So his model of the
wealth of the nation

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:05.790
was some mythology about Rome,
where distinguished gentleman

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:12.090
and benign aristocrats
devoted to the public good

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.210
would make all the
right decisions.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.180
He soon learned differently,
but that was the model.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.780
That's the original
intent of our constitution

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:27.266
for those who are interested in
original intent, originalism.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:31.150
To go back a little bit
further and go back to, say,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.320
David Hume, one
of the first great

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.720
modern political philosophers.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.730
He wrote a book called The
First Principles of Government

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.840
and in this-- I'll quote him.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.850
He wondered at "the easiness
with which the many are

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:51.850
governed by the few; and the
implicit submission, with which

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:55.560
men resign their own sentiments
and passions to those

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.160
of their rulers.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.840
When we enquire by what means
this wonder is brought about,

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.020
we shall find that
as Force is always

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.550
on the side of the government,
the governors have nothing

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.140
to support them but opinion.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.490
'Tis therefore, on opinion only
that government is founded;

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:21.590
and this maxim extends to the
most despotic and most military

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.450
governments, as well as to the
most free and most popular."

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.340
And, in fact, in the more
free in the more popular

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.100
where force is
less available, you

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.040
get the most
sophisticated development

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.620
of the notions of
manufacturer of consent,

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.630
engineering of consent, public
relations industry, and so on.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.600
And the educational
system has to be

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.180
enlisted in this enterprise.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.770
It's a very conscious
policy-- I'll

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.080
return to the way it works
in the modern period.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.470
Well, that's one point of view
about whom education is for.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.020
Another alternative point of
view, including high culture,

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.790
is that it's for
everyone and there's

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.310
interesting work on this.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.570
One book I'd strongly
recommend if you

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.080
have good eyesight-- it's very
tiny print, unfortunately--

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.350
is a scholarly book
by Jonathan Rose.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.930
It's called The
Intellectual Life

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.090
of The British Working Classes.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:23.380
It's a monumental study of the
reading habits of 19th century

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.630
British workers and
it's pretty remarkable

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.110
to see what they were reading.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.690
Rose contrasts-- I'll quote
him-- "the passionate pursuit

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.770
of knowledge by
proletarian autodidacts"

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:42.910
with "the pervasive philistinism
of the British aristocracy."

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.200
There is good evidence for
it and pretty much the same

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.130
was true in the United States.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.620
In Boston, let's say,
in the 19th century

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.170
if a blacksmith could afford
it, he would typically

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.570
hire a young boy to read
to him while he's working

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.430
and reading meant
reading classics--

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.940
or contemporary
literature that we now

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.220
consider classics--
in the factories that

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.240
were the mills that
were just beginning

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.220
to be built in the early days
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.370
A lot of the workers
were young women

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.590
from the farms-- they
were called factory girls.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.360
Now there was a
pretty lively labor

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.860
press at the time-- very
interesting to read.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.430
The factory girls had
plenty of condemnations

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.690
of the industrial
system into which

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.140
they were being forced--
I'll come back to it

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.540
in a little bit--
but one of them

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.650
was that it was taking
away their high culture.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.010
They were used to reading
contemporary literature,

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.340
classics, and so on.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.170
When they were driven
into the mills,

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.280
that was taken away from
them and this continued.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.880
I'm old enough to
remember the 1930s.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.510
At that time, there was lively
programs of workers' education

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.120
and some of the
leading scientists

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.530
and mathematicians
wrote popular books

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.370
intended for worker education.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.620
Mathematics for the
Million, things like that.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.500
George Gamow later, One, Two,
Three-- Infinity, JD Bernal,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.400
another well-known scientist.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.870
There were educational courses--
my own family, my relatives,

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.900
were mostly unemployed
working class,

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:36.200
but they were deeply
immersed in high culture

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.630
even though some never made
it through elementary school.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.730
They were what Rose calls
proletarian autodidacts,

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.640
although they were helped by
workers' education courses

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.380
and things like free
Shakespearean plays in Central

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.050
Park and so on.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:57.090
Well, those are two views
of whom education is for,

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.170
two contrasting ones.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.860
Then comes the question
what it is for.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.940
And here too, there
are contrasting views.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.990
The contrast is
actually discussed

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.890
during the Enlightenment
and there's

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.860
imagery associated with it.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:17.900
One image is that education
is like pouring water

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.550
into an empty
vessel and, in fact,

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.770
it's a pretty leaky
vessel as you all

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.860
know from your experience.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.715
So you're pour
water into a vessel

00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:29.785
and, of course, all of
us have been through this

00:24:29.785 --> 00:24:31.760
and you remember nothing.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.900
The other alternative
is that teaching

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.900
should be like laying
out a sting along which

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:47.070
the student can explore and
progress in his own way.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.260
That image comes from
Wilhelm von Humboldt

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.110
who was the founder of the
modern university system, also

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.225
one of the founders of
classical liberalism.

00:24:57.225 --> 00:25:01.910
I'll get to John Dewey,
America's greatest

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.960
social philosopher
a century later.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.400
He wrote that it is "illiberal
and immoral" to train children

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.680
to work "not freely
and intelligently,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.050
but for the sake of the
work earned, in which case

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:21.540
their activity "is not
free because not freely

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.040
participated in."

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.530
And as he also pointed out,
it will be a leaky vessel.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:33.250
Those contrasting choices
are very sharply drawn today.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.759
I'm sure, again,
that most of you

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:36.800
have seen it in your own
experience-- I certainly

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.320
have myself.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.340
It has very definite
policy implications,

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.120
right now in fact.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.910
There is just some very
recent and very pointed

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:50.399
discussion of this, which
I'll quote the American

00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:52.190
Association for the
Advancement of Science,

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.940
a main scientific organization.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.040
It has a regular journal,
The Journal of Science,

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.020
and in the last couple of
issues, the editor-- biochemist

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:09.220
Bruce Alberts-- sets forth
these alternatives very clearly.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.060
He's discussing science
education in the schools,

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.850
but it generalizes.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.970
So one approach he discusses
is, in fact, the Enlightenment

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.210
view-- that teaching is laying
out a string along which

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.440
the student progresses
in their own way

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.080
through discovery
and exploration.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.430
And his version of
it is that "our goal

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.860
is to make it much
easier for teachers

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.340
everywhere to provide their
students with laboratory

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.370
experiences that mirror
the open-ended explorations

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:44.390
of scientists, instead of
the traditional 'cookbook'

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.460
labs where students follow
instructions to a predetermined

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.326
result."

00:26:49.326 --> 00:26:53.030
And then he contrasts that
with actual practice, which

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.680
is of course is pretty much
the opposite-- concepts

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.130
taught with an overly strict
attention to rules, procedures,

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.330
and group memorizations.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.740
And then he goes on to quote his
own testimony to the California

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:13.040
Standards Commission, his
testimony opposing such ideas

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.430
as teaching the periodic table
of the elements in fifth grade

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.800
which is totally
meaningless to the student.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.890
Incidentally, he points out
he was unsuccessful in this--

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.450
it is taught that way.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.490
And what he says is, "When we
teach children about aspects

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:31.770
of science" that they
cannot yet grasp,

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.600
"then we have wasted valuable
educational resources,"

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.470
"produced nothing of lasting
value," and much worse,

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.482
"we take all the enjoyment
out of science when we do so."

00:27:43.482 --> 00:27:46.680
And he discusses
DNA, his own field.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.420
He says, "Unfortunately, most
students today are taught about

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.850
DNA at such an early age that
they are forced to merely

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.820
memorize the fact that"-- he
gives a quote from a textbook--

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.600
"'DNA is the material from which
genes are made,' a chore that

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.000
brings no enjoyment or
understanding whatsoever."

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.750
And much later he says, "when
they do have the background

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.490
to understand both the
structure of the DNA

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.740
molecule and its
explanatory power,

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.040
I fear that the joy
of discovery has

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.200
been eliminated by the early
memorization of boring DNA

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.330
facts.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.150
We have spoiled a
beautiful story for them

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.660
by teaching it at
the wrong time."

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.740
Then he goes on to
the college level.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:37.110
He says, "For example, in an
introductory biology class,

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:41.810
students are often required
to learn the names of the 10

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.230
enzymes that oxidize
sugars-- but an obsession

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.270
with such details and obscure
any real understanding

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:54.510
of the central issue," leaves
"students with the impression

00:28:54.510 --> 00:29:01.380
that science is impossibly
dull," causes many of them drop

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.020
it.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.710
"Tragically, we have
managed to simultaneously

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.810
trivialize and complicate
science education.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.630
As a result, for far
too many, science

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:17.690
seems a game of the recalling
boring, incomprehensible

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:22.270
facts-- so much so that it
may make little difference

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.840
whether the factoids
about science

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.230
come from the periodic
table or-- a movie script.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.410
He gives some examples.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:35.320
Again, I'm sure you've had
your own experience about that.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.160
Just to interpolate,
I certainly have.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.430
I remember when I was
a 16-year-old freshman

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.380
at the University
of Pennsylvania,

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.850
I had to take a
general chemistry

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.370
course with about this many
students in the audience.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.690
It was insufferably
boring and furthermore,

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.740
it was completely obvious
what was going to happen.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.600
So if you read the
textbook, you knew

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.760
exactly what was going to
happen so I never went to class.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.660
But, I got an A, it was OK.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.090
I actually had a friend who
took notes-- that helped.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:08.780
But the worst part was
that they had a lab

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.410
and I knew perfectly well
that if I went to the lab

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.120
and carried out the experiments,
none of them would work.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.610
That's automatic, so I
didn't go to the lab.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.150
There was a manual where you
had to fill in the answers

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.780
to the results of
the experiments

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.480
and, again, entirely obvious
what they were going to be.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.420
So I filled it in and
got an A and so on.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:35.360
But then I had a very
unpleasant experience.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.310
I had to register
for the next semester

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.090
and when I tried
to register, they

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:46.850
insisted on my paying a fee
for breakage in the laboratory.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.710
I'd never been to
the laboratory--

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.580
I didn't know where it was.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:55.230
But obviously couldn't
say that so I had to pay

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:59.670
$17, which was a lot of money
in those days for the breakage

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.670
in the lab that I never
attended and, of course,

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.810
I don't remember a
thing from the course.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:08.340
I'm sure many of you can
duplicate this experience.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:13.460
Actually, this approach
generalizes-- even has a name.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.730
It's called No
Child Left Behind.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.235
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.930
I see you've experienced it.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.920
Actually, it's been going
on for about 10 years.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.930
No reported progress,
which is no surprise.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.340
Serious education is
radically different.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.349
It's what Alberts
was recommending

00:31:41.349 --> 00:31:43.140
and it's the way science
is actually taught

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.910
at the advanced levels--
take my own university, MIT,

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.450
it's a research university.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.670
There is a world-famous
physicist, the late Victor

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.860
Weisskopf, who-- like a
lot of senior faculty--

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.750
taught freshman courses.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.480
And he used to say
that when he came

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.410
to the first session
of his freshman course,

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:07.750
students would ask, what are we
going to cover this semester?

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.870
And his routine answer was it
doesn't matter what we cover--

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:14.280
it matters what you discover.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.930
And maybe you'll discover that
what I'm teaching is wrong.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.340
That would be great-- that's
the kind of thing we want to do.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.670
This goes on right through
the graduate level.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.460
In a serious university,
that's all there

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.770
is-- it's the whole curriculum.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.980
And that's actually possible all
the way down to kindergarten--

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.640
there are examples.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.870
In fact, Alberts in
this series of articles

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.310
gives a good example.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.970
He talks about a
kindergarten class which

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.610
won some award in the sciences.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.960
These five-year-old
kids-- the task

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.170
that was given them--
each kid in the class

00:32:53.170 --> 00:33:00.020
was given a dish that contained
seeds, pebbles, and shells.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.990
And their task was to figure
out which ones were the seeds.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.820
So the kids got
together in what they

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.680
called a scientific
conference and they each

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.140
had ideas about how
you might do it.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.470
They exchanged the
ideas, suggested

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:19.420
some ways of testing it, and
finally carried out the tests.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.110
They finally got somewhere
with a little teacher guidance,

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.940
but they are basically
figuring it out for themselves.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.680
It ended up at the point
where they figured out

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.180
what were the seeds and they
were dissecting the seeds.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.600
They were given magnifying
glasses and could look into it

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.880
and locate the embryo, which
was the source of sustenance.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.180
That's learning-- real learning.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.060
That's Enlightenment
style leaning,

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.290
not No Child Left Behind.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:51.430
It can be done and sometimes
is like in this case,

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:53.210
but far too little.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.610
Well, let's take a brief
look at the history.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:01.550
Not surprisingly, the US
system of higher education

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:07.350
has evolved along with
broader socioeconomic changes.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.850
Actually there was
very sharp change

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.520
at the time of World War II.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.810
Everything changed
after World War II--

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:18.760
it was a very dramatic
event for world history.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.230
The United States was the
richest country in the world,

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.920
but it wasn't a major
actor in the world scene.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.469
The major actors were Britain,
primarily France, Germany--

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:34.630
but not the United
States except regionally.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.969
But after World War II, it
was all different-- totally.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.320
The United States
emerged from World War II

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.310
with a position of
global dominance

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:48.110
that had absolutely no
precedence in history

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:52.850
and no precedence since-- it
began declining shortly after.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.260
The United States at the
time had literally 50%

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.130
of the world's wealth.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.840
Other industrial societies
had been seriously

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.920
harmed or devastated.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.040
For the United States, which
was untouched by the war,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.880
the war was a tremendous
stimulus, a huge government

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.110
stimulus to the economy.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.060
The industrial
production quadrupled

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.640
and it already had been the
richest country in the world.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.470
It also had an overwhelming
position of security-- nothing

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.530
remotely like it.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:30.970
Well, this affected the whole
culture, including education.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.830
Prior to this,
higher education--

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.580
at least elite
education-- had been

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.590
a kind of gentlemen's club.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:42.540
And, indeed, it remained so
at the elite schools well

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.700
after-- again, personal
experience again.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.420
I was a student at
Harvard in the early '50s

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.060
and that's exactly what it
was-- It was a gentleman's club.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.350
But the US had also
pioneered mass education

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.970
through colleges.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.040
In fact, that's a very
important achievement

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.330
of American society.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:07.002
It was motivated in part by
just what Emerson talked about.

00:36:07.002 --> 00:36:09.990
It was motivated
by the transition

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:15.380
from an agricultural society
of free, independent people

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.420
to an industrial society.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:22.360
It was necessary to turn
free farmers into disciplined

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.510
factory workers.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:26.110
And since they
didn't like it, you

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.210
needed the kind of education
that Emerson was talking about.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:33.320
The kind of education that will
keep them from our throats.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.370
And it was dramatic-- I
mentioned the labor press--

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.730
and it was very
interesting to read.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:43.100
Factory girls, artisans
from the town--

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.530
they have many complaints
about the system they're

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.670
being driven into.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.530
It's worth reading--
it's available now.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.180
The industrial
system, they said,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.840
was crushing their culture,
their dignity, their freedom.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.730
It was turning them into
something like slaves.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.230
In fact, a century
and a half ago,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.950
a very common belief--
so common that it

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:11.970
was a slogan of the Republican
Party supported by Abraham

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:17.800
Lincoln-- was that wage
slavery is different

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.660
from chattel slavery only in
that it's temporary, but other

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.850
than that it's the same.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:27.420
You're being forced--
you're working on command,

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.740
not under your own initiative.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.190
So they wanted to
get rid of it--

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.710
worker ownership and so on.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:40.170
I think the most interesting
element of their critique

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.150
was their condemnation
of what they

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:46.400
called the new spirit
of the age-- remember,

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.550
this is 150 years ago.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:52.240
The new spirit of the
age is gain wealth,

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.020
forgetting all but self.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.630
Adam Smith had
talked about that.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:02.780
He called it "the vile maxim
of the masters of mankind."

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.150
All for ourselves,
nothing for anyone else.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.950
And the new spirit of the
age-- a century later--

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:14.810
was to try to drive
this deeply inhuman idea

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.460
into people's heads.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.520
It was a very sharp break
from traditional societies

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.750
that valued trust and
solidarity and mutual aid

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.751
for common purposes.

00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:32.190
In our own tradition,
the standard example

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.710
should be the English commons.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.890
We're going to celebrate--
probably won't-- but we should

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:43.440
be commemorating the 900th
anniversary of the Magna Carta,

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.360
The Great Charter, in
a couple of months.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.660
It is forgotten.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.080
The Magna Carta, as
everyone ought to know,

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:56.370
is the foundation of civil
liberties-- presumption

00:38:56.370 --> 00:39:01.960
of innocence, trial by jury,
due process, and so on.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.250
But it's sort of
forgotten, interestingly,

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.090
that there were two charters.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.010
There was a Charter
of Liberties and there

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:10.170
was a Charter of The Forests.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.920
The Charter of The Forests
was about preservation

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.450
of the commons.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:17.610
The commons--
including the forests--

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.850
were the possession of everyone.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:27.660
They were the source of food,
of fuel, of building materials.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.300
They had been
carefully cultivated

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.010
with mutual aid and mutual
support for centuries,

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.690
so they were very
complex ecosystems

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.430
which everyone had access to.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:45.100
And The Great Charter calls
for preservation of the commons

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:50.810
from the predatory acts
of the kings and nobles.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:54.220
Well, that's been forgotten,
so nobody talks about that

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.810
anymore.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:01.096
And that's a very
serious problem.

00:40:01.096 --> 00:40:06.990
In fact, the failure to
attend to the commons

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.850
is going to destroy us.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:12.360
That's the environmental
crisis which we're marching

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.380
towards with utter abandon.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.815
If some extraterrestrial
observer was watching,

00:40:18.815 --> 00:40:21.560
they would think
we're all lunatics,

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.300
but it is going on right now--

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.709
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:34.490
-- and unless this conception
of preservation of the commons

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:37.900
and the values that were part
of it-- unless that's restored,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.060
we're in trouble.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.490
Well, shortly after
that with the beginnings

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.480
of capitalist
industrialization, there's

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.560
a move towards making
everything a commodity.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.630
And it then becomes
necessary to inculpate

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.830
the new spirit of the
age-- gain wealth,

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:00.930
forgetting all but self--
and reverence for what

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.230
Adam Smith condemned
as the vile maxim.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.440
Actually there are major
industries devoted to it.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.070
The public relations
industry-- advertising,

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.940
marketing-- it is
probably a sixth

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.220
of the gross national
domestic product--

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.510
is devoted pretty much to this.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:21.200
It's devoted very consciously--
interesting to read

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.730
the literature their
own literature.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:31.480
It's devoted to what's called
creating wants-- fancy needs,

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.780
stimulating consumerism, turning
people's attention to what

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.930
are called the superficial
things of life,

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.690
like fashionable
consumption, and away

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.260
from real human values.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:48.870
And enormous work goes
into this-- keep people

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:51.090
from our throats, again.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:55.970
That new spirit of
the age is so inhuman

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.200
so that over 150
years of effort,

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.630
there still is
always resistance.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:07.840
So in the early 1970s, as an
outgrowth of 1960s activism,

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.580
there was a very important
series of labor striket--

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.110
young workers mostly.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.690
Many of them were
Vietnam veterans,

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.160
others just young people
getting into the workforce.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.700
The most famous one was
at Lordstown and very

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.810
significantly, they were
not striking particularly

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:33.280
for wages and benefits, but for
human dignity in the workplace.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.680
That was also the
time when women

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:40.450
were becoming organized
and active-- chicanos, farm

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.340
workers, black
unions, and so on.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.770
All of this was
beaten back and it's

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.960
been beaten back for a
generation, but it's there.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.685
In fact, the Occupy movements
that are spreading all over

00:42:52.685 --> 00:42:54.390
are reviving it.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.375
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.530
I think it is a
main significence.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:08.910
And a lot hinges on whether
the new spirit of the age--

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:13.205
150-years-old and, in fact, in
England going back centuries

00:43:13.205 --> 00:43:15.600
to the destruction
of the commons--

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.710
it is a very
important to determine

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.980
whether this new
spirit can be overcome.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:29.660
If not, we're just lemmings
walking off the cliff and soon.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.010
There's a lot to say about
that, but I'll put it aside.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.030
Well, again, after
World War II--

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.970
going back to that-- there
was a another new spirit,

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.110
a spirit of triumphalism.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:45.400
Before the Second World
War, the United States

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.630
was a kind of cultural,
intellectual backwater.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:54.450
If you want to study a science
or philosophy or the arts

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:57.840
or be a writer, you went to
Europe-- Germany, Britain,

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.090
France, someplace like that.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.690
But after World War
II, that all changed

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.400
and it led to just a
different attitude.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.110
I remember very well-- I
was just becoming a college

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:09.526
student at the time.

00:44:09.526 --> 00:44:10.900
The atmosphere
was that we should

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.260
shed all of this
old world baggage

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.240
and lead the world to
a bright future-- what

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.630
was called an American century.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.280
European scholars-- many of
whom were emmigrating here

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:28.290
fleeing Nazi Germany--
they were feared

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.580
because they were
too good and they

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:34.220
were disdained because that's
the old fashioned baggage.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.200
And the two were
at the same time.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.690
There were many
very ugly incidents.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.470
I could tell you about some
of them, which I remember.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.550
From a student
perspective-- like what

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:47.570
I was in the 1940s in
philosophy, linguistics,

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:51.050
psychology-- they just
had to start afresh.

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:56.100
Disregard all of this old
nonsense from Europe-- biology

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.060
too in fact.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.470
Forget it all,
don't talk about it,

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.570
and start from the beginning.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:05.850
We're going to create a new
age-- and a lot of contempt

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.740
and a lot of ignorance.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.290
There are many
consequences, some of them

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.660
right to the present.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.140
It's very striking in the
behavioral sciences, in fact,

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.750
but also elsewhere.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.810
There were also
changes at that time--

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:23.390
crucial changes-- in the
way the economy functioned

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.740
and the state role
in the economy, which

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.320
had a huge impact on the
universities, higher education

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.040
particularly.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.620
You go back to the
colonial period--

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.340
Adam Smith gave advice
to the colonies--

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.780
the greatest
economist of the day.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.940
And the advice he gave was
the standard prescriptions

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:48.030
that the World Bank and the IMF
and the US Treasury and others

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.040
give to the poor
countries today.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.640
Pursue your
comparative advantage,

00:45:53.640 --> 00:46:00.020
don't try to import
more advanced goods

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:02.510
from the advanced
countries, don't

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.060
try to control your
resources-- everything

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.860
will be better if you do that.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.470
Well, the United States was
independent by that time,

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.770
so they were able
to totally reject

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.940
the rules of what are called
sound economics and they did.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.240
If we had accepted them, we'd
be a third world country.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.980
But, in fact, that is
how the third world

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.610
was pretty much created.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.590
But the colonies
could reject it.

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:31.910
The so-called Hamiltonian system
introduced very high tariffs

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:35.090
to block superior
British manufactures.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.880
There was a lot of
stealing of technology--

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.390
what is now called piracy.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.320
And the United States
began to develop

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.250
and this went from
textiles, the early stages

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.650
of industrialization,
then right through steel

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:53.210
and on pretty much until the
First and Second World War.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:03.420
A huge role of the
state system and state

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.700
sector in developing
the economy-- mass

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.070
industrialization was
developed, for example,

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:12.140
in armories because there
you could control things.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:16.420
The railroad system was managed
by the Army Corps of Engineers

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.710
and so on.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:22.960
Well, after World War II, that
took a major leap forward--

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.310
huge.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:29.690
There was massive funding
for science and technology,

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:32.050
mostly through the Pentagon.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:35.750
And was done through the
Pentagon for the usual reasons.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.910
You have to inspire
fear and you can

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:44.650
get taxpayers to pay the
Pentagon to protect us

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.890
from various imaginary dangers.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:51.010
But the money that went
through the Pentagon

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.820
ended up creating
the high-tech economy

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.680
that we're now living in.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.940
So computers,
internet, satellites,

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:05.000
microelectronics-- a
whole array of stuff

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.860
comes out of decades of mostly
Pentagon funding and research.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:14.920
My own university, MIT, was
right in the middle of it.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.250
And the net effect
is to socialize cost

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.440
and to privatize profit.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.560
And it's a standard device--
interstate highway systems,

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.360
another example.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.600
It's not what it's
claimed to be.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.965
It was sold on the
basis of defense.

00:48:31.965 --> 00:48:35.540
It was really part
of the mass subsidy

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:42.884
to automobiles, energy
corporations, rubber

00:48:42.884 --> 00:48:43.425
corporations.

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:51.560
The idea was to make us
a society that massively

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.330
wastes fossil fuels
with consequences

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.800
we're now in the middle of.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.630
There was also a rapid
expansion of the student body

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:01.870
through the GI
Bill, which brought

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:04.270
a whole new sector
of the population

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.300
into higher
education-- people who

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.020
never could have gone before.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.840
That a very positive
impact on the colleges

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.350
and on the general society.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:16.090
That's incidentally
a course that's

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.720
been reversed in the last
generation-- I'll come back

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.900
to it.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.570
The sharp increase in
funding was mainly directed

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:27.410
to science and technology
but, of course,

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:31.100
there was a spillover
into other domains.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.650
1957-- the Russians
sent a satellite

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.190
into space, Sputnik,
and the laments

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:41.510
about how the US is falling
behind, going to be destroyed,

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:42.780
and so on.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.990
The scientific community knew
that this was total nonsense,

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.225
that the achievement
was essentially nothing.

00:49:49.225 --> 00:49:51.720
We could duplicate
and go way beyond it

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.690
any time we wanted to,
but it was exploited.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:56.280
It was exploited
pretty cynically,

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.840
I should say-- I
remember it very well.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:04.300
And it was exploited to give
an enormous additional input

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.890
into higher education
and also K to 12.

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.830
That's when you get the
start of the kinds of things

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:17.280
that Alberts is deploring,
like new math for example.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.070
I have to say-- I had
young kids at that time--

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:23.870
we had very amusing
experiences with watching

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:28.380
my young children, nine,
10-year-old children,

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.130
try to learn new
math from teachers

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.530
who didn't understand
a word about the said

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:37.140
theoretic basis for it but
were trying to teach it.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.370
And the kids were
making up their own--

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:41.560
I'll just give you one example.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:46.330
When my youngest daughter
was maybe 10 or so,

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:49.160
I had a visit from a friend,
an Israeli logician--

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.810
he's an old friend.

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.296
Yehoshua Bar-Hillel,
some of you know.

00:50:54.296 --> 00:50:56.130
He came and stayed
with us for a while

00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:01.410
and he saw my daughter doing
her work and what was called

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.400
Boolean-- they are
called set theory,

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.180
actually Boolean algebra.

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.370
And he was interested
because he'd

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:10.330
been trying to teach it
to junior high school

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:13.530
students in Israel and they
are having a hard time doing it

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.670
and she seemed to
be doing it fine.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:17.640
So we started
asking her questions

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.860
like if you have three things,
how many sets are there?

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.010
You know, like a milk bottle and
a cup and a book or something--

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.150
and she said right
off, eight sets.

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:31.220
And then he asked
her to list them.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.750
She listed them,
including the null set.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:37.960
And he asked, which set is
included in all the others?

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.580
She said, the null set.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.330
And I couldn't believe
it, so I asked her,

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.390
how do you know the null set
is included in all the others?

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:49.050
So she said, well, to have a
set what you do is draw braces

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:51.064
and you put the
things inside it.

00:51:51.064 --> 00:51:52.480
And if you look
carefully, there's

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.480
always a little
space between them--

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.910
that's where the null set goes.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:58.850
So what in fact had
happened is she was

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.570
doing something quite sensible.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:03.040
She was making up
a physical model

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.967
which happened to work for
these principles and, of course,

00:52:05.967 --> 00:52:07.550
had absolutely nothing
to do with what

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.960
they are trying to teach her.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:15.860
This was going on all the time--
that's No Child Left Behind.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:24.910
In the '60s, there were major
social, cultural changes--

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:27.690
the Civil Rights Movement,
moves towards diversity,

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:31.580
women's rights, all sorts of
things-- and the universities

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.020
were greatly enriched
by that as, indeed,

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.250
was the whole society.

00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.960
By the end of the
60s, there was also

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.120
a fair amount of political
activism developing

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.170
and it became a major force.

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:46.300
Again, at my own university,
MIT-- mainly a science

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.980
university-- it had an extremely
conservative and passive right

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.290
through the 60s.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:53.620
People are absorbed
in their work,

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:57.780
But by the end of
the 60s-- by 1969--

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:02.450
activism had gotten to the
point that a day was set aside,

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:07.500
formally, for the whole
Institute to consider

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.240
the question of the role
of technology in society.

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.910
Amazingly, a question that had
never been asked-- you just

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.330
do it.

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.960
And that led to a
lot of consequences

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:22.490
which, in fact, brought
about a permanent change

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:23.750
in the Institute.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:27.620
And similar things were
happening in other places,

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:32.340
even abroad too-- it
is a general movement.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:37.090
And it had a real civilizing
effect on the whole society.

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:40.570
Well, that civilizing
effect of the 1960s

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:46.520
aroused deep concerns all
across the mainstream spectrum.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.980
That's why it's usually
called the Time of Troubles.

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:54.970
It was civilizing the country
too much and that's dangerous.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:56.890
And it's kind of
interesting-- I'll talk

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:58.520
a little about the reaction.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.930
It has very strong effects
right to the present.

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.880
On the right, one
striking example

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.490
was an influential memorandum--
which is worth reading,

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:10.880
you can pick it up on the
internet-- a memorandum

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.000
by Lewis Powell who
was a corporate lawyer.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.320
He was later appointed by
Nixon to the Supreme Court.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.020
At the other end
of the spectrum,

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.180
there's an important
study-- also

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:25.450
worth reading-- by the
Trilateral Commission.

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:28.350
These are liberal
internationalists

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:32.940
from the three major industrial
regions-- Europe, United

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.680
States, and Japan.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.880
Their general outlook
is indicated by the fact

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.540
that the Carter
administration was

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:42.237
drawn almost completely
from their ranks-- that's

00:54:42.237 --> 00:54:42.820
who they were.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.360
And both of them
merit attention.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:52.210
They provide a good insight
into the ideological aspects

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:56.890
of what has, in fact, been
a major assault on democracy

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:59.210
and on rights that
was beginning to take

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:02.590
shape 40 years ago--
escalated pretty

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:06.480
sharply in the Reagan-Thatcher
years and continued

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.950
and it's now
reaching new heights.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:12.810
And they also provide insight
into how this assault targets

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:14.670
the educational system.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:18.820
So let's start with
Powell's Memorandum, 1971.

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:21.730
This was sent to the
US Chamber of Commerce.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:23.910
That's the main business lobby.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:27.940
The title was "The Attack on
the American Free Enterprise

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.000
System."

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.990
And it's worth reading,
not only for the content,

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:35.900
but also for the tone, which
is totally paranoid, which

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:40.430
is characteristic of the major
criminals, who were Ralph

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:46.360
Nader, with his consumer safety
campaigns, Herbert Marcuse, who

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:51.290
was preaching Marxism, the New
Leftists were on the rampage,

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:56.670
but primarily their naive
victims, who dominate

00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.020
the universities, the
schools, television

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:03.930
and other media, the educated
community, and virtually

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:06.780
control the government,
if you haven't noticed it.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.810
I'm incidentally
not exaggerating.

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:10.310
That's exactly what it said.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:11.900
I urge you to read it.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:16.060
Well, the takeover of the
country by these devils

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:20.200
is a dire threat to
freedom, he said.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.640
Because the only alternatives
to free enterprise

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.220
are varying degrees of
bureaucratic regulation

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:31.880
of individual freedom ranging
from moderate socialism

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.170
to the leftist and
rightist dictatorships.

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:36.670
Actually, if any
of you are watching

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:39.660
the Republican
debates, the same thing

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.210
is being repeated right
now with the center, right,

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:47.230
Obama administration, and
Marxist radicals, and so on.

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.960
Actually, Powell
was very familiar

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.110
with another alternative
to free enterprise,

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:57.300
namely the system in which he
and his Chamber of Commerce

00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.570
associates thrived.

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:04.020
He was an influential lobbyist
for the tobacco industry.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:08.570
And he was surely aware of
the huge, federal subsidies

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:13.250
for the production of
this leading killer, which

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:19.040
not only kills the users at
a scale that vastly exceeds

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:23.440
the targets of the mostly
farcical drug wars,

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.420
but also kills many others.

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:29.290
Deaths from passive
smoking-- collateral

00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:33.590
damage, just being around
when somebody's smoking-- way

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:36.270
beyond those from hard drugs.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:40.330
And he was surely aware of the
great successes of lobbyists

00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:44.340
like him in assuring
that for many decades,

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.330
the government would help-- not
only subsidize the industry--

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:51.610
but help it conceal
what they all knew.

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.230
They knew about
the lethal product

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:55.680
that they were peddling.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.700
And there are huge
mounds of corpses

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.650
to show for their achievement.

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:02.840
They're still piling up rapidly.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.790
But that didn't keep him
from wailing in his memo

00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:10.320
that I'll quote, "As every
business executive knows,

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.550
few elements of
American society today

00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:15.830
have as little
influence in government

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:19.120
as the American
businessman, corporation,

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.330
even the millions of
corporate stockholders,

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:23.190
in case you hadn't noticed."

00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:27.230
And that, again, is considered
is pretty characteristic.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:30.110
And the reason is that
there's an assumption

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:34.640
that for the state to
support, subsidize,

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:37.930
private power, that's
just the natural order.

00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:40.960
Any disruption of
it is a catastrophe.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.580
And he then drew the
obvious conclusion.

00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.440
He was talking about
the universities.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.660
He said the campuses from
which much of this emanates

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:53.150
are supported by tax
funds generated largely

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:56.210
from American business
and contributions

00:58:56.210 --> 00:59:01.170
from capital funds controlled or
generated by American business.

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:04.140
The boards of trustees
of our universities

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:08.210
overwhelmingly are composed
of men and women who are

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:10.570
leaders in the business system.

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:14.650
Most of the media, including
the national TV systems,

00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:17.790
are owned and
theoretically controlled

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:22.520
by corporations which depend
on profits and the enterprise

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.310
system to survive.

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:27.300
And therefore, these
marginalized groups

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:31.760
who are being destroyed should
organize to defend themselves,

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.350
instead of just
watching passively

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:37.130
while business and our
fundamental freedoms

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:39.910
are destroyed by this
Marxist onslaught

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:42.670
from the media and
the universities.

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:47.310
Well, Powell's memo
expresses the concerns

00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:52.050
elicited by 1960s activism at
the right end of the mainstream

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:53.190
spectrum.

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:55.250
But much more
revealing, I think,

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:59.070
is the reaction at the
opposite extreme, the Liberal

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:00.300
Internationalists.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:04.360
And these are spelled out in
the Trilateral Commission report

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.465
that I mentioned.

01:00:05.465 --> 01:00:08.650
It's called, "The
Crisis of Democracy."

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.360
It's not easy to
find, incidentally,

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.700
because they mostly
took it off the market

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.340
when people started reading it.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.860
But it's there.

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.900
Actually, I should say
that MIT-- I read it

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.340
when it came out.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.610
And I figured this isn't
going to last very long,

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.700
so I bought a lot of copies
from the MIT library.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.930
So if you can't find
one, MIT library

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:31.026
has maybe a dozen or so copies.

01:00:31.026 --> 01:00:32.400
And then, it did
go out of print,

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400
I should say, very quickly.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.420
The crisis of democracy
that they were talking about

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.090
is, literally, that
there's too much democracy.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:45.100
The problem, they said--
this is leading figures,

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.970
major political scientists from
Harvard and so on-- the way

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:53.570
that democratic order
is supposed to work,

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:57.950
the public is supposed to
be passive and apathetic.

01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:05.630
The Lippen, Bernays, Emerson,
Madison model, or Hume,

01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:08.130
they're supposed to
be passive, apathetic.

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:09.740
But in the 60s,
they were beginning

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.600
to organize to
press their demands.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.860
That's what was being
done by what are

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.300
called "the special interests."

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:22.610
The special interests are
women, young people, old people,

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:27.500
workers, farmers-- the
population, in other words.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.750
They are the special interests.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:33.020
And when they press
their demands,

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.700
there's too much
pressure on the state.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.780
The state can't deal with them.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.850
Therefore, they have to
moderate their demands.

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.930
Now there's one group
that isn't mentioned--

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:44.780
the corporate sector--
and that makes sense.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:48.390
Because they represent
the national interest, not

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:50.120
special interests.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:55.190
Just like the far right, the
Liberal Internationalists

01:01:55.190 --> 01:02:01.160
assume that their extraordinary
power, and their control

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.830
of the state and
other institutions,

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:05.090
is just the natural order.

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:08.800
A primary concern of
the Trilateral Scholars,

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.240
just like Lewis Powell, was the
failures of what they called,

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.680
and I'm quoting,
"the institutions

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.920
responsible for the
indoctrination of the young.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.710
The schools, the universities,
the churches and the like,

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:25.110
they're not carrying
out their duty

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:27.860
to indoctrinate the
young properly."

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.820
And that's why we had
this time of troubles.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.000
In general, they said, we
have to have more moderation

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.340
in democracy if the national
interest is to be protected,

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.420
including much more successful
indoctrination of the young.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.110
Well, the Powell memo,
and the Trilateral study,

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:49.980
spell out the concerns
at the opposite extremes

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.280
of the dominant,
ideological spectrum.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.100
These are largely
shared concerns.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.440
And they've led
to vigorous action

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.700
to restore order, as often
happened in the past.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.950
One consequence of these
and other developments

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:12.300
has been a pretty sharp attack
on public education taking

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.100
many forms.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.080
I'll mention a few.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.260
About a year ago,
I went to Mexico

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:25.091
to give talks at the
National University, UNAM.

01:03:25.091 --> 01:03:26.090
Quite a good university.

01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:27.760
It's a very poor
country, of course,

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.070
but quite a good, impressive
university, high standards,

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:38.310
good faculty, lively discussion,
reasonable facilities,

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.350
not like a rich
American university,

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.310
but quite reasonable.

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:45.100
I also visited a
City University.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.390
There's a City University
in Mexico City.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:51.300
Incidentally, UNAM is free.

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.360
No tuition.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.050
About 10 years ago,
there was an attempt

01:03:57.050 --> 01:04:02.520
by the government to raise
just a very low tuition.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.910
That led to a national
student strike.

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:07.320
The country practically
closed down.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.360
The government
withdrew the proposal.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.055
There actually still
on the UNAM campus

01:04:12.055 --> 01:04:15.790
is an administration building
that was occupied at the time.

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:16.970
And it's still occupied.

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:21.470
And it's used as a kind
of activism center.

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:24.190
The City University
is not only free,

01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:28.900
but has open admissions
with compensatory options

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.220
for those who need them.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.425
And it's also a
pretty respectable.

01:04:32.425 --> 01:04:34.290
I was quite impressed to see it.

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:38.550
Well, I went from Mexico to
California, maybe the richest

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.110
place in the world.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.830
There, the public
education system,

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:46.670
which is just the best public
education system in the world,

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:48.270
is being destroyed.

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:52.100
It's being privatized,
for the rich, of course.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:56.360
For the rest, there's some level
of mostly technical training.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.120
And that's quite a contrast
between a poor country

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.400
and, in many ways, the
richest place in the world.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.630
And that's happening
all across the country.

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:08.900
In most states, like
here I just heard

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:15.450
before, tuition, in most states,
tuition covers more than half

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.130
of college budgets.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:21.450
That's also true of most
public research universities.

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:24.980
Pretty soon, only the
community colleges

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.770
will be state financed.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:29.170
And even they are under attack.

01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:31.080
I'm quoting a recent study.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.910
Analysts generally
agree that the era

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:37.860
of affordable, four-year,
public universities

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.230
subsidized by the
state may be over.

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:45.600
That's one important way
to implement indoctrination

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.310
of the young for a very
good, simple reason.

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:53.150
Students leave in a debt trap.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:56.930
College debt has reached
the astonishing level

01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:59.390
of over a trillion dollars now.

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:02.270
When a student leaves
college with a big debt,

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:04.260
they don't have many options.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.950
Indoctrination is working.

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.680
That's true of social
control, generally.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.380
It's also an important feature
of international policy.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:17.480
Well, as the
Mexico-California comparison

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:22.010
illustrates, the reasons for
the conscious destruction

01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:24.770
of the greatest public
education system in the world

01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:27.500
in California, and
comparable things elsewhere,

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.730
the reasons are not economic.

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:33.740
There are many other cases,
including rich societies, so

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:38.080
Germany, to mention one, or for
that matter, the post-war US

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.980
experience.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.270
Much poorer country than we are
now but it wasn't totally free.

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:46.500
But tuition was very low.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.700
So for example, when I went to
the University of Pennsylvania

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.840
as an undergraduate, it
was literally $100 a year.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.550
That might be $400 today.

01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:59.410
It's not an economic reason.

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:01.820
But as a technique
of indoctrination,

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.200
it's very valuable.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.720
Well, if they're not
publicly supported,

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.340
how are universities
going to survive?

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:11.350
They don't produce
commodities for profit.

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:13.940
And that's the dominant
value under the New

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.080
Spirit of the Age.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.960
The funding issue raises
many troubling issues.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:25.210
These would not arise if
fostering independent thought

01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:28.630
and inquiry were
regarded as a public good

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:31.360
as during the
Enlightenment model,

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.230
that is, having intrinsic value.

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:37.650
The traditional ideal
of the universities

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:39.710
were flawed in practice.

01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:42.320
And there are major
attempts to change that.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.600
So crossing the
ocean, in Britain,

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.730
the right-wing government
is now challenging

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:53.770
what's been for centuries
called the Haldane Principle.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:55.440
It's a century
old principle that

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.970
barred government intrusion
into academic research.

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:02.920
Whether they'll succeed in
overturning it, I don't know.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.330
And well, there's
another kind of assault

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:10.130
on intellectual culture
that you can read about it

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:12.520
in this morning's newspapers.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.609
The Cameron government has
announced that it's not

01:08:16.609 --> 01:08:18.090
going to apologize.

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:20.970
It's not going to give an
apology for essentially

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:24.410
murdering one of the
great mathematicians

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:28.750
and scientists of the 20th
century, Alan Turing, who

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:32.540
apart from being a major
intellectual figure,

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.800
also happen to be a war hero.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.420
He was crucially involved
in decoding the German code,

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.399
something which saved Britain.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:45.770
They killed him, basically,
drove him to suicide.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.240
Cameron, the prime
minister, said

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.200
they're not going to apologize
because Turing broke the law.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.580
He was guilty of the
crime of homosexuality,

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.560
which is a violation of law.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.020
This should be a major scandal.

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.140
I mean, I don't know
how to describe it.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.510
But we'll see if it is.

01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:06.990
It isn't so far.

01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:10.770
Well, in the United
States, for say,

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:14.840
research institutions like
my own-- MIT-- the way

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.590
the problem was being
dealt with is by a shift

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:20.460
to more corporate funding.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.600
And that has several effects.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.180
First of all,
there's more emphasis

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.520
on short-term, applied work.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.979
Funding from, say, the
Pentagon, or the NIH,

01:09:31.979 --> 01:09:35.779
they're concerned with
the long-term future

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:38.090
of the advanced economy.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:42.250
That, incidentally, means
also the profitability

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.660
of the corporate
sector long afterwards.

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:47.300
So we develop computers
and the internet

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.810
for a couple of
decades, and it ends up

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:54.380
being profitable for the private
corporations that feed off it.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.570
That's the socializing costs,
privatizing profit principle.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:03.810
Well, that's government funding,
Pentagon funding, for example,

01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:07.130
very free, best funder there is.

01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:10.180
I was funded by them
for a long time.

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:14.540
In contrast, the
business firm typically

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:18.440
wants something it can use
and not its competitors.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.130
And it wants to be able
to use it tomorrow.

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:23.630
I don't know of a
careful study, but it

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:27.440
appears that the shift
towards corporate funding,

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.340
in fact, does lead to more
short-term applied research

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.690
and less exploration
of what might turn out

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:40.180
to be interesting and valuable
for the longer term future.

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.990
And another consequence
of the shift from, say,

01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:47.240
Pentagon funding to corporate
funding is more secrecy.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.160
During the Pentagon-funded
era at MIT--

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.530
I happened to be on a
faculty/student committee which

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:57.460
examined it carefully--
decades of Pentagon funding,

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.140
there was no secrecy on campus.

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:02.780
One exception was the
political science department.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.990
But in the sciences,
there was no secrecy.

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:10.690
Literally true, they were
involved in the Vietnam War.

01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:13.170
So none in the physics
department, engineering

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.180
department, and somewhere else.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.050
That's not true today.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:22.980
Corporate funders, they, of
course, cannot force secrecy.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.050
But they have an
indirect way of doing it.

01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:27.860
They can threaten
non-renewal of contracts.

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:31.110
That's led to some scandals,
some of them severe enough

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:34.200
to have landed on the front
page of the Wall Street Journal,

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.500
involving MIT.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.030
Corporatization can also
have a considerable influence

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.710
in other ways.

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:46.270
Corporations, by their nature,
focus on profit making.

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:47.630
That's what they're for.

01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:51.730
And they seek to convert
as much of life as possible

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:53.720
into commodities.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.600
There's a lot to say about
this topic and no time,

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:59.700
but one particular
consequence is the focus

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.080
on what's called "efficiency."

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.710
Efficiency is not a
simple economic concept.

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:09.540
It has quite crucial
ideological dimensions.

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.410
For example, if a business
reduces personnel,

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:17.930
it becomes more efficient
by standard measures

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:19.370
with lower cost.

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:23.220
But quite typically, that
shifts the burden to the public.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.410
It's a very familiar phenomenon.

01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:28.310
And the costs to the
public are not counted.

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:33.670
That's not a choice based on
economic theory, but ideology.

01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:36.270
And that applies directly
to the business models

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:38.360
for the university.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:44.050
Increasing class size and using
cheap, temporary labor instead

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:47.750
of full-time faculty, graduate
students, for example,

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:51.280
and other measures
like that may look good

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.540
on university budgets,
but significant costs

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.920
are transferred to the
students and to the society

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.252
generally as the quality
of instruction is affected.

01:13:02.252 --> 01:13:04.710
There's furthermore
no way to measure

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:10.980
the human and the social costs
of converting the schools

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:16.130
and universities into facilities
that produce commodities

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.040
for the job market.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:22.710
Abandoning the traditional
ideal of the universities,

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:25.560
encouraging creative
and independent thought

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.010
and inquiry, challenging
perceived beliefs,

01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:33.720
exploring the horizons free
of external constraints,

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.410
it's an ideal that's undoubtedly
been flawed in practice.

01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:40.650
But nevertheless, it is a
kind of a measure of the level

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:43.320
of civilization achieved.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:49.540
Well, there are related
consequences for the K to 12.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.660
There's a major assault on
the public schools underway.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:58.130
And the main reason is
the New Spirit of the Age.

01:13:58.130 --> 01:14:01.960
Public schools are based on
a very dangerous principle.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.360
They're based on the principle
that we care about one another.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.290
That's a violation of the
New Spirit of the Age.

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:13.430
Me, for example, I don't happen
to have kids in the schools

01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:14.970
anymore, obviously.

01:14:14.970 --> 01:14:16.800
So why should I pay taxes?

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.710
I mean, I'm not getting
anything out of it.

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:21.670
Therefore, let's get
rid of public schools

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:24.370
and just do things
for ourselves.

01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:28.960
The attack on Social Security
has pretty much the same root.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.090
It's based on the
principle that you're

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:36.110
supposed to care about the
disabled widow across town.

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:41.180
You're supposed to care she
doesn't have food to eat, see?

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:41.970
Why should I care?

01:14:41.970 --> 01:14:43.700
I'm doing fine.

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:46.330
There are various
pretexts offered,

01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:49.920
but they collapse very
quickly on examination.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.310
The real source of these attacks
on just humane public values

01:14:55.310 --> 01:15:00.030
and public goods, I think,
is the passionate effort

01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:04.840
to instill this hateful and
destructive principle, this New

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.160
Spirit of the Age,
going on for 150 years,

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.210
and long before that, the
attack on the commons,

01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:16.460
and instilling it
has enormous profits

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:22.020
to concentrated, private
power, very harmful,

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.490
and human effects.

01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:25.910
There's a related
campaign to destroy

01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:28.950
those parts of the
educational system that

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:32.130
enrich the lives of
students and enable

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:35.980
them to follow the
string that's laid out

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:39.390
for them in the enlightenment
vision of education.

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:42.100
That interferes
with indoctrination,

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.630
with control, with imposing
passivity and obedience,

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:50.720
with subordination to the
principle of caring only

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.310
about oneself.

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:53.900
A major struggle
about that right

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.020
here is-- you know
better than I do--

01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:59.680
the destruction of the
flourishing, Mexican-American

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.120
studies program.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.370
And even--

01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:13.450
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:17.000
--even the removal
from classrooms

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.970
of books that are
used in that program

01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:21.550
has become a national
scandal, incidentally.

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:24.850
Classics, like Paolo
Freire, the history

01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:27.690
of Chicanos in the Mexican
civil rights movement.

01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:34.980
It looks like we're
rethinking Columbus,

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.390
even Shakespeare's Tempest.

01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:40.440
This is all reminiscent
of precedents

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.390
that we don't like
to think about,

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:44.240
but they're worth
thinking about.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.940
And it's particularly dramatic
that it's happening right here

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:52.220
in the midst of what
could properly be called

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:55.490
"occupied Mexico" conqured in--

01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:57.350
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:05.665
We all know, and we
don't have to go into it,

01:17:05.665 --> 01:17:08.370
it was conquered in a
brutal war of aggression.

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:10.060
Well, I don't know
any simple answers

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:13.360
to the dilemmas that
constantly arise

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.600
in trying to develop and
sustain an educational system

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.310
of independence and
integrity, a one that strives

01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:26.290
for the Enlightenment ideal,
and to do this within societies

01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:29.620
that are dominated by
concentrations of power

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:32.410
with very different
values and goals.

01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:35.470
But at least one thing
seems clear enough--

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:40.050
efforts to do this cannot
progress very far in isolation

01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:44.420
from much broader struggles to
protect what has already been

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:48.280
achieved-- and a lot has
been achieved-- from severe,

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:53.290
ongoing attacks and to carry
them forward towards a world

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:55.954
of greater freedom and justice.

01:17:55.954 --> 01:17:56.942
Thanks.

01:17:56.942 --> 01:17:58.918
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:47.597 --> 01:18:48.263
Come over there?

01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:55.747
Should I go over there?

01:18:55.747 --> 01:18:56.247
Yeah.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.560
Thank you so much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:05.910
As we get ready for the question
and answer part of our program

01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:07.140
tonight, a reminder.

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.010
We only have about
30 minutes for this,

01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:14.700
and I can imagine a lot of
you, if you had, paper as I do,

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:17.940
would have a lot of notes
and a lot of questions

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.930
and a lot of comments
for Professor Chomsky.

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.730
So as we get into this
question and answer,

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:27.150
let me lay out some ground
rules, some housekeeping,

01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:28.390
if you will.

01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:31.040
We have two microphones
in the aisle.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.100
We'll alternate back and forth.

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:37.340
As Dr. Jones mentioned
at the beginning,

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.610
make sure you respect
others' opinions.

01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:44.400
We want a thoughtful and civil
discourse, as he talked about.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.320
There may be a few differences
of opinion in here.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.540
Also, the ground rules for this.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.840
We're not going to do
follow-up questions

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.700
from our people in the
audience because we want to get

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:57.670
as many questions as we can.

01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:00.760
So please try and
keep your questions

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.230
as succinct as possible.

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:05.210
And we'll get through
as many questions

01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:08.878
as we can in about the
next 30 minutes or so.

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.970
I should say, I
don't hear too well,

01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:18.270
so you may have to translate
the questions for me.

01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:18.733
Yeah.

01:20:18.733 --> 01:20:19.232
That's fine.

01:20:19.232 --> 01:20:21.298
Am I supposed to use this?

01:20:21.298 --> 01:20:22.636
Yeah.

01:20:22.636 --> 01:20:23.980
OK.

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:26.550
As you line up for
the questions--

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:29.250
and we will have
staff there-- I'm

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.600
going to ask the first question.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.960
I'm going to take moderator's
privilege here, if you will.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.750
Professor Chomsky, you
were talking about,

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:42.330
towards the end, corporate
influence, corporate funding,

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:46.170
and the idea that
the universities,

01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:50.790
in the corporate eyes, need
to turn out "commodities."

01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:54.080
MIT, your home institution,
now has a new program

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.100
called OpenCourseWare
that I know

01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:01.827
is getting a lot of
information given out about it.

01:21:01.827 --> 01:21:03.660
For those of you that
don't know what it is,

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:07.150
there are many forces at MIT
that the materials are now

01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:11.020
available free and
online for the public.

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.930
Talk about that a
little bit and how

01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:16.080
that may be going against
that corporate idea.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.940
I think it's-- actually, one
of my close friends is more

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.120
or less running it.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.677
But I think it's a
great idea, you know.

01:21:23.677 --> 01:21:25.756
And I think it's just
what ought to be done.

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:27.130
I mean, of course
that means it's

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:30.900
available on the internet, so
not only here, but everywhere.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:35.900
All over the world you could
hear leading scientists,

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:39.400
scholars, others, are
delivering their lectures.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.040
You can hear the
classroom interaction.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:49.270
I mean, it's not like taking a
course in a serious university,

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:51.870
because you're not part
of the interaction.

01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:55.406
Like, you can't stand up
and say, that's wrong.

01:21:55.406 --> 01:21:56.721
There's a better way to do it.

01:21:56.721 --> 01:21:57.220
You know?

01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:01.340
Which is a large part of
what real education is.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.390
It's supposed to encourage
independent thought.

01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:06.150
That means challenges.

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:09.200
And a lot of what we and
everybody else is teaching

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:13.270
is wrong, that's why you don't
teach the same thing every year

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:14.630
unless your field is dead.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.190
Because you're learning,
and a lot of learning

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:22.160
comes from what
students are doing.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:25.340
They're part of the
educational process.

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.620
And you don't interact
with other students.

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:30.660
I'm sure all of you know that--
just from your own experience--

01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:34.066
that what's enriched your
educational experience

01:22:34.066 --> 01:22:39.850
is peer interchange,
talking with other students,

01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:41.900
arguing about things,
trying to work things

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.080
out together, and so on.

01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:48.800
I'll take my own university
since I know it best,

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.930
but if you walk around the
floors of the departments,

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:54.540
students are talking
to each other,

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:58.550
working together,
writing joint papers.

01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:01.440
And a lot of very important
stuff comes out of that.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.030
Well, if you're
watching OpenCourseWare,

01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:05.630
you're not part of that.

01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:09.900
So it is necessarily
kind of passive.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.060
Actually, there are
efforts being made--

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:17.470
and it's tricky-- to develop
modes of more interaction.

01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:20.530
And it's not impossible,
but it's hard.

01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:22.890
And I hope that
it'll go to that.

01:23:22.890 --> 01:23:26.890
But the general idea
is great, I think.

01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:28.745
All right, I will
abide by our own rules

01:23:28.745 --> 01:23:32.590
and not ask a follow-up, as
badly as I would like to.

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:35.300
Let me start on this side.

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.540
And, again, let's
keep our questions

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.830
fairly short so we can get
through as many as we can.

01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:43.431
Hi, Professor Chomsky.

01:23:43.431 --> 01:23:45.180
The first thing I want
to say is thank you

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.890
for visiting the
University of Arizona

01:23:46.890 --> 01:23:48.190
and thank you for
such a great talk.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:48.689
Thanks.

01:23:48.689 --> 01:23:50.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.340
I wanted to ask about the
two documents you mentioned,

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:59.860
the Powell Memorandum and
the Trilateral Commission.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.870
Do you consider that the
major reason for the increase

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:04.000
in intuition?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.090
And what other factors
come into play?

01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:11.440
Well, I don't really know
of any study of this,

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.020
so I have to speculate.

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.300
It's kind of surprising that
there isn't-- as far as I

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.480
know-- there isn't any
study, because it's a major

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.160
phenomenon.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:23.100
But if you just look at the
timing and the thinking behind

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.680
it, and other things that are
happening in this society,

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:32.950
it's hard to doubt that the
concern about what they call

01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:37.510
on the liberal end "the
failure of the institutions

01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:41.590
to indoctrinate the
young"-- their phrase--

01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:46.040
the failure of this, which
showed up in the civilizing

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.700
effect of the '60s, it
was followed very shortly,

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:53.010
and not only by the beginning
of the rise in tuitions,

01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:56.930
but by lots of other things,
even university architecture.

01:24:56.930 --> 01:25:00.400
So university architecture
began to change.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.665
If you look at universities
that were built and designed--

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:05.040
this is world-wide,
incidentally.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.690
You know, Japan, United
States, everywhere--

01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:11.000
that are designed in
the '70s and the '80s,

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.310
they usually don't
have public places.

01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:17.370
They don't have anything
like Sproul Plaza in Berkeley

01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:21.870
where students get together
and have discussions,

01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:23.860
demonstrations, and so on.

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:26.180
So there are paths
from here to there,

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:31.600
but not places for
students to get together.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.950
That is conscious.

01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:35.230
I've talked to
architects about it.

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:37.640
And I suspect that the
same is true of tuitions.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.960
Actually, it's a
good topic to study.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:45.160
I don't know of any studies,
but it looks very plausible.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.930
Again, there can't be an
economic reason for it,

01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:50.950
for the reasons I mentioned.

01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:56.000
It's got to be an
ideological reason.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.510
Thanks for your question.

01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:58.890
Now I'll come over to this side.

01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:00.780
Thank you for coming,
Professor Chomsky.

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.570
I just wanted to ask,
I think a lot of us

01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:04.800
here are in that
group who would say

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.650
that education is for everyone.

01:26:06.650 --> 01:26:09.270
So in light of things
like No Child Left Behind

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:13.130
and the HB2281
Anti-Ethnic Studies,

01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:15.330
my question is about hope.

01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:17.240
Where should we
find inspiration,

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.300
a lot of us being
educators in here,

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:23.970
to kind of go forth
with hope for education?

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:28.776
Well, for one thing, there's--
take, let's say, Mexico.

01:26:28.776 --> 01:26:30.430
It's right nearby.

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:32.030
As I say, we're basically in it.

01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:33.150
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:33.680
The--

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.610
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:41.750
It's a poor country.

01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:45.600
It's not a rich country like us
for reasons that have something

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.390
to do with us, as you know.

01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:49.370
But anyway, it's a fact.

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:52.570
And what they do in the
higher education system

01:26:52.570 --> 01:26:54.340
is quite impressive.

01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:59.200
Actually, I should add that
this city college and city

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.150
university, open city university
in Mexico City, is not old.

01:27:04.150 --> 01:27:08.580
It was instituted
by Obrador when

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:13.280
he was the mayor, left-wing
mayor, of Mexico City.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.560
He started it and it's been
apparently flourishing since.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.310
As I say, that visited
and was pretty impressed.

01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:23.190
Things like that,
that's an inspiration.

01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:28.700
Or you can look at the student
movements over this hemisphere.

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:33.170
I mean, from Chile
up to here, in fact,

01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:37.080
there are very lively,
vibrant student movements.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.670
In Chile, it's amazing.

01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:42.300
It has just revitalized
the country.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:46.550
There's been student protests.

01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:51.320
Remember, this is protests
against the lingering effects

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:55.240
of the dictatorship
that we imposed

01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:00.809
on what in Latin America
is called The First 9/11.

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:02.850
It's kind of striking that
people here don't know

01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:05.210
what that means, most of them.

01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:10.230
But the first 9/11,
9/11/1973, by any dimension

01:28:10.230 --> 01:28:15.402
that I can think of was much
worse than what we call 9/11.

01:28:15.402 --> 01:28:17.394
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:18.888 --> 01:28:20.550
And not just in Chile.

01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:25.270
It had a very global effect.

01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:27.560
And the dictatorship
has formally

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:30.460
been gone for about
20 years, but there

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:34.080
are lingering effects,
just as there are in Spain.

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.990
There are lingering effects
of the Franco dictatorship

01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:38.300
right now.

01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:41.350
And the young people protesting
there, the Indignados,

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:44.430
as they're called, are
trying to undermine

01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:47.800
the very serious lingering
effects of the dictatorship.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.100
They're very real.

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:50.470
Well, that's Chile.

01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:52.482
And there are similar
things going on

01:28:52.482 --> 01:28:53.440
through the hemisphere.

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.106
In fact, abroad.

01:28:54.106 --> 01:28:55.360
And, in fact, right here.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:04.260
The protests about the
destruction of the Mexican

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.300
Studies program, for example.

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.200
It's important.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.830
And teachers are organizing.

01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:14.810
And they're under a lot
of pressure, you know?

01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:17.200
Tremendous pressures against
public school teachers.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.600
You speak up, you're
thrown out, and so on.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.620
But it doesn't mean that
people are taking it passively.

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:24.640
There are efforts to respond.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.100
There are journals where
people are writing about it.

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:31.270
And there are the
struggles of the past.

01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:33.216
After all, we've achieved a lot.

01:29:33.216 --> 01:29:34.590
You know, this
country isn't what

01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:38.340
it was 30 years ago or
a hundred years ago.

01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:43.750
There's a lot more freedom,
justice, rights, and so on.

01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:46.930
Again, take my own
university, but it

01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:48.790
generalizes over the country.

01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:54.780
If you walk down the halls at
MIT when I got there, 1950s,

01:29:54.780 --> 01:30:02.170
you would have seen white males,
well-dressed, very passive,

01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:07.470
very conformist, doing
their work often very well,

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:10.020
but that's it.

01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:12.420
That was the Institute.

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.970
If you work down
the halls today,

01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:20.180
it looks like this-- half
women, a third minorities,

01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:26.680
informal dress-- which
symbolizes informal relations--

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:29.455
and a lot of
concerns and activism

01:30:29.455 --> 01:30:31.230
of all sorts of things.

01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:33.371
It didn't happen by magic.

01:30:33.371 --> 01:30:35.620
It's happened all over the
country, and, in many ways,

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.940
all over the world.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:39.520
And that's the
kind of inspiration

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.270
that ought to suffice.

01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:46.290
I think it goes back to the
early days, the very earliest

01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:48.822
days, as far back as you
want to trace it in history.

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.348
Thank you.

01:30:52.348 --> 01:30:53.752
Over on this side now.

01:30:53.752 --> 01:30:56.080
Hi, I'm Denise from Chicago.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.520
First, I just want to thank the
intergenerational audience that

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.440
came tonight.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:04.480
From where I stand,
it's so exciting,

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.780
especially seeing all
the young people here.

01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:09.840
So thank you to both of
you for bringing that out.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:13.420
Two, I'd like to invite you,
Professor Chomsky, and anyone

01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.780
here to Chicago
May 19, a concert

01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:20.580
for troubadour Woody Guthrie,
who emulates many of the themes

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:22.600
that you talked about tonight.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:26.130
And you could find info on
the Illinois Labor History web

01:31:26.130 --> 01:31:29.432
page, who holds the deed
for the Haymarket Martyrs.

01:31:29.432 --> 01:31:30.390
Do you have a question?

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:33.690
The question, what do you
think of the super PAC

01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:36.430
and the decision by the
Obama administration

01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:41.090
to get into it with the--
you talked about lobbying,

01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:45.970
and now they've made the
decision to enter that fight.

01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:50.250
It's obviously a
sell-out, but not

01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:52.320
the first one, incidentally.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:57.650
On the other hand, there
is an institutional fact

01:31:57.650 --> 01:32:01.260
that political figures
just have to live with.

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:06.640
The structure of election,
the electoral system,

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.570
has been shredded.

01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:12.000
I mean, it always
was under the effect

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.440
of-- there's always a big
effect of campaign spending.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:19.170
If you want to learn about
it, the best work that's done

01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:23.800
is by a political economist
named Thomas Ferguson, who's

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.760
a personal friend.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:29.890
But he has a book called
Golden Rule, which goes back

01:32:29.890 --> 01:32:36.480
a century studying in detail
the effect of campaign spending,

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.330
not only on who's elected, but
on what their programs are.

01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:44.510
It goes right through the New
Deal right up to the present.

01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:46.500
He's extended it since.

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.250
And I think it's
pretty convincing.

01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:51.840
It's what he calls the
investment theory of politics.

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:57.620
It treats elections as occasions
in which groups of investors

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:01.550
coalesce to invest
to control the state.

01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:05.614
Campaign funding is
one standard mechanism.

01:33:05.614 --> 01:33:07.030
And it doesn't
explain everything,

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:10.640
it doesn't pretend that is does,
but it explains quite a lot.

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:14.400
Now, that's changed radically
in the last 30 years.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.530
The last 30 years, part of
this whole basically neoliberal

01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:21.340
assault on democracy
and justice-- and that's

01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:22.140
what it is.

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:24.820
It's worldwide, but
here, too-- part of it

01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:29.890
has just been the sharply
rising cost of elections.

01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:33.000
And now, especially
since Citizens United

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.480
in the Super PACs, it's
gone through the roof.

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.940
But it's been going
up steadily, and it

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.980
has a very definite effect.

01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:44.890
It forces political
figures into the pockets

01:33:44.890 --> 01:33:48.640
of those who have the money--
the private corporate sector.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.650
It's increasingly
financial institutions.

01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:55.640
Incidentally, that's not only
true of the president running

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.160
for office or Congress
running for office,

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.020
it's even permeated
the Congress.

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:05.590
I mean, it used to be the
case that if positions

01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:12.120
of some authority or
prestige in Congress,

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.960
say, chair of an
important committee, that

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:18.380
used to be the result of
seniority and service.

01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:22.300
By now, literally
you have to buy it.

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:26.000
You have to pay money
into the party coffers

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.250
in order to qualify for
a chair of a committee.

01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:34.720
Well, you can guess what the
effects of that are, obviously.

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.880
And this has been
enormously changed

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.420
by Citizens United
in the Super PACs,

01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:43.270
but it's a process
that's always been there.

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:45.410
Actually, you go
back a century, there

01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:50.650
was a great, famous campaign
financier, the most famous

01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:52.890
of the era, Mark Hanna.

01:34:52.890 --> 01:34:57.950
He was once asked, what are the
important things in politics?

01:34:57.950 --> 01:35:00.080
And his answer
was he said, well,

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.560
I can think of three
things that are important.

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.590
The first one is money.

01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:07.420
The second one is money.

01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:11.040
And I've forgotten
what the third one is.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.820
That was over a century ago, and
it's gotten a lot more extreme.

01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.210
So, yeah, this is a
sell-out on Obama's part,

01:35:18.210 --> 01:35:21.550
but if he wants to run in a
multibillion dollar election,

01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:23.490
you don't have a lot of choices.

01:35:23.490 --> 01:35:27.110
It's the system that's
rotten at the core, and not

01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:28.982
the choice of the individuals.

01:35:28.982 --> 01:35:30.946
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:39.400
Good question.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.050
Thank you, Professor Chomsky.

01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:43.520
I'm a student from
South Korea, and thank

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.480
you a lot for your writing
for the Village of Gangjeong

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.580
in Jeju Island.

01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:51.620
It suffers a lot from the
military base construction.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:55.440
But I just want more of
your opinion about the tax

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:57.790
expenditures on the
military expenditures

01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:59.380
instead of education.

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:02.560
For instance, Korean
students are suffering a lot

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.870
from the actual
increasing of tuition.

01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:08.010
And almost we are heading
towards the same way

01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:11.275
American students are being,
but still the government

01:36:11.275 --> 01:36:14.750
is expending lots of money
on the military instead

01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:17.820
of educating people
for better humanity.

01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:18.590
Yeah.

01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:22.470
Actually, that Jeju Island
construction that you mentioned

01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:23.860
is something very significant.

01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.370
We ought to know about it.

01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:30.060
Jeju island is quite
significant for Korea.

01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:36.490
It was the site of a
huge massacre in 1948

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:41.400
by the US-backed mostly
basically fascist state

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.490
in South Korea.

01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:44.300
Horrible massacre.

01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:48.960
And the island, it's been,
actually, designated,

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.100
I think by the UN, as
an island of peace.

01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:54.890
It's trying to be
an island of peace.

01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:57.770
And the US and South
Korea are building--

01:36:57.770 --> 01:37:02.420
trying to build a major military
base, a major naval base,

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:06.650
on the island oriented
towards China.

01:37:06.650 --> 01:37:11.170
I think it's 500 kilometers
from China, proximately.

01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:16.270
And it's part of the kind
of encirclement of China,

01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:20.510
which is called
containment of China.

01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:22.720
Here it's described
as protection

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.980
of freedom of the seas.

01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:26.960
The Chinese see it a
little differently.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.080
There see it the
way we would see it

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.515
if the Chinese navy was
building bases in the Caribbean.

01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:38.750
We'd blow them off the
planet if they did that.

01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:41.467
But the way the world
is supposed to work,

01:37:41.467 --> 01:37:43.300
we're supposed to be
able to do it anywhere.

01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:48.390
In fact, if you read the
professional literature

01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:51.320
and strategic analysis,
security studies,

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:54.130
they refer to the
Chinese/American

01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:59.170
naval confrontation as a
classic security dilemma.

01:37:59.170 --> 01:38:02.210
Each of the two sides
thinks that there's

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:04.186
kind of an existential danger.

01:38:04.186 --> 01:38:05.310
They just can't give it up.

01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:06.860
It's too important.

01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:10.340
So we think that it's
an existential threat

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:13.280
if the United States
doesn't control

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.740
all the oceans around China.

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:17.980
And they think it's
an existential threat

01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:24.720
if we send nuclear
arms super carriers

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.720
into their territorial waters.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.280
That's the security
dilemma, you know?

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.540
What can you do?

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:33.690
And in fact, the
US is trying hard

01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:38.880
to essentially encircle China
so that they can't have access

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:44.000
to the Pacific or to the Malacca
Straits, where a lot of trade

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.400
goes and so on.

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:49.070
Japan is part of this system.

01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:50.810
Japan's a client state.

01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:56.520
There's military bases all over
Japan, many of them on Okinawa.

01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.320
This is over the
strong objections

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.470
of the people of
Okinawa, who've been

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:07.240
trying to get those
bases off for 60 years,

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.950
and they can't do it.

01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:13.800
Recently the US basically forced
a Japanese prime minister out

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.050
of office because he
was thinking about it.

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:20.920
Well, Jeju Island in South
Korea's another case.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:23.240
And it's really serious,
and an important issue.

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.550
There's a lot of
protest on the island,

01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:29.960
civil disobedience, a lot of
arrests, violence, and so on.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.860
But your general
point is quite right.

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:34.780
I mean, the vast
military expenditures

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:39.280
are part of the-- I don't
think they're the main reason.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.890
We had vast military
expenditures in the '50s,

01:39:41.890 --> 01:39:46.102
and it still was
almost free education.

01:39:46.102 --> 01:39:48.310
And for GI Bill, totally free.

01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:51.745
And huge amounts of money
going into the research system

01:39:51.745 --> 01:39:52.800
and so on.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:55.480
And now it's a
burden, undoubtedly,

01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:02.650
but I don't-- society has to
decide where you want to spend

01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:03.456
your money.

01:40:03.456 --> 01:40:06.660
Do you want to spend
it on classic security

01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:09.370
dilemmas in China's
territorial waters

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:11.370
with all the debt
that would lead

01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:15.180
to building naval bases on
Jeju Island and on Okinawa

01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:17.040
and so on, or do
you want to spend

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.890
it building a decent society?

01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:22.400
And this question arises
all across the board.

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.350
I mean, one of the
most striking cases--

01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:28.440
is doesn't involve
education, but it

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:35.850
does involve survival-- is the
Canadian tar sands and shale

01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:40.560
oil throughout the country.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.530
In Obama's State of
the Nation Address,

01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:47.190
if you read it carefully,
one of the things he said

01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:50.790
was that we're now coming
to a position where

01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:54.810
we can have a hundred years
of energy independence

01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:59.170
by exploiting-- using
high-technology techniques

01:40:59.170 --> 01:41:02.720
and fracking and so
on, to get previously

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.410
inaccessible, and
incidentally very dirty,

01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:10.900
oil, with all sorts of local
environmental consequences.

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:13.050
And this is all over.

01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:16.200
There was a recent
speech by the President

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.160
of the Chamber of Commerce,
main business Lobby-- I forgot.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:22.620
It's Thomas Corcoran, I think.

01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:24.190
You can find it in the internet.

01:41:24.190 --> 01:41:27.190
It's his annual speech
to the business world,

01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:29.050
and the first point
that he mentions,

01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:32.530
the most important point,
is that we can now move to,

01:41:32.530 --> 01:41:36.380
he says, several centuries
of energy independence

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:39.390
by just tapping our own oil.

01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:43.150
You go to the most responsible
and serious newspaper

01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:46.990
in the world that I know of,
the London Financial Times,

01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:52.790
they devote a whole full page
to a euphoric description

01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:56.070
of the possibility
of the United States

01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:58.750
having a century of
energy independence

01:41:58.750 --> 01:42:04.530
and a century of global hegemony
by tapping these resources.

01:42:04.530 --> 01:42:06.730
There's only one small footnote.

01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:09.300
If we use those
resources, we're finished.

01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:10.230
You know?

01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:11.935
There's no future
for your children

01:42:11.935 --> 01:42:13.410
and your grandchildren.

01:42:13.410 --> 01:42:15.350
That's not discussed.

01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:19.320
You got to gain wealth
forgetting all but self.

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.061
And that means my
profits tomorrow,

01:42:22.061 --> 01:42:26.600
not what happens 30 years
from now to my grandchildren.

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:27.170
And that's--

01:42:27.170 --> 01:42:29.034
[APPLAUSE]

01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:38.140
Meanwhile, you know, there are
alternatives like, ultimately,

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.230
probably solar energy's going
to be the main alternative.

01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:43.020
And it's quite
striking to see what's

01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:48.200
happening to the solar
energy industry that by now,

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:51.320
about half the
world's solar panels

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.480
are being produced in China.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:56.180
Now, that's not cheap labor.

01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.970
It's not a
labor-intensive industry.

01:42:58.970 --> 01:43:02.990
They started the way all
manufacturing starts,

01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:05.560
very low-level manufacturing.

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:10.040
Manufacturing provides
the incentive, the ideas,

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.140
the design conceptions,
and so on that lead

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:17.820
to technological advances.

01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:19.030
Very common.

01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:21.450
And slowly they've
been-- not so slowly,

01:43:21.450 --> 01:43:24.570
they've been moving up the
high-technology ladder.

01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:27.660
They're now producing the
most advanced solar cells

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:28.900
in the world.

01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:32.065
Well, OK, that's one way
to use your resources.

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.550
We have choices.

01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:38.300
We have plenty of
choices, because we're

01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:39.900
a very rich society.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.480
China's a very poor society.

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:46.360
We're a very rich one, so
we have plenty of options.

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.080
We have about 10
minutes left, so thank

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.060
you so much for keeping
your questions short so

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:51.430
we can get through as many--

01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:53.220
That means I should
keep my answers short.

01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:53.720
I got it.

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.587
[LAUGHTER]

01:43:55.587 --> 01:43:56.670
You're the guest of honor.

01:43:56.670 --> 01:43:58.240
You can answer as
long as you like.

01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:58.740
Yeah.

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:03.420
Hello, Dr. Chomsky.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.975
I'm a member of Unidos.

01:44:04.975 --> 01:44:06.790
And our question is--

01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:08.320
[CHEERING]

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.180
In your opinion, what are
the larger implications

01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.700
of the decision by the TUSD
governing board and state

01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:15.664
superintendent John
Huppenthal to ban

01:44:15.664 --> 01:44:16.705
Mexican American Studies?

01:44:19.582 --> 01:44:24.110
Well, I think it's a
particularly ugly part

01:44:24.110 --> 01:44:30.250
of the whole attack on
anything like the enlightenment

01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:33.230
ideal of education.

01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:38.400
In this case, to destroy
the diversity of richness

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.550
of the educational system and
meaningfulness for students

01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:46.090
and so on, for a large
number of students.

01:44:46.090 --> 01:44:48.990
After all, it's a big
Mexican community.

01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:51.280
So I think it's just part
of the general attack

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.770
on a free and creative
education that

01:44:56.770 --> 01:45:03.410
stimulates learning, discovery,
enriching one's life and so on.

01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:09.200
And it's trying to impose
indoctrination and conformity.

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:12.417
A particularly ugly
case right here

01:45:12.417 --> 01:45:13.750
because of where it's happening.

01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:17.325
It would be ugly anywhere,
but it's particularly so right

01:45:17.325 --> 01:45:17.824
here.

01:45:20.261 --> 01:45:20.760
Thank you.

01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:23.100
Back to this side.

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:26.480
Professor Chomsky,
I believe I speak

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.850
on behalf of almost
everyone here,

01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:31.620
it's an absolute
humbling honor to be

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.880
learning from you in person.

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:34.864
Thank you.

01:45:34.864 --> 01:45:36.832
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:44.350
I'm an Iranian-American
peace and human rights

01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:47.560
and environmental
activist, and I'm

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:51.650
a participant in
Iran's Green Movement,

01:45:51.650 --> 01:45:58.430
a supporter of the Arab Spring
Movements against dictatorship.

01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:02.730
And obviously I'm a
passionate participant

01:46:02.730 --> 01:46:06.910
in the Occupy Movement
in this country, which

01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:12.170
I believe has already
awakened incredible energy,

01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:20.140
and therefore I am
hopeful, but also fearful

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:28.320
of what it may do wrong
in order to possibly waste

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.550
this last chance movement.

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:35.050
So please share with
us your wisdom about

01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:38.670
what is it that you think,
at this point in history,

01:46:38.670 --> 01:46:45.770
the Occupy Movement needs to
be wary of or be careful about?

01:46:45.770 --> 01:46:48.360
Well, like you, I think
the Occupy Movement

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.310
has been quite a
remarkable success, way

01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:53.440
beyond what I thought.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:59.410
And the tactic has been very
effective for a lot of reasons.

01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:03.120
One effect that it's
had is just changing

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.170
kind of national discourse.

01:47:05.170 --> 01:47:07.320
In fact, even the
terminology and imagery

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.890
of the Occupy Movement is
now sort of mainstream.

01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:17.090
It's focused attention on
serious problems-- inequality;

01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:20.210
like somebody asked before,
the purchase of elections;

01:47:20.210 --> 01:47:24.570
shredding of democracy;
the extraordinary power

01:47:24.570 --> 01:47:27.900
of financial institutions
which probably

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:30.850
contribute very little, if
anything, to the economy.

01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:36.320
In fact, the most respected
financial commentator

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.050
in the world, I
think, Martin Wolf

01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:43.030
of the Financial Times in
London is very conservative,

01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:45.070
highly respected correspondent.

01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:47.480
He describes the
financial institutions

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.530
that have developed
in the last 30 years

01:47:49.530 --> 01:47:55.580
as kind of like a larvae that
destroys the host in which it's

01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:56.408
embedded.

01:47:56.408 --> 01:47:57.720
[LAUGHTER]

01:47:58.220 --> 01:47:59.964
[APPLAUSE]

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:03.782
I couldn't get away with
saying that, but he can.

01:48:03.782 --> 01:48:05.240
And I can get away
with quoting it.

01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:11.230
And the Occupy Movement
has directed attention

01:48:11.230 --> 01:48:13.860
to foreclosures,
homelessness, a lot

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:16.770
of problems that were there
but were kind of buried.

01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:20.190
Another major contribution
it's made, in my opinion,

01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:27.490
is just overcoming the
atomization of the Society.

01:48:27.490 --> 01:48:30.340
The United States is a
very atomized society.

01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:31.910
People are kind of alone.

01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:35.990
You know, the ideal social
unit, from the point

01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:41.020
of view of concentrated
power, is a dyad.

01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:44.730
You and the screen,
nothing else.

01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:47.980
That's a way to make sure
that everybody's conforming.

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:49.425
And there's a lot of that.

01:48:49.425 --> 01:48:51.330
You know, children.

01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:55.140
It's a real disease,
a pathology.

01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:57.130
And the Occupy
Movement's overcoming it.

01:48:57.130 --> 01:49:01.100
It's creating,
spontaneously, communities

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:06.870
of people who actually are
reviving traditional ideals.

01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:10.670
I mean, if there were any real
conservatives in the country,

01:49:10.670 --> 01:49:13.210
they'd be applauding
the fact that they're

01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:18.530
reviving the concepts of
solidarity, mutual support,

01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:21.420
sympathy, free
discussion, and so

01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:25.990
on that are just the most
traditional values we have.

01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:28.120
There's been major
efforts to destroy them,

01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:32.820
and that's being revived in the
communities of mutual support

01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.790
and solidarity that
are being created.

01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:37.130
Well, all of this is
really important, I think.

01:49:37.130 --> 01:49:39.570
But now, where do
you go from here?

01:49:39.570 --> 01:49:43.300
Well, first of all,
I don't regard myself

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:46.220
as any kind of an
expert on tactics.

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:49.580
I've been wrong so many
times on tactical judgments

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:50.705
that I usually shut up.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.970
And these are
important judgments.

01:49:56.970 --> 01:49:58.510
Tactical judgments
are those that

01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:02.960
have direct human consequences,
so they're not marginal.

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:07.690
But my general feeling
is that tactics

01:50:07.690 --> 01:50:10.610
have a kind of a half-life.

01:50:10.610 --> 01:50:13.440
They have diminishing returns.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:18.420
They may be very successful,
but it sort of declines.

01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:24.350
After a while, there's kind of
a dynamism in which the tactic

01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:28.070
begins to overcome
the purpose, apart

01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:30.610
from beginning to
alienate other people who

01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:32.370
you're trying to reach.

01:50:32.370 --> 01:50:35.150
So while I think that
the Occupy tactic has

01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:39.860
been a great success, I
think it has to be rethought,

01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:44.820
and moves have to be
made somehow to reach out

01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.692
into larger communities.

01:50:46.692 --> 01:50:51.650
Now, that's been going on in
a number of interesting ways.

01:50:51.650 --> 01:50:54.800
Like one of the developments
in several cities,

01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:56.880
I know in New York and
Boston and elsewhere,

01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:00.410
has been what's been
called Occupy The Hood.

01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:04.450
Neighborhood Occupy Movements,
which have, to some extent,

01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:09.730
integrated with the ones that
make the newspapers, Occupy

01:51:09.730 --> 01:51:12.700
Wall Street, occupy your
neighborhood in Brooklyn.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:14.790
Occupy other things.

01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:18.370
And those deal with
the immediate problems

01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:20.220
of the local people.

01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:23.684
And they can be very serious.

01:51:23.684 --> 01:51:25.100
I mean, it could
be something that

01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:29.600
sounds as simple as getting
a traffic light where

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.540
kids have to cross the street.

01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:34.400
I mean, if people
can achieve that,

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:37.460
they learn you can achieve
something by mutual aid

01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:39.390
and you can go on.

01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:42.070
That's what successful
organizing is about.

01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:46.880
And if the Occupy Movements
can go in that direction,

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:50.660
reach out to larger
sections of the population

01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:53.680
and engage the
working class, which

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.000
they have yet really to do,
and that's very significant,

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.090
then I think they
have great prospects.

01:52:00.090 --> 01:52:01.660
But it's not easy to do this.

01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:05.500
And we have a lot of repression,
violent repression sometimes,

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:09.910
and power systems don't
fade away cheerfully.

01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:13.040
They'll do what they
can to control things,

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:16.250
but I think that David
Hume was correct--

01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:19.640
"power is in the hands
of the governed."

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:23.880
There's nothing-- there's no
weapon that the powerful have

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:26.090
other than control of opinion.

01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:28.880
Attitudes, opinions,
beliefs, if they

01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.090
can make people feel hopeless,
dependent, passive, atomized,

01:52:34.090 --> 01:52:36.000
OK, then you can keep power.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.660
But the governed,
that is the 99%

01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:44.120
in the imagery of the Occupy
Movement, they have the power.

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:47.700
But they have to get
organized, committed.

01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:50.850
And that's the task
of people who want

01:52:50.850 --> 01:52:54.090
to devote themselves to this.

01:52:54.090 --> 01:52:56.010
[APPLAUSE]

01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:03.970
We have time for
one final question.

01:53:03.970 --> 01:53:06.560
It will come from this side.

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.580
Hi, Dr. Chomsky.

01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:10.570
I met you first with
Daniel Berrigan.

01:53:10.570 --> 01:53:11.640
It's a long time ago.

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:16.030
But anyway, getting back to
your specific expertise in

01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:18.250
linguistics.

01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:22.970
It's been troublesome to me
that the media will use words

01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:27.160
like "socialism,"
"class warfare,"

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:30.450
but we never hear "fascism."

01:53:30.450 --> 01:53:35.870
And from my studies of ideology,
state-supported capitalism,

01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:40.690
pretty much what you've been
talking about, is fascism.

01:53:40.690 --> 01:53:43.530
I know words have power,
and you know that, too.

01:53:43.530 --> 01:53:50.230
Are we too shy to talk about
what basically almost brought

01:53:50.230 --> 01:53:53.660
the end of mankind
in the last century?

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:56.260
Or is it just the
media controls and you

01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:59.720
have to go to Link
TV or Democracy Now

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.230
or-- I don't know.

01:54:01.230 --> 01:54:04.340
But they are not supported.

01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:08.650
They have to be supported
by people donating to them.

01:54:08.650 --> 01:54:12.500
Isn't anyone aware?

01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:16.940
Well, the history of that
word is kind of interesting.

01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:22.810
Fascism obviously took on bad
connotations in the 1940s.

01:54:22.810 --> 01:54:24.677
But if you go back--
and, incidentally,

01:54:24.677 --> 01:54:26.010
the same is true of other words.

01:54:26.010 --> 01:54:27.880
Like take "propaganda."

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:32.140
The term "propaganda" now
is not used for information.

01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:33.080
In English.

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.430
It still is in other languages.

01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:39.270
If you go back to the
1920s, information

01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:41.050
was just called propaganda.

01:54:41.050 --> 01:54:43.310
Like Edward Bernays,
who I mentioned,

01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:47.170
the founder of the public
relations industry,

01:54:47.170 --> 01:54:50.420
the book of his from which
I was quoting on engineering

01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:52.870
of consent and controlling
the masses and so on

01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:54.630
is called Propaganda.

01:54:54.630 --> 01:54:56.520
Propaganda is just
what you do when

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:58.900
you try to control
beliefs and attitudes.

01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:02.190
Well, since the
1930s and the '40s,

01:55:02.190 --> 01:55:07.530
you can't use that term anymore
for its obvious connotations.

01:55:07.530 --> 01:55:09.770
Fascism is a very
interesting one.

01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:11.360
And we can learn a
lot about ourselves

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:14.120
from looking at its history.

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.000
Before the Second World War,
before the United States

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.300
got into the Second
World War, 1941,

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:25.970
fascism was not regarded
particularly critically.

01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:28.830
In fact, there's a
very important book

01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:32.510
I urge you to read if you
haven't called Business

01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:36.750
as a System of Power, by one of
the great political economists,

01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:40.160
Robert Brady, a
Veblen economist.

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:43.680
It's about the spread of fascism
through the industrial world.

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:46.580
He points out that
in every country, all

01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.990
the industrial countries,
there are developments

01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:54.630
of basically fascist character.

01:55:54.630 --> 01:55:59.045
And he discusses them, and,
perfectly understandable,

01:55:59.045 --> 01:56:02.230
he was quite right, in fact.

01:56:02.230 --> 01:56:05.240
There's nothing inherent
in fascism that says

01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:07.170
you have to have gas chambers.

01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:10.120
That's a special
thing that developed.

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.250
And in fact, say
Mussolini's fascism

01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:16.500
was very highly-regarded
in the United States.

01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:18.820
Remember, that's pre-Nazi.

01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:25.130
So FDR, Franklin Roosevelt,
President Roosevelt,

01:56:25.130 --> 01:56:30.560
he described Mussolini as "that
admirable Italian gentleman."

01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:36.780
I mean, as late as 1939 he
was praising Mussolini saying,

01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:39.400
well, he's been kind
of misled by Hitler,

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:42.130
but basically doing
the right thing.

01:56:42.130 --> 01:56:46.030
And when fascism was
instituted in Italy,

01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:51.300
and it was pretty ugly, it
was praised across the board

01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:53.190
in the United States.

01:56:53.190 --> 01:56:55.260
Business Investment shot up.

01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:57.080
It also did after
Hitler came in.

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:02.850
Fortune magazine, the
main business journal,

01:57:02.850 --> 01:57:06.790
had an issue in, I think, 1932.

01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:10.860
The title, you look at
the front page cover,

01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:15.580
big letters it says "The Wops
are Unwopping Themselves,"

01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:18.800
meaning the wops are finally
doing something right.

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:22.070
You know, they've got a fascist
government, which works,

01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:23.810
and we like that.

01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:27.100
People on the left
were praising it.

01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:29.540
Same with Nazism.

01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:36.070
I mean, as late as 1938,
Roosevelt's main advisor,

01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:40.370
Sumner Welles, went to
the Munich Conference.

01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:44.430
That's the conference which
tore up Czechoslovakia.

01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:51.380
And he came back full of
praise for the Nazi moderates,

01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:56.170
who were going to help us
usher in a new era of peace.

01:57:56.170 --> 01:58:01.080
They're the moderates kind of
protecting civilized values

01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:03.820
from the extremists of the
right and left and so on.

01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:08.010
I mean, George Kennan, who's
very much honored and respected

01:58:08.010 --> 01:58:10.760
now-- there's a major
biography that just came out

01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:14.590
full of praise-- if you take
a look at his actual record,

01:58:14.590 --> 01:58:21.510
he was the American Consul
in Berlin right through 1941.

01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:24.050
He was withdrawn, Pearl Harbor.

01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:28.470
And he was sending back
diplomatic correspondence

01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:30.530
to Washington
saying, you shouldn't

01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:32.680
be so hard on the Nazis.

01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:36.597
They're doing some things
wrong, but basically we

01:58:36.597 --> 01:58:37.680
can do business with them.

01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.770
They're the right
kind of people.

01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:42.420
Well, a couple of years later,
you couldn't talk about fascism

01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.310
that way.

01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:47.690
Fascism meant crematoria, you
know, gas chambers, and so on.

01:58:47.690 --> 01:58:49.660
So you stopped using the word.

01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:51.160
But your point is correct.

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:55.510
As a social and political
order, Robert Brady

01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:57.210
knew what he was talking about.

01:58:57.210 --> 01:59:01.310
There are elements of this
kind of state capitalist order

01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:06.000
all over the industrial
world taking different forms.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:06.500
Thank you.

01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:08.374
Well, thank you all for
all of your questions

01:59:08.374 --> 01:59:09.820
and for your attention.

01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.020
[APPLAUSE]

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.870
[MUSIC PLAYING]
