00:00:00.673 --> 00:00:02.076
In this and the next few videos

00:00:02.076 --> 00:00:03.874
we're going to be
studying something called

00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:06.333
"aggregate supply" and "aggregate demand."

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.405
Actually, we're going to start

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:08.207
with aggregate demand

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:10.739
and then start talking
about aggregate supply.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.075
We're going to think
about aggregate demand

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:16.343
and aggregate, I'll rewrite the word,

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:19.618
aggregate supply.

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:20.810
What I really want to emphasize

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.403
in this video is in a lot of ways,

00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:23.990
it's going to look similar to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.078
traditional supply and demand,

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:26.621
but I want to emphasize that there's

00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:28.207
a very big difference between

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:30.957
aggregate demand and traditional demand

00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:33.207
in a microeconomic context.

00:00:33.207 --> 00:00:34.959
Aggregate supply in a macroeconomic

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:38.469
context and just regular supply

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.468
in a microeconomic context.

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:41.606
To think about that,

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.803
let's go to the micro version.

00:00:43.803 --> 00:00:46.142
These are macroeconomics

00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:47.933
so we're looking at economy as a whole.

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.472
These are macro ideas.

00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:52.455
To make that comparison,

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:54.124
let's revisit the micro-,

00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:56.447
the microeconomics ideas of

00:00:56.447 --> 00:00:57.199
supply and demand.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.046
To do that, we can focus on

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.454
a particular market.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:03.019
Maybe it's the market for candy bars,

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.834
so this is the market for candy bars.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:07.813
We've seen this many, many, many times,

00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:08.994
this is most of what we were doing

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:10.804
when we were studying microeconomics.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.991
On the vertical axis, we would

00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:14.860
plot the price per unit from

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.584
the candy bar and the horizontal axis

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:19.482
you would have the quantity bought or sold

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:22.286
in the given amount of time.

00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:23.940
We saw that the demand curve

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.859
tended to be downward sloping,

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.949
it would look something like that.

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:30.067
There was multiple ways to interpret this.

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:32.806
One way to interpret this at a high price,

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:35.697
people would say, "Why should I buy this

00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:36.794
candy bar? I could buy other things

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:38.531
with that money that would make me

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.863
just as happy or happier."

00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:42.447
So they would purchase
a low quantity of it.

00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:46.026
At a low price, this is a low price

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:47.023
right over here, people say,

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.325
"This is a pretty good deal. I can get

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:50.008
candy bars, they're so cheap,

00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:51.280
I can buy a bunch of them.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.610
Instead of buying other
things, instead of buying

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.523
lollipops and ice cream,
I'll buy candy bars,"

00:01:55.523 --> 00:01:57.530
then they'll buy a high quantity of it.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.590
So that's one way to interpret it.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.614
The other way to interpret it was

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.393
as essentially as a
marginal benefit curve.

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:03.867
That very first few units of candy bars

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:06.095
to get produced, there's someone there

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:08.114
who just loves candy bars so much

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:09.647
there's a high willingness to pay for it.

00:02:09.647 --> 00:02:11.854
There's a high benefit
for those first few units.

00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:13.719
As you have more and more units,

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.522
the incremental benefit to the market

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:16.609
gets less and less.

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.153
You can view as they are people who

00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:20.446
still like candy bars, but not as much

00:02:20.446 --> 00:02:22.658
as the people who bought
those first few units.

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:26.514
That is why you have a
downward sloping curve.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.595
When we think about aggregate demand,

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:30.985
it's going to look very similar,

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:33.590
but the idea is a good bit different.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.650
I'll do it in a different color

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.153
to show that it's different.

00:02:38.153 --> 00:02:39.320
Now we're in the macro version.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.067
We're talking about aggregate demand.

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:44.180
Aggregate demand.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.665
The first thing to realize is we're

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.852
talking about aggregate demand.

00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:47.733
We're going to be thinking about

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:48.612
the economy as a whole.

00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:49.717
We're not just thinking about

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:52.191
the market for just one good or service.

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.936
In aggregate demand, what we do is

00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:57.448
we plot on the horizontal
axis, not quantity,

00:02:57.448 --> 00:02:59.219
not just the quantity bought or sold

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.022
of one good or service
in an amount of time,

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:04.010
we plot the actual production of

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.150
the economy in a given period of time.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.731
We've already studied that.

00:03:07.731 --> 00:03:09.356
The actual production of the economy

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.205
in a given period of time is real GDP.

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:16.252
We plot, on this axis, real GDP,

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:17.998
so it's really how much are we producing?

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.669
I guess there is an analogy to quantity,

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.010
it's kind of the quantity of the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.124
productivity of the economy.

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:25.122
In this axis right over here,

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:26.921
we plot price level.

00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.854
This is prices.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:33.004
This isn't prices for one good or service,

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.455
this isn't just a price for candy bars,

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:37.856
this is the general level of prices

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:39.600
in the economy.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.060
Maybe you're saying
it's a weighted average

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.982
or however you want to measure it,

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:44.289
some way of measuring the level

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:45.690
of prices and economy.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.250
What we will see is this is a

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.260
downward sloping curve.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.120
It does look like this.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.984
It will look something like this or

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:56.927
we can assume, we actually don't know

00:03:56.927 --> 00:03:58.051
whether it definitely looks like that,

00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:00.220
but economists will tell
you it looks like that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.262
based on certain theories.

00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:03.191
They like it this way because

00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.134
it starts to explain,

00:04:04.134 --> 00:04:05.520
based on their models,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.682
and you can kind of separate out

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:08.461
the emotional aspects of economics,

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:10.856
it is one way of potentially

00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:12.475
explaining economic cycles,

00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:13.866
although if you know from the last video

00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:16.356
I'm actually a stronger believer in

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.853
the emotional aspects of it.

00:04:17.853 --> 00:04:19.686
But it will be downward sloping.

00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:23.719
It will be downward sloping like this.

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.583
Once again, this is one product,

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:27.118
goods or service right over here.

00:04:27.118 --> 00:04:28.856
This is the economy as a whole.

00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:30.456
This is just a general level of prices.

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:33.788
This is the actual
productivity of the economy.

00:04:33.788 --> 00:04:36.008
This is saying, and it's
a little unintuitive

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:39.960
at first, that if prices are high,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.787
it's seldom this extreme, it's not like

00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:43.285
the GDP would go to zero,

00:04:43.285 --> 00:04:45.544
but we'll just assume it's simplified

00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:46.730
like this ... Maybe I'll draw it with

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.719
something like this ...

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.386
Maybe I'll have it something like,

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:51.226
maybe draw it something like that

00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:52.465
so I don't have to make the extreme

00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:53.895
statement that if prices
are at some level,

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:55.501
that there will be no GDP.

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:57.720
Generally saying if prices are high,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.927
GDP will contract and remember,

00:05:00.927 --> 00:05:04.246
ceteris paribus, all other things equal,

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:07.986
if prices are low, GDP will expand.

00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:09.542
It's happening for completely different

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.674
reasons than this downward sloping.

00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:13.124
This downward sloping is essentially

00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:14.070
a substitution effect.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.205
When prices are high, people say,

00:05:16.205 --> 00:05:17.462
"I don't need to buy candy bars.

00:05:17.462 --> 00:05:19.130
I can go buy ice cream or Slurpees

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.589
or Slushees or something else

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:22.475
that makes me happy," or

00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:24.429
and when prices are low, they say,

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:25.661
"Let me substitute candy bars for

00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:26.934
other things because I'm getting a good

00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:29.131
deal on candy bars."

00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:31.248
Over here that is not what is happening.

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:32.939
What's happening here,
and there's a couple

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.411
of theories why economists will justify

00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:39.423
a downward sloping aggregate demand curve,

00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:46.224
let me make this clear,
this is aggregate demand.

00:05:46.224 --> 00:05:47.469
This is essentially saying
how much productivity

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.754
there will be in the economy as a function

00:05:49.754 --> 00:05:52.135
of price levels in the economy.

00:05:52.135 --> 00:05:54.073
This is aggregate demand ...

00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:56.382
And this is just demand right over here.

00:05:56.382 --> 00:05:58.804
There's three major theories why

00:05:58.804 --> 00:06:01.149
economists believe that
there is a downward

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:03.910
sloping aggregate demand curve.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.651
The first is called the "wealth effect."

00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:08.022
Let me write these down.

00:06:08.022 --> 00:06:12.065
The first is called the "wealth effect."

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.535
The wealth effect is just saying,

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:20.800
and once again, it's
a little nonintuitive,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.899
because in my mind when I start saying

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:26.005
prices have gone down, I start saying,

00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:27.293
"Prices have gone down,

00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:28.934
wages have gone down, maybe

00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:30.262
profits have gone down, and then

00:06:30.262 --> 00:06:32.069
people will get less optimistic,

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.727
the economy will shrink."

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.523
That's not what we're saying

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:36.734
in this chart right over here.

00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:38.075
Remember, ceteris paribus ...

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:40.075
All other things equal.

00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:41.931
We're assuming over here only,

00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:44.128
so if we take this
scenario right over here,

00:06:44.128 --> 00:06:47.284
we're assuming only prices have gone down.

00:06:47.284 --> 00:06:49.607
Everything else in the economy is equal.

00:06:49.607 --> 00:06:51.338
Employment has not changed.

00:06:51.338 --> 00:06:52.998
Profits have not changed.

00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:56.239
People's optimism has not changed.

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:58.261
The only thing that changes is

00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:00.268
people wake up one day and everything

00:07:00.268 --> 00:07:02.162
in the economy is half the price

00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:03.669
it was before.

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:04.743
People have the same savings.

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:06.267
They have the same amount of money

00:07:06.267 --> 00:07:07.153
in their wallet.

00:07:07.153 --> 00:07:09.407
If that happens, all things equal,

00:07:09.407 --> 00:07:10.823
now they say, "With the same amount of

00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:12.195
money that I have in my wallet,

00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:15.626
I can now buy more. I feel wealthier."

00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:16.996
That's the wealth effect.

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:19.059
They will say, "I will go and demand more

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:22.160
goods and services
because with what I have

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.465
in my pocket, I can go buy more things."

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:28.235
Likewise, if for whatever reason people

00:07:28.235 --> 00:07:28.989
woke up the next morning ...

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:32.301
Remember, all other things equal,

00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.256
if the price of everything were to double,

00:07:34.256 --> 00:07:35.496
they say, "Oh my God! I can't buy anything

00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.191
anymore. Everything's too expensive.

00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:38.408
I have to buy less of it. I'm going to

00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:41.105
demand fewer goods and service."

00:07:41.105 --> 00:07:42.272
The wealth effect is one theory

00:07:42.272 --> 00:07:45.715
that would explain,
all other things equal,

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.417
why you would have a downward sloping

00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:50.873
aggregate demand curve.

00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:52.940
The other one is related
to interest rates.

00:07:55.154 --> 00:08:00.297
I would call it savings
and interest rate effect.

00:08:00.297 --> 00:08:05.466
Interest rate effect.

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:08.526
You can imagine, if before this bar

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:11.129
represented the total amount of money

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:12.399
someone had in their pockets,

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:14.698
and this is how much they needed to spend

00:08:14.698 --> 00:08:16.857
on goods and services in order to have

00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:18.697
a nice, happy, productive life,

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.660
this is originally what they were

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.188
going to save, now all of a sudden,

00:08:22.188 --> 00:08:22.893
now if all of a sudden if things get

00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:25.458
a lot cheaper, they don't have to

00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:27.276
spend this much on goods and services.

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:28.235
They could spend less

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:29.165
on goods and services.

00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:30.914
Maybe if things got a lot cheaper,

00:08:30.914 --> 00:08:32.630
they could spend less
on goods and services.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.865
Now they could spend maybe this amount

00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:36.013
on goods and services,

00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:37.817
and they could save much more.

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:41.335
Right over here ... Remember,

00:08:41.335 --> 00:08:42.576
all other things equal,

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:43.743
if everyone woke up tomorrow

00:08:43.743 --> 00:08:45.163
and things were just half priced,

00:08:45.163 --> 00:08:46.936
people would be able to spend less

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:48.272
on the things they need,

00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:50.835
and they would be able
to save a lot more money.

00:08:50.835 --> 00:08:53.210
We've seen before, savings,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.104
when people save money, it just goes into

00:08:55.104 --> 00:08:56.417
the financial system.

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:57.495
You save it, you put it into the bank,

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.606
and it just gets lent out to other people.

00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:02.278
So when you have increase in savings,

00:09:02.278 --> 00:09:05.277
all other things equal,

00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:06.410
when prices goes down,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.292
all other things equal,

00:09:08.292 --> 00:09:10.605
then savings go up which means

00:09:10.605 --> 00:09:13.914
that the supply of money to be lent,

00:09:13.914 --> 00:09:17.749
supply of lenders or money to be lent,

00:09:17.749 --> 00:09:22.029
money lending goes up.

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:23.611
We saw that in a previous video.

00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:24.802
If you increase the supply of money

00:09:24.802 --> 00:09:25.918
that can be lent, the price of

00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:28.003
borrowing the money will go down.

00:09:28.003 --> 00:09:29.430
Another way to think about it,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.615
interest rates.

00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:32.745
Interest rates will go down.

00:09:32.745 --> 00:09:34.500
When interest rates go down,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.631
it becomes cheaper,

00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:36.623
you have to spend less interest

00:09:36.623 --> 00:09:39.340
to borrow money and make investments.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.336
Borrow money, build a house.

00:09:41.336 --> 00:09:42.827
Borrow money, build a factory.

00:09:42.827 --> 00:09:45.749
Borrow money, do whatever
... buy inventory.

00:09:45.749 --> 00:09:47.611
Interest rates go down,

00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:50.606
that stimulates investment,

00:09:50.606 --> 00:09:53.810
that stimulates investment,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.672
which once again, would cause

00:09:54.672 --> 00:09:57.916
the economy to expand.

00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:59.473
You would have more goods and services

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:00.907
being produced.

00:10:00.907 --> 00:10:02.356
Likewise, if you went the other way,

00:10:02.356 --> 00:10:03.610
if prices went up,

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.233
this is a situation
where prices went down.

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:09.989
if prices went up, now all of a sudden,

00:10:09.989 --> 00:10:11.622
people have to spend more of their money.

00:10:11.622 --> 00:10:14.885
More of their money on the things

00:10:14.885 --> 00:10:16.289
that they maybe think that they need

00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:18.014
to survive and be happy.

00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:19.604
There will be less savings.

00:10:19.604 --> 00:10:20.856
If there's less savings,

00:10:20.856 --> 00:10:23.365
there's less money to be lent.

00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:25.618
There will be higher interest rates

00:10:25.618 --> 00:10:26.939
and there will be less investment,

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:29.006
so the economy will contract.

00:10:29.006 --> 00:10:31.894
So real GDP ... And remember,

00:10:31.894 --> 00:10:34.410
when I say GDP here, maybe
I'll call it real GDP,

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.740
real GDP would go down.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:42.202
This is real GDP would go up.

00:10:42.202 --> 00:10:43.686
The third theory of why ...

00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:44.995
or the third justification because

00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:47.509
economists like to have this downward

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:48.789
sloping curve so that they can justify,

00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:51.730
and we'll see how aggregate supply

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.519
and demand can cause business cycles,

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.855
the third effect is essentially,

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:56.270
I'll call it a foreign exchange effect.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.808
A foreign exchange effect.

00:10:59.808 --> 00:11:04.717
Foreign exchange.

00:11:04.717 --> 00:11:06.122
Based on the line of reasoning,

00:11:06.122 --> 00:11:07.872
so let's say a situation once again where

00:11:07.872 --> 00:11:09.133
prices went down,

00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:10.596
based on their line of reasoning and

00:11:10.596 --> 00:11:12.536
justification, we said if prices go down,

00:11:12.536 --> 00:11:16.870
then interest rates go down because

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.465
there's more money to be lent

00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:20.399
in that economy in that currency.

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:22.337
If interest rates go down,

00:11:22.337 --> 00:11:23.710
investors might say,

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.731
"I only get low interest in my country.

00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:29.305
Why don't I convert my money into

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:30.581
other currencies where I can get

00:11:30.581 --> 00:11:31.938
higher interest rates?"

00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:33.688
So if interest rates go down,

00:11:33.688 --> 00:11:35.457
people convert out of the currency.

00:11:35.457 --> 00:11:40.524
Convert out of the currency.

00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:42.190
So maybe before, if we're talking about

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.159
America and maybe the interest rates

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:46.334
are really low in the
US and interest rates

00:11:46.334 --> 00:11:48.450
are higher in the UK, maybe because

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.183
prices didn't go down there as much,

00:11:51.183 --> 00:11:52.529
people say, "I'm going to convert my money

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:55.120
from dollars to pound sterling."

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.913
When they do that, they will essentially,

00:11:56.913 --> 00:11:58.827
because once again, if people are

00:11:58.827 --> 00:12:01.930
converting from ... I've gone in-depth

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.411
on some of the videos on foreign exchange,

00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:05.274
if people are converting from dollars

00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:07.741
to pounds, that means that there's

00:12:07.741 --> 00:12:10.428
a larger supply of dollars and

00:12:10.428 --> 00:12:11.746
more demand for pounds.

00:12:11.746 --> 00:12:13.744
The price of the dollar relative to

00:12:13.744 --> 00:12:15.165
the pound will go down.

00:12:15.165 --> 00:12:16.737
Essentially, the dollar will weaken.

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:22.416
The dollar will weaken
relative to other currencies.

00:12:22.416 --> 00:12:24.329
If the dollar weakens relative to

00:12:24.329 --> 00:12:24.948
the other currency,

00:12:24.948 --> 00:12:26.001
this is a little confusing,

00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:27.662
I go into more depth into this when

00:12:27.662 --> 00:12:29.384
I talk about currency exchange,

00:12:29.384 --> 00:12:31.000
if the dollar weakens relative to

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.715
other currencies, then American

00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:34.731
goods and services are going to appear

00:12:34.731 --> 00:12:37.635
to be cheaper to people in England.

00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:42.154
For example, if I offer to make a car

00:12:42.154 --> 00:12:44.011
in America for $10,000,

00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:49.683
maybe $10,000 before all of this happened,

00:12:49.683 --> 00:12:51.452
translates into 5,000 pounds,

00:12:51.452 --> 00:12:53.174
but now the dollar has weakened.

00:12:53.174 --> 00:12:56.135
Now $10,000 is going to translate into

00:12:56.135 --> 00:12:58.021
4,000 pounds.

00:12:58.021 --> 00:12:59.485
Foreign consumers will say,

00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:01.862
"Wow, American cars just got cheaper

00:13:01.862 --> 00:13:03.606
when we view it in our own currency."

00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:05.080
More and more of them are going to want

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.785
to buy American things so America will

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.536
export more.

00:13:08.536 --> 00:13:10.006
Once again, if there's more demand

00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:11.362
for American goods and services,

00:13:11.362 --> 00:13:13.211
the GDP will expand.

00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:16.185
This is related to low interest rates

00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:18.078
driving people to take currency out

00:13:18.078 --> 00:13:20.943
or exchange out of the currency we're

00:13:20.943 --> 00:13:22.535
talking about, which will make that

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:23.530
currency cheaper, which will make

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.660
its goods and services cheaper to

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.922
the rest of the world,

00:13:25.922 --> 00:13:27.315
which it will essentially

00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:31.588
once again, make net exports increase.

00:13:31.588 --> 00:13:32.882
You really could just cut to the chase

00:13:32.882 --> 00:13:34.914
and say if the price level all of a sudden

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:36.311
in US dollars just got cheaper,

00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:38.447
people say there's deals to be had

00:13:38.447 --> 00:13:40.314
in the US, and once again,

00:13:40.314 --> 00:13:42.318
net exports would increase.

00:13:42.318 --> 00:13:43.922
Once again, when you have low price level,

00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:47.644
you could have GDP expanding.

00:13:47.644 --> 00:13:48.979
Obviously if the prices were to increase,

00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:52.066
the opposite dynamic might occur.
