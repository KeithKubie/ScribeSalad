1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,820
I go back and forth with conspiracies.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,570
I have a love hate relationship with
conspiracies. I love some of them.

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,430
Some of them are fascinating.
Some of them like, okay,

4
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:12,990
what the fuck happened there? You
know, but, and then some of them work.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,890
I can't do this anymore. Yeah,
I didn't. When I was younger.

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,700
I used to think about it, but then
I think when I had a kid at, well,

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,990
I don't have time for that.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,210
No time for nonsense and
becomes very precious.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,270
This becomes food.

10
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:32,130
How exactly not over here worrying
about the fucking Illuminati.

11
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:35,670
I don't even know what that means.
What's the Illuminati? Exactly. I'm busy.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,570
I kind of go, but I get how people get
sucked into that rabbit hole, you know?

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,100
Yeah. No, no, no. I could see it. I
went into a rabbit hole the other day,

14
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:48,150
but with aliens, I watched three
alien documentaries in a row.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,480
I Raja this one on Bah Blah czar.

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,200
Who was the guy who claims that he
worked at area 51 very compelling.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,740
Very interesting. Because at the top, but
that's the one you would suggest. Yes.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,970
That's the one I would suggest.

19
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:04,950
It's called area 51 Bob Lasar
area 51 and flying saucers,

20
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:08,370
I think it's called. It's on iTunes
right down. It's fucking good.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Take notes because there's some things
that this guy knew that it's almost

22
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,100
certain that he worked
where he said he worked,

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,950
that he worked at area
51 the question becomes,

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,220
he told all the truth about all these
things that have since been proven to be

25
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,010
true. Um, weird. So he gave,

26
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:30,930
he gave first cut at those truths, right?
Yeah. Well he did a long time ago too.

27
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:34,560
He came out about this like 30 years ago.
There was a Nevada.

28
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,250
Tell heard about this Bob. He would. He
would. He was worried about his life.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,330
Here's what happened.

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,810
Apparently the guy was working in this
area doing research for whatever the

31
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:49,080
government wanted them to do, an
area 51 what he did there, who knows?

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,740
He gets fired from this job and then
takes his friends to this viewing position

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,720
in the mountains where they can
see them flying, flying saucers.

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,780
He was telling them they fly them
at his base. I'm going to bring,

35
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:08,610
you guys were going to watch it. He, they
videotape this on old school VHS tape.

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,350
You can see these flying saucers
flying around area 51 and he says,

37
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:18,000
these are not w not being
piloted by a, uh, by aliens.

38
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,230
These are being piloted by human beings,
but that these are real devices.

39
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,690
These things are real.
It's a real vehicle.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,560
And they got this real
vehicle from some other,

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,250
some other civilization from somewhere
in space and they had nine of them.

42
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,350
It sounds like total
horseshit when you hear it,

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,320
but then you watch the video and
so the questions come like, well,

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,530
how did he know that they were going
to be flying these things up there?

45
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,690
How do you know they were
going to do them on Wednesdays?

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,480
How do you know where to be and where
he could see it? How did he know?

47
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,400
How did he know about the biometric data?

48
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,700
How do you know about element one 15
he was talking about this element,

49
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:55,701
this manmade element that it's a real
element that they've now identified.

50
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,580
But when he was talking about it in 1981
knew what the fuck he was talking about

51
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,630
or 1984 or whatever it was when he was,
when he first got interviewed about this.

52
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,910
So when this guy is bringing this
stuff up today and people are,

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,870
are looking back at all the different
things that he said that have since been

54
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:18,610
proven to be true, especially
the existence of area 51,
the, the government had to,

55
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,110
at some point in time in the 90s,

56
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:25,111
they had to say that they own the base
and say that it did in fact exist.

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,740
The, uh, top secret area
or the, uh, do you know,

58
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:33,490
like there's a do not enter
zone or they'll pull you
over and arrest you if you

59
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,570
get past a certain spot.

60
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,920
They wanted to broaden that area so people
couldn't be watching their crafts fly

61
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,650
around like Bob Lasar was.
And when they did that,

62
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,150
when they expanded the territory,

63
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,270
that's when they had to actually
admit that the base was real.

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,810
So he was proven to be correct on so
many different things that he said,

65
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,680
like explain how they get them out there,
explain what the research was.

66
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,770
And he said that they had these
things that run on some, they,

67
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,520
they manipulate gravity in some way and
they're very small because these aliens

68
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:07,720
are very small little creatures. Like a
child, like a eight, 10 year old child.

69
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,550
Huh. It makes you go, what the fuck man?
Like I, so he talked about, he said, well,

70
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,920
he saw them, he knew
how they operated. Wow.

71
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,180
The things that he knows that are true,
that that turned out to be true.

72
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:23,290
That how could he have known them if
he didn't work at area 51 or the most

73
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,430
compelling aspects of it.

74
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,730
And the fact that area 51 was at one
point in time by the governments take it

75
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,860
didn't exist.
And then it was like a legend.

76
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,510
And this was when he was talking about it.

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,980
And so watching this documentary
and seeing this guy 30 years later,

78
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,450
still basically saying exactly the same
thing with a bunch of things have been

79
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,600
proven. Have improvement. Cynthia. Yeah,
that is intense. It's a trip, man. I mean,

80
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:51,601
if the government really did at one
point in time have some craft that it got

81
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:56,170
from another planet, like what the
fuck man? But the thing is like,

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,310
how would we take that?

83
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,090
How do you think people would
take that if they found out?

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,710
How do you think that handle that?

85
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,390
If they really knew there was something
that was so sophisticated that it could

86
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,420
visit us from another planet.
It could be here in minutes,

87
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,070
g land in the White House lawn and
do whatever the fuck I wanted to.

88
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,630
You couldn't even shoot it with bullets.
How would

89
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,350
people take that?

90
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,320
I think that people would just keep
going on like with every other scare.

91
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,840
I think so, yeah. I
think, okay, there's, um,

92
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,770
there could be a media that's supposed
to hit us. Right, right. I mean,

93
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,620
how do people take it? I mean,
that's what they're saying.

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,980
They said it could happen. I think it
would be a fuck fest in the streets. Yeah.

95
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,750
But what they say they say
could happen. I mean, you know,

96
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,130
if you saw one common yeah,

97
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:38,770
but I'm saying that if you saw one
company because you don't see the alien

98
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,820
coming, if people realize that yeah, these
guys could show up. Right. I don't know.

99
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,410
I remember the conspiracy that um,
when I, I remember, I do remember that.

100
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,910
I remember that when they would be like
these booklets of like xerox stuff going

101
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:55,270
on, like the one about aids and stuff
like that. Maybe that one. Yeah.

102
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,190
That one had be going for a while.
The con, the AIDS conspiracy,

103
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,710
the Irish stroker
memorandum. Oh yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,210
People are used to hand those out.
Right.

105
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,920
Don't try and tell people that
aids was a hoax, not a hoax.

106
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:08,390
That it was like all this stuff memorized.

107
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:12,350
I always got to host a government
conspiracy. Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

108
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,170
Way Out for a while.
I remember I was video I was making,

109
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:19,860
I was making copies and passing along
guys. That blew my mind. Wow. There was a

110
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,540
one doctor at one point in time that
was trying to say that that HIV does not

111
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:29,490
cause aids and we had him on way back
in the day early on. Was that guy's name

112
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,980
Duesberg? Dr Peter Duesberg. Yeah.
Yeah. That's what it is. Our man,

113
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,823
I just remembered it.

114
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,030
He is a professor at the University
of California Berkeley I believe.

115
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,580
I think he's a Bot biologist and his take
was that HIV does not cause aids that

116
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:52,370
would causes AIDS as a
compromised immune system.

117
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:56,030
That HIV is actually a weak virus and it
shows up in the immune system so people

118
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,290
that are already compromised.

119
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,890
That's why you're finding it in these
people that it's not the cause of their

120
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,780
immune system being compromised.
Compromise.

121
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,800
It's a symptom of it and that with these
people are really dying from is there

122
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,520
their whole system being fucked up by
drugs that either they're taking AZT,

123
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:16,280
which destroys their body. You
know, it was a cancer medication,

124
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:19,700
like a chemotherapy that was so powerful
is killing people quicker than the

125
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,534
cancer was.

126
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,290
And then they switched it over to using
it with people that had aids because in,

127
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,830
in the early days they would
call aids the gay cancer.

128
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,390
There was all these different,

129
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,670
like they were trying to figure
out what it was and what it did.

130
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,830
And early on this guy was saying this
and we had them on the podcast and people

131
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,170
got so mad there,

132
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:42,350
there were so mad that given this
guy a platform to spread his,

133
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,070
his propaganda in his lies. And I was
like, wow. But he is a professor, right?

134
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
He has done like legitimate cancer
research. He's, you know, I mean,

135
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,920
don't you want to listen
to them? And, and I,

136
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:57,200
I wanted to get someone on to debate him,
but nobody wanted to debate him.

137
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,430
It was like trying to get someone
to debate a Holocaust denier. Like,

138
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,170
nobody wants to give them the platform
and when he wants me to talk to them,

139
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,130
which I understand, but
those, those kinds of,

140
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,480
I mean it's very highly unlikely that
all these doctors are incorrect in her

141
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:16,010
hiding the fact that HIV, you know, and
then now the fact that they've got these,

142
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,560
um,
HIV medication,

143
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:22,610
so basically they can take people and
make them HIV negative now. Right.

144
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,300
Then they have like a couple people
have tested HIV negative after her

145
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,780
medications. Yeah. I
Dunno. I'm too stupid.

146
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,820
Too stupid to understand what's really,

147
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,980
yeah. That's, that's for me
that I know that I'm like,

148
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,610
when I watch some of those things,
you know, they, some of them,

149
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:42,120
they will like lead off
with these statements and we
all know and we know this.

150
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,170
I'm like, I don't, I don't
know. Yeah. I don't know.
Yeah. There's too much to know.

151
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,800
Yeah. Yeah. How do we get
in the subject of AIDS?

152
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,080
I don't know where we're talking
about conspiracy theories.

153
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,920
And that was the one that I, that one,
that one when it was back in what?

154
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,890
[inaudible] 89 or something. 88 when
those little pamphlets are growing around.

155
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,120
Yeah. I was like, yeah,

156
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,080
well marijuana and conspiracies
go together like cookies
and milk. Yeah, yeah,

157
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,670
yeah. Right. This is nothing
like we, it starts your,

158
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,790
your gears turning and you start thinking
that's where a lot of people start

159
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,310
thinking conspiracies are
against them too. Right.

160
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:16,830
You get high and they start thinking
that the world's closing in on you.

161
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,440
Everybody's watching you surveillance.

162
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,950
But do you don't probably don't feel like
that when you get high. No, I'm okay.

163
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,120
Yeah. Yeah, I do. Sometimes
I kinda like it though.

164
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,290
You know why I like it? Cause it
ends and when it ends you feel great.

165
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,990
It's almost like a, a brutal
brain workout. Like you,

166
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,991
you go digging deep into your psyche and
find out all the things you're scared

167
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:44,370
of. Right? Yeah. No, it's like it's work.
Yeah. It'll work. You like took a look at,

168
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:47,640
you said, and you know I never thought
about me from that angle before. Yeah.

169
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:50,790
I like to do it. I'm going to clean up
mine. Yeah, yeah. Clean up your shit.
