00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:02.174
- [Voiceover] Let g be a function defined

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:03.757
for all real numbers.

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:06.962
Also let g prime, the derivative of g,

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.761
be defined as g prime of x

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:11.918
is equal to x squared over x
minus two to the third power.

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:14.835
On which intervals is g increasing?

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.937
Well, at first you might say,
they don't even give us g.

00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:20.893
How do we figure out when g is increasing?

00:00:20.893 --> 00:00:24.451
Well, the answer is all we need is g prime

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.237
which they do give us.

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:29.030
And saying on which
intervals is g increasing,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.970
that's equivalent to saying,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.212
on which intervals is the first
derivative with respect to x

00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:37.537
on which intervals is that
going to be greater than zero?

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.048
If your rate of change with respect to x

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:40.969
is greater than zero, if it's positive,

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.755
then your function itself
is going to be increasing.

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:47.587
And so there's a couple of ways
that we could approach this.

00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:49.101
You might just want to inspect

00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:51.100
kind of the structure of this
expression and think about,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.360
well, when is that going
to be greater than zero

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.490
or we could do it a little
bit more methodically.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.493
We could say, well, let's
look at the critical points

00:00:57.493 --> 00:01:00.516
or the critical values for g.

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:01.516
So critical,

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:04.094
critical points

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:06.175
for g

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:10.288
and just to remind ourselves
what critical points are,

00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:14.528
that is when g prime of x is equal to zero

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:17.195
or g prime of x is undefined,

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:20.409
is undefined,

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.667
and we have videos on critical
points or critical values

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.706
and why those are relevant
is those are the places,

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:30.665
those are possible places
where the sign could change,

00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:32.957
the sign of g prime could change.

00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:35.817
So when is g prime of x equal to zero?

00:01:35.817 --> 00:01:37.952
Well, the way to get g
prime of x equal to zero

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:39.591
is getting the numerator equal to zero

00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:40.491
and that's only going to happen

00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:44.114
if x squared is equal to zero
or if x is equal to zero.

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:46.279
So that's the only
place where g prime of x

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:47.601
is equal to zero

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.071
and where is g prime of x undefined?

00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:50.904
Well, it's going to be undefined

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:52.815
if the denominator becomes undefined.

00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:57.434
The denominator becomes undefined
if the denominator is zero

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:58.267
and so that's going to happen

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:00.785
if x minus two is equal to zero,

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:05.152
x minus two is equal to
zero or x is equal to two.

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:08.750
So we have two critical
points or critical values here

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.862
and what I'm going to do
is I want to graph them.

00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:12.223
Let's put them on a number line

00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:15.914
and let's just think about
what g prime is doing

00:02:15.914 --> 00:02:18.932
in the intervals between
the critical points.

00:02:18.932 --> 00:02:20.849
So let's start at zero,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.243
one, two,

00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:28.592
three and then let's go to negative one

00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:31.648
and we have a critical point at,

00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:33.239
let me do that in magenta,

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.238
we have a critical point at x
equals zero right over there

00:02:37.238 --> 00:02:40.668
and we have a critical point at x equals,

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:43.301
at x equals two right over there.

00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:46.140
And so let's think about
what g prime is doing

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.043
in the intervals between
the critical values

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:51.290
or on either side of the critical values.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.718
So let's think about,

00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:54.970
let's first think about this interval.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.825
Let me do it in this purple color.

00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:00.512
Let's think about the interval between,

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:03.429
between negative infinity and zero.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.429
So if we think about this interval,

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:08.883
so negative infinity and zero,

00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:10.773
that open interval,

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:13.106
well, if we look at g prime,

00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.038
the numerator is still
going to be positive.

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:17.650
If you take any negative value squared,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.530
you're going to get a positive value

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.009
so this is going to be positive.

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.288
Now, what about the denominator?

00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:24.863
You take a negative number,
you subtract two from it,

00:03:24.863 --> 00:03:26.506
you're still going to
get a negative number

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.074
and then you take it to the third power.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.271
Well, a negative number to the third power

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:30.812
is going to be a negative number

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:32.797
so that right over there
is going to be negative.

00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:35.064
So you're going to have a
positive divided by a negative

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:38.029
so g prime is going to be negative

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.740
so let me write that down.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.138
So on this interval, on this interval,

00:03:43.138 --> 00:03:44.243
I'll write it like this.

00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:47.307
g prime of x is less than zero

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:49.758
or if we cared or if we want
to know when it's decreasing,

00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:53.109
we would know it's definitely
decreasing over that interval.

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.744
Now, let's take the interval
between zero and two

00:03:57.744 --> 00:03:59.077
right over here.

00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:02.324
So this is the interval

00:04:02.324 --> 00:04:05.324
from zero to two, the open interval.

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:09.350
So what's going to go on
with g prime of x here?

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.451
Well, once again, x squared,

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.534
anything greater than a zero

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:16.653
and it says we're not including
zero in this interval.

00:04:16.653 --> 00:04:20.206
Well, this is for sure
going to be positive

00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:22.576
and so let's see, if we have x minus two

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:26.089
where x is greater than
zero but less than two.

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:28.336
So if x, we could just say
for example, if x was one,

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:30.422
one minus two is negative one.

00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:32.304
We're still going to get negative values

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:34.552
in this denominator right over here.

00:04:34.552 --> 00:04:36.392
So since we're still going
to get negative values

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:37.292
in this denominator,

00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:38.854
the denominator is still going to be,

00:04:38.854 --> 00:04:41.181
you take a negative
value to the third power,

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.937
well, you're going to
still get a negative value

00:04:42.937 --> 00:04:46.333
so this is going to be negative.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:50.784
So you're still going to have
g prime as less than zero

00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:52.605
so let me write that down.

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:55.105
So you still have g prime of x

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.480
is less than zero.

00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:01.374
And then let's take the interval above.

00:05:01.374 --> 00:05:05.604
Let's take the interval
from two to infinity.

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:07.459
Two to infinity.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:08.973
Well, the numerator is positive.

00:05:08.973 --> 00:05:10.529
It's always going to be positive

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.677
for any x not being equal to zero

00:05:13.677 --> 00:05:15.369
and this denominator,

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:17.115
you're taking values greater than two,

00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:18.169
subtracting two from it

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.968
which is still going to
give you a positive value.

00:05:19.968 --> 00:05:22.523
You take the third power,
it's all going to be positive.

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:24.628
It is all going to be positive.

00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:28.589
So this is the interval where g prime of x

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:30.339
is greater than zero.

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:33.466
So on which intervals is g increasing?

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.544
Well, that's where g prime
of x is greater than zero

00:05:37.544 --> 00:05:40.714
so it's going to be from two,

00:05:40.714 --> 00:05:44.686
from two to infinity or we
could just write it like this.

00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:48.470
We could write x is greater than two.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.533
Either way,

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:52.646
for either of these, g prime
of x is greater than zero

00:05:52.646 --> 00:05:56.479
and your function g is
going to be increasing.
