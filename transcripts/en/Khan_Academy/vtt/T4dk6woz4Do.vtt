00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:06.379
tonight with the work of a remarkable young man who is

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.512
applying his three degrees from MIT and one from

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:13.928
Harvard to help a lot of young people around the world

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.094
do better in school.

00:00:15.094 --> 00:00:17.756
His classroom, in this case, is the Internet and his

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:21.420

Kristen: What makes 5th graders cheer?

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:33.506
Would you believe math?

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:34.376
Boy: Yes.

00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:36.262
Girl: I'm starting to really like math now.

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:38.840
Kristen: These kids are learning with the help of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.526
Khan Academy, an online school.

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:43.656
Adult: You got it right. Good job.

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.179
Videos that are interactive and fun,

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.788
explaining difficult concepts in a conversational way.

00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:51.318
Khan: So if you want the slope of a line.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.653
Kristen: Khan Academy is the brainchild of

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.827
34-year-old Sal Khan.

00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.039
Khan: Everything in my gut says that's the right way

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.333
that education should move in the future.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.497
In 2004, Khan started tutoring his cousin,

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.128
Nadia Rahman, in math.

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:06.106
Khan: So, this is it.

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:08.485

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.771
online from a closet in his home.

Now studying Pre-Med at Sarah Lawrence College,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.703
Nadia says she has her cousin to thank.

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:20.315
Nadia: So I kind of, was able to learn on my own pace.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:23.703
Kristen: Khan posted more lessons online for anyone to use.

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:28.065

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:29.649
Khan: Your videos will allow us to help ...

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.117
Kristen: Khan eventually made 2,200 videos; basic math,

00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:38.042
algebra, trigonometry, calculus, all for free.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.165
Speaker: 9 divided by ...

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:43.253
Khan's lessons have been viewed on YouTube 43 million times,

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:44.757

00:01:44.757 --> 00:01:46.025
Khan: You got it, very good.
Kristen: Yeah.

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:48.995
making them the largest educational source on the site

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:51.705

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:55.693

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.679
Kristen: We caught up with Bill Gates promoting

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.430
Khan Academy at this year's Tech Conference,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.680
which focuses on new ideas.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.902
Bill: It's phenomenal. It's the cutting edge of

00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:07.014
where education is going.

00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:09.233
Kristin: The Gates Foundation and Google recently

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.969
donated a total of 3.5 million dollars to help turn

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.696
Khan's not-for-profit into a global classroom.

00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:18.335
Khan: Hopefully, Khan Academy will teach people

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:20.895
either there are no such things as geniuses

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.445
or that to some degree everyone is.

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:25.747
Kristin: A philosophy that is opening the doors of

00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:28.222
learning all over the world.
