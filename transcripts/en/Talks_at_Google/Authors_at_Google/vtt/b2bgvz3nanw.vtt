[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:06.487
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:07.778
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Thank you.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.770
Thank you.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.710
It's good to be here.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.510
I've watched a couple
of these talks online

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.480
and I know that sometimes
they're very lighthearted.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.230
This one won't be.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.970
My life started to change
considerably in 2010

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.290
when about 10 Somali
pirates were arrested

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.140
for trying to capture
a German cargo ship

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.570
and hauled in front of a
court in Hamburg in Germany

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.590
where I was working
as a journalist.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.120
It was the first
time pirates had

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.352
been in front of a German
judge for almost 400 years.

00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:47.060
So it was an extremely
interesting story,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.143
and I started to cover it
for Spiegel Online where

00:00:49.143 --> 00:00:51.570
I was working.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.300
A lot of the German
defense lawyers in the room

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.740
said that their
clients were just

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.350
sort of poor fishermen, which
is a story you've probably

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.320
heard plenty of times because
it's talked about sometimes

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.420
when Somali pirates come up.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.340
This was a group of
10 young Somalis armed

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.810
with AK-47s and rocket launchers
that boarded a cargo ship

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.560
and only were kept from
hijacking it when the Dutch

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.280
Navy came in and overpowered
them with gunfire

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.250
and arrested them on the deck
and sent them to Germany.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.810
So these men were
caught red handed.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.870
But by the time they landed in
Hamburg, their defense lawyers

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.240
had statements prepared claiming
they were just poor fishermen

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.230
and they'd been press ganged
by real pirates and stuff

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.380
like that.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.190
And again, that's
a common story,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.680
and it has something to do with
the roots of Somali piracy.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.790
But there's this tale you
hear that most pirates are

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.692
just disgruntled
fishermen trying

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.900
to make an honest living,
but they can't, and so they

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.820
go out and capture big ships.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260
These are complicated
issues, and they

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.630
can be a little confusing.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.796
Since you're engineers, I'm
going to be a little bit

00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:03.500
wonky today about them.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.290
But I'm going to talk about
fishing and piracy and even

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.830
Islam and a few
related topics in a way

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.340
that I hope sheds light
on Somalia a little bit

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.500
and also on what happened
to me in Somalia.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.070
So I was captured
and held hostage

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.000
by pirates in central Somalia
for over 2 and 1/2 years.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.460
And by the time I
got out, I didn't

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.220
think I was going to see my
family and friends again.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.680
Before I went
there, I had worked

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.530
as not just a journalist,
but also an author in Berlin,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.400
and I had traveled quite a
bit to Europe and Africa, Cuba

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.430
and the Middle East.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.940
I wrote a book about surfing.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.640
Cleo mentioned that it was not
just about surfing, but also

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.610
about the spread of
American culture or pop

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.050
culture since surfing is not
just American, around the world

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.400
after World War II.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.590
And in the Horn of Africa while
I was doing some of that work,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.814
I met a documentary
maker named Ashwin Raman.

00:03:04.814 --> 00:03:05.980
He's a very good journalist.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.410
He's born in India,
but works in Germany.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.005
And since we were both living
in Germany at the same time

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.330
and we both had an
interest in pirates,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.070
we talked about some
traveling to Somalia together.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.350
Ashwin had been there.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.770
He does war documentaries
for German TV

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.350
from Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Guantanamo.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.200
He knows how to move in and
out of dangerous places.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.480
So when we started to
plan a trip to Somalia,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.160
we didn't do it lightly.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.660
We found a Somali
elder in Berlin

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.530
who had taken another journalist
from Germany to the same region

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.910
before safely.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.370
And I took time and earned a
grant for some of my expenses

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.910
from the Pulitzer Center
on Crisis Reporting.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.920
We planned the trip for months.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.490
Then finally we flew to
Somalia in early 2012,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.190
planning to stay
for about two weeks.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.690
We stayed in Galkayo, which is a
town you may not have heard of.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.210
It's a central Somali town where
lots of pirates happen to live.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.100
But it's nowhere
near the coastline.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.630
It's actually a very big city.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.550
It's 100,000 people, which
is quite large for Somalia.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.680
And it's big because
it's a crossroads town,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.800
and that's one reason that some
Somali pirates have used it

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.300
as a sort of resupply
town and a place

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.337
to retreat and build
their houses, too.

00:04:23.337 --> 00:04:24.920
From Galkayo, we
made one excursion up

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.260
to Hobyo, which is a town
you probably have heard of.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.510
It's a pirate town on the coast.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.890
And we had a conversation
with a pirate boss who called

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.040
himself Mustaf Mohammed Sheikh.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.710
And he posed himself
as sort of a guy who

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.750
was at war with
European interests

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.840
somehow, with the people
who dump poison waste off

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.470
of Somali beaches, which the
Italian mafia certainly does,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.530
and with companies
that come down

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.130
and take Somali fish, which
French and Portuguese fishing

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.410
ships have certainly
been known to do,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.910
and also some Asian companies.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.600
So he was full of
legitimate complaint.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.350
But it turns out that he's
like a lot of antique pirates

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.790
in that sense.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.640
Pirates in history have always
been a little bit rebellious,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.890
and they've always had
some sort of complaint

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.907
to back up what they do.

00:05:14.907 --> 00:05:16.490
But with pirates,
you have to untangle

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.060
their legitimate complaints with
their main motivation, which

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.320
is greed.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.810
And I would argue that
when Somali pirates started

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.730
capturing big cargo ships
instead of fishing ships

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.420
off the coast, and especially
when they started capturing

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.410
people on land, that it was
no longer about defending

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.200
their coastline from
illegal fishing.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.220
So we spent not very much time
in Hobyo, just sort of a day,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.440
and we came back to Galkayo,
and Ashwin decided to--

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.460
there's Galkayo again--

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.110
Ashwin decided to
fly off to Mogadishu.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.920
And so we agreed to do
everything together,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.210
and we both went to the airport
with our security, saw him off,

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.550
Ashwin got on the plane,
and it was on the way

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.664
back from the airport that
a truck was waiting for us.

00:06:07.664 --> 00:06:09.080
It was actually
called a technical

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.800
on the side of the road between
the airport and Galkayo proper.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.870
A technical looks like that.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.060
It's a flatbed truck with
a canon welded in the back,

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.580
and it's a very common sort
of improvised battlewagon

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.955
in the Somali Civil War.

00:06:23.955 --> 00:06:26.330
This is not a picture of the
one that was waiting for us,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.140
but the one that was waiting
had 12 guys in the back

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.730
with Kalashnikov,
something like that,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.160
and at first we thought maybe
it was there to protect us.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.710
But it moved when
it saw the car,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.020
and it aimed that big cannon
through the windshield,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.270
and it overpowered my guard.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.450
And the 12 guys with
guns came across,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.870
came off the flatbed and
over to my side of the car

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.780
and pulled me out.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.900
They beat me on the head.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.590
They beat my wrist because I was
trying to keep the door closed.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.090
They broke my wrist.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.860
They bloodied my scalp.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.090
They broke my glasses, which I'd
been wearing and which I need--

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.947
I'm extremely
near-sighted-- and then

00:07:03.947 --> 00:07:05.780
they bundled me into
an SUV that was waiting

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.270
by the side of the road, and
we drove off into the Somali

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.890
Bush, which looks like that.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.860
And those were my
circumstances after that

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.960
for the next 2 and 1/2 years.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.440
We found a camp
in the Somali Bush

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.180
where some other
pirates were staying,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.350
and a couple of
hostages too, but I

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.060
was too confused to
understand what was going on.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.880
There was a mattress
waiting for me.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.870
I sat on the mattress.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.690
Somebody gave me some food,
some bread and canned tuna,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.290
and that would more or
less be my diet, at least

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.270
for the next few months--

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.910
canned tuna and bread and some
bottled water and some pasta.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:55.390
And in the next two or three
months, I lost about 45 pounds.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.500
But for a treat-- actually, this
is digression-- but no matter

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.911
what else we ran out of, no
matter what else went wrong,

00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:04.410
even if we ran out
of bottled water,

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:10.290
for some reason we always
had biscuits and mango juice.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:16.314
That's a sample of the
vanilla biscuit box we got.

00:08:16.314 --> 00:08:18.230
It was a big part of my
experience in Somalia,

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.760
this brand, but in spite of
the sugar, I still lost weight.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.580
So those first days
were very confusing.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.120
But gradually, I got to know
the other two hostages that

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.725
were there at the camp, and one
of them I was thrown together

00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:34.600
with for some reason.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.809
We became partners, at least
from the pirates' point

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.280
of view.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.789
He and his friend were both
fishermen from the Seychelles.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.660
And this guy,
Rolly, was about 69,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.060
kind of a squat
old man who spoke

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.072
a French-inflected
Seychellois Creole.

00:08:52.072 --> 00:08:53.350
That's Rolly.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.260
He and his friend Marc were
both fishing about 50 miles out

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.745
of their home port
of the Seychelles.

00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:01.120
The main island
of the Seychelles

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.452
is about 700 miles
from the Somali coast.

00:09:04.452 --> 00:09:06.410
And they were just cleaning
their fish at night

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:11.680
and the pirates came
up and took their boat

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.740
and overpowered them
with guns and said,

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.260
you have to sail
back to Somalia now.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.010
It took them a week.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.810
They were a week
away from Hobyo.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.580
So that was one of
my first impressions

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.820
of life as a hostage.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.620
The first two other
hostages I met

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.220
were two poor African fishermen
captured near their home

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.170
and hauled back to
Somalia and held

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.388
for the staggering
sum of $20 million

00:09:39.388 --> 00:09:42.880
by pirates who pretended to be
oppressed by industrial fishing

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.830
boats.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.010
So that was one myth exploded.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.470
And a few days after-- so
there's both of them, actually.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.220
That's a picture of Rolly
and a picture of Marc.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.110
I'm happy to say they're fine.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.810
That's on the day they
got back from Somalia

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.330
some time after I met them.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.180
Now, a few days
after my capture,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.180
the US launched a rescue to
get two other hostages who

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.440
were there in Somalia.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.930
They had been captured
completely separately

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.430
and it was probably
a different gang

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.763
that was holding them, but
maybe some clan relationships

00:10:21.763 --> 00:10:25.220
between that gang and my gang.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.200
They'd been in Somalia
for a few months.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.330
And for some reason, four
days after my capture,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.034
SEALs went in and got them.

00:10:31.034 --> 00:10:32.450
They knew exactly
where they were.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.230
They killed nine Somali guards
and rescued the two hostages

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.760
safely.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.850
The two hostages were Jessica
Buchanan and Poul Thisted,

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.440
an American and a
Dane, and they were

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.405
working for a demining NGO.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:57.080
And they-- I mean, I've met
Jessica in the meantime--

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.140
really good people.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.890
But the rescue upset my guards.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.640
They upset, I think,
some of my bosses,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.740
too, because they said
that they had some clan

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.090
relationships to the guards.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.790
So a few days
after their rescue,

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.270
they made the original
demand for my release,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.660
and the original
demand was $20 million.

00:11:18.448 --> 00:11:20.281
My mom didn't know what
to do with that one.

00:11:23.047 --> 00:11:25.430
$20 million-- they probably
didn't pull that out

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.970
of the air.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.800
They were asking $20
million for other people,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.010
including the two fishermen.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.910
But they held on to it, in
my case, for almost a year.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.137
So I think that has something
to do with the rescue.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.899
Rolly turned out
to be a chatterbox.

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:46.190
And he told me a strange thing.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.050
He said that he
had seen my picture

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.530
before the pirates brought me to
that camp sort of blindfolded.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.850
One of the guards had a
picture of me on his phone.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.000
And then a couple of days
before I arrived there

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.790
with the blindfold, the
guards had disappeared,

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.100
which means that it was
extremely well-planned

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.002
and they knew what
they were trying to do.

00:12:09.002 --> 00:12:10.460
And eventually I
saw this picture--

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.840
a guard showed it
to me on his phone--

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.030
and it happens to be my author
picture from my second book.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:22.130
So they did some research
on me on the internet.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.050
That narrows down
the number of people

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.990
who could have planned it.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.490
But it also told me something
crucial because until then I'd

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.614
been traveling as a German.

00:12:29.614 --> 00:12:31.760
I'm also a German
citizen, and I'd only

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.492
traveled on my German
passport in Somalia.

00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:36.200
But the pirates must
have known very well

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.630
that I was an American before
they decided to capture me.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.870
And the reason
that's interesting

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.440
is that Americans think that
we have a hostage policy that

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.420
keeps us safe.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.370
Everyone knows-- I
think everyone knows--

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.910
at least every journalist
knows that the US doesn't

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.520
pay ransoms, and the reason
it doesn't pay ransoms

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.920
for cases like this, for
any case of kidnapping,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.120
is that if you start to
pay criminals to do that,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.020
then more criminals will do it.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.620
And so the idea is that it
will keep Americans safe.

00:13:14.184 --> 00:13:16.100
The pirates were obviously
trying to get money

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.360
from every possible source.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.860
They called my mother.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.740
They called "Der
Spiegel Magazine."

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.325
They called the US government
and the German government.

00:13:24.325 --> 00:13:26.450
They just thought that the
more places they called,

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.910
the more money was going
to fall from the sky.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.210
It was very unrealistic,
but most of my pirates

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.310
really did think that
the US government was

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.200
going to shell out money.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.060
They just thought, well,
it's the wealthiest

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.640
country in the world,
and so why wouldn't they?

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.820
And I know that because
one guard who held me

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.080
for a long time named Boshko--

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.800
I have a picture--

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.080
kept me updated on negotiations.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.290
And one day, a year and
a half into my captivity,

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.596
he came into the room
very angry because someone

00:13:56.596 --> 00:13:57.970
had told him that
there was going

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.914
to be no money coming
from Washington.

00:13:59.914 --> 00:14:01.330
In other words,
until then, he had

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.250
believed that some
portion of my ransom

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.560
was going to be paid
by the US government.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.220
And when some Somali
negotiators probably

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.900
told him that it
wasn't going to happen

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.850
and he had to sort of reduce
his expectations for a ransom,

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.130
he was really angry.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.580
And he came in and he said, why?

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.930
Why won't the US pay?

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.660
It's such a wealthy country.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.576
Why wouldn't they pay
for one of their people?

00:14:24.576 --> 00:14:26.900
And I tried to explain
the whole thing to him.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.330
But the rationale started
to weaken a little bit

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.952
while I was trying to explain
it to him because this was

00:14:34.952 --> 00:14:36.410
a year and a half
into my captivity

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.740
and it was incredible to me
that my own kidnappers weren't

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.073
keeping track of these policies.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.090
Somebody wasn't listening
to the politicians

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.030
from behind the podium who said,
we have a hard line on this

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.520
and don't even try it.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.660
And it turns out kidnappers
like that either don't care

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.669
or they don't know the
difference between some

00:14:57.669 --> 00:14:58.460
of these countries.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.690
In fact, I knew Boshko
didn't know the difference

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.750
between England and France.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.610
He wanted me to draw
a map at some point

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.640
to show him which was
which, which means

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.530
that most of these
guys' conception

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.270
of European
geography is about as

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.980
good as the average
American's conception

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.440
of African geography.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.340
So if you can imagine
your understanding

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.090
of African hostage
policy, then maybe you

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.150
can understand why a lot of
groups in the wider world

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:33.700
don't keep very good track of
differences in policy, if any,

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.250
in Western countries.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:41.770
So the point is that
that was a bitter way

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.280
to have a second myth
exploded as a captive.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.890
American hostage policy does
not keep us safe in the way

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.900
that we think it does.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.717
The pirates knew I was American,
they targeted me on purpose,

00:15:52.717 --> 00:15:55.300
and then they held out for money
in spite of what I considered

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.532
a very famous hardline policy.

00:15:58.532 --> 00:16:00.740
There are some implications
for that, and one of them

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.531
is not that I think
the US should shell out

00:16:02.531 --> 00:16:04.760
money for ransoms.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.130
But I just think it's important
for an American audience

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.707
to understand that the ideas
we have about that policy

00:16:10.707 --> 00:16:11.540
are not always true.

00:16:13.584 --> 00:16:15.250
I want to say a little
more about Boshko

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.427
because he claimed
not to be a pirate.

00:16:18.427 --> 00:16:20.760
He watched me every day with
a Kalashnikov in his hands,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.560
but he would say, on these
sort of long afternoons

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.750
where we had conversations,
broken conversations, that he

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.450
wasn't a pirate.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.250
He was just a guard.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.700
And it's possible that a
great big pirate gang--

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.040
there must have been hundreds
of people in the network--

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.780
is broken up into
little cells, and you

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.300
might have an attack
cell and a guard cell

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:45.130
and the cell that organizes
a telephone call for a ransom

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.250
discussion or the
food-- some people just

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.590
have to organize the food--
but all those little groups

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.150
have to be within
the pirate network

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.430
and they have to be
trusted by the guards.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.880
So as far as I was concerned,
Boshko is a pirate.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.820
And the other interesting
thing about him

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.280
is that he was a
very devout Muslim.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.859
In fact, all my guards
prayed five times a day,

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.970
which is a bit of a surprise
to me because I thought--

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:15.569
I knew Somalia was
a Sufi nation, but--

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.950
predominantly
Sufi-- but I didn't

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.349
expect to see my pirates
praying quite so often,

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.300
and they were extremely
devout about it.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.810
And it actually got me
angry to watch them do it.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.190
And so finally, I asked Boshko--

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.840
I said, you are a Muslim.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.520
He said, yes, because he
was very proud of that.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.970
I said, but, Bashko,
you are also a thief.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.830
I said, these things
don't go together.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.960
I said, no same same.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.440
This was our language.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.360
And he laughed at
that because he

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.750
understood what I was saying.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.550
And I think it
pricked his conscience

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.590
because after a couple
of weeks, he kept--

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.860
over the next two weeks, he
kept coming back to the topic.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.689
And finally, he gave
me the justification

00:17:56.689 --> 00:17:57.980
that I think he took seriously.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.020
He said, Michael,
you are an infidel,

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.345
and the Quran says to
struggle with the infidel.

00:18:04.345 --> 00:18:07.510
And we are not
al-Shabaab, so we're not

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.610
fundamentalist terrorists.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.060
Al-Shabaab is the al-Qaeda
aligned group in Somalia.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.670
We're not going to just shoot
you for being an infidel.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.860
But we do think we
can take your money.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.380
Stealing from an
infidel isn't theft.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.166
I thought that was
a strange answer.

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:27.040
I've never heard that
interpretation of Islam

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.410
before much as I've
traveled around.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.530
But I thought it was
odd for another reason,

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.140
because Sufis are
meant to be very sort

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.700
of open-minded,
mystical Muslims,

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.830
and Boshko's answer had sort
of an edge of fundamentalism

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.220
in it, taking that
word in the Quran

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.860
very literally, that
word "struggle,"

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.650
and misinterpreting it
in just the right way.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.367
But that was the third
busted myth for me

00:18:52.367 --> 00:18:53.950
because before I
went, I really didn't

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.900
think any Muslim-oriented
pirates were going

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.830
to consider themselves
real Muslims

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.990
as long as they were
working as pirates.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.770
But it turns out that
centuries ago, Barbary pirates

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.570
were no different.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:12.100
In the 1600s and 1700s, the
great age of Barbary pirates,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.460
you had basically what was
a religious war going on

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.220
across the Mediterranean.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.960
There was a sort of
low-burning jihad involved

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.510
in these ships that sailed
off from North Africa

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.640
to capture Christian
ships in the Mediterranean

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.250
and take the people
back as hostages,

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.094
and that war absolutely
went in two directions.

00:19:30.094 --> 00:19:31.510
So in other words,
Christian ships

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.940
came down and
sacked Muslim towns

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:39.580
on what we now call
the Moroccan coast

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.820
and took hostages absolutely
for religious reasons.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.870
The religious motive was
the same in both directions.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.045
And this religious war
went on for centuries.

00:19:52.769 --> 00:19:53.810
I knew that a little bit.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.840
But when I was in Somalia and
I had time to think about it,

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.490
I had this feeling of
having slipped back in time.

00:20:02.292 --> 00:20:05.420
But hostages in those days, in
the 17th and 18th centuries,

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.580
were considered sort
of lost souls, people

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.880
who had dropped out
of Christian society,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.420
maybe turned Turk, which is
the very sort of offensive term

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.880
for converting to Islam.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.410
But one of the people who
did this who was captured

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.560
was Miguel Cervantes.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.670
He was held by Barbary
pirates for maybe five years.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.620
He was a soldier and,
with his brother,

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.560
he went out to a
battle somewhere else

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.780
in the Mediterranean
against the Ottoman Empire,

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.830
and it was on the way back
that his ship, close to Spain,

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.320
was actually captured
by some Barbary pirates.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.250
And the two Cervantes
brothers were taken and held

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.650
prisoner in the
bagnios of Algiers--

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.010
so underneath the
city of Algiers.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.010
Cervantes tried to
escape five times.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.400
I'm not sure where he
thought he was going to go.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.280
People considered
hostages in those days

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.410
to be somehow
compromised because--

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.010
and it's the same now--

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.820
they're a little
bit unfortunate,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.410
but also a little
bit morally suspect

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.770
because they've fallen into
the hands of the enemy.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.830
They've allowed themselves
to be used as pawns

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:21.520
or to raise money for
evil men, which is--

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.325
that's the point of a ransom.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:28.650
A criminal gang is raising
money for more criminality.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.950
And I felt that moral
compromise very deeply.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.450
In fact, I brooded
over it every day

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.240
and sometimes I
considered suicide.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.670
I had the idea that
getting rid of myself

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.640
would solve a bunch of problems.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.290
It would end the
problem at home.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.780
I knew my mother was suffering.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:51.450
It would save any SEAL team the
incredible risk of a mission

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.280
of trying to come get me.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.940
And once in 2014, I heard--

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.660
I had a radio at that point--
and I heard "The New York

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.450
Times" journalist
Rukmini Callimachi talk

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.250
about how some
European countries

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.300
sort of paid ransoms through
back channels for some people

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.590
being held by al-Qaeda in the
Maghreb in Western Africa,

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.240
and that just made
me feel awful.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.520
I just felt-- it inflamed
my sense of guilt.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.021
And I know Rukmini,
in the meantime,

00:22:20.021 --> 00:22:21.603
and I think she's
terrific and I think

00:22:21.603 --> 00:22:23.190
she's a very
wonderful journalist,

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.940
but this was my state
of mind at the time.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.060
And I was also angry.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.161
I was angry at the guards.

00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:33.660
Excuse me.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.310
I was angry at their bosses.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.340
I was angry at myself for
getting into that mess.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.430
And so every day in
Somalia, especially when

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:45.510
I was held alone, was this
sort of maddening cauldron

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.940
of anger terrible food.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.950
And it was another thing
I heard on the radio that

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.480
helped a little bit.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.410
At some point later in
2014, I heard a homily

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.591
by the pope, a new
pope, Pope Francis.

00:23:00.591 --> 00:23:01.840
I had never even heard of him.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.410
I didn't know what
happened to the old pope.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.130
But Pope Francis said something
about mercy, and he said,

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.405
mercy is like the
light of the sun.

00:23:11.405 --> 00:23:14.220
At night, you see
lots of stars and you

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.140
think about your sins
and your shortcomings,

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.330
just like the stars,
and then in the morning,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.120
the sun rises and
banishes all the stars.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.210
And he said, the
mercy of God is like

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.570
that because it banishes
your sins with its glory.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:32.540
And the idea was to, as a human,
was to pass it along somehow.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.690
And I found that when I made a
conscious decision to do that,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:41.220
to forgive people in your
life, including my guards,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.060
including my pirates, my
self-destructive feelings

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.670
of anger and guilt
and depression,

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.100
to a certain extent,
started to lessen.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.040
And another idea that was very
sort of hooked into that, which

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.980
I'm going to read about a
little bit from the book,

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.020
comes from stoic philosophy.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.789
So this also had
an influence on me.

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:07.580
This was also sort of
going through my mind

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.140
while I was there.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.670
I was thinking, in particular,
about the philosopher Epictetus

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.710
and some of his ideas.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:21.180
Epictetus was an early stoic
and he gave lectures in Rome.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.570
He was originally a Greek who
was crippled and originally

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.400
a slave.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.890
And so I'll read this passage
to you from late in the book

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.702
well after I had lost hope
that I would even see my family

00:24:33.702 --> 00:24:34.910
and friends or my home again.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.740
I thought of them, my family,
as shades from the past.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.580
I assumed my mother had packed
up my apartment in Berlin

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.500
and stuffed everything
into storage.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.640
I hadn't spoken to her in 14
or 15 months on the phone.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.310
I knew there was a chance that
this dim existence in Somalia

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.250
would end in gunfire or with
an unexpected hostage sale

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.900
to al-Shabaab, who wouldn't mind
having an American to destroy

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.230
in public.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.790
I assumed the past was gone.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.132
I just moved from one
moment to the next.

00:25:05.132 --> 00:25:07.340
But Epictetus said, in more
than one of his lectures,

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.910
that real human freedom
is a moral choice.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.700
It's the skill to
choose good over bad

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.730
and not to be distracted
by impressions.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.890
This turned out to
be a lot of work.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.220
By impressions, he meant
not just prejudice or reflex

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.720
or the first
impressions that we all

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.140
form about strangers, who
might be enemies of friends,

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.940
the sort of usual bending of the
light through a cognitive prism

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.780
that modern psychologists also
teach their clients to see,

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.510
but by impressions he also
meant the basic wrong impression

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.270
that good and bad can
be discovered out there

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:46.070
in the world among hordes of
uncontrollable other people.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.130
Sectarian strife, dissension,
blame and accusation,

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.660
ranting and raving--

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.450
they are all mere opinion, the
opinion that good and bad lie

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.030
outside, Epictetus said.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.800
Let someone transfer
these opinions

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.120
to the workings for the will and
I guarantee his peace of mind,

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.310
no matter what his outward
circumstances are like.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.580
That's what I did.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.382
I quit worrying about whether
the guards were good or bad.

00:26:14.382 --> 00:26:16.420
I turned that critical
power on myself

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.940
and I made a conscious
decision to forgive them,

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.030
and I quit feeling so
angry and suicidal.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.670
And I firmly believe
that that decision

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.735
is one reason I'm still alive.

00:26:27.735 --> 00:26:29.110
Without it, I
probably would have

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.740
killed someone, which would
have been suicidal in itself.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.090
And I believe that this sort
of inner moral decision,

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.010
a decision whether
to forgive or not

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:45.590
or whatever, is the only
real freedom we have,

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.410
no matter where we live, in
a mansion or on the street

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.100
or in a prison, wherever.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.220
So in the end, it took 2
and 1/2 years for my family

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.470
and a dedicated
team of negotiators

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.120
to get me out of Somalia.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.100
Ransom was $1.6 million.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.280
And on the last day,
the pirates delivered me

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.830
to the Galkayo
airport where I had

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.830
seen Ashwin fly away
without even telling

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.180
me what was going on at first.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.490
And they put me in a car and
handed me to another car,

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.410
and then finally I
drove up and there

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:26.240
was a plane waiting for me,
a Cessna, a small bush plane,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.074
piloted by a wonderful British
Kenyan named Derek who I know,

00:27:31.074 --> 00:27:31.740
in the meantime.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.320
He's a wonderful guy.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.850
He flew me to Mogadishu.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.000
And at the Mogadishu airport,
an American transport plane,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.300
C-130, landed and flew
me off to Nairobi.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.740
The ransom was raised by my
mother from family and friends

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.990
and some magazines
I had worked for,

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.040
some institutions in
the US and in Germany.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.830
And it was agonizing
for my family.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.990
A few days later,
several pirate bosses

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.080
had a shootout over that money.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:10.210
They had a disagreement about
who was supposed to get what

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.420
and five top bosses killed
each other, which made

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.940
the FBI's job a little easier.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.400
And one Somali
told me afterwards

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.899
that it was a kind
of a shame that I

00:28:19.899 --> 00:28:22.870
had been held for so long,
but the expense of holding me

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.090
for so long and then
that shootout afterwards

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.430
helped destroy the gang.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.020
I hope that's true.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.880
Some pirate gangs
are still working

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.570
in other branches of
business over in Somalia

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.410
even if it's not kidnapping
or hijacking ships.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.510
But I still feel
terribly humbled.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:47.370
I'm humbled by the horror of
the kidnapping and the horror

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.516
that it imposed on other
people, especially my family,

00:28:50.516 --> 00:28:52.140
and also by the
astonishing help that I

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.810
received from a lot of people.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.240
I can't forget it.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.596
And along with some of these
myths that the kidnapping

00:29:00.596 --> 00:29:02.220
managed to vaporize
for myself, there's

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.480
one other very important
and personal myth

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.630
that I think most of us walk
around with all the time,

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:10.590
and that is--

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.230
I mean, I can't speak for you,
but when I went to Somalia,

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.440
I had this idea that I knew
a thing or two about love,

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.520
that I somehow knew enough
to love enough to get

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.450
through an average day.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.450
But after my kidnapping,
my mind sort of flipped

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.199
through all the people
that I used to know

00:29:26.199 --> 00:29:28.559
and the pages of
my memory for days.

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.600
It was a little bit like
that cliche of your life

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.266
flipping before your
eyes before you get

00:29:32.266 --> 00:29:33.630
killed, except I wasn't killed.

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.829
I just thought I was
going to get killed

00:29:35.829 --> 00:29:37.620
and I had days and
weeks to think about it.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.090
And I remembered
the people that I

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:43.650
loved with a profound sense of
having failed to love enough.

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:47.900
And so if I can leave
you with one impression,

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.608
that would be it.

00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:52.100
I have this strong suspicion
that we don't love our families

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.220
enough from day to day.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.490
And that may be one of
the most popular myths.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.530
So if death gives
you a few moments

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.140
to think about it
before you kick off,

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.530
I'm thinking that might
be one of your thoughts,

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.490
that you fell short
or that you lived

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.790
into this illusory
cloak of anger and guilt

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:17.300
and self-recrimination and
blame, which are all intimately

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.850
related, and that you should
try to do a little more each day

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:24.060
to escape that
sort of evil cloak

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.370
and learn to love a little more
before your time comes around.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.680
I told you it
wouldn't be cheery.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.599
But I can take questions.

00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:39.140
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering,
it seems like if you were there

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.320
for a long time, was
boredom a real problem,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.900
or what did you
do to kind of keep

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.627
occupied other than thinking
about the stoic philosophers?

00:30:47.627 --> 00:30:48.710
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Yeah.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.170
Boredom was an
incredible problem.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:55.010
I didn't know what to
do most of the time.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.140
You just had to sit still.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.300
I did-- sometimes I
had pen and paper.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.010
So that helped.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.890
So I could do a little writing.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.920
Sometimes I just wrote in my
head and memorized things,

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.050
and I would come
up with long things

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.630
to memorize that I would
go through every morning--

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.040
so a kind of mental
routine in the morning.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.610
That helped too.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.580
And also, doing yoga helped.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.520
When I could, I did
yoga when I was being

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.130
held in prison houses on land.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.410
I actually asked the
pirates for a mat

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:31.220
and I could do about
an hour of that a day.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.140
But that was only one hour.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.660
So boredom was an
incredible problem.

00:31:38.339 --> 00:31:38.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.840
Thank you so much for
sharing your story.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.499
I'm sure it's not something
that's easy for you to do.

00:31:43.499 --> 00:31:44.790
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Thank you.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.290
AUDIENCE: One of
my favorite authors

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.590
is Viktor Frankl who wrote
"Man's Search for Meaning."

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.650
He wrote how hope got him
through the Holocaust.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:56.820
So I'm wondering if you have
any perspective on channeling

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.230
into hope and faith.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.010
And also, how did you
reintegrate back into the world

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.930
and seeing people
with smartphones

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.317
and lollygagging around
doing everyday things?

00:32:07.317 --> 00:32:08.400
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Yeah.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.358
That's a good question.

00:32:09.358 --> 00:32:11.070
I like Frankl, but
it's been a while

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:15.210
since I've read "Man's
Search for Meaning."

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:22.250
My relationship to hope
was it was complicated.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.710
I did not maintain hope.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.400
That was not the idea at all.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.580
And, in fact, it
wasn't until I learned

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.030
to detach myself from hoping
at all that I found a way

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.470
to survive.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.330
And actually, that's a
very important point.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.444
Hope has an underside.

00:32:36.444 --> 00:32:38.110
And if you keep going
through that cycle

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.429
from hope to despair,
which the pirates were

00:32:40.429 --> 00:32:42.970
happy to keep me doing because
they just kept telling me, oh,

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.928
you're going to get out
in two weeks or a month

00:32:44.928 --> 00:32:49.330
or whatever, it can be very
destructive, because every time

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.630
you go through the cycle,
you just feel worse.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:57.746
And I realized that if I didn't
somehow take care of that,

00:32:57.746 --> 00:32:59.650
it was going to get bad.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.320
So I learned to not hope.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.980
I learned to avoid hoping and
live without looking forward

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.630
to the future.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.270
And that was very instructive
because you can live like that.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.820
Americans don't like to
think so, but you can.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:17.200
And it was another
reason I'm still alive.

00:33:19.974 --> 00:33:21.640
What was the other
part of the question?

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.260
AUDIENCE: My other question
was about integrating back

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.280
into the world.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.363
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Yeah.

00:33:25.363 --> 00:33:27.505
Integrating back
was difficult, but--

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.679
so I got out and I
wasn't used to dealing

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:34.720
with people who liked me.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.492
I was so used to
dealing with, whenever

00:33:40.492 --> 00:33:41.950
I talked to someone
during the day,

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.380
dealing with having to
second guess what they meant

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.140
and wondering if I was
being lied to and just

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.650
saying something very simple
and brutal and that being it.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.450
The complicated way that we
interact in our own languages

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.680
is something that I had--

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.540
that part of my
brain had atrophied.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.970
So all the sort of
cues that people

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.910
get when they talk
around a subject

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.970
or just all the nonverbal ways
that we communicate really

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.100
overwhelmed me when
I first got out.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.340
So I could only be in the
room with a few people.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.300
But when I got out, I went to
Berlin and some of my family

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.650
had sort of congregated there.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:22.719
And we talked about what
they had done last week.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.639
We talked about really
ordinary things.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:29.080
And having a small room full of
people doing that every day--

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.719
when we had breakfast, for
example, at the hotel--

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.489
was a strain on
me, but it helped.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.949
And then after a while,
I could have a party

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:39.639
and see all my friends,
and slowly I got better.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.820
But it did take
about a year for me

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.170
to get back to full physical
and mental strength.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.219
And I don't take the mental
strength for granted at all.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.080
One psychologist
actually said to me

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.350
that he wasn't going to diagnose
me with PTSD, although I had

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.659
some symptoms, but
he said, we don't

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:59.864
like to put an extra
pathology to recover from.

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:01.780
So in other words, if
you think you have PTSD,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.860
that might be another
condition to recover from.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.409
And in my case, that
was the right approach.

00:35:06.409 --> 00:35:07.950
AUDIENCE: You have
a lot of strength.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.540
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for speaking.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.270
I was just wondering,
the way that you learned

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.570
to mentally and emotionally
survive in Somalia,

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.352
do you still try to
apply that today?

00:35:23.352 --> 00:35:24.560
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Oh yeah.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.320
Yeah, of course.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.480
Sometimes I have to remember.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:35.567
But yes, I don't think too
hard about the future anymore.

00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:36.650
I mean, of course, I plan.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:41.390
But you don't live for the
following week or the following

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.137
year.

00:35:43.137 --> 00:35:43.970
And I don't need to.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.970
And you have to learn to--

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:52.550
I can't get through
my average week

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.250
without learning to
slow down and forgive

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.750
people, all that kind of thing.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.640
And it's a question
of gratitude,

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.680
and when I forget
that I should be

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:07.469
grateful about just being alive,
I find ways to remind myself.

00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:08.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.300
That was definitely
a captivating story.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.400
Thank you.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.100
I wanted to ask, because
I've been hearing words

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.980
like "hope" and "faith" and it's
getting me to think about some

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.810
of the Christian virtues--

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:23.200
and it seems like through
your profound suffering

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.250
and that experience,
you came to a very deep,

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.580
probably an extraordinarily
deep understanding of themes

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:35.860
like freedom and
forgiveness and love.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.820
So are you thankful for
that experience itself

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:44.197
beyond just escaping that, but
just having gone through that?

00:36:44.197 --> 00:36:45.280
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Yeah.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.821
That's a tough question.

00:36:46.821 --> 00:36:47.320
Not yet.

00:36:49.701 --> 00:36:51.450
I might have to work
on that a little bit.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.100
But yes, I'm grateful
for coming out

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.790
of it and for coming out
of it with a few things

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.500
to think about.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.910
That-- yeah.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.340
Hope is tricky.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.890
I try-- you can't
have this experience

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:17.730
and then pretend that it
doesn't belong to you.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.170
You have to go back and forth
even if it seems like a dream

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.780
now, which it does sometimes.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:30.740
So you have to let it
be there and you have

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.970
to take from it what you can.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.100
AUDIENCE: Why do you
suppose the US decided

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.430
to save the other two
hostages but not you?

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:41.560
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE:
Probably just circumstances.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.840
I think when they plan
something like that,

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.357
everything has to line up,
including the intelligence.

00:37:46.357 --> 00:37:48.940
You don't want operators going
in there if the intelligence is

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.380
wrong or somehow shaky.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.970
An abundance of
caution, probably.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.100
I suspect there
were plans to get me

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.900
and it was just a question
of the stars didn't align.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.267
I'd rather be a hostage
under a cautious president

00:38:05.267 --> 00:38:06.100
than a reckless one.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.173
But while I was there, I was
like, someone just come get me,

00:38:13.173 --> 00:38:13.672
you know?

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:20.110
AUDIENCE: I find that you tapped
into the ability of forgiveness

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:23.470
to be one of the main
healing and motivating

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.910
factors for survival.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:28.090
And I guess my question
is, how did you keep, even

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.760
with that in mind, from
being like Cervantes

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.430
and trying to escape five times?

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:36.292
I think if I was in that
situation, a month or two in,

00:38:36.292 --> 00:38:37.750
it wouldn't be
suicide, it would be

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.180
like, I'm going to take as many
of these guys with me as I can,

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:40.630
right?

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.990
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Oh yeah.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.156
No, that was the temptation.

00:38:42.156 --> 00:38:45.240
And that was the idea
that I had more than once,

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.990
especially-- so there
were several phases.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.760
I was held in the
Bush with Rolly

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.345
and then I was held on a
ship a lot like that one.

00:38:51.345 --> 00:38:53.470
We could see that ship from
where we were anchored.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.260
This was just on the
beach near Hobyo.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.260
And we were on a very
similar model of tuna vessel.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.560
The ship was-- there were
plenty of other hostages there,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.440
so I wasn't thinking about--

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.360
to keep me company.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.930
So I had people to talk
to besides pirates.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.570
After the ship-- so first
of all, I did try to escape.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.310
I jumped off the ship.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.690
That's a totally
different story.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:21.730
But it's in the book.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:25.660
And after that, I
was taken on onshore

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.780
and I was being held alone
in these prison houses.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.200
And that's when I had
those temptations.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.030
That's when I wanted
to grab a Kalashnikov

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:36.446
and start shooting the guards
or shoot myself or whatever.

00:39:36.446 --> 00:39:37.420
It came up slowly.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.329
I mean-- but at
some point, I had

00:39:40.329 --> 00:39:41.620
to wrestle with those feelings.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.370
And of course, even after
I forgave them in my mind

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:52.690
and reoriented my head, I
thought about how to escape,

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.950
how I can get out, whatever.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:57.130
I heard one story about a
French guy in Mali, I think,

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.100
who was being held by
Islamists who did get out.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.550
And for a while, he was my hero.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.900
I heard a report on the BBS.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.710
And I'm like, I want
to be like that guy.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.560
But he found a way to lock one
of his guards in the bathroom

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.290
while he prayed, separated
him from his gun.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.730
And I'm like, well,
OK, first of all,

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:16.750
he had a guard who
prayed in the bathroom,

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.140
the bathroom was lockable,
he left the gun outside,

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.285
all these things, and
then he could get keys

00:40:22.285 --> 00:40:23.410
to get out of the compound.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.910
I didn't have any of those.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:29.020
And then, he had a fairly
friendly population

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.340
when he got outside.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:36.980
I couldn't quite-- but
I had plans, believe me.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.620
And the question
was, from day to day,

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.042
whether it's worth it to try.

00:40:41.042 --> 00:40:43.000
So some of the plans were
violent, some of them

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.600
weren't, and you don't know.

00:40:48.504 --> 00:40:49.920
AUDIENCE: Can I
ask your question?

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.975
AUDIENCE: Yeah, go ahead.

00:40:51.975 --> 00:40:53.600
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for being here

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.770
and sharing your story.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.520
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE:
Thank you for coming.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.154
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for sure.

00:40:58.154 --> 00:40:59.820
I guess I wanted to
ask, how long did it

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.550
take you to decide
to write the book

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.990
and whether you just struggled--

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.240
I mean, you're a
reporter by trade

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.710
and I'm sure you at least were
thinking about, if I got out,

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:14.070
I might write a book and tell
people about this experience--

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.680
but did you struggle at all
with whether you wanted to do it

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.220
or not?

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:22.380
And then kind of what does
life look like for you

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.220
now in terms of your
writing and what

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.880
you're doing professionally?

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.810
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: So I'm a
writer and an author primarily.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.750
I certainly was
thinking about a book

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.927
while I was there because
I had gone there to write

00:41:35.927 --> 00:41:37.510
one kind of book,
and all of a sudden,

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.426
I realized I was going
to be writing a hostage

00:41:39.426 --> 00:41:41.090
memoir, if I got out.

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.322
But after a while,
I stopped thinking

00:41:43.322 --> 00:41:44.280
I was going to get out.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.830
I just-- it was no
longer part of the plan.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.720
And the first
couple of times when

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.370
I had my hands on
some notebooks,

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.620
I obviously tried to take
notes so I could have

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.420
something for when I got out.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.010
But those notes
were taken twice.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.320
And then I went for a
long time with nothing,

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.020
and then when I got
paper and pen again,

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.861
I started to write not
about what was going on.

00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:09.610
So if something really
important happened,

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.350
I might make a note in German.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:14.471
But the guards would look
at what I was writing,

00:42:14.471 --> 00:42:16.720
I think because sometimes I
wrote incriminating things

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.110
in the previous notebooks
and I got them punished.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.200
So they would sort of scan my
English for their own names

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.370
and place names and
things like that.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:30.204
So I made sure to draft a novel.

00:42:30.204 --> 00:42:31.870
And after a while,
they're like, is this

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.280
the made-up story
about the fish?

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:33.905
I'm like, yeah.

00:42:33.905 --> 00:42:36.062
They're like, what
are you doing?

00:42:36.062 --> 00:42:37.520
They didn't understand
that at all.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.410
So I left with notebooks that
included the draft of a novel.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.260
My worry when I got
out was whether I

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.720
had remembered enough, not
having taken assiduous notes

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.780
every day, for a book.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.300
And I'm happy to say I did.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.450
I didn't get down to writing it
for the first couple of months.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:02.860
But once I did, I was happy
to see that it was flowing

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.324
and that I had to boil
down what I remembered.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.770
That's it.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:10.750
I mean, I don't
think I doubted I

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.060
was going to write a
book once I was free.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.207
But it took a long time.

00:43:14.207 --> 00:43:15.790
I mean, I'm glad I
had a publisher who

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:20.980
gave me the time to do it
and make it a decent book.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.070
Now I'm working on that novel.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.640
And I'm also working on--

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.040
I also work on the board
of Hostage US, which

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.030
is a very good nonprofit
that helps hostage

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:35.164
families behind the scenes just
to deal with what they're going

00:43:35.164 --> 00:43:36.580
through, because
when I got out, I

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.163
noticed that talking
to other hostages

00:43:38.163 --> 00:43:41.230
was far more effective
for me than talking even

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.640
to a psychologist.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.710
Someone who's been
through that is

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.530
very helpful to other people,
and that goes for the families

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:52.360
too, and Hostage US tries
to put those people together

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.713
and create networks like that.

00:43:54.713 --> 00:43:56.706
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:56.706 --> 00:43:58.580
AUDIENCE: So some of my
question was actually

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.360
what you just asked about what
you were going to work on next

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.900
and how this
experience would change

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.430
what you would
want to write about

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:11.280
or what kind of journalism
you'd want to do going forward,

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.300
especially because the things
that you've said about suicide,

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.070
for example, and depression
and finding a path

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.720
to loving yourself so that
you could forgive people

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.900
sounds a lot more
spiritual than maybe

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.080
some of your prior work
on the history of surfing.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:34.190
And so I guess I'm
wondering if that's going

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.650
to compel you after your novel.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.547
You might branch
into that direction.

00:44:39.547 --> 00:44:41.630
And I guess I'm also kind
of secondarily wondering

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:43.250
if you think you're
ever, ever, ever

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:46.340
going to go back to Somalia.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.550
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: The
second answer is easy-- no.

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:51.770
I mean, it would
really have to change,

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.840
security wise,
for me to go back.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:59.300
But I think it's not that
different from what you think.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.050
Those themes are obviously
important to me now,

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.360
the spiritual dimension
and the notion

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.166
of depression and survival.

00:45:08.166 --> 00:45:09.800
Those themes are very important.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:14.910
But all my books up
till now, on some level,

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.640
including the book
about surfing,

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.020
have been about freedom.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:23.840
And so from that point of view,
I'm still mining the same vein.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:29.147
But that's an abstract idea and
I can take it in any direction.

00:45:29.147 --> 00:45:31.730
And that was true about my first
book, too, which was a novel.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.730
And it actually had some
spiritual ideas too.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.710
This experience
obviously sharpened

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:40.440
some of those ideas of what
human freedom actually means.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.160
But that's why I read you
the quote about Epictetus

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.176
is that that was
his central theme.

00:45:47.176 --> 00:45:48.800
In fact, I think that
quote is probably

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.470
from a book called
"On Human Freedom."

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.970
Those are big
questions, and they're

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:56.014
going to be interesting to
me for the rest of my life.

00:45:56.014 --> 00:45:56.930
AUDIENCE: I'm curious.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.490
You're talking about
the relationship

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.930
you had with the guard and
then the other people there.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:05.220
So when you were leaving, what
were your parting words to them

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:05.887
and them to you?

00:46:05.887 --> 00:46:06.970
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE: Yeah.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.880
It was weird because
on the last day,

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.430
they had to convince me
that I was going free.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.650
I had gotten so used
to not hoping and not

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:16.809
believing the things they were
telling me that when they said

00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:18.600
there's a car here,
you're going to go out,

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:23.410
we're going to take you to
the airport, don't believe it.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:24.780
You can tell me whatever.

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.850
And then they said,
well, pack your things.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:28.330
You're going to go.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:28.830
OK.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.870
I guess I'll pack
whatever little things I

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:31.860
had into this bag.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.360
But then they shook my hand.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:34.860
OK.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.855
I guess I'll shake your hand.

00:46:36.855 --> 00:46:37.980
They smiled and everything.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.550
I'm like, yeah, no--

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:41.610
whatever.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.550
I started to believe
then that I was probably

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:49.060
going to get shifted somewhere,
probably to another gang,

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.350
and that was it.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.570
I mean, they did attempt
a formal goodbye,

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:58.510
but it was this weird
sort of tense situation

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:02.110
where I wasn't sure whether
to believe them or not.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:08.080
AUDIENCE: What happened to
your fellow captors, the two

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:08.620
fishermen?

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.220
MICHAEL SCOTT MOORE:
The two fishermen?

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.050
AUDIENCE: How did they escape?

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.600
MICHAEL SCOTT
MOORE: So those guys

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.210
got out after a full
year in Somalia,

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.490
also I think with a ransom.

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:24.520
They wound up in the
Seychelles by November of 2012.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.850
So I knew Rolly for
about eight months there

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.390
at the beginning of 2012.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:33.150
And then after I left the
ship, he also left the ship,

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:37.230
and they put him back together
with Marc, and they flew away.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:40.170
My pilot, Derek, by the
way, also flew them out,

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:42.300
and he told me that within
the first few minutes

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.610
of our flight out of Galkayo.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:45.600
I couldn't believe it.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.385
Somebody knew friends of mine.

00:47:48.385 --> 00:47:50.010
SPEAKER: I think
that's going to be it.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.718
Let's give him another
round of applause.

00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:54.140
[APPLAUSE]
