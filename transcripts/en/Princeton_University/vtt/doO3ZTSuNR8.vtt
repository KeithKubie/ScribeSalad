00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.800 position:97%
Myra Gupta:
a murder at an Indian wedding over the summer and we thought, "Hey, that'd be a great idea

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.289
Anjali Bisaria:
for a play!"

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.079 position:91%
Anjali Bisaria:
on original plays. We write two original plays every year.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.829 position:95%
Myra Gupta:
We're one of the only theater groups that actually does that.

We focus on South Asian culture and heritage and the shared experience of Indians and South

Anjali Bisaria:
Asians in both the states and in India.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.129 position:98%

And usually through the lens of humor because these issues can get a little heavy sometimes

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.769 position:70%
Myra Gupta:
and we like to take a comedic approach to it.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.879 position:98%

There's absolute pandemonium in this house. I can't stand it a minute longer.

Myra Gupta:
Right after the bride, Amita, has found that the pandit has been murdered at the pooja before the wedding,

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.980 position:97%
Myra Gupta:
she's getting ready for bed, and she's also expressing some of her

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.270 position:98%
Myra Gupta:
nervousness about getting married and of course the fact that someone was murdered at her

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.939 position:97%
Myra Gupta:
wedding to her sister, and her maid is helping her tweeze her eyebrows because she

Myra Gupta:
wants to make sure everything is ready for the wedding.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.340 position:98%

So, Amita, I guess the big question here is: Are you still getting married in two days?

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.180 position:98%
Rachita Jain:
Of course I am. At least, I think so. I'm not sure how things will work out from here on...

Nobody has ever been murdered at my wedding before... OUCH! Bai, that hurt!

Arrey, Beti, your eyebrows are a jungle! Deforestation is not without pain!

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.350 position:97%
Anjali Bisaria:
What's great about a murder mystery is, at a wedding, is that we actually get to incorporate

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.009 position:97%
Anjali Bisaria:
a lot of different aspects of South Asian culture that we don't normally get to, like:

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.159 position:97%
Anjali Bisaria:
large families, ridiculous food, ridiculous parties, all those kinds of things ...

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.750 position:98%
Myra Gupta:
... crazy relatives, over-the-top accents, all of that fun stuff.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.170 position:98%
Anjali Bisaria:
All of those things that are quintessential to a wedding, and we can really

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.880
Anjali Bisaria:
bring that together.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:07.619 position:97%
Sanchali Pal:
So first, we will cleanse your aura and remove the essence of the murder. Animbu pani swati om shanti nami nazar ...

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.680 position:56%
Shloka Mehta:
This is going to be a great success!

I'm really glad this is on film. We love each other in PSAT! We love each other!

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.580

This is embarrassing.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.750 position:58%

Haha. This is actually on film? Haha.
