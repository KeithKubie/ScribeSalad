FITZ: We're back.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.000
And we're here to talk about the
history of I/O with some

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.220
people who have been to a
number of Google I/Os.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.750
BEN: And I know that you and
I, Fitz, have been to every

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.470
single Google I/O. So
we've watched it

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.690
evolve over the years.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.460
We're going to talk to some
people who have also been here

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.370
from early days, and get their
opinions on how I/O has

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.310
changed over time.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.730
FITZ: Absolutely.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.070
So, hi.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.960
What's your name?

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.030
KEVIN NILSON: Yeah,
I'm Kevin Nilson.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.910
I'm the VP of Engineering
at just.me.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.630
And just.me is a start up in the
mobile social space that's

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.630
inside of Google Startup Labs
funded by Google Ventures and

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.619
many others.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.740
And one of the other things that
I do is I'm the leader

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.750
the Silicon Valley Google
Developer Group.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.480
FITZ: So our viewers here have
seen you quite a bit in the

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.580
countdown to I/O lately.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.030
Tell us a little more
about that.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.210
KEVIN NILSON: Yeah, there was a
nice blog series with a lot

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.150
of us that kind of highlighted
some of our past experiences,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.660
because we've got experiences in
a lot of I/Os, and kind of

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.730
what we were excited about
coming in to I/O. And I think

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.460
it's going to be a really
great event so far.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.830
BEN: So this is the fifth Google
I/O. And you were here

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.260
for the very first.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.670
Can you tell us what brought you
in to begin with and what

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.610
that experience was like--

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.150
FITZ: What was it like, yeah?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.580
BEN: --back in 2008?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.220
KEVIN NILSON: So I've always
really been inspired by Google

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.980
and what they do.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.940
And I think I/O is a
really great thing.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.100
Starting from the early days and
watching it grow to what

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.080
it's become today--

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.580
there's an interesting quote
from Tor on the Android

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.500
Eclipse team.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.430
And what he said is that I/O
today is a lot like JavaOne in

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.570
the glory days.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.530
And a lot of great
announcements, new releases,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.810
new things that we're
all excited

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.480
about are being launched.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.350
And I really feel that momentum,
being a long time a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.280
veteran of JavaOne and seeing
this grow to what that wishes

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.440
it could be.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380
FITZ: Well, you worked with
a ton of different Google

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.930
technologies.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.190
Tell us a little bit about some
of the technologies you

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.990
worked with when you were
coming to the first I/O.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.910
KEVIN NILSON: So when I first
started with I/O, I was very

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.560
excited about Google Maps.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.830
There was a lot of great
things with Maps.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.630
I think a lot of Web 2.0 was
defined by Maps and what was

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.420
done in Google Maps.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.390
And then, as things progressed,
I started doing

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.440
more HTML5 and working
with Chrome.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.800
And those topics were
very interesting.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.100
And then today, I spent--

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.180
I think almost every session
I've been to, maybe every

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.960
session I've been to, has
been Android related.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.450
So I think the timeliness
of all the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.100
sessions at Google I/O--

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.820
and now, I imagine next year,
and maybe the rest of this

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.570
I/O, I'll be attending a lot of
the cloud computing topics

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.630
that are out there.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.460
BEN: I was going to say, so
what are you hoping to see

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.850
more of next year at I/O?

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.610
What are you looking
forward to?

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.520
KEVIN NILSON: It's hard
to say what I'll be

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.810
doing a year from now.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.200
But I know today I think
the Jelly Bean

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.250
stuff is really exciting.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.290
Kind of one of the things that
was just amazing for me was

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.680
some of the stuff that they
launched around the ability to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.040
inject things into the back
stack, often notifications.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.300
And that's something that I
spent the last month on and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.000
off whiteboarding a solution
on how I thought

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.150
I could solve that.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.960
And then here, that's been
rolled right into the API,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.230
because I guess others
have been having the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.760
same problems as me.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.940
And I'm excited to go back and
just utilize what I learned.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.540
BEN: That's fantastic.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.490
Wow.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.580
FITZ: So we've started off
with the first year that

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.720
there's been some great
giveaways, some interesting

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.970
pieces of hardware.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.260
Have you gotten your bag
of awesome hardware?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.960
What are you excited
about with that?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.400
KEVIN NILSON: Yeah, there's
a lot of neat things.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.890
So the Galaxy Nexus
is really great.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.330
So I actually got a
few months ago.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.920
I ordered it out of Europe.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.110
It's extremely fast.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.090
I love that.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.640
And then, last night I was
actually up until 2:30 in the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.790
morning taking our app at
just.me and trying to run it

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.370
on the Nexus 7.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.680
And it was kind of great to see
that fully enriched, kind

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.380
of larger, seven-inch display
and what it can

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.430
bring for the future.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.570
BEN: Do you have any plans to be
a tester for Google Glass?

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.680
KEVIN NILSON: Well, I haven't
ordered one yet.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.810
But I'm keeping my
fingers crossed.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.330
Maybe I'll get one some day.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.210
But all the great giveaways--

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.390
what, for me, about the Nexus
7 that was really cool was

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.820
that it actually fits
in my pocket.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.010
I'm not sure that it fits
in everyone's pocket.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.990
But it's a tablet that
is small enough

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.030
to fit in my pocket.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.800
BEN: Very convenient.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.160
FITZ: We've been here
every year.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.810
It feels to me like the
energy this year is

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.130
just off the charts.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.245
Can you talk a little bit about
some of the things that

00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:32.870
have changed and how
you've seen I/O

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.100
evolve over the years?

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.000
KEVIN NILSON: Yeah, I think
they've done a great job to

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.460
integrate all the partners.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.120
And you go out into the demo
grounds, and there's so many

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.510
great things that people are
doing, innovative things on

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.190
top of Google technology.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.940
And I think that's something
that's probably where I've

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.960
seen the most change from
the early I/Os.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.920
There were virtually no booths,
nothing going on.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.300
You could just see
the sessions.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.300
And that was all.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.950
And then, over time, there's
been more and more.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.560
And today, it's almost
no Google

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.690
things out in that area.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.120
So it's more the partners.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.100
BEN: It's exciting to see the
ecosystem evolve, isn't it?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.670
KEVIN NILSON: Absolutely.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.770
BEN: It really is.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.640
Great.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.800
Well, thank you for chatting
with us here.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.370
I think it's great to have
you here all these years.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.940
And--

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.510
FITZ: Maybe we can talk to you
more next year at I/O '13.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.140
KEVIN NILSON: I'm very excited
about Google I/O 2013.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.800
FITZ: Thanks a lot, Kevin.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.600
BEN: Thank you.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.290
Hello again.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.060
We've got another I/O attendee
here who's been

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.300
coming for a few years.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.310
And what's your name?

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.570
WILL SMIDLEIN: Will Smidlein.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.020
BEN: OK.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.560
And Will, this is your second,
third, or something?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.680
WILL SMIDLEIN: Third, yeah.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.332
I started coming in 2010.

00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:39.774
BEN: That's fantastic.

00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:43.140
And how did you get into
programming to begin with?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.550
WILL SMIDLEIN: When I was
really little, I was

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.000
exploring the web.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.860
And I wanted to know how
websites worked.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.840
So I went to the library and
grabbed a book on it and

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.460
figured it out.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.030
And then after a little bit of
that, I decided to make them

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.430
functional, dynamic.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.010
And so I started learning
languages like that.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.740
And I saw I/O--

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.190
BEN: So, wait.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.020
Way back there you
said library.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.510
Is that like Wikipedia?

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.310
Is that some new thing?

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.350
WILL SMIDLEIN: At some
point in time, I

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.380
think there was books.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.640
I don't know.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.800
BEN: Made of trees?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.030
That's crazy.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.470
No.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.680
So, you actually taught yourself
programming languages

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.920
on your own?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.290
WILL SMIDLEIN: Yep.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.790
Yeah, I've always taught myself
programming and every

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.250
new language I learn.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.910
FITZ: So we couldn't help but
notice your name tag, which

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.310
you're not wearing at the
moment, said something that no

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.210
one else's name tags
here says.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.000
Can you tell me what it says?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.990
WILL SMIDLEIN: It says, youngest
developer at I/O.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.260
FITZ: Youngest developer
at I/O. And

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.620
exactly how old are you?

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.320
WILL SMIDLEIN: I'm 15.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.203
FITZ: So when you first
came here, you were?

00:06:36.203 --> 00:06:38.080
WILL SMIDLEIN: 13--

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.610
12?

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.430
BEN: 12.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.300
FITZ: So that's pretty
incredible.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.630
What kind of advice would you
have for other people who are

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.910
12, 13, 14, 15 for coming to
I/O, or getting involved in

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.560
programming, or anything
like that?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.670
WILL SMIDLEIN: Just
start programming.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.110
I mean, do it fun.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.630
Don't worry about making a
product or making a name for

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.290
yourself or anything.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.380
I mean, you don't really
have to worry about it

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.270
until you're older.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.370
So just learn while you can.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.250
I mean, that's why I'm here.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.850
I'm here to learn.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.150
FITZ: So follow what you're
interested in?

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.980
WILL SMIDLEIN: Exactly.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.780
FITZ: You came to the first I/O,
second-- well, not the

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.040
first I/O, but your first I/O.
Tell me a little bit about

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.680
what that felt like, your
first time here.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.040
WILL SMIDLEIN: Well, it was
pretty incredible, because the

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.760
I/O staff made a specific
exception to let me come as

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.390
long as I brought
my dad along.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.630
And I just sat in awe at the
first keynote as they

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.910
announced all these things
that I was used

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.700
to reading on blogs.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.640
And I was right there.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.700
And it's always amazing to me
what they come up with next

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.200
year and next year and
the year after that.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.540
And it's pretty crazy.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.470
BEN: Now, do you have any
friends that you do

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.560
programming with?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.060
Is it purely a solo activity
right now?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.330
WILL SMIDLEIN: No.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.250
I mean, one of the main reasons
I come to I/O is to

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.030
meet up with all the people
from GitHub, and IRC, and

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.430
Twitter, and put faces with
the names beyond Twitter

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.050
profile pictures, and just
interact with people.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.650
BEN: Yeah, it's great to see
people in real life.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.440
I've found the same
at conferences.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.410
It's a big deal.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.050
At this year's conference, are
there particular areas that

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.920
you've been listening in
on or learning from?

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.480
WILL SMIDLEIN: I'm really
excited about the stuff that

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.220
Google is doing with the cloud,
cloud computing, all

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.060
those cores.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.600
This morning, for the demo,
that was pretty crazy.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.980
So I'm interested to see how
that's going to work out for

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.170
development purposes.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.930
BEN: Do you have any ideas on
what to do with all those

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.159
cores, crazy ideas?

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.299
WILL SMIDLEIN: Calculate
all of pi.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.270
BEN: All of it.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.289
WILL SMIDLEIN: All of it.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.669
BEN: That's going to take
a little while.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.020
FITZ: A lot of our viewers out
there will know that they've

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.310
seen you on the countdown to
I/O. So you were involved in

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.930
some of that stuff.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.970
Tell me a little more about
your countdown to I/O.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.560
WILL SMIDLEIN: So before I/O,
I got a nice little email

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.540
saying, hey, do you want
to be part of this?

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.550
And I said, sure.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.120
I kind of want to give an
intro, and get other

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.210
developers excited for I/O.
Because it is exciting.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.870
FITZ: What are some of the
most exciting things this

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.550
year, other than, of course,
people jumping out of blimps

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.630
with Glass on their face?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.390
WILL SMIDLEIN: Like I said,
the cloud computing, the

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.130
Google Glass.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.930
You know, actually being able
to pre-register for that is

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.820
pretty cool.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.990
FITZ: Now, did you pre-register
for that?

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.090
WILL SMIDLEIN: Well,
of course.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.530
FITZ: Do you have
a credit card?

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.380
WILL SMIDLEIN: Maybe.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:17.830
FITZ: OK.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.010
All right.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.100
WILL SMIDLEIN: And then the
Android, the Ice Cream

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.515
Sandwich, really cool the speed
that's coming with that.

00:09:26.515 --> 00:09:27.190
FITZ: Jelly Bean?

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.192
WILL SMIDLEIN: Right, right.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.580
I just said Ice Cream
Sandwich.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.320
Some of the web stuff, the demos
today, just basically

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.230
everything.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.470
FITZ: So it sounds like you've
really absorbed all the

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:37.920
conference.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.770
You've got all the sessions.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.570
You've got people you're
meeting up with.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.530
WILL SMIDLEIN: Yeah.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.710
That's why I come.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.110
BEN: Do you have any advice for
other folks your age, I

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.910
guess, who want to get involved
in programming,

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.930
specific to this conference or
come to this conference?

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.160
Have you thought about
inviting other folks?

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.400
WILL SMIDLEIN: Yeah, I mean,
just start learning.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.150
Pick a language.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.090
Get really good at it.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.070
Start making stuff with it.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.320
And if you open source it,
show people you can code.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.830
And people will take interest.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.750
It's a very natural
progression.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.460
BEN: I like that advice.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.270
We're big open source
guys ourselves.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.170
And so that's a great
way to get started.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.940
We always talk about how it's
sort of the internship that

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.560
you get for free if you
participate in open source.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.060
FITZ: When you're on the
internet programming, no one

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.900
knows that you're
14 years old.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.810
BEN: Or a dog.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.010
FITZ: Or a dog.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.540
All right.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.180
Thanks a lot, Will, for
coming to talk to us.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:25.420
BEN: Great to meet you.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.850
FITZ: We hope to see you
there next year.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:26.985
WILL SMIDLEIN: OK.

00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:27.410
Good.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.750
FITZ: Take it easy.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.290
Bye-bye.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.380
OK, now we're here with
another Google Ion.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.730
That is someone who has attended
all five Google I/Os.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.540
And what's your name?

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.620
VINCENT NGUYEN: I'm Vincent
Nguyen, editor-in-chief of

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.470
SlashGear and Android
Community.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.510
FITZ: Tell everybody about

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.010
SlashGear and Android Community.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.330
VINCENT NGUYEN: SlashGear
is more of a tech site,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.930
everything, review, news.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.120
Android Community
is 24/7 Android.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.690
So it started a little
bit before the

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.220
first Google I/O, obviously.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.800
I remember when it was
the first event.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.220
And people just walked in.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.930
There was no queue.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.200
And it was kind of cool.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.150
Nowadays, you know, you've got
a queue of like six bazillion

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.380
people wrapped around
the building.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.230
It's changed so much.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.650
BEN: That's true.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.730
And in 2008, Android was
pretty new, right?

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.510
And so your community was new.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.270
VINCENT NGUYEN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.386
BEN: Yeah, it was barely
there, right?

00:11:15.386 --> 00:11:16.338
So--

00:11:16.338 --> 00:11:16.814
VINCENT NGUYEN: Exactly.

00:11:16.814 --> 00:11:18.064
But we were there.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.490
We were one of the first on
the internet writing about

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.300
Android, covering the news.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.790
And it was kind of cool
to be a part--

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.070
to take part in history--

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.560
taking a part of something
that was really big.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.370
And obviously now, with a
bazillion of these Androids

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.790
floating around-- and the whole
Jelly Bean is kind of

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.320
cool, because different colors,
different version of

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.110
Android, different devices,
tablet, phones, and whatnot.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.170
So--

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.690
BEN: So you've really gotten to
watch Android evolve over

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.260
the years, not just in
the products, but

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.320
at the show as well.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.290
VINCENT NGUYEN: Not just watch
but actively participating in

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.380
reviewing the different products
that's available

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.450
today, whether it's
a tablet, phone.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.810
We've seen it grow
into Q, right?

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.380
I mean, it's such a cool
product that was just

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.080
announced yesterday.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.080
FITZ: So what are some of the
great things you've seen this

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.380
year at I/O that have really
gotten you excited?

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.570
VINCENT NGUYEN: Well, first of
all, a bunch of dudes jumping

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.460
out of an airplane
wearing Glasses.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.050
And we saw it live.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.900
I mean, that's not something
we expected.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.100
FITZ: I've got to say, I didn't
expect that either.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:19.900
VINCENT NGUYEN: Yeah,
we didn't either.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.040
Next year, I think the only
thing to top it would be like

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.150
a big pair of Glasses on
a self driving car.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.370
FITZ: The car will drive
itself here.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.460
VINCENT NGUYEN: Exactly,
on stage.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.360
BEN: Can it navigate its way
down maybe on to the building

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.490
if we put a glider on it.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.080
It could be good.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.830
VINCENT NGUYEN: That
would be cool.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.290
I would definitely
expect that.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.220
FITZ: We can't do any
pre-announcements for 2013.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.920
But we'll definitely put that
in the suggestion box.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.040
VINCENT NGUYEN: Appreciate it.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.730
BEN: So are you an Android
developer yourself?

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:51.950
VINCENT NGUYEN: OK, when it
comes to code, the farther you

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.790
want me away from it is probably
best, because I start

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.050
breaking stuff.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.930
If it's not broken, you have
me in there, I'll start

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.480
breaking it.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.090
That's why I have a good team
to do all that stuff.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.340
BEN: You sound like a great
QA person, actually.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.600
VINCENT NGUYEN: Yes, yes.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.550
I do the testing.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.670
I do the review.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.020
I love to just get in there
and tear things up, and

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.810
try to break it.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.270
But as long as I don't have
to fix it, I'm good.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.080
FITZ: So what kind of terrible
things have you done to the

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.090
awesome Nexus seven-inch
tablet that you got?

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.300
VINCENT NGUYEN: Awesome,
well--

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.320
BEN: It's only been a day.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:22.990
VINCENT NGUYEN: It's
only been a day.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.500
FITZ: Have you broken it?

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.110
Be honest.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.440
VINCENT NGUYEN: No, I
haven't broken it.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.080
It's a really good device.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.630
The price is awesome.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.130
It's fast.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.850
And it's just really nice
and comfortable to

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.450
hold in your hand.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.440
I don't recommend breaking it.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.800
It's such a good device.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.140
It's a shame.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.120
FITZ: I totally agree
with you.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.750
I can't wait to try out mine.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.000
BEN: Do you have plans to
use your Q at home?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.650
Or are you just going
to dissect it?

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.080
VINCENT NGUYEN: Well, I do
have plans to use it.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.720
In terms of how long--

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.720
because products cycle through
every couple days for me.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.880
I mean, I'm hoping it's one
device that I'm going to have

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.030
around for a long
period of time.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.990
And especially with the
ecosystem I have in my house,

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.050
I've got Apple.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.210
I've got Android.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.080
I've got to bounce back and
forth between the two.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.350
So it gets kind of hairy.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.330
FITZ: So you were also on the
countdown to Android--

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.660
I mean to count down to Google
I/O. Well, you were the count

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.350
down to Android, back in
the day, I suppose.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.730
Tell us a little
bit about that.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.370
VINCENT NGUYEN: It
was kind of cool.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.960
I mean, it was great to be a
part of it and to be here.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.690
FITZ: Is it cool to have been a
part of something since day

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.220
one and all here five
years later and

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.080
see where we're going?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.890
VINCENT NGUYEN: Absolutely.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.510
I mean, I wouldn't
change a thing.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.130
I mean, to be here five years
later, to see Android where it

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.460
is today and--

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.690
like I say, it's not just
being a part of--

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.220
like a historian, if you
will, we're recording

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.240
the history of Android.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.570
But we're actively participating
in its growth.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.520
And so, that's where
we take our pride.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.270
BEN: Have you gotten to connect
to other people in

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.310
your community, people
who read your site?

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.120
Have you met any of them here
or any of the folks?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.260
VINCENT NGUYEN: Funny you
should bring that up.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.300
I mean, that's a neat thing,
because a lot of the times we

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.790
work with these developers--

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.080
reviewing their apps
and whatnot.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.500
But to be here, and connecting
with them, and meeting them in

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.390
person, saying, hi.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.550
You know, we've sent
a bazillion

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.540
emails back and forth.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.310
It's great to see
you in person.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.570
And that's when you really
connect with not just the app,

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.420
which is the medium, but the
people behind all the hard

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.540
work that goes into
these great apps.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.620
BEN: I imagine there's a lot
opportunities there that come

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.020
out of that.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.870
FITZ: That echoes a lot of what
we heard from our other

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.380
guests, which is that it's not
only an opportunity for great

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.840
sessions, for great hardware,
but for great connections with

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.440
other developers.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.870
BEN: What we call the
hallway track--

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.410
FITZ: The hallway
track, exactly.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.800
BEN: Perhaps the most important
part of any

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.460
conference.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:29.970
FITZ: Yep.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.500
Well, Ben, I think that about
wraps it up for the live

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.540
segment of Google I/O 2012.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.140
BEN: Absolutely.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.320
And all of these talks and key
notes will be available on

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.165
developers.google.com/io.

00:15:42.165 --> 00:15:42.840
FITZ: Correct.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.620
BEN: And you'll be able to
watch them all there.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.010
FITZ: And we hope we'll
see you guys all back

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.790
right here in 2013.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.340
Thanks.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:48.940
BEN: Thank you.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.190
FITZ: Bye.
