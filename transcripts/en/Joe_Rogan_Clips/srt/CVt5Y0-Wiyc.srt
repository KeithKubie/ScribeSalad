1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
I think there's a big
problem with education.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,710
A big problem with the
education that edible marijuana,

3
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:06,840
as we talked about before,
I think you were in the bathroom,

4
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,870
the 11 hydroxy metabolite is
it's processed by the liver.

5
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:12,450
It's radically different truck,
radically different,

6
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:16,500
and it's really a psychedelic in a very,
for me personally,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,280
edible marijuana and flotation tanks,

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,310
I might as well be taken a
fucking bucket of assets.

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,610
It is crazy God damn experience.
Now,

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,170
I personally enjoy being paranoid
and I know this sounds crazy,

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,660
but I think with me it gives me an,

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,690
I think I live a pretty
blessed life and I like,

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,770
I liked the feeling of paranoia because
it allows me to explore maybe some area

14
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:47,520
like maybe it's just a constant paranoia.
It's a freak out man.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,560
I think I have maybe an
abundance of confidence.

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,380
Maybe I have too much, right?
Maybe I'm too successful.

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,590
What I like about the paranoia that comes
with edible marijuana is it allows me

18
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,870
to check myself.
It allows me to put myself,

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,580
examine all of my behavior in
the darkest recesses of my mind,

20
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:13,230
my thoughts, and, and gives me a
purpose. And it makes me a nicer person.

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,180
It might not go just a little tiny, just
like the other psychedelics with thing.

22
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:21,560
It just, it gives you just a
little knocks, an ego, just little,

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,100
I mean some people use it and like at the
end of the day and then you know, like,

24
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,941
like Joe said,

25
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:31,680
I think it makes you reflect
sometimes better and more objectively.

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,280
Meaning that like,
you know,

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,450
maybe you had an encounter with someone
early on the day and then you know,

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,240
late at night, maybe you talk up
a bit and you're like, oh man,

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,770
I probably should have done things that
a little bit different that, you know,

30
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,880
like that happens to people
all, all the time. It just,

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,510
it forces you to reflect
in a different state.

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,890
And sometimes when you reflect in that
state, you come up with thoughts that,

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,110
that you just went to come up with before.
Yeah.

34
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,150
Like my patients say to me all the time,

35
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,960
like it just kinda breaks this
like negative state that I have.

36
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,340
I'm just able to, to, to, to break out
of a negative state and think logically,

37
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,630
you know, people say that to me all
the time. Let's see. You're, to me,

38
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:13,710
you're talking about something different
and it works for you. Right? Your, your,

39
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,860
your paranoia is,
it sounds more almost existential.

40
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,190
It's how can I be a better person?
What am I doing wrong in my life?

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,310
It's not my wife is poisoning me,
don't you?

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,880
No shoe. Like this is funny. Yeah, no,

43
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:31,890
I understand.
Or you know,

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,920
or the cops aren't going to bust through
the fucking door and shoot me different

45
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,580
thing.
And that's why,

46
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,650
that's why Marin marijuana drives
this extreme violence in some people.

47
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,080
Or those people need to get
their fucking shit together.

48
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,960
Well that's possible too.
They may need to go to,

49
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:55,050
those aren't really coming bro,
but they may need to be intervened before.

50
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:59,770
And to Joe's point though, they
have shown in studies that, um,

51
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,830
if you make an intervention other
outside of the a psychotic symptoms,

52
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:08,350
you can actually reduce the
incidence of violence. And also too,

53
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,670
I think it's a good point.

54
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:14,110
I was going to mention earlier to bring
up genetics because we are teasing out

55
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,400
genetics for people and we are discovering
that certain people do have certain

56
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:23,320
genetics that do predispose them, uh, to,
to certain cannabis disorders. Right? So,

57
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,860
you know, I'm involved, um, with, with,

58
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:29,020
with the company that's doing that right
now and we're trying to create, um,

59
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,330
cannabis genetic tests for people,
right.

60
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:35,660
And there's three genes that
we've identified so far, you know,

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,470
and one of them is that
Amy p k 14 genotype,

62
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:42,790
and that has been shown to
be associated with, um, a, a,

63
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,700
a deficit and brain volume
when you do use cannabis.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
And then there's two other genes
that att one and the cad and,

65
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,430
and to genotype.
You know,

66
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,420
both of those have also been shown to
be associated with cannabis. But again,

67
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,860
you know, how many people have them. Um,

68
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,220
BMAP k 14 is roughly about
8% is what we're seeing. Uh,

69
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,290
the Akt one is around 4% and the
cad m two is around is around 5%.

70
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,490
So that's almost 20% of the
population. But, but, but we're seeing,

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,290
but if we can identify, um, I love
that stuff. Lion's mane. Yeah,

72
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,870
that's wicked. Um, so if we
can identify, you know, the,

73
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:26,290
the people who are at risk, then we can
maybe Billy, uh, potentially, you know,

74
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,840
you use the medicine in a way where
only the people who don't have these

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,250
genetics are using the
medicine. And then, you know,

76
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:38,140
for the people who do have these genetics,
you know, they stick mostly to CBD.

77
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,580
I just think, you know, that that's a
better approach than, you know, just,

78
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,120
just Kinda, um, prohibiting cannabis
are saying that we shouldn't,

79
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,150
we shouldn't use it at all,
are saying that it's not medicine.

80
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,200
I think that it should be held to the
same standard as any other medicine.

81
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,980
And I think that if we had an incredible
medicine that worked for some people

82
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,550
and that didn't work for others than what
we would do is we would try to figure

83
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:04,630
out why. And you know, I, I've been doing
that. My companies have been doing that.

84
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:08,370
It's called a net life. You know, full
disclosure, I am on the board, um,

85
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,410
and that left at.com and you know,
um,

86
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,650
and when we use these different, uh,
these different strategies, you know,

87
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,890
then we can actually
reduce the overall harm.

88
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,610
And that should be another thing that we
can add into the mix. Because for sure,

89
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,150
there's people who are definitely
more predisposed to mental illness and

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,660
definitely more predisposed to,
to a psychosis.
