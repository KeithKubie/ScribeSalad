00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.080
Spring has sprung!

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.580
Twitterpated animals are getting all cuddly,
and then it's over.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:18.880
That was so FAST WHAT HAPPENED?!

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.380
We are living in uncertain times.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.580
Our lives are short, and the universe is constantly
changing…

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.509
Not always for the better OR worse.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.009
It just is…

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.769
So let's lay it ALL out there so we can build
a bridge and get over it!

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.380
Spring get's 30 seconds to a minute shorter
EVERY YEAR.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.730
According to the director of the Goddard Institute
for Space Studies, in the year 8680 Northern

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.750
Hemisphere's spring will be 4 days shorter!

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.399
Spring is caused by the Earth beginning to
tilt toward the sun.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.590
It starts on the vernal equinox, which is
when the axis is exactly vertical.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.929
Over the next 92.76 days, we'll get closer
as the wobble gets more pronounced, and then

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.120
summer will start.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.050
The wobble isn't constant though, over time,
precession happens -- basically the wobble

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.580
shifts -- about 1 degree every 72 years.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.020
This changes a LOT of things…

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.880
Summer lengthens, and so does autumn,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.660
The North Star, Polaris is in the north NOW,
but thanks to that axis wobble it's changing

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.070
ever so slowly.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.280
In 12,000 years, Vega NOT Polaris will be
the North Star!

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.630
Vega is way brighter than Polaris, so that's
nice, but every 26,000 years the two trade

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.710
off.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.150
And speaking of North, the magnetic north
pole isn't constant either!

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.170
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS A LIE.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.210
That's right, when your compass points north,
it's not pointing at the top of the planet,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.610
but it's close.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.590
Earth's magnetic field determines where magnetic
north falls.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.370
It can move as much as 50 miles (80km) in
a single day In 1831, magnetic north was closer

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.640
to Canada's Hudson Bay, while today it's 685
miles (1102km) closer to true north; but it's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.640
still moving.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.640
The south pole moves too.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.090
Because the magnetic field is constantly in
flux (LOL magnet joke).

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.200
Scientists believe as the speed of Earth's
iron core shifts the magnetic field also shifts;

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.069
but they're not entirely sure why.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.489
Scientists can actually watch the poles moving
around thanks to the ESA's Swarm satellites.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.640
Freaky.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.680
And if the north thing isn't freaking you
out.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.390
How about something a little closer to home;
if you wanted more hours in the day, just

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.390
wait.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.590
The days are getting longer.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.400
The Earth and the Moon are constantly interacting
with each other gravitationally.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.569
Every year, the moon takes a few centimeter
baby step away from us, and every time it

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.569
wants to move out, WE PULL IT BACK IN.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.409
Over millions of years, Earth's rotation slows
because of this pulling, and our day gets

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.609
longer.

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.609
620 million years ago, the day was only 21
hours long; every century, the day gets 1/500th

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:49.609
of a second longer.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.600
In fact, the International Earth Rotation
and Reference Systems Service (my dream job),

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.450
announced that in June we're going to have
a leap SECOND added to the calendar.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.079
There IS a hypothesis, though, that leap seconds
could break the internet, literally.

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.799
Computers don't handle change well, even worse
than humans do.

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.209
(NEW SET, REMEMBER).

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.849
If some computers thought it was midnight
and others thought it was midnight and one

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.639
second, havoc would ensue.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.530
In June of 2012, Reddit, Gawker, Yelp were
all messed up because of a leap second.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.480
Quantas airlines had to delay their flights
because of a leap second bug!

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.120
We've had 25 leap seconds since 1972 when
the idea was created, but there are more and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.689
more computers around now… so we'll just
have to trust the engineers.

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.779
In the grand scheme of things, we don't live
very long.

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:42.799
Even the oldest person ever 122 year old French
woman Jeanne Calment, in comparison to Earth

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.749
time… is just a blink.

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.109
Because of our limited viewpoint we think
things are stable, but the North Pole, the

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.670
North Star, how long the seasons or the year
or the day is… they're all CONSTANTLY in

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.980
adjusting and changing.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.419
Nature is amazing.

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.930
And scary.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.739
What do you think of all this?
