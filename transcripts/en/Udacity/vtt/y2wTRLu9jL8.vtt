Thank you for your response.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.740
Please discuss your ideas about using different metrics on the forums.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.130
Before we move on to the modeling section,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.800
I would like to give you some food for thought.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.650
As you have seen, distance metrics are very useful.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.340
In our case, we have used the distance metric quite literally to

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.750
measure distance between two points on the surface of the earth.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.250
However, when we measure difference between two PDFs or

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.530
functions, we can use distances as well.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.369
In the following sections,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.600
we are going to introduce what are called the risk and loss functions.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.760
You will see that the lost function is essentially a distance measurement.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.980
As we move on to build and verify the model,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.920
feel free to use features you chose in the quiz instead or

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.890
in addition to our features that we have used so far in the analysis.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.210
And see how the model performs.
