put in the hospital or something I
 

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
put in the hospital or something I
warned<00:10:41.240><c> him</c><00:10:41.330><c> in</c><00:10:41.480><c> the</c><00:10:43.540><c> eyes</c>

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:50.990 align:start position:0%
the show could have massively been
 

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
the show could have massively been

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:52.850 align:start position:0%
improved by keeping him on absolutely
 

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.699 align:start position:0%
improved by keeping him on absolutely
and<00:10:53.149><c> could</c><00:10:53.720><c> have</c><00:10:53.810><c> built</c><00:10:53.930><c> up</c><00:10:54.110><c> our</c><00:10:54.230><c> feelings</c><00:10:54.560><c> for</c>

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:54.709 align:start position:0%
