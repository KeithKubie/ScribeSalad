00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.070
Okay, so you created your first relationship. This is how

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.400
we get objects to communicate with each other. And this is

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.850
where things get really interesting. Because of the relationship between the

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.880
parent object Festival and the child object, Attendee, you can now

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.280
aggregate all sorts of useful information. For example, if you want to

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.270
know how many tickets you sold, you can now get that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.590
information directly from the Festival object. In fact, the information on

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.060
the child object is now accessible by the parent object, and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.720
vice versa. Later, when you start building more

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.240
complex business logic, you'll see how important and powerful

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.020
the relationship between objects becomes. See if you can

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.640
identify the parent in each of the following scenarios.
