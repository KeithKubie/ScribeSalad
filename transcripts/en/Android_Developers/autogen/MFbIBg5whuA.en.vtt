00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.049
 Hello, I'm grandson of the Navy. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 of the android team and I'm here today 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.900
 to talk about a new android tape 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.480
 4.4 kitkat to have the bike change 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.670
 allow the application to go full 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.340
 I was excluded taking advantage of the whole 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.650
 android device screen but before 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.210
 begin to talk about the immersive way of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.579
 I wanted to talk a little bit about how 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.040
 was before the kitchenette in the picture with the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.149
 the first four and had two groups 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.820
 already country 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 the first one related to windows - eu 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.600
 had a flec to the full screen that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.670
 allows you to hide the status bar 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 where the battery information is 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.379
 network and everything else and can take advantage of 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 better this space to another relative to the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.680
 system and where it also works is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 hide some things changing and the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.039
 of dowry 4.0 is only good so 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.559
 hence the low profile which basically 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.180
 darkens the status bar not 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.640
 Removing the screen is a bit 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.799
 different because I have a screen that is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.260
 basically the same thing and that has in the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.180
 windows - day and then last which 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.580
 one of the most different subjects here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.650
 that the web game show radio that besides 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.140
 hide the status bar 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.869
 hides from navigation a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.580
 boat that in time she left the bar is 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.400
 that some devices already have that is 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.220
 where you have the home button back and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.920
 Recent apps to some phones 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.390
 There is no such thing as this bar, and it's just that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.189
 soft call that you want for example 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.740
 those that have a menu that does not 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.540
 it's the newest versions plus one 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.509
 It is important to remember that King David 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.200
 milk is also it as you hide the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.880
 bar 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.759
 when the user touches the screen back 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.130
 it again displays the navigation bar 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.130
 in this case he does not pass this event of 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 touch your app so it's good to have 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.909
 this in mind that we neither 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.619
 He's talking more about the immersive way you 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.869
 will see a little the difference between 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.890
 these two ways to use touch mode 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.930
 good 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.989
 also has here a set of 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.489
 that are relative to the layout is 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.140
 important to know that you can 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.980
 use this in the way the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.409
 layout of 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.019
 the screen and it is different because it goes 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.090
 helping your goal does not keep jumping or 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.670
 resizing when the bars are 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.650
 displayed or hidden, that's fine. 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.810
 more item related to layout assembly 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.819
 good application and the novelty of 4.4 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.560
 it's the way it's irreversible we have there 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.299
 two arrows that are two modes one 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.459
 a little different from each other that they are 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.160
 mutually exclusive views 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.440
 whistles that one is the other irreversible way 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.349
 immersive stick we're going soon 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.329
 listen a little bit of each one good 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.220
 first time a small demo 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.440
 too much about immersive mode is good 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.150
 where it happens that when you 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.000
 begins to interact with the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.220
 application the hidden interface bars and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.560
 the first time he does this 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.319
 user will receive a warning that if a 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.170
 teapot indicating that if it does swype 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.750
 from top to bottom on the screen it 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.910
 to show bars is just as well and well 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.000
 simple and can see how I am clic 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.190
 Ok to go back and then if I start to 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.290
 make the uae it shows new bar and 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.870
 when it interacts with the content it 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.500
 Hide the bar again so it's okay 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.870
 cool 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.180
 works very well not dynamically 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.250
 It will cause a lot of damage. 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.900
 is recapturing here the four 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.079
 lines that can be understood - the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.130
 flow how it's going to work and it's 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.040
 interesting to show 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.410
 so as you interact the bar comes back to 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.180
 back to being hidden and can use your 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.669
 team to replay 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.500
 It's okay or a little bit in the code and 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.150
 how it works and what it already has 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.790
 available to do it there 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.889
 first you have to pick up Corvil to 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.989
 to be able to make hospitalizations 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.629
 so you just have to use it right on your own 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.180
 seven consist oe visibility and listen 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.690
 which is what it is I'm going to record one 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.599
 list is to know when the 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.430
 visibility of the system and I 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.680
 I can, for example, hide something 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.620
 or resubmit in accordance with a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.629
 The logic you need is oprah 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.150
 To hide very simple, you just have to 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.120
 call the 77 web system displayed 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.400
 passing the flex, then you see 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.940
 where I can even combine flex of 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.600
 layout with the flex of our immersive mode 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.270
 and when 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.740
 want to display I simply remove 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.460
 that never for who does not want more 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.040
 Show 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.430
 Okay, so it's just you keep this. 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.040
 different call there and in case I can 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.110
 for example that after a certain time 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.180
 activate the raid so that after a three 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.830
 seconds or when I do some kind of 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.970
 different interaction that will not enter 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.160
 in many details here 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.980
 but it's only you to call according to 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.780
 law or send a message from the 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.690
 system and control this message to 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.660
 display or hide the bar or you 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.670
 You think it's better here, too, if you can. 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.430
 want to do when you lose focus 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.160
 gain outside the window mode then 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.930
 I gained focus I hide the window if 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.480
 I suddenly lost focus even 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.520
 removed is messages that may be in the 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.070
 row and so do not leave pending actions 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.050
 for when I re-run do not have 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.650
 problems with my pump display 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.080
 sun here is also you might want 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.460
 when every one click you go back 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.670
 hide but take care that I 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.530
 touching the screen is also going to trigger a 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.970
 gesture detector so you do not want to 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.010
 simply do not click can fall can 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.320
 drag and you will end up with one thing 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.110
 unnecessarily good for you 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.750
 you can use the gesture and detector and use 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.700
 15 tep detection 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.040
 that way I guarantee it only when he 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.050
 touch and release that I'm going to you 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.080
 mode and to make sure that you do not 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.630
 touch drag and drop and activate 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.690
 unnecessarily yours to your method 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.400
 you can use the source of the amount and 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.510
 remove the messages that you think 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.610
 are unnecessary 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.980
 It's a good way for you to use this. 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.810
 use the one clickist step you go 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.140
 end up having some behaviors not 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.320
 expected therein when now in 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.840
 immersive tic is very similar or 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.780
 also when entering the 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.000
 the user will get a one bamboo to 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.040
 remember him and if he does just spy 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.030
 bar will also reappear 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.490
 we can see that the bay is a 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.740
 little translucent is so into it 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.150
 the mode is a bit different then 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.790
 When I do show here again. 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.300
 bamboo and then when interacting with the 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.400
 epp 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.140
 if I do the swype I'll show a bar 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.470
 which is translucent 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.340
 It's good, and that's what's changing then. 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.230
 Basque 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.940
 irreversibly persist because 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.980
 that fancy name 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.169
 the stick mode also on the four screens 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.380
 here they are recapitulating time 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:54.540
 next time you come back and then 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.680
 have I come back to use the bar again 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.370
 where did the previous one that had the 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.169
 licenses 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.940
 You're no more, now the name 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.220
 chic do not you wear it again 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.100
 putting flec was already done 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.770
 You put the fla he treats for you. 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.780
 are this apparition and this when hiding 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.000
 bar and cause worry about 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.580
 cut list vouchers initiative to list 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.130
 is a slightly more transparent way to 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.650
 you use your app ok 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.410
 and here she simply has to have a 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.990
 high a list not out of the window for 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.750
 that the 7th affleck according to the guy 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.460
 enters your application and thus is or is not 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.160
 is enough because as the name itself 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.910
 already says stick it is already stuck 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.800
 presence flag in your application ok good and 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.150
 When will I use another one when the 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.580
 best way to use 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.260
 come on when they're using the 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.210
 windows - I was screen for example 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.460
 I teased chan that you call beautiful 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.410
 beck is for video players that 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.630
 youtube request you have 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.400
 a certain way that only shows the video and 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.410
 when you play there, yes it shows 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.289
 But you can go back there at that time. 

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.330
 is a type of application and has few 

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:01.710
 interaction with that screen 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.900
 us here at the most to use the video 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.639
 At that time you do not want to be having too much 

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.950
 contact with the screen is fine 

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:09.870
 they are now using immersive mode with bump 

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.030
 on radio navigation I can use for a 

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.099
 book reader where I want to enjoy 

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.289
 all my to my screen to show the 

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:17.910
 content but at the same time that it has 

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:19.710
 some kind of work around when you click the 

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.570
 I want to be able to go back a page to 

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.240
 to be able to get a sea book that I can have 

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:27.660
 some kind of special command is what 

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.370
 will help in my user navigation and 

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.039
 then I also have a simple way 

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.599
 tic who just spoke with 

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.150
 written and angry gay chan 

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:38.370
 in this case it is very good for games where 

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.560
 I do not have anything else the team of 

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.270

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.650
