00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:02.700
(upbeat music)

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.233
(happy music)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.080
- Welcome to the living room

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.570
at the Goldman School of Public Policy.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.610
We have here today
professor Rucker Johnson

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.620
who's a professor at the Goldman School.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.010
He's just written an
extraordinary new book.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.480
It's about segregation
it's about integration

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.560
and it's about education in America

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.780
and it's about how to make
America a better place

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.120
by improving its educational system

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.730
and making everybody better off.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.380
Professor Johnson in your
book towards the end,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.770
you say your goal is not condemnation,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.070
it's not to just diagnose an illness

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.150
it's to try to cure the illness.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.860
Exactly how are you trying to do that

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.800
what do you want to do with this book.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.860
- Okay, Well thanks,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.380
thanks for engaging with me on the book.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.610
we're really excited about it.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.270
I think one of the
animated features of it,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.580
is that generally Brown
v. Board is considered

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.470
the beginning of this of
the civil rights movement

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.906
- and that was in the 50s of course 53

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.130
and 54 the successor Brown
- Yes

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.130
- and the question is, it's
clearly that with all the laws

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.603
that were changed,

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:23.950
with all of the war on poverty initiatives

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.850
and progress that as made.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.130
Today we still find ourselves facing many

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.240
of the same problems

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.910
and in groping in the dark
seemingly with you know,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.750
the average black-white
achievement gap big

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.970
that for black children on average,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.280
roughly two garde levels
behind their white counterparts

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.240
that children from the poorest districts,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.253
are estimated to be on average
four grade levels behind,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.040
the most affluent districts
children's outcomes.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.040
So that kind of leaves us with
a question mark around maybe,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.820
with all of the things that we're trying,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.490
why are we still here?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.220
- So so let me just stop so that...

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.240
maybe everything failed,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.550
maybe Brown versus Board of Education

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.690
although was morally the
right thing to desegregate

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.750
the schools, maybe it just
didn't have much impact

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.820
on improving the schools
maybe school finance reform

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.720
which was something we tried

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.450
and the decades following didn't succeed

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.620
and maybe Head Start a
great great society program,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.020
maybe that failed too, But
your book claims otherwise.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.060
exactly and I think that's
that's the thing is that,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.300
a lot of our efforts,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.750
are kind of thinking about
inequality in a vacuum

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.770
and just like,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.140
you know, people have
intergenerational lineages

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.360
so do policies. When you
go to the doctor you...

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.530
the first thing that they do

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.120
when they are trying to
diagnose something is

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.230
they'll ask you not just
about your own blood pressure

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.940
or your own blood pressure
reading but they'll ask you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.310
about your own familial
history in areas of health.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.620
And in the same way,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.950
we had to take inventory

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.730
of the three biggest key,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.530
equal education opportunity
policy initiatives

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.780
that we pursued.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.220
School desegregation,
school finance reform

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.400
as you say in Pre-K,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.951
expansions of public investments in Pre-K

00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:14.210
and really what we had to
do is be skeptical first

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.220
of the conventional wisdom

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.930
that none of those policies had worked

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.220
and really look at it with a fresh eye

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.890
with new sets of data and methods

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.750
- So let's take each one of those in turn

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.510
but let's start first
with just talking about,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.760
how could you even begin

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.040
to figure out whether
those things would work

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.670
or had worked what is
the technique you used

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.780
and just give us a brief
overview of how that worked.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.730
- Yes, I mean I think that the
most important thing is that,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.730
these are age-old questions
but with the advent of big data

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.880
with the advent of new research methods

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.630
to really kind of isolate
and tease out causal effects

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.900
and long term impacts

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.210
we are able to say
something more definitive,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.710
around what works while not
focusing narrowly on test scores

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.860
while not using just snapshots

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.890
of what may happen at a point in time

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.680
but rather following children's lives

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.290
from birth to adulthood.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.840
- So first you looked at
outcomes like employment,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.990
wages, health outcomes and other things

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.530
that happen to people 20 30 40 years

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.130
after they'd experienced
some of these programs,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.850
like school integration
or school finance reform,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.330
so that's right?

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.210
- That's right so we're trying to first,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.810
leverage longitudinal data,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.630
using the panel study of income dynamics

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.320
that can bridge a nasty
representative portrait

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.260
of how the childhood conditions,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.210
were shaped using data
matched with the kind

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.350
of school reform timing,
of school desegregation,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.330
of school finance reforms,
of the timing of Head Start

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.480
and the family backgrounds
of those children.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.390
So that we have the kind
of intersectional nature

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.890
of the multiple factors
that affect life chances.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.330
- So you've got data over time of families

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.585
that have been interviewed
since the late 60s?

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:01.651
- That's right.

00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:02.570
- All over the country
- For decades

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.430
- a nationally representative sample

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.410
and you can follow them all
the way up to the present day

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.900
and you know all sorts of
things about these families,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.380
including the places where
they lived which is essential

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.040
for what you're trying to do because,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.060
how did you use the
places they lived as a way

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.900
to get at with the results
of these programs were.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.050
- Yeah so what's what's key is

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.430
you really want to kind of characterize

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.800
how where people grow up,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.150
affects the set of
opportunities they had access to

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.270
and so sometimes people
think of brown as something

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.140
that happened 1954

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.510
and all of a sudden the
light switch was turned on

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.860
and all of a sudden the
vestiges of Jim Crow

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.030
were automatically overnight overturned

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.890
and that's just not how it happened.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.370
So it requires having a sustained picture

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.870
and that's how why we have
to kind of follow children

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.987
over extended periods of time.

00:05:52.987 --> 00:05:54.440
- But actually turns out

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.560
although it was probably not a good thing

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.270
that it took so long to implement

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.040
Brown versus Board of Education.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.050
From your perspective as a researcher,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.540
it gives you leverage
in trying to figure out

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.730
what the impacts were

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.340
because you look at young
people who were in districts

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.970
that were desegregated,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.970
versus those who were in districts
that weren't desegregated

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.300
and compare them to see

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.660
if school desegregation
actually had an impact.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.120
- Exactly and so that's really the

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.410
the kind of hallmark of having kind of

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.300
laboratories of experimentation

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.800
where you could take a child
that was born in say 1960

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.320
and they may have been born in 1960

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.180
but they lived in a district
where they were exposed

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.610
to integrated schools
throughout their school ed years

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.030
and you can contrast it with
the child that was born in

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.410
maybe a similar area, in similar region

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.830
but they weren't exposed
to integration at all

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.920
because of the timing of implementation

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.120
of the desegregation court orders in their

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.430
neighborhood and community of upbringing.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.780
- So it's almost like a clinical trial,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.890
that the health care people use

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.980
where you randomly assign
people to one treatment

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.730
or the other that one treatment
being you get the medicine

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.540
and the other one you don't get anything

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.050
but in this case it turns out people

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.300
were more or less randomly

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.310
because of the way these
programs were implemented.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.560
More or less randomly given

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.410
the school desegregation treatment

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.260
versus those who were continuing
in segregated schools.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.070
- Well that's right because
partly what happened was that

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.743
while Brown decision,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.000
gave a vision for what
a just system in society

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.560
should look like with
regard to integration

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.310
and said what segregation should not be,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.690
it did not really give the
the it left the details

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.170
up to someone else to fill in.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.030
- So what did you find?

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.710
let's start with Brown
versus Board of Education

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.440
and integration what did you find?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.747
was it helpful to these young people

00:07:45.747 --> 00:07:46.630
- Yes I mean
- who had the chance?

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.520
- I think I think part
of what is is is key

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.970
is understanding,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.530
what was integration itself

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.980
and what kind of changes did it

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.000
what kind of cascading
changes did it elicit

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.080
and one of the things is that
most people think of it as

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.740
how many black kids are going
into school with white kids

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.470
but a big part of the changes
actually came through the way

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.310
integration affected
access to school resources.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.650
The ways in which it
affect average class size

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.770
for African-American
children in particular

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.800
the way it affected
access to teacher quality

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.080
and school facilities and after-school

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.960
programs and activities
and a big piece is also,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.400
it integrated the teaching workforce

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.290
in a way where now teachers were teaching,

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.220
a kind of multi-ethnic set of classrooms

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.490
and and and that took time

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.220
it wasn't something overnight.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.910
But so what we're able to show is that,

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.030
if we think of your example
of like a clinical trial,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.120
it's a type of medicine,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.810
where we're saying that
the medicine treatment

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.990
call it desegregation.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.070
It works but it also depends on the dose,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.000
and the duration of exposure.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.560
So when we find children only exposed

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.660
to integrated environments
only in their last two years

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.530
of high school.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.840
We see much more muted impacts

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.800
when we see that they were exposed

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.880
to integrated environments

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.030
but it didn't significantly
affect their access

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.090
to school resources or reduce class sizes

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.600
in a significant way in the like

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.460
we don't see the same

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.850
large impacts that we see

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.040
when the integration both was something

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.740
that happened earlier in the school career

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.170
particularly in elementary school years

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.700
and was sustained.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.660
- So what are some of those larger impacts

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.660
in terms of wages say or employment

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.540
or something like that
- Yeah

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.270
- So I'll say chronologically

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.840
just to give you a sense
of the array of outcomes

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.920
that we find impacts on,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.100
but beginning with high
school graduation rates,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.940
beginning with educational
attainment including college

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.910
enrollment college completion rates

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.750
as late as 1960,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.520
only about 20% of black males
graduate from high school

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.550
as late as 1960.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.740
Compare with 50 percent of white males

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.840
in that same by 1960 roughly,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.810
only 3% of black males
graduate from college

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.430
13% among white males as late as 1960.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.400
So those are vast educational differences

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.400
when we look at outcomes like
education, health, earnings,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.030
the single area in which we saw

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.320
the biggest racial
convergence in those outcomes

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.200
black-white differences
narrowing substantially

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.640
the only period in which we've seen

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.500
that narrow so dramatically

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.720
is this era of cohorts that were exposed

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.300
differentially, to school integration.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.020
And we really are able to tie and connect

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.500
the dots to that convergence
in educational attainment

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.030
so that by the late 70s and early 80's,

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.060
the college enrollment rates of eight...

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.060
of eighteen and nineteen year
old black folks' children

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.090
were around the same rates

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.640
that were experienced for white

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:46.363
for those cohorts.

00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:47.990
- So that's an astonishing convergence.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.650
- In in in a 15-year window.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.840
- Of course the great complaint

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.590
of white racists in the South,

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.410
was that this was going
to ruin the white race

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.010
and it was going to be terrible for whites

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.410
to be integrated with
blacks. What do you find?

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.370
- What we find is that
the beneficial impacts

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.660
that we find for African Americans,

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.510
did not come at the expense of whites

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.790
and moreover we see no
negative impacts across

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:14.790
earnings, wages, employment,
incarceration, health

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.243
you name it.

00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:20.110
We don't find any negative
impacts for whites and moreover

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.270
we find significant
beneficial impacts, on aspects

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.570
that have to do with racial
attitudes in adulthood

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.570
that when they are exposed to
more integrated environments,

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.780
their attitudes around
race, racial tolerance,

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.720
their perspectives around racial diversity

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.240
and you're a scholar of
the political polarization,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.570
you've written a major book on the kind of

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.330
the political polarization
that we've seen.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.450
We actually can kind of

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.450
document how the early
experiences in diverse schools

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.523
shape subsequent political
attitudes in adulthood.

00:11:58.242 --> 00:12:00.610
- And reduced polarization
- And reduce prejudice

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.190
- Increased tolerance, understanding

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.120
ability to have

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.640
friends of another race
- Yes

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.480
- And to work presumably
with folk who look different

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.313
than you do.

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.230
Which in course is increasingly important

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.200
in many jobs in America,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.020
especially in big cities
where you're going

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.760
to be dealing with a diverse workforce.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.670
So what's really wonderful about your book

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.400
is you you not only talk about
how the integration mattered

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.130
and you talk about the complexity

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.600
of the treatment of integration

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.210
what did integration really do?

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.700
but then you start to unpack that,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.660
you say okay what was it

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.150
that made integration work well

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.290
and so you move to school finance reform

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.660
and this the lessons you have
there are actually lessons

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.090
not just for African Americans,
they're for everybody

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.510
because we find out that

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.670
it turns out that school finance reform,

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.290
actually is one way to make
our educational system better.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.620
So so talk about that.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.060
- Well I think one of the
things to even discuss

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.760
the impacts of a reform is to kind

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.880
of make sure we appreciate
what the status quo was.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.210
So historically the way we
have funded public schools

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.930
in the United States is through
the local property tax base.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.810
And local property tax wealth differences

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.850
because of segregation by income,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.210
in neighborhoods wealth differences

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.910
create vast differences in
the ability to raise revenue,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.780
through the property tax base

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.940
and that was creating
significant vast differences in

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.860
where poor districts
would have to leverage

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.350
much higher property tax rates,

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.000
just to generate almost half of the level

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.980
that very affluent areas were having.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.290
And that really I would say

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.560
set the table in the stage following

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.780
the school desegregation court rulings,

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.110
for the school finance reform movement.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.260
To challenge the constitutionality

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.120
of solely local systems of finance.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.100
And so what the state court
ordered school finance reforms

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.570
began to do with
California being the first,

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.520
it's interesting because
California's both the

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.850
kind of first and actually now represents

00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:00.550
among the most recent and
bold progressive formulas

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.920
in the most recent five years.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.560
But the first one was
done here in California

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.920
and the idea is simply to
narrow the spending disparity

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.815
to richen the ...

00:14:10.815 --> 00:14:12.500
- On a on a moral grounds its very simple

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.880
is that every child deserves
an equal opportunity

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.700
in K through 12 and therefore

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.300
that's not equal if we're
spending vastly different sums

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.270
in Beverly Hills than we
are in East Los Angeles.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.630
There's a literature out there

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.460
that says additional school
spending isn't worth it

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.760
we don't get anything
for it it's just wasted.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.200
- Yes
- You don't find that

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.140
- Yes yes and so this is
again where the kind of

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.080
conventional wisdom around

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.600
integration being a
failed social experiment,

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.740
school spending leading to great waste

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.570
and not really boosting student outcomes.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.680
The reason why some of those,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.300
premature conclusions had been reached,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.340
enlist that what we find in our work

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.150
is inadequate attention to

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.280
accounting for a family
background, important

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.830
but really isolating
how the school spending

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.830
where the money flows to,

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.570
what students are affected

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.950
and what school districts at the time

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.480
and when we isolate the school spending

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.470
what we find is significant
improvements on a whole host

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.920
of educational trajectory.
- And and I say

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.000
another thing you do is you say

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.720
that it's not just about test scores

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.820
that some other the problems
with some of this literature,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.850
is it's focused on

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.820
does school spending increased
test scores but it turns out

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.380
that may not be the best
measure of what schools do

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.450
and indeed if you think about it

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.920
what we ultimately care
about is not test scores

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.010
but whether people go on to get jobs

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.640
and whether they stay out of prison

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.210
and they don't stay off
welfare and things like that

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.970
and you find that when you
use those kinds of measures,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.700
you get significant positive effects

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.870
- That's right and we do actually
find it on test scores too

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.540
like my colleague Jesse Rosting

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.320
and his colleagues Jad-Diane...

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.810
they certainly find
outcomes on test scores.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.170
But I would say if we
focus solely on test scores

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.100
we would miss a huge

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.100
and understate the potential
for school reforms like these

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.880
to really break the
intergenerational cycle of poverty

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.350
and so that's a key piece.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.450
Now one thing I think

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.500
that's important about the
school spending piece is,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.520
one of the things because
people often come to me

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.480
and they say haven't we
already tried these things?

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.520
and I think one of the things
you have to consider is that,

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.660
all of these things were
tried one at a time, not

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.660
and unevenly and consistently
not with sustained investment.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.690
What we find is that,

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.760
the very nature of learning
beginning future learning,

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.480
is that half of the achievement
gap among third graders

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.000
is already apparent on the
first day of kindergarten.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.020
That footprint of these
early life experiences,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.950
has to be kind of part of
the investment strategy

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.180
that would include Pre-K.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.980
- Ok so let's talk about Pre-K so you...

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.460
and then I want talk about
the interaction of Pre-K,

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.890
with school funding Which I heard is one

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.600
of the most interesting findings, you have

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.010
but let's first talk about Pre-K.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.929
So, Head Start was an attempt

00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:06.520
on the part of the Great
Society Lyndon Johnson

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.800
to say that we've got to
really do a better job

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.920
of providing education for young people,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.070
before they even get to kindergarten.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.920
And there's been lots of people who said

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.127
that never worked
- Right and this...

00:17:17.127 --> 00:17:18.820
- But again you don't find that.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.110
- Right! and this goes back to,

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.900
being too enamored with
easily measured overnight,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.080
kind of metrics like test scores

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.090
that there have been evidence

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.390
that have shown test score
improvements have faded out

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.810
in the years following
Head Start attendance

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.230
but the question is
that fade out reflective

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.670
of the policies inadequacies

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:46.670
or is it just a byproduct of
any great early investment

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.810
is still dependent on

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.720
the quality of subsequent investments.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.340
- So one of your most extraordinary
findings seems to me is

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.000
that you find out that Pre-K is especially

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.640
has an especially big impact

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.830
when in fact subsequently
school districts,

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.010
actually invest money to provide more help

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:11.450
and service two students
who are getting Pre-K

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.520
so in other words there's
an interaction effect

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.470
- Yes
- And then You've got a

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.910
as you say keep going with the
treatment and if you do that,

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.170
you find suddenly that
Pre-K actually has an impact

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.640
and a long lasting impact.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.060
- That's right we think of
this as kind of synergies that,

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.090
when we combine these policies

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.620
in a strategic investment
implementation way

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.620
what happens is, you invest
early you cause children

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.510
those are investments are not
investments in acquisition

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.420
of knowledge but they
give greater ability for

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.580
the acquisition of future knowledge

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.010
and that enables them to be
more likely to be school ready

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.210
as they enter kindergarten

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.440
and then they can take more advantage of

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.340
the k-12 educational opportunities,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.600
because they're in a system
that's not poorly funded in

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.060
the k-12 years and so we
actually do find fade out.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.280
If you do the Pre-K

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.420
and they subsequently attend
poorly funded schools in

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.270
the k-12 years.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:07.240
We do find that the
effects do not last long

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.840
when that happens

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.860
and similarly even the
K12 spending investments,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.440
don't yield the same return
if they're not preceded,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.500
by high quality high
quality Pre-K investments.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.630
- I mean you would think of
an exercise regime for example

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.640
if you thought that somehow

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.230
well I used to exercise 30
years ago I should be fine today

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.970
that's rather foolish you know...

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.140
we know they probably have
to keep it up at least

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.000
at some level

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.740
and that's what you're
really basically saying

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.940
is that we it's great that we have Pre-K

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.020
but we've got to follow up with schools

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.410
that actually capitalize on that Pre-K

00:19:40.354 --> 00:19:42.730
and so I think that's an
extraordinarily important finding

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.420
That we can't just assume
there's a magic bullet

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.709
that one of these
programs all the problems

00:19:47.709 --> 00:19:50.363
- Exactly, exactly and
it's very much like,

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.510
going back to an initial
question you asked which is,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.000
what's the frame of the book?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.500
and what the book is aimed to do,

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.060
is to provide a blueprint,

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.930
an educational opportunity
blueprint for what kind

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.580
of investments are requisite

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.530
what are the essential ingredients

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.400
for kids opportunities
no matter their zip code,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.420
no matter their race, ethnicity

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.090
to be insured no matter
their poverty status

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.610
to be insured to have
opportunities to thrive.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.990
- So your book is very
hopeful it seems to me

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.810
and that you say if we
just would be more intense

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.710
about saying let's keep up
our desegregation efforts,

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.440
let's keep up our efforts to fund schools

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.710
in a responsible manner to
make sure that money gets to

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:35.480
the places it's got to get and
we add Pre-K that we're gonna

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.020
have a system that
actually does a lot better.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.300
The sad part of your book,

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.770
is the second half when
you start talking about

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.060
the fact that we've actually
pulled back on a lot

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.190
of these policies especially desegregation

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.320
and to some extent school finance reform

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.220
- Yes so there is a kind of misnomer

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.350
that we actually did a lot
of school finance reforms

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.280
and so maybe the kind
of spending disparities

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.750
are no longer there by
say income and actually

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:06.040
that's not true that we find
23 states as late as 2012

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.030
and those rates haven't really changed in

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.820
the last five years that among 23 states,

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.680
average spending in
more affluent districts

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.380
is significantly greater
than in poor districts

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.480
so I think one of the key things is

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.100
that we reached a peak level

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.400
of integration in the late 80s.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.840
1988 we're at the peak
level of integration,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.800
in many ways we were seeing
a lot of the positive impacts

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.650
but they weren't actually well documented

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.570
so while they were happening,

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.360
in real time they weren't being documented

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.730
and that created a window for
some of the political backlash

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.010
that would want to kind of move back to

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.990
what is cast a school choice

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.940
or local control or...

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.490
what other words

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.490
forced busing like these
are very loaded words

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.700
but underneath them sometimes,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.520
the motivation has a little bit of a

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.180
fear of race and integration.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.580
And so beginning in the early 90s

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.520
there began to say be a kind of legal

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.600
change in which basically court rulings

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.800
lifted and made it easier
to lift court orders.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.802
- So there's a court order that
said you had to desegregate

00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:24.635
- Then you'd have to have a
- and you have to work hard

00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:26.676
- desegregation plan to integrate

00:22:26.676 --> 00:22:29.650
and it was incumbent upon the district

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.430
to ensure that there be racial balance,

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.270
in those things.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.980
So that begins to be lifted

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.820
- Let's note that you give some examples

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.520
where that was done extremely well

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.460
that may be in Boston for example,

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.610
mistakes were made so for example

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.490
it as I read your book

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.330
it looks like the poorer communities,

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.480
bore the greater brunt
the poor white communities

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.050
than the rich white communities in Boston

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.540
and that that was a mistake
and that's not the way to do it

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.920
and then other communities realized,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.510
that everybody had to share equally

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.030
if you're going to do this,

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.870
and then everybody would be better off.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.050
- That's right.
- When you give examples of

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.860
where that's been been successfully.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.770
- So a big part of it is just that the,

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.070
how matters as much as the what

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.070
so when we say integration we have to kind

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.580
of still think about you know

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.610
what is it that's making
things work together?

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.460
and what is it that can make it unravel?

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.920
and so it's the combination
of they lifted the court order

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.380
so half of the districts that
were ever under court order,

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.100
have been lifted of
court order that led to

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.710
significant resegregation.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.270
Another example is like
a place like charlotte

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.120
that was like really
a model of integration

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.950
and now is basically you
know backtrack to become,

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.980
as segregated as they
were before busing began

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.860
and the part of the rationale
and part of the reason,

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.850
is not just you know without
policy playing a critical role.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.220
So in this case,

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.580
I'll give you an example with
the North Carolina legislature

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.490
passed House bill 514 and what it did,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.150
was it authorized for,

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.010
wealthy suburban districts
in the Mecklenburg County

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:07.060
to secede and form their
own charter districts.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.310
- Apart from Charlotte
- Under the banner

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.610
of like school choice but

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.410
that would be their own charter districts

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.030
and predominantly white suburban

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.440
and that really enabled there

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.220
to be a significant also
resegregation of schools

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.370
that was furthered.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.370
And the reason that kind of
piece is important is because

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.140
whereas before if you had
a set of racial prejudice

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.420
to kind of avoid integration,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.880
you did have to like bear the
brunt of the financial cost.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.700
When it's a charter school
it is the taxpayers money

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.680
that's actually subsidizing
the segregation.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.770
So there are aspects about
how the instruments of policy,

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.340
can be used to further integration efforts

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.560
but in some places are being used to

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:52.000
further segregation and so that's,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.300
one of the things I guess I should say

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.390
that is part of the
second half of the book

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.080
and I think it's part of our the goal of

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.780
the book in its entirety,

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.690
which is that we had the
quantitative evidence,

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.690
and nasty representative portrait

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.230
but we needed to marry that

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.320
like that provided an aerial view

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.010
of how the reforms were working

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.680
and whether there was long term impact

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.160
but we had to marry that
with qualitative evidence

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.980
around the stories of
people who were living these

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.290
experience changes within
the schools by talking to

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.160
superintendents and teachers and judges

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.620
and policymakers to
really get that texture,

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.620
to understand how this was
mirroring their lived experience

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.610
both the challenges and the successes.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.170
- One of great things about the book

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.350
are those stories and then the evidence

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.860
that you bring from the
very careful econometric

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.660
and statistical work that you've done

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.100
and you marry that I think extremely well.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.520
To show how in fact these
programs can and do work

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.610
and also to give us an idea
of why on the ground they work

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:57.110
but also why on the ground
sometimes even though they work

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.150
sometimes people reverse them
and don't continue with them.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.760
And that's as I say that
the sad part of the book

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.170
but the hopeful part at the very end,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.970
is that there are a set
of policy prescriptions

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.100
you put forth that will improve education

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.670
for everyone and why don't
you recount those again

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.710
just so that we summary of them.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:22.310
- We cannot leave out school integration

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.873
because throwing money
at the problem only,

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.900
is insufficient to the task.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.020
And so it's integrated
school environments,

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.200
combined with early Pre-K investments

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.920
and quality school finance
equalization policies

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.927
that ensure access to opportunity

00:26:40.927 --> 00:26:43.420
and that includes teacher quality

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.680
and ensuring the development
of those teachers.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.320
Now doing that in a kind of cohesive way,

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.550
is not something that should
be left up to one district at a

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.280
time but kind of really
requires some vision around

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.260
how that needs to be connected.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.250
- Rucker Johnson you've
written an extraordinary book,

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.523
children of the-dream.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.340
Why school integration works
but it's much more than that,

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.410
it's how to make our
educational system work better.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.060
- For all children
- And better for everyone.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.070
Not just for one group but for everybody

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.990
and how to solve a problem
that's been an American dilemma

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.670
for far too long and I thank
you for this very readable,

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.360
very exciting very amazing book.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.680
- Can I just close with one quick thing,

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.930
I have a number of colleagues that were

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.400
instrumental in the work.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.300
Economists Kirabo Jackson at Northwestern,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.780
my colleague and former
PhD student Sean Tanner,

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.810
my current PhD student Sean
Darling-Hammond was instrumental

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.520
in research assistance and
other just insightful feedback,

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.930
and Alexander Nazarian a former
senior writer for Newsweek

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.290
also collaborated with
me on this on this work.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.830
So I want to definitely give shoutouts

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.240
to a whole host of folks
that made this possible.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.890
- You put together a great team

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.210
and I think the lesson of the team is,

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.120
it helps to get people
together to work together

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.037
to do things together
- Different perspectives.

00:28:02.037 --> 00:28:04.180
and of all sorts of different perspectives

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.200
and backgrounds
- For sure.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.370
- And that's that that's
the message of the book

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.450
in two ways.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.670
Just in terms of what we
should be doing in this country

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.270
and in the way to write
one heck of a good book.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.080
Thank you very much.
- Thank You Dean Brady

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.070
- Thanks

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:22.070
(gentle music)
