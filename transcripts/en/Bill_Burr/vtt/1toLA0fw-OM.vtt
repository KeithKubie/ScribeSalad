[inaudible].

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 1>Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.</v>

3
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:05.910
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.460
February 1st, 2006 Dane, what's going on? There you go.

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:16.461
The first month of the year is out of the way in old Billy BU's bag.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.550
It's been doing really well. All right. Last time I got here,

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.280
last time I got hammered was a,

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.530
the last day Versie was out here visiting me whatever fucking day that was.

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:33.531
It was like the second or 3rd of January.

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.670
And um,

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.610
I didn't drink for the rest of the month other than the fact I had eight beers

12
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.380
leftover from the rose bowl.

13
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:44.700
So I just drank like one a day for eight straight days. Um,

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.620
always wanting a second, forget about a third in a ninth beer. But I,

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.000
uh, just, I just had one that was it self,

16
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.520
it's not bad for me. You know,

17
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.440
I went like three weeks without drinking and then eight straight days, lol.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.120
He had one beer and then yesterday I didn't have any beer in the fridge.

19
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.170
I might have a Guinness left, but I didn't drink it. So, um,

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.350
you know, we were out here. What was Sunday?

21
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.290
It was fucking raining to beat the band.

22
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.040
Is that the fucking expression? The play, the band?

23
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:21.100
I haven't know what it was fucking pouring out here for like legitimately the

24
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.490
almost the entire day. Um, which is great.

25
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:26.710
We could probably use about 90 more of those days,

26
00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:30.130
but that was good that that was happening. So, um,

27
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.650
I just fucking stayed home. Didn't do shit. Last time I did Joe Rogan's, uh,

28
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.550
podcast, he gave me some elk meat that he had. Uh,

29
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.830
he fucking killed an elk. He murdered it premeditated.

30
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:47.260
The man got in his car and said, I'm going to kill a fucking out,

31
00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:50.770
but he didn't know which one, so we can only get them on second degree murder.

32
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:54.190
And I became an accessory to the murder when I agreed to take some of the

33
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:59.110
carcass off his heads. Uh, no, he just gave me these two like giant,

34
00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:04.111
like softball sized things that elk and they'd been sitting in my freezer.

35
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.390
So a, I heard the meat's really lean and that it could be a little gamey.

36
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.960
So I just looked up some recipes and there was something there for like elk,

37
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.020
Chile. And um, so I, uh,

38
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:21.730
I made that yesterday and uh, and it was fucking delicious.

39
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.900
Of course the lovely Nia goes out there and be like, is this done?

40
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.910
This doesn't look done. This doesn't,

41
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.410
I guess I'm just not used to Chile with this like consistency.

42
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.980
This mug looks more like a stew cause there wasn't any tomato paste in.

43
00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:39.430
The recipe was still delicious. It was definitely a little more watery.

44
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.570
So she had to go out and go fuck with the whole thing and I'm eating the one

45
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:47.020
that I made and I'm enjoying it and she just keeps letting the other room just

46
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:51.970
kept going, like for thought or whatever. That's fine. I was just like,

47
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.710
will you shut up? It's fine. Fucking time.

48
00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:57.610
I go out in the kitchen,

49
00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:01.120
she fucking nitpicks whatever the hell it is that I'm making,

50
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:04.570
it's fucking unbelievable. She makes something, I eat it. It's good.

51
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.180
Go out there and go to the fucking spice rack. You know, it's, it's, it's, it's,

52
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.420
it's rude. It's rude. So we got into it,

53
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.640
you know, as we always do, right. Get into it a little bit. Then she laughs,

54
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.780
told me to go fuck myself,

55
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:22.990
and then she gave me her version of what the tomato paste and you know,

56
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:27.160
I say say, Oh yeah, I see what you're saying. I like it. You know, that,

57
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.000
guess what I really felt. I felt the first one tasted better.

58
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.900
She thickened it all up with this fucking tomato paste and then made it like

59
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.070
sweeter and uh, you know, did it to the whole fucking pot. So,

60
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.760
you know, if we had a giant pot of it. So I was like, well,

61
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:45.790
I can handle what the fuck she did to it. If it's just mine.

62
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.950
I got eat the whole pot, so I just rolled with it.

63
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.280
Just one of those times you just sit quietly and you not, yeah. Okay.

64
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.940
That's what you did over there. All right, I'll approve that. You know.

65
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.610
Anyways, um, underrated elk meat.

66
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.760
Got To throw it out there. It's fucking delicious.

67
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.950
So then we fucking sit in there. I take my dog out,

68
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:09.490
there's a little a break in the, um,

69
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.640
in the, in the weather. So I take my dog around the block and uh,

70
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.450
Blahblahblahblahblah and I come back in and he is like, Hey, you know what?

71
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.460
Why don't you want to have a pot cookie?

72
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

73
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.850
<v 1>And I was like, no, I don't. I got the podcast to do, I got some bills,</v>

74
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:29.970
mail and shit I have to do. She's like, come on, it's fucking raining.

75
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:33.060
We're not going anywhere. This is a perfect day to have a pot cookies. Like,

76
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.050
I don't like that shit. It gets me too fucked up. I feel like I'm hallucinating,

77
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.440
I don't want to do it. And she goes, no, these are really mild.

78
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.880
These are really mild.

79
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.510
I know everybody out there who fucking consumes those things right now is

80
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:49.620
laughing. [inaudible] they really mild. So I guy find,

81
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:53.010
so I fucking eat this thing right.

82
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.350
And it comes on really slow. It's mellow. And on my card I can deal with this,

83
00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:02.610
just sort of just be chilling out and be relaxed and then all of a sudden just

84
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:07.020
fucking to the moon. Alice, right. I was like fucking tripping.

85
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.880
Not like literally, but it was just like, you know,

86
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.080
I closed my eyes and my feet would feel like they would nine miles away from me,

87
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:19.350
you know? And uh, that was it.

88
00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:23.550
I took it in the afternoon like around four o'clock by five o'clock.

89
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:26.940
That was it. The day was over. So now here I am,

90
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:29.570
I've got a bunch of shit to do and I'm trying to cram this crap in there.

91
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.820
I really don't. I don't like it. Um,

92
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.650
potheads idea of what mild is, is not, you know,

93
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.630
now I'm sure I'm going to get a bunch of fucking,

94
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.200
get a bunch of fucking emails from people going like this.

95
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:50.190
You want this sativa fucking a Asian infused strain,

96
00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:53.780
a weed man. I just don't give a fuck. Right.

97
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.550
I mean, I was like, just, I was TV just dying,

98
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:00.650
laughing at everything that fucking came on there.

99
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.520
My wife made some cornbread with the Chili and I started doing like a cornbread

100
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.500
commercial, you know, hey guys, what's better than a, than a bullet Chili.

101
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.600
That's right. A nice piece of cornbread. Hi. Do you know me? Of course. Sure.

102
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.110
We all do. I was just doing that shit and I was the funniest shit ever to me.

103
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.840
And they was looking at me like, what the Fuck's wrong with you? And I'm like,

104
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:23.420
what do you mean what's wrong with me? You fucking drugged me.

105
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.000
I swear to God. You know what I think it was,

106
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.220
I think the horror of me being around for 24 hours with that weather,

107
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.510
she got like cabin fever and she literally drugged me because she was able to

108
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:38.310
handle it fine, which is making me think.

109
00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:43.050
She took less and she was just sitting there watching TV and I've seen all this

110
00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:45.870
shit that's making me laugh and she's just sitting there totally quiet.

111
00:06:45.871 --> 00:06:49.890
I was like, I go my bomb and over here she was just like, no, no, no.

112
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.710
I hear what you're saying. I'm just watching the show and I like,

113
00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:56.370
how are you that fucking like,

114
00:06:56.371 --> 00:07:00.780
I'm still a little fucked up right now. 24 hours later,

115
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.653
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

116
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.760
<v 1>So anyways, that's why I like alcohol. It slowly comes on,</v>

117
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:10.690
I know where it's going. It isn't like you grab a beer and you're this,

118
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:14.320
I wonder what this does. What's the end know this,

119
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:17.800
this is a mellow drunk and then all of a sudden you get like fucking 20 times

120
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.780
drunk and then you want it to be, I mean, that can start,

121
00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:21.400
that can happen I guess with hard stuff.

122
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.983
<v 0>Um,</v>

123
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.860
<v 1>I did, I don't know, I just feel like the amount of fucking edibles,</v>

124
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:29.320
you have to have to start to understand what they do to you.

125
00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:33.520
It's just not fucking worth it. So, uh, that was my one pot cookie for the year.

126
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.380
But anyways, I haven't had a cigar since the eighth. Um, so I did it.

127
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.310
I'm trying to be too cigar a month guy. And I did it in January.

128
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:47.140
I had one at the rose bowl and I had one on the eighth and then I got a whole

129
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:51.310
fucking month ahead of me. So rather than smoking on the first, you know,

130
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.850
I'm just gonna fucking chill here for like a week to 10 days.

131
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:57.460
And then I figure I got to, I can smoke.

132
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.030
I'm really just taking you through my whole fucking a bad habit schedule.

133
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.640
They on. I um, I was speaking to cookies by the way.

134
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.510
I bought two boxes of girl scout cookies from this lei.

135
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.003
<v 0>You know,</v>

136
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.040
<v 1>it's never the girl scout anymore knocking on the door. Thank God.</v>

137
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.640
Thank God with all the,

138
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.660
the A to catch a Predator's they probably got sick of getting the door.

139
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.190
Fuck it slammed in their face. Dig Dog. He opened the door. Hi,

140
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:28.940
I'm selling girls. Got The door

141
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.570
fucking yelling at your dog. You saw nothing happened. So anyways, um,

142
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.600
now that just sort of sold by adults as far as I know.

143
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:42.140
So I got two boxes of these fucking things. And, um,

144
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.450
I just finally realized the amount of time that I've always felt like the girl

145
00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:52.320
scouts made the cookies cause they were called girl scout cookies and just

146
00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:56.580
somewhere maybe in the middle of this country around Fort Knox,

147
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.650
like the a,

148
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.660
the United League of American dos girl scouts has their headquarters and they

149
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.190
just had these giant tubs where they just stirred up cookie batter once a year

150
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.440
and they got 'em out. And um,

151
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.333
<v 2>okay.</v>

152
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.380
<v 1>After finally thinking about it and looking at the professional packaging, um,</v>

153
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.740
I'm going to go out on a limb here and I, and I want to say, I don't think,

154
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.800
I don't think any girl scouts make any of those fucking cookies.

155
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.050
I think they fucking outsource it. Right.

156
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.110
It's probably made by children, Central America.

157
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.070
They sit there crying, how hard they have to work,

158
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.620
knowing they're never going to get a bite, you know.

159
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.760
And then one of them actually steals a cookie and there's some psychotic

160
00:09:42.761 --> 00:09:46.720
disciplinary action that's taken. Let's Google this shit. Huh? Shall We?

161
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.140
This is like the new segment now. They'll just, you know, back in the day.

162
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.240
She just talk now. I'm actually going to look it up here.

163
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.870
Who makes girl scout cookies?

164
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.433
<v 2>Okay.</v>

165
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.580
<v 1>All right. Girl scout cookies. All right,</v>

166
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.160
girl scout cookies or cookies sold by girl scouts. I'll thank you. Thank you.

167
00:10:09.161 --> 00:10:10.030
Wikipedia,

168
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:15.210
girl scouts of the USA or GS USA as one of its major fundraisers for local

169
00:10:17.501 --> 00:10:20.200
scouts units, members of the girl scouts of America,

170
00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:25.201
but selling cookies since 1917 girls who participate can earn prizes for their

171
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:30.430
effort. Fuck you. That's my name. Alec Baldwin comes in and screams at them.

172
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.693
All right.

173
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.720
The first cookies sales was by a scouting union missile,

174
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.910
the missile troop in Oklahoma and December,

175
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.650
1917 at their local high school in 1922 girl Scout magazine, the American girls,

176
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.090
the American girls suggested cookie sales as a fundraiser, blah, blah, blah,

177
00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:50.750
blah, blah.

178
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.980
From 33 to 35 country-wise organized cookie sales grew with troops in

179
00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:58.640
Philadelphia, in New York City using the cookie selling model,

180
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.700
so they're cooking their own ones. World War Two.

181
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:07.701
They sold calendars in 1990 the national council limited the bakeries providing

182
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:11.780
cookies to just ABC bakeries,

183
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:16.780
a division of inner Interbake foods. Oh wait,

184
00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:20.980
I skipped over something. The 1953 more cookie recipes were added short breads,

185
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.610
peanut butter sandwich, and thin mints. The classic,

186
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.450
it's like the Beatles, Zeppelin, and the who of cookies.

187
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.180
Six types of cookies of being sold nationwide. Great.

188
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:36.330
A cookie sale due to the baby boom generation. They needed more.

189
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.870
The Samoa was added in 75. All right, whatever.

190
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.950
So ABC bakers was making in the 1990s and little Brownie Bakers,

191
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.710
little Prouty bakers at division of the key book company.

192
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040
In 1998 cookie sale awards were instituted with the 2005 trans fat controversy.

193
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.150
The girl scouts move to make the cookies healthier and provide nutritional

194
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:02.260
information on the box. In 2009, the number of thin myths,

195
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.940
Dosey dose and tag tag alongs in each box was reduced.

196
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.290
Why? And Lemon chalet creams became smaller because of the increasing costs of

197
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:18.670
ingredients and transportation. All right. So the, they're there.

198
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.330
They try to make it with less, uh, less trans fats.

199
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.370
Here's 10 weird girl scout cookie facts and then we'll get off this fucking

200
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:31.730
subject. I have dry mouth from that fucking cookie last night. Hey,

201
00:12:31.731 --> 00:12:33.860
when they legalize like,

202
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.100
<v 3>yeah,</v>

203
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.480
<v 1>pot at a federal level,</v>

204
00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:39.390
do you think that they'll actually have girl scout like pot cookies?

205
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.890
You know, Jesus Christ. That'll be a field day.

206
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.480
What's happening to this country? And they're selling drugs. All right?

207
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.110
Number one. These cookies are older than your grandmother. That's not weird.

208
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.760
It's not weird to, you can make the original recipe at home.

209
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:01.210
You can make the original recipe of everything at home. If you know the recipe.

210
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.820
Do you feel like taking a trip back in time and baking some boring stuff? Oh,

211
00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:10.190
this must be one of these hipster sites where they're over everything,

212
00:13:10.191 --> 00:13:11.810
including making fucking cookies.

213
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.040
You can try the authentic or they actually liked making the cookies,

214
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:18.020
but they're anticipating being insulted.

215
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.450
So what they do is they make fun of themselves first.

216
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:24.110
So you can authentic original girl scout cookie recipe.

217
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.690
It's not in the recipe recipe,

218
00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:31.370
but they taste better if you dress up as a girl scout when you make them all,

219
00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:35.360
it's a little internet joke. Only two companies make the cookies.

220
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.970
Honey booboo is banned from selling them.

221
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.460
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

222
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.670
<v 1>thin mints are, aren't just delicious. They're mandatory.</v>

223
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.870
I don't know what that means.

224
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.860
There is a cookie queen and she's a master sales woman.

225
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

226
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.680
<v 1>Oh, there's a non sanctioned girl scout cookies. Weed strain. Of course.</v>

227
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.580
Girl scout cookies used to cost less than a quarter.

228
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:06.600
Everything costs less. There was a cookie shortage during World War II.

229
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.360
Of course. Not every cookie made the grade

230
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.990
a Jesus. That was disappointing. All right.

231
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:17.590
Can I apologize for the wasting the last fucking 15 minutes you life talking

232
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:20.170
about girl scout cookies, um,

233
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.390
to anybody watched the NHL Walstad Gay fucking three on three hockey dod.

234
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.460
It was actually pretty entertaining but not quite as exciting as I thought it

235
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:33.010
was going to be. Cause no one was going to take the body dude.

236
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.690
But it was still cool and obviously seen John Scott score a couple of goals.

237
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.800
That's fucking hilarious that the NHL didn't want him in there after all the

238
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:45.400
money that they've made on fighting and all this shit that a goon goes through,

239
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.990
you know, the fact that the fans liked him enough to elect him into the game,

240
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:53.000
right? Daddy gets fucking traded,

241
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.060
set down to the minus and they told them not to show up.

242
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.050
Then he blogged about it like a seventh grade chicken. Everybody went, Dude,

243
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:02.900
what the fuck? And then he was there and then he scored two goals.

244
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:07.880
It's like a Hollywood fucking movie. Hey, any non hockey fans?

245
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:09.950
Did you actually sit down and watch the All Star game?

246
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:13.220
It's everything that you would've liked. Huh? A zillion fucking goals.

247
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:14.630
No fighting, nothing.

248
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:18.590
Physical people smiling after rum running into one another.

249
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.930
Was it dumbed down enough for you? They're fucking who? Peds. Um,

250
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.180
I actually only watched the first period. It's,

251
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:28.940
it appeared like the first period was only like 10 minutes long.

252
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.500
Is that true or was I under the influence of a pot cookie? Um,

253
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.960
but anyways, all exciting news here. Exciting news for me. Um,

254
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.070
I'm actually doing a Gig in Cheyenne, Wyoming now,

255
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:46.070
Wyoming is the last state that will fucking,

256
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.300
Billy red face has never performed it. And at this point, um,

257
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:54.680
I will have performed in all fucking 50 states. And uh,

258
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.640
that being the fact that, I don't know, I have a little debt. OCD, right?

259
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.290
Is that what it is now? I don't know what it is. I just like, you know,

260
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.750
at first I was like, you know what? I'm going to go to every baseball stadium.

261
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.340
Then it became immediately goes,

262
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.940
I'm going to go to every fucking stadium that exists, you know?

263
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.200
So if I start doing stand up and then it becomes, all right, dude,

264
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.090
I've done three states.

265
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.240
It immediately I have to do every state and then it becomes a,

266
00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:19.340
I have to do every continent, you know,

267
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.050
except for like Antarctica or like places that don't want me. Right.

268
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.420
But anyways, I'm going to be a, I'm going to be in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

269
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.970
I'm going to put, first of all, I'm going to be in Denver, Rocky Mountain.

270
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.300
Ha. And please don't bring me any fucking pot cookies. All right.

271
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.770
I don't enjoy the I, I don't, I, okay. I, I just,

272
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.210
it's too much on the 12th and 13th I believe the, uh,

273
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.970
12th and 13th is Wyoming and Denver or Denver, Wyoming. I don't know which one.

274
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.830
And then the 14th is Valentine's Day.

275
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.720
And that's of course when a young people go out because they're not smart enough

276
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:04.100
to realize that, uh, that you can say, I love you on any day of the year.

277
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.780
You know, what's a great day to go out? Go out on like the 17th, you know,

278
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:13.730
or the 16th and the 19th or the 21st don't go out right before,

279
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:18.590
go out after God. After I say this every fucking year, you know,

280
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.633
look at us.

281
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.200
The super bowl this year is on the seventh and the fucking Valentine stays on

282
00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:28.340
the 14th. Now those are two absolutely absolute shit show days.

283
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.630
Now obviously if your own fucking football team is playing in the Superbowl,

284
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.010
you know this, you're gonna want to watch you with a couple of other fans,

285
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.010
right? However,

286
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.010
that doesn't mean that you're going to go to one of those shit show fucking

287
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.970
super bowl party. So like I said, as always, take the fucking game,

288
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.600
let it go for a good 90 minutes. Then you come in, you sit down,

289
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.490
you blow through all the commercials,

290
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:55.440
you blow through the fucking halftime show.

291
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.390
Fast forward through all of that shit.

292
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.680
And then when the game really starts getting down to it, you know,

293
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.100
you're caught right up. You'll catch up in like the beginning of the, uh,

294
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.360
the fourth quarter. Then you can just kind of watch it in real time.

295
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:12.210
It's fucking perfect. And you know, blow your whole afternoon.

296
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.210
Oh fuck. Sorry guys. No more pot cookies for me. Um,

297
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.500
and then the, uh, on the 14th, same thing, just wait like two, three days after

298
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.650
when you can get a fucking reservation,

299
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:28.290
you can go to the restaurant you want to go to and they haven't jacked the

300
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.290
prices up through the fucking roof. Um,

301
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.960
and then you're done. Right.

302
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.953
<v 3>Okay,</v>

303
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.210
<v 1>here's a good one, right? Cause guys,</v>

304
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.260
we usually don't get shit on Valentine's Day. So, uh,

305
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.630
I suggest don't get your wife's shit either.

306
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.650
Just take her out to dinner and fucking leave it at that. And if she's like,

307
00:18:48.651 --> 00:18:50.600
I thought you were going to get me something else, just be like,

308
00:18:50.601 --> 00:18:55.180
well did you get me something else? And when she's like, no, you'd be like, ah,

309
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.250
well I paid for dinner. That's it.

310
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.840
And that guarantees that should be in a fucking awful fight on Valentine's Day.

311
00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:06.230
How you like that? Let's see what I'm staring steering you towards.

312
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.620
Um, for the life of me,

313
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.640
Bill Burke coming to Cheyenne Civic Center to 11.

314
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.530
The fuck are you talking about?

315
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.583
That can't be right.

316
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.593
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

317
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.970
<v 1>Bill Barb will perform at the Cheyenne Civic Center in Cheyenne,</v>

318
00:19:25.971 --> 00:19:29.930
Wyoming on Thursday, February 11th. All right, so then on the 12th,

319
00:19:29.931 --> 00:19:32.630
I must be in Denver. Is that right?

320
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.580
Jesus Christ Bell. How do, why don't you fucking know your own goddamn schedule?

321
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.370
Denver, I had to go ski and when I'm out there, you know,

322
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.350
I ski once every 10 years. I really should take a lesson because that,

323
00:19:47.351 --> 00:19:51.110
that is just the a blow your fuck. Yes. The 12th. All right,

324
00:19:51.111 --> 00:19:56.111
so the 11th Thursday I'm in Wyoming and February 12th I'm in Denver.

325
00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.800
Ah, that's how it is. Very nice. So there you go.

326
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.390
The Cheyenne Civic Center,

327
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.510
you know they always have fucking rodeos and shit there, right?

328
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.030
What goes on there, Toby? Keith,

329
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:15.470
Cheyenne Civic Center civic up to be like some old ABA building

330
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:23.390
images. Jesus Christ. Look at Cheyenne.

331
00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:27.560
This looks like a fucking opera plays there. And Opera Bill and orchestra.

332
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.700
Um, the Cheyenne Civic Center.

333
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.810
Go on to Cheyenne, Wyoming.

334
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.180
What are some of the great things that happened in Wyoming over the years? Huh?

335
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.500
Only thing you always hear is bad stuff isn't that place with a,

336
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.140
with a tight that kid cause he was gay to the fence until he died.

337
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.650
This isn't good. They don't have any sports tapes.

338
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:57.340
The fuck am I going to Wyoming for Wyoming?

339
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.970
Is this where like Ted Turner can ride his horse all over the place and be like,

340
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:01.930
I own that.

341
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.770
I'll own that to get off of there or I'll take you out of Yardi,

342
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.470
your basic cable package. Take my, my fucking TV Outta here.

343
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.440
Um, don't ever start any shit with Ted Tourney in Wyoming. All right.

344
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.840
Because he's going to come and arrest you and then he's going to be the judge

345
00:21:23.841 --> 00:21:26.390
and he's going to throw you in. GE owns the whole fucking state. Does he?

346
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.860
I believe he does, right? I don't know. Anyways,

347
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.010
let's get to the fucking rates here for this week. Oh, Billy,

348
00:21:35.011 --> 00:21:40.000
all over the place. All right. What are we got here? The first read.

349
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.330
Oh, look who's back everybody. Sherry's.

350
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.430
Barry's a must be a clam day coming up. Oh yes it is.

351
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:52.750
Valentine's Day is next week. Finding the right gift can be tricky.

352
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.790
Uh, tell a personal story relating to Valentine's Day. Well, you know,

353
00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:01.570
I think it's bullshit. You know, I always hated it when I was fucking younger.

354
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.370
I think everything's, uh,

355
00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.690
overpriced and everybody just sits there looking around at everybody,

356
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.520
you know, and then somebody gets proposed to and they're like, oh my God.

357
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.840
And then, you know,

358
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.290
even if you already proposed through the one year with this still kind of

359
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.260
fucking jealous and sad, you know,

360
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:25.430
then you just sit there splitting a dessert. That's the part I hate the most.

361
00:22:25.431 --> 00:22:28.730
Just sitting there splitting dessert because that means I've wanted to leave for

362
00:22:28.731 --> 00:22:33.290
at least an hour and 10 minutes. I just feel like you're distant tonight.

363
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.190
Um, oh, here's an example of the story.

364
00:22:37.191 --> 00:22:40.960
Why you give Valentine's Day gifts, getting the wrong gifts,

365
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.210
getting the right gift, horror stories of waiting until the last minute,

366
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.840
et cetera. I don't think you should get them a gift out of the,

367
00:22:47.841 --> 00:22:50.630
you should get them anything more than Sherry's berries.

368
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.070
The fuck are they getting you?

369
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.150
Where is the copy for what the lay is going to get the guy,

370
00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.220
this is such a fucking bullshit. This, this, this whole holidays.

371
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.130
Completely fucking sexist. And I, you know, I, you'd like to hear more raw,

372
00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:09.740
a little chatter from the fucking feminist ladies there about this. You know,

373
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.260
why are you taking me out?

374
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.100
Why don't I take you out every other year and then I get you a gift. Come on,

375
00:23:16.101 --> 00:23:20.540
ladies. Let's have an even playing field, right? All right.

376
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.180
You want to give something unique that she'll love,

377
00:23:23.181 --> 00:23:27.050
but you don't want to spend a zillion dollars. You know? You want to say, Hey,

378
00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:29.270
I'm really like you. You know I really like you,

379
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:32.960
but I'm not quite in love with you yet, but I'd like you to continue fucking me.

380
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.290
What would be a perfect gift? Sherry's berries,

381
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:41.291
freshly dripped strawberries from Sherry's berries starting at only 1999 it's

382
00:23:42.591 --> 00:23:47.450
over 40% savings. That's less than hookah, and if you don't want,

383
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.070
if you really want hero status, you can double the berries for just 10 bucks.

Now they're not. They never are.

387
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:05.450
They fucking get yanked and then they throw them and they ripen on the truck.

388
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.430
They ripe.

389
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:10.640
They're all fruit ripens on the fucking truck without the nutrients from the

390
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:13.100
vine to ensure the best gift experience.

391
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.260

All the time. It's hard for us guys to say what we feel.

409
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.370
What if there was a gift that said send it for you Jesus.

410
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.150
See how sexist this shit is yet too fucking dumb to say what you thinking.

Why don't we handle it? Why? With a bunch of Shit we ripped out of the ground.

412
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.360

I always thought it was fucking bullshit.

418
00:25:56.961 --> 00:25:59.210
I always thought it was bullshit in all a day.

419
00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:03.020
You know you pay way too much money and then halfway through some other woman

420
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:05.900
gets proposed to it. Even if you already proposed to your woman,

421
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.710
she's still look it over though. Like, oh,

424
00:26:14.271 --> 00:26:17.810

That's pro flowers.com. Click on the microphone and type in my code bar.

440
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.220
You must order it by Friday, right midnight in order to get this deal. Wow.

441
00:27:21.221 --> 00:27:25.270
That's going to be an issue, huh? Okay. Cut Right into Sherry's berries.

442
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.110
Sherry's fucking berries. Well, there's only one more here,

443
00:27:29.111 --> 00:27:31.960
so I might as well plow through it. No, no, there's two more. All right.

444
00:27:31.961 --> 00:27:36.810
We'll split it up. We'll split it up. Uh, you know,

445
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.050
I was actually debating watching the Superbowl by myself and doing a little bit

446
00:27:41.051 --> 00:27:44.650
of commentating during the game. You guys seem to enjoy that. Um,

447
00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.910
maybe I'll do commentating during the shittiest most boring parts,

448
00:27:48.911 --> 00:27:53.911
but then I'd have to sit and watch it like whoever's opening and I know sting's

449
00:27:53.921 --> 00:27:57.070
playing the halftime shown as much as I want to go see him and,

450
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.500
and Vinny Collie UDAs on my bucket list.

451
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:04.790
Like that's not the right band for halftime at the Super Bowl.

452
00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.123
Huh?

453
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:13.110
Every breath you take every day move you made.

454
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.260
He's going to have to go more uptempo shit.

455
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.380
What do you think sting's going to play from his repertoire?

456
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.103
<v 2>Huh?</v>

457
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.880
<v 1>It's thing of 10 summer tails,</v>

458
00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.460
but that's not the queen of my heart. No, that's not the

459
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.680
Shay of Mar Hall or you can't play that song.

460
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

461
00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:43.090
<v 1>Bow Now, but double double bow. Oh, now now what's, I was at boon.</v>

462
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.143
Doga Diego.

463
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:46.760
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

464
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.340
<v 1>Fucking song. We said then there was a song about the brothers</v>

465
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.280
one Betty was a coward. None of that is going to play well.

466
00:28:55.060 --> 00:29:00.040
It probably plays synchronicity. Right? You had a football game.

467
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.820
That's stadium rock. Did you set that goal?

468
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.903
<v 2>Whoa.</v>

469
00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.150
<v 1>All right. Bunch of old baby boomers. Second along. Bunch of kids go on.</v>

470
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.450
That's not dubstep. Um, they had,

471
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.110
do I want to fast forward through all that shit? Yeah,

472
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:19.380
I'm thinking about maybe commentating on some of that stuff. I'll just do like,

473
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.130
uh, maybe I'll just do like three minutes of the game, you know,

474
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.950
cause I think it'll get boring after awhile, you know? Um,

475
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.920
at least if I'm going to get bored in myself,

476
00:29:28.921 --> 00:29:33.150
I would think that you guys would get bored. No. Um, all right,

477
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.360
let's plow through here. So I don't have any boots in the fridge, so I'm just,

478
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:40.260
I guess the month of, uh, I sorta half as committed to this,

479
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.310
like not losing. Is that a bad thing? Fuck is the other,

480
00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.120
oh, there it is. Sorry. Um,

481
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.280
talks about everything. Pop Cookie rating out here, Shane. Oh,

482
00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:58.910
I haven't been on the fucking road in weeks, so, um, I might be doing wink,

483
00:29:58.911 --> 00:30:01.100
wink. Oh, I am doing a show this week. That's right.

484
00:30:01.101 --> 00:30:04.790
I'm doing the a d del Reg del Ray at the El Rey.

485
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.900
Oh geesh. I'm a native comedy and Rock,

486
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:14.330
uh, Dean Del Rey's 50th birthday party. He's going to have, um,

487
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.120
you know, he's going to have Joe Rogan, Krista, Leah, myself. Um,

488
00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:22.440
I know it was a couple of other comics, uh,

489
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.780
red bands gonna be down there and I want to say,

490
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.870
I want to say there's maybe one other comic. And then after that, um, detail,

491
00:30:32.871 --> 00:30:35.430
Ray's gonna front a band, um,

492
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.400
that will include the likes of Rudy Sargasso, Dave Cushner, Dave Lombardo,

493
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.060
uh, Tracy guns, Gilby Clark,

494
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.750
all these rock stars and he's going to sing the entire highway to hell album.

495
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.860
And uh, all Billy red face might sit in for a song or two,

496
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.950
but it's going to be a great night. You can get tickets at, uh,

497
00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.660
golden voice dotcom. And also,

498
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.690
um, I might be doing a, a,

499
00:31:02.691 --> 00:31:06.300
a surprise show somewhere locally cause I gotta run my hours.

500
00:31:06.301 --> 00:31:09.970
So when I go to Cheyenne, Wyoming or not get out there,

501
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.990
check out a spread, I want to make sure that they are going to be on my game.

502
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.530
I don't want people in the crowd be like, what the fuck man,

503
00:31:18.531 --> 00:31:23.531
you made us wait to be number 50 for that bull shit walking around.

504
00:31:24.111 --> 00:31:27.200
And they had John Denver fucking cheap coats, right.

505
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.940
Got The sheep lining rocky Matt and had Colorado

506
00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.260
Bell. We don't talk like that. We'll talk like this.

507
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.650
That's what Wyoming is all about. I'm going to the Capitol Man.

508
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.320
Do they have open carry in Wyoming? You know,

509
00:31:42.321 --> 00:31:46.430
I made such a big deal about open carry in Texas and uh,

510
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.250
it turns out that they've had it in Oklahoma for years and there hasn't been a

511
00:31:49.251 --> 00:31:53.360
fucking problem. So um, it's kind of a non story.

512
00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.250
And then again,

513
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:59.540
I think that kind of adds to the touristy vibe of going to Texas and seeing

514
00:31:59.541 --> 00:32:03.670
people walking around with holsters. You know, maybe you can see,

515
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.190
have somebody have a fucking shoot out over like a parking parking space,

516
00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:11.920
a duel, right. Draw A,

517
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.580
yeah. Worst case scenario, just a bunch of people that I don't know die,

518
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.760
which is uh, considering with global warming and overpopulation.

519
00:32:19.761 --> 00:32:22.520
I think it's a good thing. I think they should have open carry, uh,

520
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.780
they should have everywhere. Everybody strapped

521
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.860
it would probably actually end up being safer when you think about it.

522
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.190
Cause I know like New York City for as much as everybody talks about how

523
00:32:35.191 --> 00:32:38.010
dangerous it was, uh, I just found on the,

524
00:32:38.011 --> 00:32:42.050
on the subways where all of a sudden you are riding in the car would fucking

525
00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:44.060
everybody, it's all mixed up.

526
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:48.050
There was a certain level of heightened courtesy because you didn't want to have

527
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:51.980
a fucking problem. You know, it's the subway, it's New York City.

528
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:54.040
You could get mugged, you could get the shit kicked out of you.

529
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.210
So people fucking minded their business.

530
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.330
So I would think if you had a whole state of everybody walking around with a gun

531
00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:03.350
on their hip, you know, somebody cuts you off in traffic, you know, Eh,

532
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:07.010
you know, yeah, I could yell you fucking asshole.

533
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:10.550
But if you start shooting at me, yeah, it's okay. Go ahead buddy. I mean,

534
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:12.020
I have a gun too, but you know what?

535
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:16.850
If I miss and you don't by all means go in front of me. You know,

536
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.600
like if somebody is being weird to you and you're at one of those ATM sits on

537
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:23.720
the outside of a building. Yeah, it's a very nervous moment for you.

538
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.810
But if you're in your car and that same person cuts you off,

539
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.030
you're fuck fucking kicked the shit out of you.

540
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.880
You fucking ticket and you're all toughing your cock,

541
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.630
which could lead to road rage. Now, if you know that that guy has a gun,

542
00:33:35.631 --> 00:33:37.490
he could just simply, you know,

543
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.700
pointed out the side of his car and just shoot in the general direction of your

544
00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:44.320
car. You figure at the very least he's got to hit the radiator, right?

545
00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.800
You have that steam coming up like in every fucking movie, GSD, good old boy.

546
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.693
Right?

547
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.910
You probably got to mind your fucking business.

548
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:55.900
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

549
00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.750
<v 1>Maybe that's the secret to ending all wars.</v>

550
00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.660
Everybody strapped and you have the gun out.

551
00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:05.290
You just walk in and every time you just walk, you just,

552
00:34:05.291 --> 00:34:08.740
the guns already pointed at somebody. How are you doing? I'm doing good.

553
00:34:08.741 --> 00:34:11.860
How are you? Fine. That's great. Yeah,

554
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.840
keep the conversation short and sweet.

555
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.433
<v 3>Okay.</v>

556
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:19.300
<v 1>I think I just saw ball our, all of our problems, right?</v>

557
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:23.860
Everybody's strapped with a gloated gun out pointed at somebody's safety off

558
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.750
because you'd be more relaxed, you know,

559
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.930
all they couldn't have safety off cause then when people fell asleep, you know,

560
00:34:30.931 --> 00:34:34.920
it's like falling asleep, you know, smoking, you can let your bed on fire,

561
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.240
you might squeeze off around, which doesn't even make sense, right?

562
00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:40.560
Cause you got to put pressure on it.

563
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.590
Unless you didn't have in one of those dreams. You know,

564
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.530
you have one of those dreams where you're falling or somebody just gives you a

565
00:34:46.531 --> 00:34:49.650
leg sweep, sweep your leg for whatever reason,

566
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.000
and you've got fucking 10 step maybe that, then you shoot yourself in the foot.

567
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.620
I bet podiatrist would be off the bet. They're all for open carry,

568
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.820
you know the foot doctors. All right.

569
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:07.800
You want me to do some reads for this week here? Let's get into it. Um,

570
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.180
where are we? Come on bill. For God's sakes.

571
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.760
I was on the right one to begin with.

572
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.500
Oh Hey, by the way, does anybody know like when a fucking, for whatever reason,

573
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.160
you download an album off of iTunes and then for whatever reason it just sorta

574
00:35:29.161 --> 00:35:33.480
disappears off of your phone and then fucking reappears because you haven't

575
00:35:33.481 --> 00:35:37.560
hooked it up to the computer. You know what I mean? With phone.

576
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:41.400
And that makes it legitimately on your phone rather than just going through the

577
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:45.780
air or whatever the fuck's going on. Right. You know,

578
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:49.650
cause you got the Wifi on and then the Wifi shuts off and then the album

579
00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:50.371
disappears.

580
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:54.090
So then your old like may see it downloaded again and then you got that album

581
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:57.330
and then the, the, the, the first one comes back and now you've got doubles.

582
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.130
How do you get rid of the other one?

583
00:35:59.131 --> 00:36:01.350
I've gone into my iTunes and I've gone to delete it,

584
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:03.720
but on my phone it's still in double, so I don't know how to do it.

585
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.950
So the song ends and then it replays again. It plays everything twice.

586
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.520
That happened me with van Halen in 1984 and then nas album illmatic it.

587
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.020
Um, as much as I love both of those albums,

588
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:18.870
I don't need both songs to play twice. How do I get rid of the other one?

589
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:22.380
If anybody can tell me, I would really appreciate it. All right.

590
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.760
Okay. Kanye situation. Hey Bill,

591
00:36:26.761 --> 00:36:31.500
red blooded American male here who heard about the Kanye situation and was

592
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:32.580
scared shitless.

593
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.170
I'm not going to disclose whether or not I enjoy what he was accused of enjoying

594
00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.990
a parentheses. If you don't know the story,

595
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:44.100
his ex Amber Rose implied on Twitter that he enjoyed a finger in his ass.

596
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.240
Actually it was fingers plural. Yeah.

597
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:51.690
I didn't hear about this fucking story and it may be feel good of as a human

598
00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:54.630
being that I was somehow out of the loop of this fucking news.

599
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.680
He said this scared me because it doesn't matter what you're into.

600
00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:03.600
If an ex says shit like that, you're going to get branded. Um,

601
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.150
sir, you sounded like your ex put a vase in your ass.

602
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:07.623
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

603
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.260
<v 1>Anyways, he goes, it's how urban myths about journals get started.</v>

604
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.210
Unless you're fearless Jim Norton and you can say something like that with a

605
00:37:20.211 --> 00:37:24.140
smile on your face, on the airways. It's a pretty tough situation to be in.

606
00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.840
How does a man like Kanye deal with that?

607
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.220
<v 0>Uh, I don't know.</v>

608
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.650
<v 1>I went, I started to read it, but I don't know. It just,</v>

609
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.570
I don't know if it is true. I don't give a shit not,

610
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.600
it's really none of my business.

611
00:37:43.601 --> 00:37:48.601
Before I could tell from the article he was talking shit about her now hat if

612
00:37:48.941 --> 00:37:52.260
she had half her hand up his fucking assets,

613
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.920
some point is probably not a smart idea if he's sensitive about that part of his

614
00:37:56.921 --> 00:37:59.530
sexuality to be talking Shit.

615
00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.173
<v 0>Right.</v>

616
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.980
<v 1>Which makes me kind of believe him</v>

617
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.940
<v 0>that it didn't happen</v>

618
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.370
<v 1>because you figure if she had that over him,</v>

619
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:13.700
if she was walking around with them like a sock puppet, right.

620
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.880
That he wouldn't go around talking shit about her.

621
00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.413
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

622
00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.710
<v 1>I gotta be honest. It's one of those things that I,</v>

623
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.800
I legitimately feel is none of my fucking business.

624
00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:30.270
And, uh,

625
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:34.060
whether it's true or not doesn't make me look at Kanye one way or the other.

626
00:38:34.061 --> 00:38:37.660
I mean, I don't give a fuck. Give a shit what the guy does.

627
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.820
And I also think a,

628
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:43.600
I don't think you walk around talking shit about someone who used to go out

629
00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:46.630
with, didn't work out, fucking grow up. You're already married.

630
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:51.810
You found somebody else leave him alone. Right. I don't know. Look,

631
00:38:51.811 --> 00:38:53.520
I don't know what happened, but all I know he was,

632
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.680
if it's true that he was talking shit about her,

633
00:38:55.681 --> 00:38:58.380
I probably should stop saying talking shit when we're talking about a finger up

634
00:38:58.381 --> 00:39:03.010
your ass. Um, you know, having said all that,

635
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:03.940
it's fucking hilarious.

636
00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.840
<v 0>Um, okay.</v>

637
00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.873
<v 1>You know,</v>

638
00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:16.020
I would think that there's a lot of rival rappers right now trying to write down

639
00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:19.590
words that rhyme with the phrase fingers up your ass.

640
00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.440
<v 0>Uh hmm.</v>

641
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.070
<v 1>Lingers in the class with fingers up your ass. I'm sorry.</v>

642
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.490
I don't know that that's,

643
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.680
there's gotta be something that they're coming up with. Oh,

644
00:39:30.681 --> 00:39:33.850
that's an easy one too. If I was,

645
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:37.210
if I was a rapper and somebody said that my ex put fingers up my ass,

646
00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:40.090
I'll all I would be thinking was like, God damn it. Why didn't she say rectum?

647
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:41.893
<v 0>Okay.</v>

648
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.290
<v 1>At least make it difficult to arrive something. Rectum check.</v>

649
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.950
You checked them fingers up your rectum. Now thing is check the

650
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.620
throw cleaned going up your rectum. Sorry.

651
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.003
<v 0>Anyways,</v>

652
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:09.780
<v 1>um, classes. I like that and I'll hold that to 100% on him.</v>

653
00:40:09.781 --> 00:40:13.110
What about her with this thank you finger stuff. Jesus Christ.

654
00:40:13.111 --> 00:40:15.100
You gotta go with the fist bump. Now when you go with, into,

655
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.950
when you run into amber, give her the ll bug. Want to stay away from that?

656
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.900
Get a fucking tetanus shot. It's funny, she,

657
00:40:23.901 --> 00:40:26.940
she shook her hand and then all of a sudden you just started fucking talking

658
00:40:26.941 --> 00:40:31.080
shit about yourself the way Kanye does. Um, all right. Classes,

659
00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.420
uh, in high school. Uh, hello. You Orangutan Looking motherfucker.

660
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.080
I guarantee that this guy is the ugliest motherfucker.

661
00:40:40.081 --> 00:40:44.790
I really find that people, uh, people who trash the way I look the most,

662
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.010
especially on Twitter, never have like their uh, never have their picture.

663
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.260
I don't look like an orangutan do I? They're fucking older.

664
00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.060
They look like old people. Um, in a house coat. Uh,

665
00:41:00.061 --> 00:41:04.770
I am a senior in high school. Yeah. Like a kid. Oh, you probably 18.

666
00:41:04.771 --> 00:41:08.880
At this point. Your punk, uh, and this may seem childish to talk about,

667
00:41:08.881 --> 00:41:11.640
but I had been thinking about dropping one of my classes,

668
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.680
this class is music theory,

669
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:18.330
a p and I'm a straight B studio students, so I'm no genius.

670
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.530
I talked to my teacher and guidance counselor who both said it was fine to drop

671
00:41:22.531 --> 00:41:25.650
it. Music theory being a unique class.

672
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:30.840
What was that appendix right there at the end there that didn't make,

673
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:35.270
that was all part of that sentence. Anyways,

674
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.770
recently I came into school thinking, uh, that was the shit.

675
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:44.390
Like I came into school thinking that this shit was over and I wouldn't have to

676
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:45.500
take the class anymore,

677
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:49.190
only to have the assistant principal of my school tell me that I would not be

678
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:53.840
able to drop at that this point I'm frustrated because I'm very unhappy in the

679
00:41:53.841 --> 00:41:58.730
class and the only ones separating me from dropping the class is my prick of an

680
00:41:58.731 --> 00:41:59.810
assistant principal.

681
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:04.130
Should I sack up and finish the rest of the year or should I stand up from my

682
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:06.620
case and become a stubborn prick in the process?

683
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.030
The class gives me anxiety and I'm not really into music anymore.

684
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.000
I'm thinking about picking up a second English class.

685
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.310
If the principal doesn't let me drop the class,

686
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:19.280
I would probably end up skipping it every day because I hate the class.

687
00:42:19.281 --> 00:42:23.360
That fucking much am I in the wrong? Any advice would be great, Bill. Thanks.

688
00:42:23.361 --> 00:42:28.190
And Go fuck yourself. Um, or when I was a kid, when you went to high school,

689
00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:32.540
you couldn't drop classes that happened in college. You're a senior,

690
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.250
it's February, don't you get out in like the middle of May.

691
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.360
Um, and if you transfer,

692
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:44.300
do you have to make up the first two semesters or whatever the fuck it is?

693
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.100
September, October, November.

694
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

695
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.120
<v 1>December and January worth of shit. And you're second English class.</v>

696
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:56.740
I just toughed it out. It's music theory. I mean,

697
00:42:56.741 --> 00:43:01.060
that sounds boring as shit. Um, but whatever,

698
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.933
just tough it up.

699
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:03.800
<v 2>Okay.</v>

700
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.350
<v 1>I, I, that's what I would do. I mean,</v>

701
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.580
I mean I would rather tuck up tough. I mean,

702
00:43:09.581 --> 00:43:11.850
I mean maybe just speak my about myself personally,

703
00:43:11.851 --> 00:43:16.680
but I rather tough art music theory than dare take another fucking English

704
00:43:16.681 --> 00:43:17.670
class. But that's me.

705
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:19.483
<v 2>Okay.</v>

706
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.090
<v 1>Yeah, dude, just fucking tough it out.</v>

707
00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:27.160
What's it giving you is anxiety for it? It's a music theory teacher.

708
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.480
It's not like they're going to be like,

709
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.230
so like the football coaches teaching it Izzy. Yeah. Fuck it.

710
00:43:34.231 --> 00:43:35.064
Tough it out.

711
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.760
That seems like a class that even if you just halfway pay attention,

712
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.570
you can at least get a c. Right? I Dunno dude. This fuck it.

713
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.950
It's fucking hangover from this goddamn cookie. I mean,

714
00:43:46.951 --> 00:43:50.460
I fell asleep last night at like six o'clock. I slept for like 12 fucking hours.

715
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.290
I'm still exhausted. All right. Being Stung by shit.

716
00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.373
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

717
00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.050
<v 1>Hey, Billy, big freckle balls. Love that.</v>

718
00:44:02.051 --> 00:44:04.170
You guys think I son my nuts. Uh,

719
00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:08.330
your last podcast touched on being stung by spiders and Shit,

720
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.810
and you touched on sting rays. Uh,

721
00:44:11.811 --> 00:44:16.550
those fucks that killed Steve Irvin and I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

722
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:20.900
He fucked with them. And the thing felt like it had to do to defend itself.

723
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.930
All right. I'll tell you right now the,

724
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:30.260
the rejoicing that wildlife did overall when the crocodile hunter got killed,

725
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.010
I mean, the level of stress that he brought,

726
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:39.330
every animal that he came into contact with all, see, he's hunching up.

727
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.960
He doesn't like that. The thing is in fear for its fucking life.

728
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.380
And you're going up and you're fucking with the thing.

729
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:49.740
You know when your little fucking booty shorts. Anyways, he goes,

730
00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:54.741
I'm Canadian and I spent five minutes in an American ocean and was stung by a

731
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:59.540
sting ray. Well, all of your oceans are American too.

732
00:44:59.541 --> 00:45:02.390
You live in North America. We're all Americans.

733
00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.640
But I guess once you say you're Canadian, yeah,

734
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.613
<v 3>yeah.</v>

735
00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.600
<v 1>Um, United. Okay. I'm a Canadian. I spent five minutes in an American ocean,</v>

736
00:45:10.601 --> 00:45:11.890
was stung by a stingray.

737
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:17.040
It felt like a hot nail being driven through my foot and the pain went up and up

738
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:22.690
for hours. It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. Uh,

739
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:26.080
let that be a lesson to all the listeners that sting rays are not something to

740
00:45:26.081 --> 00:45:30.370
be fucked with. A nothing can describe that pain. It was insane.

741
00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:35.890
Love the podcast. Fuck you in Boston because they win. So fucking always

742
00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.650
cause they win. So fucking always. Um, yeah, we, you know,

743
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.880
this is the thing. We're not supposed to be in the ocean.

744
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.273
<v 3>Okay?</v>

745
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.070
<v 1>Okay. I'm going to say that again.</v>

746
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:55.040
We're not supposed to be in the ocean. We can't breathe in there.

747
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.300
We can't see what's beneath us. We're completely vulnerable when we go in there.

748
00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:00.560
We're not supposed to be in there.

749
00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.330
That sting ray has evolved to fuck up things that belong in the ocean,

750
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.750
all of which are way bigger and way faster. Generally speaking,

751
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.880
some giant fish goes to fucking kill this sting ray.

752
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:18.380
It's got to have enough juice in its shank to make a shark go away.

753
00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:21.170
I would think so. Yeah. You come walking in,

754
00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.090
you fucking pink feet. Come walking in there. If you're white, right?

755
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.740
You go in there and you did just yet. It's over subpar.

756
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.030
I'm surprised they don't got enough juice to kill you.

757
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:34.610
Cause I know Steve Irving,

758
00:46:34.611 --> 00:46:37.010
what happened to him as he got stabbed in the fucking head?

759
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:42.800
I think it punctured his heart. What are the odds of that?

760
00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:46.840
I wonder what his fucking last thoughts were.

761
00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.650
He's both are really fucking sting. Right?

762
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.313
<v 3>Okay.</v>

763
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.520
<v 1>Or was he just thinking, oh, let me just pull this out.</v>

764
00:46:58.521 --> 00:47:02.450
I'm sure that'd be fine enough. Oh, that's artery blood. All right.

765
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.030
Love the podcast skill. Fuck. He said, you know, it's funny.

766
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.760
Somebody Australia's can be offended that I'm actually fucking talking like they

767
00:47:07.761 --> 00:47:10.820
haven't thought about this shit. Why isn't it like 10 years ago?

768
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.150
What is the statute of limitations when you, uh,

769
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.940
deliberately go and fuck with a Stinger and get killed by that? It's um,

770
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:24.530
that you can't keep talking about. All right. Beer drinking contest advice.

771
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.910
Dear Billy Beer Bong. I'm a big fan man.

772
00:47:28.911 --> 00:47:33.220
I to your podcast for a couple of years now and I had the chance to see you

773
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.790
[inaudible] Botnick at the Chicago theater. Great show.

774
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.660
So I've been roped into a beard, beer drinking Olympics,

775
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:44.860
parentheses for charity by a buddy of mine. And being that I'm an old fuck,

776
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.320
not quite where you are, I'm 38.

777
00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:52.410
I was wondering if you have advice in terms of longevity backstory on me.

778
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:57.370
I'm a Canadian. I'm Canadian pocket square wearing habs fan.

779
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.260
I know. Fuck me, right? I don't give a shit.

780
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.500
As long as you have a sense of humor about yourself that can really hammer that

781
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:06.490
back. Beer is my first choice when I drink as I assume as yours.

782
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.550
What would you do to get ready for something like this? Thanks.

783
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:13.870
And Go fuck yourself. Um, well you gotta I would think,

784
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:19.910
aren't they going to be different events? You know,

785
00:48:19.911 --> 00:48:23.600
there's got to be drinking beer, there's got to be drinking hard stuff.

786
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:29.410
Is it all just going to be beer drinking? Wait a second.

787
00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:31.750
I was wondering if you have any advice in terms of longevity. All right.

788
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:33.570
As far I thought you meant how to, how to live long,

789
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.280
you mean how to hang in there? Um,

790
00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.090
well if it's a beer drinking contest,

791
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:44.060
then I would just drink hard stuff leading up to it, you know,

792
00:48:44.061 --> 00:48:48.210
a couple of beers and had like your shots too, you know, I dunno.

793
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:49.460
Build up your tolerance.

794
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.000
This doesn't seem like this is a responsible thing for me to be telling you to

795
00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:55.910
do. I would be, I would just go there and have a good time.

796
00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.490
That's what I would do. And I wouldn't try to win a medal.

797
00:48:58.491 --> 00:49:01.040
You don't want to be the guy that wins that the guy wins.

798
00:49:01.041 --> 00:49:04.370
That's going to have like fucking rosacea on the side of his face from Booz and

799
00:49:04.371 --> 00:49:06.590
you know, it's going to look like fucking WC fields.

800
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.690
You don't want to be the guy that can win that contest.

801
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:12.950
I would say just go there. I have a good time, you know, and uh,

802
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.400
stop short of being the guy that fucking pukes all over everybody.

803
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.920
That would be my advice. Uh, alright,

804
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.970
let me do the last reads here really quickly and then I'll do the last question.

805
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:28.760
I'm fucking trying to shake off this goddamn yawning from that fucking cookie.

806
00:49:28.761 --> 00:49:32.040
I'm like over tired here. Alright. Oh Gay. I,

807
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.120
I've you guys put watching any of the super bowl pregame. Why would you,

808
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.700
are they doing the old man versus the young man

809
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.140
<v 4>but for the Denver Broncos, Holloway Stopped Cam Newton,</v>

810
00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.780
these panthers of the fucking Carolina.

811
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:46.010
<v 5>Well,</v>

812
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:49.920
I'll tell you about cab building is this guy is one of those rare talents that

813
00:49:49.921 --> 00:49:52.200
just can hurt you on every level.

814
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:53.330
<v 2>Okay?</v>

815
00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:56.570
<v 5>He covers receivers. No problem. This guy's got ruddy.</v>

816
00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.160
You're going to rush this guy.

817
00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.760
You can't bring up Dab with just what guy you're going to stand there and stare

818
00:50:01.761 --> 00:50:05.540
at him. He's going to pick you apart. I'll tell you right now, I void that.

819
00:50:05.541 --> 00:50:09.080
I want to have this job as being a coach. Order these Denver Bronco [inaudible]

820
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.020
<v 4>Mike, what do you say they're going to do? Who Take the cue?</v>

821
00:50:13.021 --> 00:50:16.920
The Gabe is Deborah has to get to ball and they have to score early.

822
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.510
They got to skill more often.

823
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.380
Their best hope to control Cam Newton is to take the panthers out of their game

824
00:50:23.381 --> 00:50:26.940
plan. If they're playing catch up all night, you know, with dead dead for

825
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.760
[inaudible], you know, I know Peyton Manning's older,

826
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:34.730
but this is still paid Manny. Okay. It's his last game, man.

827
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:36.380
I'll tell you right now, he's a competitor.

828
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:40.160
He's going to get out there and although to pair to each have a good defense,

829
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.920
they still are a young defensive unit. Okay.

830
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.720
And then you'd watch that to come into play,

831
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.420
especially after they make their halftime adjustments.

832
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.070
<v 1>Is that about it? Something like that. They're gonna try to exploit the seeds.</v>

833
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:58.340
Um, what about special teams? What about Peyton Manning's wife?

834
00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:02.750
Take an h, g. H what are the odds of that dollar shave club? Everyone,

lots of players will be sporting play off beards.

836

Now that the post season's here,

837
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:10.640
can you imagine if Jazelle was getting fucking HGH sent to the house?

838
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.090
I'm sure that story would just disappear after a couple of moments.

839
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.620

Within minutes you'll be printing postage, right? Your desk. Go to stance.com.

879
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:28.110
Before you do anything else, took on the

880
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.610
microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinburburthatstamps.com enter bur.

881
00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:39.540
All righty. Mercifully it is ended. Um, all right,

882
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:40.560
let's get back to, uh,

883
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:43.620
I got one more read here and then I gotta wrap this fucker up.

884
00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:50.010
Tam For me to go. All right. Dating in the workplace, Aka, no,

885
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:55.470
geesh. Billy fuckboy bar. Oh Hey. By the way,

886
00:53:55.471 --> 00:53:58.770
I finished the second season of top boy. I highly, uh,

887
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.100
highly recommend it. Um, alright.

888
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:07.190
There's a lady in my workplace that I have a huge crush on,

889
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:11.880
but I've fucked everything up by drunkenly telling her best friend at a company

890
00:54:11.881 --> 00:54:14.310
holiday party that I had a crush on, on a,

891
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.940
I say fucked up because I know how females communicate.

892
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.240
I might as well have just walked up to the girl I had a crush on and told her I

893
00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:27.870
know from a past job that dating in the workplace fucks everything else up at

894
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:30.570
work. I had told myself I'd never do it again,

895
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:34.710
but for some reason my brain couldn't say no to this girl anyway.

896
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:39.030
I know this girl knows I like her from her best friend and it made our work

897
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:42.180
dynamic awkward just because when we interact now,

898
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:46.860
both of us feel like we have to fulfill some sort of role.

899
00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.100
Well, he should have just walked up to it says, Hey, I got a little drunk.

900
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.120
I said some things to your girlfriend, uh, that you know,

901
00:54:55.121 --> 00:54:59.590
I should've said to you that I can't say that that's too forward. Oh,

902
00:54:59.591 --> 00:55:00.940
the office just makes it creepy.

903
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:04.150
You can't lean on anything as you're talking to her,

904
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:08.670
you might as well just be standing there rubbing your balls. Ah, this,

905
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.840
this situation. One day I said fuck it,

906
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.200
and half aster route to an art museum.

907
00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.440
But she had friends in town said she couldn't.

908
00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:21.670
What pisses me off is that I used to hang out with my coworkers and this girl

909
00:55:21.671 --> 00:55:25.060
every now and then now, no, no one invites me to hang out.

910
00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:28.450
When they do a background on the company,

911
00:55:28.451 --> 00:55:32.740
it's under a hundred people and we're all in our twenties for the most part. Uh,

912
00:55:32.741 --> 00:55:36.400
what's the best way to pursue this girl in this situation and how do I mentally

913
00:55:36.401 --> 00:55:39.520
handle the fact that it's affected my ability to hang out with my coworkers,

914
00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:44.140
my other coworkers, I really want closure to this thing, whether it be a date,

915
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:47.470
whether I date her or she tells me she's done interested.

916
00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.190
I don't care at this point. I really don't like the tension at work. Thanks.

917
00:55:51.191 --> 00:55:53.650
And Go fuck yourself. Yeah. Which says to me,

918
00:55:53.651 --> 00:55:57.650
you don't really even like this girl Mike.

919
00:55:57.651 --> 00:56:00.420
I just want to ask around and get rid of the tension. And then she says yes.

920
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:04.220
So she says, no, I really don't give a fuck at this moment. This is what you do.

921
00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.630
This is what you do, sir. You just just fucking blow it off.

922
00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:15.340
Just blow it off. You don't give a shit. Just act normal around her. All right?

923
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.830
Then she'll be gone. Like, oh he doesn't give a fuck.

924
00:56:17.831 --> 00:56:19.570
And then she'll probably end up being interested in you.

925
00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:23.250
Cause that's how they fucking work. All right? Don't,

926
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.920
don't hang out with the people you work with. Fuck someone you don't work with.

927
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:30.100
You need to create a social circle outside of work.

928
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.540
The people at work should be the people you see Monday through Friday. Okay?

929
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:38.020
And then once Friday, see you later guys. Take it easy. What are you doing?

930
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:41.380
I'm getting the fuck away from you, right? Then you go out,

931
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:44.620
you can do your fucking black tar heroin or whatever the fuck you want to do.

932
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:47.590
And then there's no awkwardness at the copier. All right?

933
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.280
You already said you've, you've,

934
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:54.280
you fuck somebody that you worked with before and how that made your last job

935
00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.930
awkward yet. Here you go again.

936
00:56:56.350 --> 00:57:00.820
And for some reason you're not even in a relationship yet and it's already

937
00:57:00.821 --> 00:57:02.440
fucking up your coat. You're a,

938
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.530
<v 2>yeah,</v>

939
00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:05.011
<v 1>just your,</v>

940
00:57:05.011 --> 00:57:08.070
your interaction with your coworkers yet you want to pursue this thing too.

941
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.690
I would just let it go. Just let it go. And uh,

942
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.233
<v 2>listen.</v>

943
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.050
<v 1>You want to fuck somebody at work? Don't try and fuck them. All right.</v>

944
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:23.220
Just come in with a big smile on your face on Monday and every, you know,

945
00:57:23.221 --> 00:57:26.480
nobody knows what the fuck you did. And they're all hanging out with each other,

946
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.310
they're all gossiping with each other and eventually they going to be gossiping

947
00:57:29.311 --> 00:57:32.880
about you. Hey, I wonder what he does, what's up with his exciting life?

948
00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:33.953
You know,

949
00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.590
and you're coming in looking like you're out there banging away and fucking

950
00:57:37.591 --> 00:57:40.410
having a great time going out in the town.

951
00:57:40.411 --> 00:57:43.200
Eventually one of these brides is going to be fucking interested enough and then

952
00:57:43.201 --> 00:57:43.681
you know what?

953
00:57:43.681 --> 00:57:46.950
Your dumb ass is going to fuck her and then it's going to be awkward again.

954
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:50.940
Can't do it to it. You gotta you gotta have a fucking your social sir.

955
00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:55.380
You're fucking, and you're drinking and all that has to be outside of work. Um,

956
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.710
unless it's a guy, okay, it cannot be,

957
00:57:58.711 --> 00:58:01.320
cannot fucking hang with women that you work with. You can't do it.

958
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:04.530
Cause eventually your Dick's going to make you say something stupid.

959
00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:05.550
Something's going to happen.

960
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:08.880
Well that's going to get in the fucking way and it's just going to be a big be a

961
00:58:08.881 --> 00:58:13.080
big God damn problem. Uh, same thing. Don't hang out with your boss either.

962
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:17.250
Hang out with somebody that's on your fucking level. Even then, dude,

963
00:58:17.251 --> 00:58:19.650
I wouldn't, I wouldn't hang out. You don't hang out with people you work with.

964
00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.440
You know, something always ends up happening.

965
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:25.920
Maybe it do something dumb and then your buddy can't keep his fucking mouth

966
00:58:25.921 --> 00:58:30.480
shut. You know, and then it gets to somebody and then that you're up for your,

967
00:58:30.481 --> 00:58:34.380
your, your review. You don't get as much money. You get passed over.

968
00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.990
It's fucking stupid. You're in your twenties. You're to make a,

969
00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:38.970
you're gonna make a bunch of fucking mistakes.

970
00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.820
So don't do it with the people you work with. Alright.

971
00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:45.960
Have I said that enough times? Alright, haven't said that.

972
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:47.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

973
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:51.250
<v 1>Um, you want my Superbowl pick? Um,</v>

974
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:53.860
I actually liked the Broncos with the points.

975
00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:58.780
If they get getting six and don't listen to me because I don't know anything

976
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:00.010
about the Broncos coach,

977
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:04.420
but I know bill Belichick with Peyton manning in that defense could figure out a

978
00:59:04.421 --> 00:59:08.500
way to uh, beat the Carolina Panthers.

979
00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.690
And I know a lot of you guys are thinking,

980
00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:14.440
well that defense and that coach and Peyton manning just beat you patriots and

981
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:17.860
bill Belicheck. It's like, well he didn't have the team, you know.

982
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.680
Um,

983
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.170
my only concern is that Denver's defense isn't as good as it looked against the

984
00:59:24.171 --> 00:59:28.220
patriots because a, we had that Swiss cheese fucking offensive line.

985
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:31.670
We had injuries all that year and Carolina, it looks really healthy.

986
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:34.650
Their offensive line looks really healthy. So, uh,

987
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:37.993
I dunno,

988
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:41.000
I think that bullshit that I actually said earlier where I was making fun of

989
00:59:41.001 --> 00:59:41.690
those analysis,

990
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:46.490
those analysts is actually what I think dead for better hope that when the toss,

991
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.630
and I would say take the ball rather than deferring it and hopefully you marched

992
00:59:50.631 --> 00:59:54.230
down the field score seven, give them a three and out.

993
00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:59.450
I think I literally think that they then need to score again. Go up 10. Nothing.

994
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.610
This is my keys to the game. Denver when the toss,

995
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.440
they need to go out there and somehow get it Todd and choose heads.

996
01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:14.060
If it's going to be heads, tails, if it's going to be tails, then they gotta

997
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.150
take the fucking ball, ram it down their fucking throats. Yeah.

998
01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:21.620
Just obvious shit.

999
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:26.510
Nice time consuming drive and uh,

1000
01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:29.800
stablish the run. Um,

1001
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.890
I think Peyton could do all right against the defense if they, if they, uh,

1002
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.370
you know, if he has the fucking time,

1003
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:41.930
see there's no way to say really bill, what if he doesn't have the time?

1004
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.960
Does that make it more difficult? This is really hard. This is really,

1005
01:00:44.961 --> 01:00:48.320
it's really hard to say something that isn't cliched. Um,

1006
01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:53.870
my, my concern is a Broncos fan is that PR the panthers get the ball,

1007
01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:57.620
they march right down the field and they score it because what's his face?

1008
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.950
Peyton manning is his gloom and doom guy.

1009
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.190
That guy gets that look on his face. Peyton faces what?

1010
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:07.340
Me and my family used to call it where he just see just purses,

1011
01:01:07.341 --> 01:01:10.280
his lips and he starts looking down field shaking his head as he takes his

1012
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:13.520
fucking Chin strap off after yet another three and out.

1013
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.790
That's the, that's the the headspace.

1014
01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:21.020
Panthers want to get him and he gets into the eye. He gets into that.

1015
01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:25.640
And why isn't everybody as good as me mindset. It's fucking over.

1016
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.900
So in order to keep him happy, I'd say that they got a score.

1017
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.110
I'm back to that again. That Jesus,

1018
01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:36.260
maybe I'll come up with something on Thursday. There you go. Everybody.

1019
01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:42.560
[inaudible] I'd take the Broncos in the points. I'd take six points. Fuck it.

1020
01:01:42.561 --> 01:01:44.690
Cause every contact is going to take the panthers.

1021
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:46.300
Every [inaudible] out there is going do to,

1022
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:47.990
parents are going to fucking destroy them.

1023
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:51.800
