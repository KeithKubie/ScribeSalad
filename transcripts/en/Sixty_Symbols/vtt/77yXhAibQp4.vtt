00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.520
MEGHAN: Today, we're going to talk about dark matter.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.120
PROF. COPELAND: Where is it?
Haha, it's dark. You can't see it.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.920
MEGHAN: We know there's a lot of it out there,

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:09.929
but it's quite mysterious.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.239
PROF. MERRIFIELD: Astronomers kind of rely on light in order to figure out what's going on in the universe,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.389
and things in the universe which inconveniently don't give out any light,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.880
causes some problems because it's very hard for us to actually infer very much about it apart from the fact that the material is there.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.880
MEGHAN: If I can introduce my prop here...

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.359
PROF. COPELAND: About 95% of the total energy density in the universe is made of stuff that we don't know.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.640
MEGHAN: Well, it's dark obviously. It's appropriate. It's chocolate and it smells really good. If you imagine that this pie represents

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.490
the entire matter and energy budget in the universe, and so the biggest slice of this pie

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.239
is something mysterious - something really mysterious, called Dark Energy.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.690
Nearly three-quarters of our pie

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.070
so that...

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.189
Let's say, about that much.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:07.529
So all of this bit here is this mysterious stuff called dark energy, but we don't nearly have time to talk about that today

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.599
So I'm going to leave this whole piece of the pie for the moment, okay? We'll just stick it over here

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.620
So what's left is the stuff that has mass. This is all the matter in the universe.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.680
Now I'm going to divide this again. So this little slice of the pie here, which is supposed to represent about 4% of the total,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.040
this is all of the normal matter in the universe.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.800
This is all of the periodic table, so it's all chemistry, all of biology...

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.640
It's everything that we can see,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.660
it's all of the stuff that we're made of, that the earth is made of, it's all of the stars

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.100
and galaxies and the gas and dust out there in the universe.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.140
Most of it is actually hydrogen, so an even tinier sliver is the stuff

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.580
that makes, you know, our universe interesting. And what's left,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.320
about... just about 23% or so of the universe

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.140
is this dark matter - this mysterious stuff.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.820
We call it dark because it neither emits nor absorbs electromagnetic radiation

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.180
so it doesn't shine and neither does it cast a shadow.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.240
There's almost certainly dark matter streaming through this room right now, but we have no way of knowing that it's there

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.200
And we call it matter because it has mass.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.100
And that's very important because although it doesn't interact through the rest of the normal forces

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.300
it does interact with itself, and with normal matter and light, through gravity

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.340
because it has mass. And that's the only way that we can figure out that it's out there in such large quantities.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.880
*nom*

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.140
Haha, a little less of it now.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.480
PROF. MERRIFIELD: And so we can tell it's there because we can see its gravitational influence on things

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.120
we can actually see that the this dark matter was actually, you know,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.580
gravitating and pulling other stuff towards it.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.140
MEGHAN: And the first observation of that kind was made by an astronomer named Fritz Zwicky

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.180
back in the 30s.
PROF. COPELAND: ...who was looking at the rotation of galaxies.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.820
You know, they go around, and he was looking at the speed of the rotation

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.260
as you move away from the center of the galaxy, so he'd pick some object that was emitting light

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.680
and he'd look at how rapidly it was going around.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.340
MEGHAN: Think about the solar system for a moment.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.480
In our solar system, most of the mass is right in the middle - it's made up of the sun.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.840
So the planets close to the sun, they feel a strong force of gravity.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.500
So Mercury for example is zipping around the sun

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.500
while Neptune, further away, not feeling such a strong force of gravity, is just sort of pootling along very slowly.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.220
You'd expect something of the same to be happening in galaxies, because if you look at a galaxy - if you look at a spiral galaxy,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.200
it looks like it's got this big concentration of stars in the middle and this disk that extends out even further.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.860
PROF. COPELAND: So you expect the speed to sort of rise up to a maximum and then drop off again.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.080
That's what Newton would have told you, given what you could see. And what he noticed was that this...

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.840
this speed went up to a maximum, and then stayed there.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.820
MEGHAN: They were going just as fast on the outside as they were in the inside.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.140
And what this meant was, again: What you see is not what you get.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.200
It's not the whole story, there must be some other component.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.840
Part of this galaxy, providing enough mass to keep these stars moving.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.560
As an astronomer, I don't know what the dark matter is.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.700
But what I can tell you is how much of it is out there, and what kind of structures it forms.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.120
And so, again it goes back to this key idea that, whatever these particles are,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.220
they interact gravitationally.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.260
BRADY: A bit of a misnomer calling it Dark Matter though, it seems like it's almost transparent.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.020
PROF. COPELAND: Yeah, I hadn't thought about that until I said the word transparent today.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.280
It's dark only in that light doesn't seem to interact with it.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.760
And so we're inferring that there's something there that we can't see.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:14.140
The way you actually do perceive it is, light will go past it and as it goes past it, or through it,

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.720
it will get bent.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.740
MEGHAN: In a sense, imagine yourself looking through a window.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.380
On a normal day, you just see right through the window

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.259
you don't even notice it's there.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.040
On a rainy day, there might be raindrops on the window, and that kind of distorts your view,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.700
and that's exactly what dark matter is doing. It's distorting our view of the distant universe.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.740
Using data from the Hubble space telescope,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.360
the distortions in this case are so small you can't actually see them,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.000
but by adding up the shapes that we observe of tens of thousands of tiny little galaxies

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.340
we can measure this and reconstruct.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.600
And what my colleague Catherine Heymans has done to make this beautiful map

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.300
is to use those distortions to figure out how much dark matter is in this particular part of the universe, and where it is,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.500
and we've color-coded it pink here. So you can see these big pink blobs of dark matter

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.960
making up what is actually a super cluster of galaxies

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.200
And what's interesting is, if we look closely - and we've overlaid the actual pictures of galaxies here themselves,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.180
you see the galaxies are embedded in these blobs of dark matter.

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:30.378
Dark Matter is of course invisible, so for the purposes of this picture, we've chosen just to color it pink

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.848
so you can see it. 
BRADY: Why can't we find this stuff? If it's everywhere; if it's in this room;

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.829
if it makes up such a big piece of the pie, why can't we find it?

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.870
MEGHAN: Well people are looking for it, and this is again a very interesting connection

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.880
where people like myself who study the universe on very very large scales

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.840
interact with people who are studying it on the small scales: The particle physicists.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.920
PROF. MERRIFIELD: As with most things in astronomy, as soon as you come up with some observation

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.960
there's a whole bunch of theoretical astrophysicists who say "I have an explanation for that!"

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.580
And so there are a whole bunch of possible explanations out there for dark matter.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.740
The particle physicists for example would very much like it to be some form of exotic particle, so one of these

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.740
sort of supersymmetric particles that comes out of their theories.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:18.500
MEGHAN: And so there are actual experiments that are trying to basically catch the dark matter particle

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.480
in action, as it flies by.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.580
They're really, really, really difficult. Because as I said, the best candidate that we...

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.460
that the particle theory people have for dark matter, is something called a weakly interacting massive particle.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.020
So it's not a normal type of atom. A good candidate for the dark matter particle would be the lightest

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.640
supersymmetric particle, the Neutralino. So this is something that's been thought of in theory

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.040
but hasn't been observed. And so these dark matter experiments, they usually take place deep underground

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.489
because they have to be shielded from all sorts of radiation, from neutrons, that sort of thing.

00:07:55.489 --> 00:08:00.720
BRADY: What would happen if I drove my car into a big concentrated clump of dark matter?

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.540
PROF: COPELAND: Into a big concentrated clump of dark matter...

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.980
That would be... you'd...

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.440
That's a good question, that I've not thought of the answer to.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.060
PROF: MERRIFIELD: There are a whole bunch of experiments around the world,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.460
trying to detect this. For example if it is these weakly interacting massive particles, then they're everywhere.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.460
They're very small, each one, but there's millions and millions of them, and they're, you know, they're passing through this room at this moment.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.940
And they're very hard to detect because they don't really interact very much with normal matter,

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.880
but once in a while they do, and so there's a whole bunch of experiments

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.920
sort of scattered around the world, trying to detect these things and when one of them...

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.800
IF and when one of them gets a detection,

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:38.299
then we'll have an answer tomorrow as to as to what the dark matter is - or at least we'll have detected it.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:44.209
BRADY: Does it frustrate you, as someone who dreams of dark matter being discovered, to know that it's here in this room?

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:49.699
PROF. COPELAND: Yeah, it's amazing 'cause it is everywhere, and then... it's just so elusive.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.740
It won't interact it all - barely, it just passes straight through you.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:00.720
And indeed, in order to try and find it, you have to go to areas where you increase the chance

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.260
of it interacting with something, and so that typically is to go deep underground

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:11.540
so that you can hide it from all the other type of signals,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.380
from particles that might mimic dark matter.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:21.040
MEGHAN: Because we think that dark matter makes up such a huge piece of the pie in our universe

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:28.680
it means that we can actually run very very high... very very large computer simulations

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.260
to predict what a dark matter universe would be.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.140
You have to figure out what the force of gravity is between that particle and every other particle

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.180
and how that's going to make it move. And then you do it again and again and again

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.560
So yeah, It does take a large amount of computing power.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.640
So this is... this is a simulation of our universe.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.700
So what you're seeing is a slice - a chunk of the universe at very early times,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.140
when the distribution of matter was very very smooth.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.460
And let's fast-forward through the history of universe and see what happens.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:09.040
We have what's called a hierarchical universe being built up. Small bits of dark matter merged together to form larger halos.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.720
That means the force of gravity is greater there and that acts as a well. And this...

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.800
Dark matter tends to drain down along these filamentary structures and collect in these

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.940
increasingly larger and larger halos. You can see we've got this beautiful, detailed picture

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.840
of a universe that's invisible to us.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.300
BRADY: What will happen to the man or woman who discovers dark matter?

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.600
PROF. COPELAND: They'll be going to Stockholm, I think, probably.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.740
MEGHAN: We're coming across the road from the astronomy building, to the Cripps Computing Centre.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.969
So what we're going to see is a supercomputer.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.960
And basically some of my colleagues across the road use this computer

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.140
to simulate whole universes full of Dark Matter.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.320
I'll have to put earplugs in for health and safety reasons, because we're told that this is going to be very very loud

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.880
[very very loud ventilation system noises]

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:09.780
So it's really loud in here and it's really cold, because they have to keep pumping cold air through.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.100
And I've just learned that if the air conditioning fails, it would get so hot so quickly, with all these machines running

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.000
that things would start to basically break down within an hour.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:28.700
I should say that this facility isn't just used for astronomy. It's also used across the University by other disciplines

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.900
to do simulations on protein folding in cells

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.240
and all sorts of other applications that require a large amount of computing power.
