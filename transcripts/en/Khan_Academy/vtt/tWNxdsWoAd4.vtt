00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.974
- [Instructor] We're
told that f of x is equal

00:00:01.974 --> 00:00:04.527
to one over the square root of x plus one,

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:06.399
and what we want to figure out is what is

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.451
the second degree
Maclaurin polynomial of f?

00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:12.421
And like always, pause this video

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:14.629
and see if you could have a go at it.

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.516
so let's remind ourselves what
a Maclaurin polynomial is,

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:20.370
a Maclaurin polynomial is
just a Taylor polynomial

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.876
centered at zero, so the
form of this second degree

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:27.684
Maclaurin polynomial,
and we just have to find

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:30.584
this Maclaurin expansion
until our second degree term,

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:32.615
it's going to look like this.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.652
So p of x, I'm using p for polynomial,

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:38.152
it's going to be our f of zero

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:42.911
plus, and we could do
that as f of zero times x

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:45.478
to the zero power, well,
that's just f of zero.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.228
F of zero plus f prime of zero x,

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.632
plus f prime prime of zero,

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:57.160
divided by, we could think of it

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.179
as two factorial, but
it's really just two,

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.178
we could think of this as
dividing by one factorial,

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:03.305
which is just one, this
dividing by zero factorial,

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:06.214
well that's just one again,
so we have f prime prime

00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:08.092
of zero, the second derivative evaluated

00:01:08.092 --> 00:01:10.945
zero divided by two, x squared.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.154
Now if we wanted a higher
degree we could keep on going,

00:01:13.154 --> 00:01:15.144
but remember, they're just
asking us for the second degree.

00:01:15.144 --> 00:01:16.745
So this is the form that we're gonna need,

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:18.558
we're gonna have these three terms.

00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:21.972
So let's see if we can evaluate

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:25.572
the function and its derivatives at zero.

00:01:25.572 --> 00:01:29.239
So f of zero, f of zero
is equal to one over

00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.185
the square root of zero plus one,

00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:35.587
well that's one over
the square root of one,

00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:37.732
the principle root of one,
which is positive one,

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:39.744
so that's just going to be equal to one.

00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:42.015
So that right over there is equal to one.

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:44.682
Now let's evaluate f prime of x,

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:48.677
and then I'll evaluate f prime of zero.

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:50.774
F prime of x is equal to,

00:01:50.774 --> 00:01:52.796
well, one over the square
root of x plus one,

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:55.948
this is the same thing as x plus one,

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:57.894
let me write it this way,

00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:00.781
this is the same thing as,

00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.244
actually let me write it down this way.

00:02:03.244 --> 00:02:06.961
Another way of writing f of
x is this is the same thing

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.461
as x plus one to the negative one half.

00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:15.267
And so if I'm thinking
the first derivative of f,

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.452
well, I could use the chain rule here,

00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:20.035
the derivative of x plus
one with respect to x,

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:21.936
well, that's just going to be one,

00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:23.789
and then I'll take the
derivative of this whole thing

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.518
with respect to x plus
one and I'll just use

00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:28.630
the power rule there, this is
gonna be negative one half,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.517
times x plus one, to the,

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.845
and I decrement the exponent,
negative three halves.

00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:38.513
And so the first derivative
evaluated of zero

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:41.692
is just negative one half, times,

00:02:41.692 --> 00:02:44.144
if this is zero, zero
plus one is just one,

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:46.579
one to the negative three halves,

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.577
one to the negative three half power,

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:51.375
well, that's just going to be one.

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:53.186
So this whole thing, f prime of zero

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:55.100
is just negative one half.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.916
So that is this right over
here is negative one half.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:03.266
And now let's figure out
the second derivative.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:07.099
All right, let me do
this in this green color.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:12.561
So the second derivative
with respect to x,

00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:14.129
well I did the same thing again,

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.736
the derivative of x plus
one with respect to x,

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:17.284
that's just one, so I just have to take

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:18.661
the derivative of the whole thing

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:20.137
with respect to x plus one.

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:22.246
So I take my exponent, bring it out front,

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:24.594
negative three halves times one half,

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:26.909
times negative one half, is going to be

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.595
positive three fourths times x plus one,

00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:33.877
and then I decrement the
exponent here by one,

00:03:33.877 --> 00:03:37.671
or by two halves, so that's
gonna be negative five halves,

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.314
and so the second derivative
evaluated at zero,

00:03:41.314 --> 00:03:43.936
well if this is equal to
zero you're gonna have

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:46.301
one to the negative five
halves which is just one,

00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.174
times three fourths, is
gonna be three fourths.

00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:53.033
So this part right over
here is three fourths.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:56.370
And so you're gonna have
three fourths divided by two,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.068
three fourths divided
by two is three eighths.

00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:02.758
So our Taylor, I should say,
our Maclaurin polynomial,

00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:05.163
our second degree Maclaurin polynomial,

00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:07.978
p of x is going to be equal to,

00:04:07.978 --> 00:04:09.846
and I'll do it in the same colors,

00:04:09.846 --> 00:04:11.887
going to be equal to one,

00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:15.832
plus, maybe I'll just
write it as minus one half,

00:04:15.832 --> 00:04:17.249
minus one half x,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.917
plus three eighths x squared,

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.957
plus three eighths x squared,

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:31.000
and we are done, there you have it.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.287
We have our second degree
Maclaurin polynomial of f,

00:04:34.287 --> 00:04:36.583
which could be used to
provide an approximation

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:40.750
for our function, especially
if our x is near zero.
