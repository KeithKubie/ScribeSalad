Heathrow: Good afternoon, my name is Heathrow,
and I'm a volunteer with the local Authors@Google

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.850
team.
We have a speaker we have today called Travis

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.840
Millard, and he's done a lot of different
stuff under the rubric of "Fudge Factory Comics."

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.590
Relatively recently a book which you have
called "Hey Fudge," published by a local publisher

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.590
Narrow Books based in LA.
Travis is based in Echo Park, and he has done

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.660
a lot of different media work. He has done
mini-comics and zines. He's done fine art;

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.090
he is represented by the Richard Heller Gallery
right here in Santa Monica. He's done illustrations

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.530
for Chronicle Books, like "How to Speak Zombie,"
which just came out yesterday, and another

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.370
book called "Farts," which I just wanted to
say so I could say the title.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.500
[laughter]

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.960
And we're here today, it's an interesting
mix of stuff, when you have a chance, and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.129
he'll talk about his work and show a lot of
samples, a lot of raw and rough stuff, but

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.340
also really polished stuff, and so he is going
to talk about his work; he's going to talk

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.269
about his work across the different media
and forums.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.529
I hope you like it. Travis.

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:07.729
[audience clapping]

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.729
Travis Millard: Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot.
Thanks for having me here. I appreciate the

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.079
chance to come speak here.
I looked your website up last night, and you

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.109
seem pretty successful. So it's an honor.
[laughter]

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.249
So, I guess I'm going to start out by assuming
that you don't know what I do. So I'm going

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:34.439
to show you a few of these drawings and talk
a little about my process.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.119
Primarily, I kind of tend to work with just
the basics. I like pen and ink. Or I like

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:48.950
an inkwell and brush. And keep it really simple.
I also tend to work kind of small. I've worked

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.630
large before. I've worked really large, or
painted on a variety of different things,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.399
but I tend to, I think it comes back to my
workspace. I don't have a whole lot of room

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:08.460
in my house, so I can't afford the space to
work large and store it really, because it

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:17.629
takes up a lot of room. So I just have drawers
and boxes of tons of little drawings. I also,

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm just kind of into the process of exploring
with just a pen and paper. And just being

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.760
able to, like, see what I can pull out of
that.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.819
I'm way into sketchbooks. I kind of don't
work in sketchbooks quite as much as I used

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.819
to. I eventually got to a point where I wanted
to just start tearing the things out of there.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.810
But the sketchbook was sort of too scared
for me to rip it out, so I decided to just

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.239
abandon the sketchbook and sort of just draw.
But I like the sketchbook because it allows

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.719
you to just generate ideas. There is a lot
of exploring.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:05.390
And I think that's probably the biggest theme
that my work involves, is just exploring,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.939
and experimenting and trial and error, and
not realizing what failure is until you see

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:24.859
it later in print, and trying it different
the next time around. Um, I also like humor,

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.860
I like jokes and I like, um, sort of like
the rawness, I tend to do drawings of people

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.470
fighting a lot and people ask me why I do
drawings of people fighting, and it's not

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.260
because I'm really agro or anything, but I've
seen a few fights and I think that they're

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.079
sort of funny in the way that nobody seems
to win or lose, they're just tugging at each

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.450
other and hurting each other both, but nobody
really walks away a winner.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.430
And, um, I also like to work with mirrors
a lot. I think mirrors, there's something

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.249
really special that happens in the mirror.
I think it was also, somewhere a long time

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:08.689
ago, somebody told me that if you looked into
the mirror at night, then something weird

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:14.430
would happen. So that kind of like, that myth
stayed with me.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.079
I'm also into just really, like list making.
I, like um, the things that you kind of, that

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:29.941
are out there, that you maybe don't see right
offhand and you know just, there's a book

00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:33.410
called "Zoom," where, you know, you zoom in
really close and then you zoom out really

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.770
far. And so sort of the idea of that, and
um, tigress chugging beer, that's an element

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:52.360
that happens too. Anyway, I'll just go back
to some background. I grew up in Kansas City

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.490
and my mom was a self-taught artist. She did
a lot of painting when she was pregnant with

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.540
me and my brother. And, um, so she didn't
really paint otherwise, she would mostly was

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:12.610
just, ah, kind of do it for fun or relaxation,
and so their basement is just littered with

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.169
these old paintings that she did and they
are really sweet. But this was around me all

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.540
the time and she really encouraged me and
my brother to draw a lot. And so, ah, these

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:33.210
are some drawings from a sketchbook that I
found from maybe '85, maybe 1985. And I was

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.620
drawing influences from pretty similar things
to what I am today, I you know, into skateboarding,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.840
graphics and horror movies. And ah, this is
a girl I had a crush on and it's drawn from

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.510
her school picture. I was also into, like,
slapstick comedies with, you know, anything

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.800
with cussing or cheap nudity or something
like that that I could get away with outside

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.340
of my parents house at a slumber party or
something, you know. You can kind of see the

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:09.150
little Led Zeppelin logo back there. I was
into comics and, you know, rock 'n' roll and

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.051
rap and heavy metal and punk rock, and sort
of what I cut my teeth on. That should have

00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:20.190
come out actually but, I left the comfort
of my parents home when I went to, decided

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:27.091
to study art in KU. And so, um, I included
this slide because it's my first art show

00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:36.460
in maybe my freshman year at college. I studied
illustration in printmaking and ah, I also,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:43.290
well one of the professors there, she was
in book arts and she showed a few students

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.479
on, these little tips on how to make these
handmade books and I also discovered the zine

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:54.099
rack at the local record store and was like
"ah, that's how you do that" and so I decided

00:06:54.099 --> 00:07:02.280
to try and make my own. This is probably from
maybe '96 or so. And, I just made a handful

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.560
of these and passed them around to some friends
of mine and it got some laughs and so it kind

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.280
of encouraged me to try another one and, ah,
so I did another one and tried another one

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.129
after that, and you know, mostly it was just
to entertain myself and my friends. And it

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.800
seemed to, you know, it was like a life for
a lot of the drawings I was doing in my sketchbook

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:30.520
to, you know, I dunno, just kind of spread
it around a little further. And, I was also

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.840
really interested in just trying to get published.
I wanted to, you know, see if I could get

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.740
paid to do an illustration job, I thought
that was kind of the wildest thing I could

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:47.050
think of possibly doing. So I, well I didn't
know what the hell I was doing at all so I,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.939
I put together, I knew that you had to have
a portfolio when I got out of school and I

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:56.030
saw all these people had these black portfolio
cases, so I thought I don't want to do that.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:01.840
And I also didn't have, I mean I didn't send
an email until I was like out of college almost,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:09.319
and just had no clue about any kind of savvyness
of getting my stuff around. So I built this

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:17.919
clunky box. I built two clunky boxes. And
I had my stuff shot on, you know, 4x5 transparencies

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:24.590
and the box unfolds and you know there's this
little light box in there. And ah, so I didn't

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.500
know what to do so I literally got the Kansas
City yellow pages and I looked up "advertising"

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:35.600
and "design agencies" and just cold- called
and, ah, said, "Hi, could you see a portfolio?"

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.020
and I'd just go show up at their door and
show up with this weird box and nobody knew

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.500
what to do with me at all. This is, um, I'm
taking some shots you know, just holding this

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.170
up to the sunlight but this will give you
an example of some of the things that were

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:55.100
in there, and they didn't know what to do
with me. But there was one, one company, one

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:02.520
ad agency that said, "Hey let's, can you be
a designer at our company? Do you know Illustrator

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.920
and Photoshop?" And I was like "Yeah, Yeah,
no problem." And didn't know that stuff at

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:13.950
all, so I, after about 3 months they politely
fired me. And, ah, so I moved back to, I was

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:19.640
living in Lawrence, Kansas, and ah, I was
also sending those zines out a lot and sending

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.880
'em to, I would go to like bookstores and
look in the magazine rack and you know find

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.440
a magazine that I liked or there was a record
that I really liked and I would just look

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.450
up the address and copy it down and find the,
you know, find the person to send it to.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:39.650
And so I floated one to, there was a magazine
called "Bunny Hop," that started out as a,

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.480
it started out as a zine and it started to
kind of get a little more steam, and they

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.720
eventually started printing it as a magazine
and I got a call from this guy called Noel

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:55.420
Tolentino, cold- called, and I also like,
my business cards and stuff I had my parents

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.310
phone number on there so it just didn't, you
know, I was really low-tech. And so I just

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.570
got a call from this guy and he said, "Hey,
I got your thing, you know, can you do a comic

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.441
for a magazine?" and I was, like, "Hell yeah!
Definitely." And I was, like, I had no idea

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:11.780
how to do a comic for a magazine, I don't
know how to, but I figured it out, you know

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:19.600
so, just as far as printing it and, you know,
all those issues with Photoshop and, you know,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:28.330
how to scan things right. So I got that done
and I sent it to him and then, around this

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:35.210
time, this is like '90, 1999, some friends
of mine were in the Get Up Kids and they were

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:41.890
some guys that I grew up with in Olathe, Kansas,
and they asked me to do their record cover.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:48.950
They asked me to do a 7 inch at first and
then they invited me out to this bar and said,

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.820
"Hey, about that 7 inch, can you do our full
length?" And I was like, "Yeah sure!" and

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:58.690
they were like, "Hey cool! It's due in a week!"
So I hammered this out like really fast and

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:03.370
I was literally blowing it dry on the way
to FedEx and I didn't know how to scan something

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:10.790
this big so I FedExed this big painting to
Vagrant in Santa Monica and then three weeks

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:17.310
later it was released worldwide. And also
around that time my friend, Brock, who was

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:24.020
a friend that I grew up with and he helped
me, he said, "You need a website." He said,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:31.560
you know, "Just come up with a name," and
I'd done a few different comics around that

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.240
time, just weird little panels, you know,
zine comics and stuff. And so he said, "Just

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.740
come up with a name." And I figured, well,
Fudge Factory, I guess, and I looked into

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:45.670
"Fudge Factory" and it was all porn sites
and candy stores. And then I just put "Comics"

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.911
on the end of it and it was free, so I thought,
yeah, all right, you know it fits in there

00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:56.980
somewhere. But, so I had an email on there
and I started getting emails from kids in

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:02.900
other countries, and I was getting emails
from different magazines or people, you know,

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.160
just meeting people through doing that and
they said, "Hey, I know a friend over at this

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.590
magazine, you should call them up." And so
these are some earlier illustrations I did

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.590
for "Mean Magazine" and Camille Rose Garcia
who's a really successful artist and a friend

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:21.770
of mine was the art director of the magazine
at this time, and, ah, it was really cool

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:28.620
to work with her and just talk to her about
these kind of things. And, ah, I, this is

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.680
a cover of "Slap" magazine. Skateboarding
has been an influence in my life since I was

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.730
a young kid. So it was a real honor to be
able to do this and this was only the second

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:50.040
time that they had an art cover that wasn't
a photograph of a skateboarder. Anyway, little

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.940
bits and things were kind of happening and
I had, you know, I was working two part-time

00:12:53.940 --> 00:13:00.210
jobs and, but, you know, I started to kind
of get a little money trickling in from different

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.790
illustration work so, I got a random email
from the editor from "Spin" magazine and she'd

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:11.790
seen the "Bunny Hop" spread and said, asked
if I'd like to do a comic on their last page.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:18.490
So I did one, and it went well, and she asked
me to do another one, and then that went well,

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.370
and she asked me to do another one, and that
eventually it started to develop into, you

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:26.730
know, I was never like a solid thing but I
would kind of have, you know, maybe a couple

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.300
of weeks of silence, and not know what I was
doing, and then I'd get another email and

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:35.450
say, "Hey, you wanna do another one?"
And this was, it paid enough money, it paid

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:41.890
more money than I'd seen in Kansas for a while,
so I, and a friend of mine expressed some

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.970
interest in moving to New York and I just
figured like, what the hell, let's do it.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:56.520
And so I packed up and moved and moved to
South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and just continued

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:03.570
doing these comics for "Spin." And that kind
of continued on for a little while and I did

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:11.920
a few writing things for them, but I worked
out to get my website on the bottom there,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:18.920
which they don't normally do, but I was sort
of persuasive enough to slide it in there

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.190
and that started to get a lot more activity
and, you know, so that was a cool thing that

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:30.070
it brought in other things.
But I lived in this piece of shit apartment

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:36.300
and the kitchen was just roach-infested and
I, ah, I couldn't really eat there, or cook

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:44.650
there so I started going over to this cafe,
this little cafe like on the corner, and drawing

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:51.120
at the counter. And this guy Andreas, who
was the cook, he was like, "I want you to

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.201
draw my menus" and I was like "I'll trade
you for lunch," and he was, like, "Alright,

00:14:55.201 --> 00:15:01.220
deal." So I did his menus and he didn't charge
me for like six months. Like just kept breakfast,

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.710
lunch and dinner. And I eventually got to
the point where I had to put a halt to it

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:09.530
and pay the guy. He's a really sweet guy and
he was like my best friend actually, a 55-year-old

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:15.770
Mexican dude. But I was also doing a lot of
stuff for the "New York Press." That was kind

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:23.390
of a regular client at the time, and various
other things. But then I'd been there for

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:30.630
maybe six months when 9/11 happened. Everything
stopped. I mean literally like, there was,

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:37.600
obviously there was no work at all and I didn't
know what would happen after that. And so

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:44.790
everything was uncertain and it forced me
to just kind of spend more time at the desk,

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:51.870
and I started, you know, I wasn't like looking
for work and, you know, job-wise, and I just

00:15:51.870 --> 00:16:00.200
focused on drawing more, and I dunno, just
exploring what I actually do when I'm just

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.830
sitting around my house with no work coming
in. So these are some shots of my work space

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:13.960
around that time. And I was also walking around
the city a lot and riding the subway and just

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:20.640
looking around a lot, and you know graffiti
is something that, there's obviously a culture

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.240
of graffiti all over the country, but New
York, there's a whole different energy about

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:32.190
it, so I was really inspired by just walking
around and just participating along with that

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:37.720
and just drawing no big, you know I didn't
really work with spray paint or anything,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:45.001
I was more into just like pens and drawing
on subway posters and pasting up. I was in,

00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:50.640
you know, I liked to paste things up every
once in a while. Max Fish was a bar that I

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.990
hung around at a lot and there are a lot of
artists and graffiti writers and skateboarders

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:08.019
and just, and there's a really good energy
and it has a rich tradition of art and drunks.

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:12.569
So their bathrooms were something that I would
just go in there and paste something up in

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:17.030
the bathroom, and then eventually I kind of
got to be friends with the owners and they

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.900
would let me in, in the daytime and I would
just like put just bigger things up and then

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:29.779
at night they would just get crushed you know
with all the writers and stuff. But they offered

00:17:29.779 --> 00:17:34.639
me, they eventually, you know, I did maybe
three or four installations in there and just

00:17:34.639 --> 00:17:39.580
pasting up around, and they offered me a show.
Because they do great shows there. And they

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.610
offered me a solo show, or I could do a split
show or I could curate it and so I kind of

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:49.019
wondered, well, who would I want to do a show
with? And one of the art directors at "Spin"

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:54.100
was a mutual friend of Shepard Fairey and
she said that he liked my thing. So I just

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.139
dropped him an email and asked if he would
be interested in showing and he accepted and

00:17:58.139 --> 00:18:03.360
we did this show together. He designed this
card, and it was a great show. He was a really

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.470
good guy and it sort of put me on the map
a little bit I think as far as shows went

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:15.309
after that, because I started to exhibit a
lot more and I just wasn't used to like having

00:18:15.309 --> 00:18:20.302
people show up at an art show, you know? So
that was a big thing. I was like "Wow, there's

00:18:20.302 --> 00:18:28.150
people in the room, this is pretty good" But
I started really just focusing on just making

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:34.110
art and putting things into shows. I was really
excited to just have things on the wall and

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:41.299
be an artist in New York. But at the same
time I just completely neglected any kind

00:18:41.299 --> 00:18:48.830
of work that I was getting, that I had coming
in. So I was getting pretty assed out and

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:56.759
I knew that I needed to make a change. 'Cuz
my rent was just bleeding me and work wasn't

00:18:56.759 --> 00:19:01.070
really happening all that much and so I just
felt like I needed to make a jump. And I got

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:09.529
a call from my friend in LA and he said he
lived in these two big houses on a 2-acre

00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:13.779
hillside in East LA and he said the rent is
super cheap and "You should come out here,

00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:22.430
it'll be really fun. There's 11 roommates."
And I went, "All right!" But anyway, but while

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:28.990
everything was kind of like, I mean my account
was draining and everything, but then I would

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.720
go, my friend Rich worked at this record store
Sound and Fury. I went in there and he was

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.741
like "Hey, did you see this magazine, this
Japanese magazine cover?" and I'm like, "No,

00:19:36.741 --> 00:19:41.541
I didn't, that's pretty cool." And Nat Owens,
another friend of mine, owns this gallery,

00:19:41.541 --> 00:19:47.450
he got this, he's like "Hey, I got this Taschen's
'1000 Favorite Websites' book and that crappy

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:52.870
website you had up has somehow made it into
the pages of that." So I was like, "Hey, thanks

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:59.429
for the note Taschen!" [laughter from audience]
But anyway, so I knew something was going

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:10.150
alright. So I bought a minivan from a soccer
mom in Kansas and I pasted a couple of skulls

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:17.090
on it and painted it black and drove it to
LA, where it died as soon as I pulled into

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:23.720
this compound. And these are the houses that
I moved into. And there was 11 roommates and

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.009
sometimes there were as many as 14 people
living there, you know, there was a guy in

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:32.460
a tent on the hill. But there were a lot of
people from Savannah College of Art and Design

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.559
who had moved out and they were involved in
film and photography. I was kind of the only

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:46.110
visual painter, or, yeah you know visual painter.
But it was a good group of people. And, you

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:51.981
know, there's a pool back there. It was just
a whole new weird thing. I didn't do a lot

00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:55.650
of swimming because there were some suicides
in the pool. [laughter]

00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:03.059
But I had this outdoor studio that I was working
with and was totally foreign to me. I mean

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:09.789
I grew up in Kansas and winters in New York
and stuff and so palm trees are, you know,

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:16.029
still kind of foreign to me. But I had this
outdoor studio that I worked in and I was

00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:20.970
pretty broke. But my friend took me to this
bar called Little Joy the first night that,

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.490
or first week that I was in town. And I met
this guy called Joe who was the manager there

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:32.629
and he was also from Kansas and he's a good
guy and he mentioned that he needed somebody

00:21:32.629 --> 00:21:38.149
to wash glasses and I was, like, "I'll wash
glasses right now." And so he gave me a job

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:46.149
there, and I pretty quickly got promoted to
bartender. I'd never bartended, I faked my

00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:50.260
way to that, too, so people would come up
and say, "Hey, can I get a Kamikaze?" and

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:56.250
I'd say I can give you a rum and Coke, or
I can give you a beer or a shot.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:02.721
And anyway after hours I would just go in
and just paste my stuff around the bathrooms

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:09.129
and eventually just kind of started covering
the hallways and the bathrooms of this bar.

00:22:09.129 --> 00:22:16.010
And that kind of like got me, it just got
me planted socially. I started making some

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:20.659
friends around the bar, it was kind of a place
that I could go. You know, it was just sort

00:22:20.659 --> 00:22:24.419
of a home, it felt like, you know there was
also a bar in Kansas called the Eighth Street

00:22:24.419 --> 00:22:29.080
Taproom that I started out by pasting stuff
on in their bathrooms and then I went to New

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.330
York and started pasting stuff up in the Max
Fish bathrooms and then I got to LA and then

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:37.309
I sort of felt like Little Joy was like, all
right, this is where I'm going to paste my

00:22:37.309 --> 00:22:45.629
stuff up. But at the time, also at that time
I was really exploding in my sketchbooks;

00:22:45.629 --> 00:22:53.870
I was drawing all the time and just, it felt
like I was drawing in a different way. I sort

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:58.490
of feel like I can look back at sketchbooks,
I have them since I was in second grade, you

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:04.509
know, all the way up until last week. And
I can say that even like a year ago it seems

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:09.789
like I don't even draw the same, you know,
and it seems that I'll figure something out

00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:15.990
along the way with each drawing and kind of
get a little better and I'm just pretty hypercritical

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:23.660
of my own stuff. So I feel like I'm always
sort of running from doing something kind

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.830
of the same way I did it before. Around this
time I also kind of discovered this gray-wash

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:39.340
technique that I've since kind of really held
onto. And so these are some images from the

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:46.980
sketchbooks around this time. I also started
to, I was doing, you know, little mini comics

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:54.629
and you know, just little bursts of humor
and things like that. And I kind of wanted

00:23:54.629 --> 00:24:01.000
to, I really wanted to try to do a longer
form story. And so around this time the allegations

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.980
of Michael Jackson, you know, doing what he
did kind of came out and there were rumors

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:12.499
of it going to trial. And I was just talking
to a friend of mine and we were talking about

00:24:12.499 --> 00:24:17.980
celebrity justice and sort of like, what do
you do? So a celebrity can commit a crime

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.499
and kind of get off, or whatever, so I went,
"So what do you do when the most famous person

00:24:23.499 --> 00:24:27.279
in the world commits like maybe the most heinous
crime in the world?" and then I said, "Michael

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:33.080
Jackson in exile," and he was, like, "Ha Ha!"
So I just did a drawing, this first drawing

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:39.269
of him sitting there at the table and I showed
that to him and he was, like, "Do another!"

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:45.279
So I started trying to, like, I had no idea
what was going on, or what I was aiming for.

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:49.230
But I just tried to like, what's gonna come
next, what's gonna come next? So the whole

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:59.320
thing was written just visually and completely
with no plan.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.980
Around this time I met Christopher Lepkowski,
the publisher of Narrow Books, while I was

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:09.850
a bartender at Little Joy and we got to be
friends talking about zines and publishing

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:15.919
and things like that. And so these are some
examples of zines that I have done over the

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:20.559
years. And I started talking to Christopher
about how to get this thing published. Like,

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:24.779
what do the publishers want? Like how do they...?
You know, I'm used to doing this myself but

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:33.460
I don't really know what it means to get a
book really published in a professional forum.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:39.039
And so he was doing, they had released one
book called "Two Letters," and they were going

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:43.610
to the, they went up to the Alternative Press
Expo in San Francisco and he offered to take

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:49.309
my zines up and put them on their table. And
you know, we just continued to talk and I

00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:56.259
think he took even a little, a rough outline,
or rough examples of the book I'd been working

00:25:56.259 --> 00:26:05.270
on at the time, maybe to show it to somebody
or what. And so, then, I was also doing a

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:12.119
lot of art shows, this is a solo show that
I did in Silverlake at the Jeff Electric Gallery

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:18.820
and I put like all my time and effort, I'd
probably spent 10 solid days installing the

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:24.279
show, just painting the walls out, putting
you know, the best work that I had in there,

00:26:24.279 --> 00:26:29.240
hanging these daggers, hanging like a hundred
daggers from the ceiling. The opening was

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.260
really great and I didn't sell anything at
all and I was pretty bummed, you know, and

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.759
just like, arggg, that's the way it goes.
But the next morning, I got a call from Christopher

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:41.860
and he was, like, "Hey, let's publish that
book."

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:48.909
So anyway, that's what brings me here today,
is this "Hey Fudge" book.

00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:58.889
And it's, so the book is kind of compiling
all these zines and, you know, drawings and

00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:06.119
some photographs of, you know, art shows,
and just experience that have just kind of

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:11.549
been tossed in there that I feel like is relevant
to maybe the last five years or so before

00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:16.899
publishing this.
And, um, it was a really unique experience

00:27:16.899 --> 00:27:22.470
to be able to work with Christopher and Mark
Dischler on just you know, having meetings

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:27.970
on, just looking through books that we liked.
And essentially what our goal was to just

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.490
to set out to try to produce a book that we
would want to buy on the shelf, you know,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.759
something that would really like, jump out
at us. So we were going and looking at books

00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:43.909
and talking about what we liked about certain
books and didn't like about other books. And

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:50.379
you know, those guys get really, really into
the minute details of, you know, the stitching

00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:55.710
and binding and all these different things,
and paper stocks which I never considered

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:03.869
at Kinko's when I was, you know, stapling
and stuff like that. So anyway, that book,

00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:12.980
it came out in 2007 and we decided to have
a, Christopher got, they got distribution

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.489
through Last Gasp and Diamond Distribution,
and so it started to kind of hit some shelves

00:28:17.489 --> 00:28:23.789
and we decided, "Hey, let's throw a book release."
So we went back to the Jeff Electric Gallery

00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:33.159
where Chris saw that show and we hired a Mariachi
band and got some buckets of beer and signed

00:28:33.159 --> 00:28:43.679
some books. And it was a lot of fun.
I'd also like to mention, my partner Mel Kadel.

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:55.720
She's an artist and my special lady, you know.
How do I say this without being too embarrassed?

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:02.590
Anyway this is Mel, and she's also an artist
and we live together and draw together out

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:09.450
of the same shack and this is an example of
a few of her drawings. And she's a consistent

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:20.090
source of inspiration and humor and wildly
talented.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:27.210
And Mel and I are rep'd at the Richard Heller
Gallery in Santa Monica at Bergamot Station.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:32.379
And you know, a lot of people ask, like, "How
do you get rep'd at a gallery? You know, I

00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:37.510
gotta get a rep for my stuff." You know and
I'm like, yeah, we all do, but I don't know

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:44.350
how that stuff happens. And I think with Richard,
you know, I never went and took a meeting

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.440
and shared him anything and I've tried that
before with galleries. And I don't really

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.539
think that galleries want to you to come up
and say, "Hey, here's my bag of stuff," you

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:56.779
know. I think galleries seem to want to discover
you more, and not have you kind of walk in

00:29:56.779 --> 00:30:02.769
their door, but who knows, that's my experience
but it's different for everybody. But I think

00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:08.170
that stuff really does happen by just making
things and floating those zines out and just

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:14.679
all these little things, the stuff in the
bathrooms, you know, a comic that I did for

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:18.980
a magazine that maybe I forgot about years
ago. You just never know when somebody's gonna

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:26.360
come across it and pick it up, so, I think
my plan of attack is just to litter the corners

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:33.059
with my stuff for somebody to discover along
the way wherever they found it. So this is,

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:40.769
we did a split solo show, Mel's "New Drawings"
and my "Nude Rawings." We live together in

00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:50.640
Echo Park in an old cabin. This was built
in the '20s and ah, yeah we have a little

00:30:50.640 --> 00:31:02.710
cat. We enjoy going on for long walks in the
street and decorating poles. So I'll move,

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:08.799
I guess I also, just now, will move onto some
work projects because I do a lot of commercial

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:18.059
work as well. So these are some examples of
that. There's just, I guess this just kind

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:22.129
of goes to, like, you know when I first started
out thinking that I wanted to make a drawing

00:31:22.129 --> 00:31:27.750
and see if I could get paid to do an illustration,
there was just a lot that came along with

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:33.549
that that I didn't expect to find myself in
this position, talking to Google, really for

00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:40.269
one, or being on the phone negotiating a contract
or, you know, having to answer a number of

00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:45.159
emails that are, you know, there are just
all kinds of things that come up that isn't

00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:50.989
just sitting around drawing pictures and making
jokes all day. Which is kind of a disappointment.

00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:55.109
[laughter from audience]
But anyway these are some examples of Vans.

00:31:55.109 --> 00:32:02.609
I did a series of shoes for Vans in 2003,
and I did a number of T-shirts and things

00:32:02.609 --> 00:32:08.090
for them. And that came about basically by
them coming and they saw my stuff at an art

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:15.980
show years ago at the Blk/Mrkt Gallery, and
got in touch. Foundation is a skateboard company

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:25.669
that I've done a lot of stuff for.
I was actually introduced to Foundation through

00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:31.100
Michael Sieben who's a good friend of mine
in Austin, Texas. We made friends through

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:39.230
the mail, like old-fashioned mail. I was living
in New York, we were in a show together. And

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:43.019
he said, we started kind of sending each other
zines back and forth and he's a really funny

00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:48.789
guy, so he says, "Hey, let's try to do a like
a drawing zine back and forth." Initially,

00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:52.899
you know, we just decided that we were gonna,
you know, send these things back and forth,

00:32:52.899 --> 00:32:58.289
drawing together, and maybe we'd have, one
of us would have a stack of drawings for like

00:32:58.289 --> 00:33:01.510
two months and then send it on to the other
one and then the other one would hold it for

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:05.529
maybe a month or so and then send it on. We
kept passing this back and forth, back and

00:33:05.529 --> 00:33:10.970
forth for about two years and then decided
that, all right well, initially we were just

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:18.330
going to make a run of 200 zines, split the
run and sell them on our sites, but a friend

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:26.160
of Siebens from Austin, named Mike Aho, had
gotten a job at Volcom and just saw one of

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.440
the drawings and was, like, "What are you
doing with these?" He said, "Well I bet we

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:35.470
could get Volcom to, ah, I bet we could use
their copy machines or something." And then,

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:40.070
you know, people at that company caught wind
of it and eventually it became this book.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:48.850
And, you know, it's like a 40-page book. They
printed 65,000, I think, of these books and

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:54.419
they went out and in one month they went out
in every issue of "Thrasher" magazine. And

00:33:54.419 --> 00:33:59.480
like in the cover, it was glued into every
issue of "Thrasher." They never sold them.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.289
Actually our payment was, they were like here's
a thousand books, you can sell them. And they're

00:34:04.289 --> 00:34:12.230
not available for sale anywhere else, other
than with me or Mikey. But to sort of justify

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:17.990
that, they produced these T-shirts and they
had these T-shirts that went into the line,

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:24.080
and then they also sent us on these, a number
of art shows to kind of promote the shirts

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.220
and book and everything. You go to the art
show and you get a free shirt and a book.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:32.640
And it was pretty wild, it was a pretty wild
campaign and definitely way further than we

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.410
expected to ever take it.
And it actually took us to Japan. We ended

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:43.610
up going and having a show in Tokyo. This
is Michael in front of Kiddieland. That look

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:48.790
on his face is about the look that both of
us walked around with the whole time. "What

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:58.910
the hell?"
That's Mike Aho also in Japan. So I had not

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:04.580
done a lot of traveling, and we get there,
and the first, just a little story here of

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:12.930
me geeking out, arriving there. But we arrive
at the airport, take a train in to Shibuya,

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.690
get off the first train and this guy is standing
there with the shoes that I did for Vans.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:22.450
The first dude I see standing there, and I'm
like "Oh My God!" and I'm taking pictures

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:27.310
of him and he just freaked out, doesn't, you
know, I mean I don't know, how often does

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:32.490
a door opens up from a train and someone starts
flashing photos of you? Anyway, he had no

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:38.470
idea.
So these, so Michael Sieben also has a skateboard

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:44.320
company currently called Roger, but the one
previous to that was called Bueno. This is

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:51.110
a deck and a T-shirt that I did for it. Burton
Snowboards is a company that I also do a lot

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:57.010
of work for. And this is the first, I did
a snowboard for them, it was a Jeremy Jones

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:02.050
signature series board, I think it came out
in 2005. This is a picture of Jeremy hucking

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:10.290
himself off something.
And then they came back and asked me to do

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:16.240
the, I did all the packaging and hang tags
for all of their products for 2009. So it

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:24.090
was largely, it was like the biggest, it was
my entire 2008 was building boxes and just

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:30.160
for every product that they had. They were
a great company to work with. They were just

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:37.240
like, you know, constantly telling me to just
juice my imagination. They were like, "Man,

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.920
make this box crazy, this box just really
crazy." So I'm like "OK, I'm gonna make it

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:47.110
crazy." And then they were like "Alright,
that's crazy, but for the next one, go off!

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:51.920
We're gonna go crazy on this next one." I'm
like "Yeah alright, turn up the juice", and

00:36:51.920 --> 00:37:00.280
then they'd be like "Oh man, that is sick,
but this next one is [animated sounds] crazy

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:05.500
freak out." "All right!" So I reached new
levels of freak out. [laughter]

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:11.070
And produced, you know, several boxes and,
you know, pretty much I got a, you know, if

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:20.760
you got anything from the 2009 season it's
got my stamp on it somewhere. I also do a

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:29.880
lot of packaging for bands and avid, you know,
fan of music. And Anton Newcombe is the singer

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:35.280
of Brian Jonestown Massacre and I met him
at the Little Joy as a bartender and he was

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:42.760
into the vampires that were pasted onto the
wall and asked if we could just photograph

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.670
those and design a package around that. This
was around the time that the movie "Dig" came

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:56.650
out. And so I did that record for them and
then, EL-P is a hip-hop artist that I've done

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:04.950
a lot of stuff for and continue to do work
for. Um, Megapuss is ah, Devendra Banhart

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:11.310
and Greg Rogove moved in next door to us in
the cabin and we just met at the mailbox and

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:17.241
they were recording this project and asked
me and Mel to do the packaging for it. And

00:38:17.241 --> 00:38:24.580
so Mel and I tag teamed. She did the waves
on there, and we would kind of, like, swap

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:35.290
every page back and forth, and that came out
on Neil Young's Vapor label last year. I also,

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:43.700
you know, got a random call from HP for, there's
an ad agency in San Francisco called McCann

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:51.800
and they asked if I would do work for HP's
Back to School campaign of 2009. So this is

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:59.120
a series of drawings that were like some kind
of Facebook component. And there's some kind

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:06.310
of random like, major generator, like college
major generator, so you'd be like, you know

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:09.110
punch these buttons and it would say, "This
is stuff I like," and it'd say, "You might

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:17.720
be a cheese maker or a physics major or whatever."
So they asked me if I would do do this, what

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:25.890
would be, you know an animated commercial,
it never had, well I'd done video for the

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:33.350
Get Up Kids a few years back but as far as
animation, like I'm not, in theory I know

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:37.770
how it works but certainly with cell animation
I'm not, I don't have the patience or the

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:45.150
skill to do that. But key frames and concepting,
and that kind of stuff I can do so I sort

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:53.720
of, I can get it to a point where it's in
a good working order for an animator. So anyway

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.730
I ended up putting together a series of six
key frames and those went to a company called

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:07.300
Brand New School and they were animated. And
I don't have the link to the animation on

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:13.310
this, but if you go to my site you can see
that, it's on YouTube. Here's a couple more

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:18.640
of those key frames, but this, that little
head in the back, the little head with the

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:30.180
motor board is head banging gloriously blowing
in the wind. So then I did this book, "Farts."

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:40.100
On a more serious note, and this book last
year came out with Chronicle Books. Yeah,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:45.120
I don't know, how do you say no to a book
about farts? You know, and it's a sound book.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.810
I didn't write it but Chronicle got in touch
and said, "Hey, this Fudge Factory guy I think

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:55.080
is the guy for the job", and so they would
basically just give me the title of these

00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:01.190
farts and I would just have to come up with
some kind of image about what the description

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:04.960
would look like, and then you can punch the
button and hear what it sounds like. And it

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.870
did really well. Like in the first three weeks
it sold out of its first run of 30,000 and

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:16.180
I think it's in, I mean, in under a year it
reached over 100,000 copies. I'm not sure

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:23.890
where it's at now, but it's widely available.
And then, so they asked me to do another kind

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:30.650
of sound book and this just came out yesterday
called "How to Speak Zombie." And it's another

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:35.260
kind of goofy kid's book where you can punch
the sounds. Like "Hey, how can I order a coffee?

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:44.800
I'm in Zombieland." And you punch the button
and it's like "Arrrrggggg."

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:50.210
[laughter]
So I'm just gonna wrap this up with a few

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:55.400
more drawings, 'cuz basically what it comes
down to, I'll go home and just continue drawing

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:10.610
today, work or not. But, yeah. I think it
just sort of comes to, comes down to just

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:15.960
doing, you know, and continuing to do things,
and not really know, you know, what kind of

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.890
life it's gonna take on after it leaves the
desk. But um, I'm just sort of curious to

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:27.850
see like, I'm basically just trying to keep
myself entertained and avoid doing something

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:32.570
that I did last week and hopefully somewhere
along the way like, communicate with somebody

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:45.250
and make a joke or make a point. And, yeah.
So I guess I'll just, I really don't know

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:49.810
what else I want to say about it. If anybody
has any questions or anything like that, I'm

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:51.800
happy to take them.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.070
[pause]

00:42:53.070 --> 00:43:01.710
audience#1: All right well, I really like
your work first off. So thanks for coming

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:09.070
and sharing. Um, I see a lot of, maybe there
not there, I do see a lot of graffiti elements

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:14.390
to your work. And, you know, with your work
with EL-P and stuff. And I've discovered a

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:18.890
lot of artists like Jeremy Fish, and you've
got the same flora as in run English on you

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:23.290
know some magazines like "High Fructose" and
"Juxtapoz." Have you ever considered, you

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:29.220
know, working with some of those to kind of
get the hip-hop culture emergency work as

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.220
well?

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:34.090
Travis: Ah, well, "Juxtapoz" is a magazine
that I've worked with before,

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:35.090
audience: Nice.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:40.600
Travis: I had a feature in their magazine
last year, and Jeremy is a great friend of

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:49.740
mine, I mean he's a rad dude and I've done
some stuff with Aesop Rock and you know, like.

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:54.130
I guess, you know, like Def Jux is a, I've
been a fan of those guys, I was a fan of Company

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:58.250
Flow, I used to have a college radio show
when I was in Kansas and I used to play the

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:04.770
Fun Crusher Plush album and like, you know,
I

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:11.440
I don't really know how you insert yourself
into, how do you do a hip-hop record? I don't

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:18.440
know. I mean I don't know how this stuff happens,
but I just eventually along the way I met

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.571
Jeremy and Jeremy was like "I really like
your stuff and hey this is Aesop, you know"

00:44:22.571 --> 00:44:26.600
and I was like "Hey, good to meet you" and
then he's like "Yeah I like your stuff" and

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:32.110
then totally out of the blue I got a random
call and they said, and I answered the phone

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:36.410
from a 917 number, and he said, "Is this Travis?"
and I said, "Yeah." And he said, "This is

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:42.500
El-Producto," and I was like, what? You know.
And he's like, "Hey, I got your number from

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:50.910
Aesop." So that's kind of how that happened.
I wanted to do stuff for him years ago but

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:56.100
I just didn't know how to make it work, you
know I mean it's a lot of times, it's the

00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:01.770
same with skateboards, you know, I mean honestly
anything I've ever, I've ever been involved

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:07.630
with that I'm really proud of, I haven't gone
out and tried to scrape my way into it, it

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:15.120
sort of like, it seems to come back around
and more naturally work, you know? But yeah.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:20.440
audience: Cool. Thank you.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.100
Travis: Sure.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:30.550
audience #2: So I saw your work, you know
there's the whole skulls that you've been

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:36.090
doing for a long time and I kind of was thinking,
I mean this is just an association, but I

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:40.000
was thinking like Self-Help Graphics, do you
do Dia de los Muertos kind of stuff? Have

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.040
you ever checked that stuff out?

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:55.600
Travis: Um, no. But I, well I have, I'm not
that familiar with it but, maybe a line of

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:04.230
self-help books is exactly what I need to
be doing. [laughter] Yeah, good idea. Well,

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:09.960
I'm not sure. I mean I'm kind of into, I think
skulls just comes from like, for me it comes

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:16.050
from like, Pusshead, you know like early skateboard
graphics, you know like Zorlac Boards and

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:21.590
stuff. That's why I started drawing skulls,
you know, it was just kind of seeing it in

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:30.500
skateboard magazines or like heavy metal records
that I was into and then, yeah. There's a

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:37.380
rich tradition with the Dia de los Muertos
but I think I like the, I dunno. I think I

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.980
was captured by the rawness of just metal
and skateboarding and stuff like that. Maybe

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:46.620
if there's a self-help book for me out there
on that kind of stuff I'd be open to reading

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.430
it but...

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:54.770
audience#3: You mentioned how you went through
a bunch of books to find things you liked

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.931
about other books to go into the production
of "Hey Fudge." Could you talk about some

00:46:58.931 --> 00:47:04.610
of the things that you ended up either putting
in the book or ways you put it into the book,

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:05.610
based on that?

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:14.720
Travis: Um, well, yeah. I think, well, I think
a lot of, you know there's certain things

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.970
about books that was just really fun to go
to the bookstore. I'm a collector of books

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:24.540
and so are Mark and Christopher, and so we
all just kind of, and it also gave me an excuse

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.430
to go to the bookstore and just like spend
a bunch of money on stuff and just justify

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:36.940
it that way. But, you know there's just things,
certain things about some books that we really

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:42.270
liked you know, and other things that we didn't.
And so we tried to kind of take the best of,

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:46.050
you know, little bits and try to rip off like
parts of books that we thought were working

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:52.640
really well. And then when it came to designing
the book, I think I have a, I think, just

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.590
you know, I've laid out a lot of zines and
I've done a lot of you know illustration layout,

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:05.320
or whatever I'm doing. But my tendency is
to just full bleed everything, just to throw

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.640
it in there and really kind of, when I make
zines I like to kind of think of them as mixed

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:18.510
tapes. So if I'm, you know, it's like, this
is what I've currently been listening to over

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:23.450
the last couple of months. So I'll pull out
the best songs of, you know, what I've been

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:29.740
listening to and toss them onto this tape,
in the way that the zine comes together. And

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:34.550
so the editing process was a little different,
whereas with the zine I could make a hundred

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:39.420
of those things and if it ah, you know, if
there's a piece of crap in there that I'm

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.960
embarrassed about later, I don't really think
about it, you know, I kind of let it float

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:51.380
because I'm gonna make another one like in
a month or two. With this book, um, it you

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:56.510
know, I've looked at, there's some drawings
in there that I'm just like, "pfff, I had

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:04.060
a better drawings than that. How did that
make it in there?" Or you know. But that's

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:09.060
where Chris and Mark kind of helped come in
and helped editing it. And Mel, also sitting

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:13.140
with me and going through it, and saying like
"You've got a better drawing than that, that

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:22.020
can go." Or one thing with the "Michael Jackson
in Exile" book, that thing has a, you know,

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:26.730
my first instinct was just to have that go
full bleed off the pages, and Mark and also

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:35.800
Brock advised me on just shrinking those things
and adding a big white border. So when it

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:42.410
does go full bleed on a couple of the pages
it becomes a lot more dramatic. And ah, you

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:47.590
know, there's just a lot of different production
things that go into it. And when I make a

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:55.190
zine I think the kind of the flash of the
copier and it's, I dunno, it's kind of part

00:49:55.190 --> 00:50:02.530
of the magic of it, is just the kind of crude
nature of how it comes out in the end. But

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:08.460
things are different with this kind of production,
you know? I mean the crappiness of it isn't

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:14.820
really as endearing as it is with a handmade
staple thing. So, just adjusting levels, you

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:25.080
know, and I had some help with that but, yeah
it was a really good learning experience.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:29.380
For these guys, too, this is their second
single, their first single authored publication

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:37.720
and their second book. You know, so. We were
all kind of learning together at the same

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:43.061
time, you know. But we're all, you know, pretty
savvy guys and know what we like so we can

00:50:43.061 --> 00:50:48.320
just sort of go for aesthetic and see how
that came together. Yeah.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.540
[pause]

00:50:49.540 --> 00:51:00.270
All right, thanks a lot. Oh I have some stickers,
some sticker packs, if anybody wants to get

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:05.520
a free sticker pack. Oh yeah, and I also just
launched my website. These guys are going

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.010
"Website!" I just launched my website. I haven't
updated my website in a really long time,

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:15.810
and I just launched it like within the last
12 hours. FudgeFactoryComics.com. [pop noise]

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.790
All right. Thanks.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:19.790
