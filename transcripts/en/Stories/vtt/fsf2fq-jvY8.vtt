00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.560
SPEAKER 1: Cereal.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.400
The humble breakfast
staple is hardly

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.200
something to revolt
over, [BREAKING GLASS]

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.710
or so I thought.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.530
Because in September 2015,
a group of protesters

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.700
got really mad over
an East London store

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.200
that sold the innocuous
breakfast for around $5 to $7,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.450
which to be fair, is a
lot when you consider

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.220
it's just a bowl of cereal.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.590
The angry mob hurled
bottles, smashed windows,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.590
and even burned an
effigy of a policeman.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.490
Now the riot wasn't because
the place had run out of, well,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.640
this.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.530
The fight was really about
a much bigger problem--

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.420
gentrification.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.800
The protesters are an
anti-gentrification group

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.046
called the [BLEEP] Parade.

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:40.170
The group launched their
campaign against the store

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.810
because they felt it symbolized
a bigger problem in London,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.730
and, indeed, in many other
metropolises around the world.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.860
Many anti-gentrification
protesters

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.970
aren't 100% opposed to
the idea of urban renewal.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.690
But they do have a
problem with what it's

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.630
doing to local communities.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.360
Higher rents and
housing prices mean

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.250
established
working-class communities

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.945
are being forced to move.

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:02.860
The [BLEEP] Parade
have even gone as far

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.850
as describing the problem in
London as social cleansing.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.550
And people aren't
necessarily moving in

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.240
to replace those who have left.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.190
Urban renewal, gentrification,
whatever you want to call it,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.790
is making properties in cities
like London much more desirable

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.420
for foreign investors,
or those who are

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.020
wanting to buy a vacation home.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.570
So now, imagine walking
down a street at night,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.770
in one of the most vibrant
cities in the world, only

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.590
to find it's eerily quiet.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.430
There are no lights on in the
houses, because, well, nobody's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.540
home.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.660
This is actually happening
in London boroughs

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.270
like Camden and Hammersmith.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.630
To paraphrase a popular
British band from the '70s,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.970
pockets of London are
looking like a ghost town.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.540
And the same exact thing
is happening in New York,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.680
Melbourne, and San Francisco.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.130
Ghost towns are an extreme
manifestation of urban renewal,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.620
but it does highlight
the real bone

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.820
of contention surrounding the
practice-- loss of community.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.470
Because the essence
of why somewhere

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.810
is desirable to live can't be
bought or built. It's true.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.100
Anti-gentrification protesters
should not have used violence

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.630
to get their point across.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.050
But there is some
truth when they

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.590
say, "We don't want luxury
flats that no one can afford.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.110
We want genuinely
affordable housing.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.380
We want community."

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.170
And this might hit home
when, instead of London,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.950
it's echoing through
the streets of what

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.229
used to be your neighborhood.

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.020
There's another fight
over land development

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.770
happening in America,
involving the US Government,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.120
Big Oil, and, believe it
or not, a prairie chicken.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.144

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:35.810
SPEAKER 2: The energy
industry got upset

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.860
because their land
use could be limited.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.890
Conservationists got
upset because they

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.320
thought the land use still
wouldn't be limited enough.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.600
And it really only got
crazier from there.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
SPEAKER 1: Thanks for
watching, and don't forget

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.910
