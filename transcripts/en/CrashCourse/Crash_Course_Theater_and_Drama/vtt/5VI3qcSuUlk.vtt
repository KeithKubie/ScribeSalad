00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.700
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Theater, and today we’re going to

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.620
circle up our pageant wagons and talk about
the theater of the late Middle Ages: mainly

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.420
mystery plays and morality plays.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.810
Judged by contemporary standards, these plays
are… awkward.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.730
They’re episodic, kind of basic, and pretty
chaotic in their mix of comedy, drama, and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.730
scripture.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.730
But some of the jokes are good.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.220
Like the ones about baby-eating [PAUSE] That’s
more Yorick’s speed than mine - you love

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.420
a morose groaner, dontcha, Bonehead?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.769
Mystery plays and morality plays were the
first European plays to unite religious life

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.470
and secular life in more than a thousand years.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.140
Whole towns pitched in to create them; whole
towns arrived to see them.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.970
Those wagon wheels paved the way for the Renaissance’s
theatrical explosion.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.190
Today, we’re going to look today at The
Second Shepherd’s Play, written by the Wakefield

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.190
Master.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.260
It may seem a little hum-drum, but no Wakefield
Master, no Shakespeare.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.970
And no Shakespeare: NO YORICK!

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.490
Actually maybe that’s ok ...
INTRO

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.290
A couple of episodes ago, we looked at liturgical
drama: those moments, first in the Easter

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.960
mass and then all year, when priests and monks
acted out some of the liturgy.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.260
This form took off, and spread all throughout
Europe.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.120
And by the 11th and 12th centuries, got pretty
elaborate.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.630
It expanded out from the altar and spread
all over the church, occupying small spaces

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.850
usually known as mansions, which were decorated
to suggest different scenes.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.650
One personal favorite: The Hell Mouth.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.650
Intense!

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.650
For a while, liturgical drama works.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.560
You have the liturgy, you have the drama,
you have the mansions—religious fun for

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560
the whole family.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.190
But eventually it’s just not enough.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.340
Because here’s the thing: Medieval Gothic
churches are big.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.340
They’re really big.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.530
They are trying to stretch all the way up
to heaven and capture something of God’s

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.200
majesty in glass and stone.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.250
If you’ve ever stood in Notre Dame, or York
Minster, you’re like, yup, that there’s

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.900
some world class majesty.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.420
And yet, even these colossal churches become
too small to contain the awesomeness that

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.870
is THEE-AH-TAH!.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.230
So liturgical drama moves to the only other
place with enough square footage to accommodate

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.040
all that dang majesty: outside.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.660
Now you’re thinking, yay, fun, liturgical
drama al fresco!

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.050
Not so fast.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.580
In 1210, Pope Innocent III issues an edict
saying that the clergy can’t perform plays

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.180
in public.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.370
The clergy are like, “Oh well.”

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.990
But the people are like, “No!

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.540
You can’t walk it back.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.790
We want hellmouths!

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.790
Bigger!

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.790
Better!

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.790
More!”

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.510
So in the early 13th century a radical thing
happens: Drama moves from being a clerical

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.470
phenomenon to being a secular one.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.470
We back, baby!

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.430
Since Roman times—for more than a thousand
years!—Christians have haaaated theater.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.260
But Christians also loved theater, or the
liturgical drama wouldn’t have caught on

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.610
the way it did.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.680
Performing plays inside the church, basing
them exclusively on the Christian liturgy,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.260
and having members of the clergy act in them
were the strategies Christians used to make

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.380
it less sinful… but that’s all gone now.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.040
Drama has left the building and by building
I mean basilica; priests are no longer the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.040
actors.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.319
Bring on the incest plots and the dancing
girls!

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.560
Ok, it doesn’t escalate THAT quickly, It’s
going to take theater a few decades to get

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.610
truly decadent.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.170
Theater sticks pretty closely to the Bible
and associated religious texts as the liturgical

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.220
dramas transform into the cycle plays.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.500
Cycle plays are an ambitious genre of medieval
drama that depicts the whole history of the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.950
Christian universe, starting with the creation
of the world, and ending with the death and

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.220
resurrection of Christ, and skimming most
of the Old and New Testaments in between.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.080
Some of them go all the way up to the Last
Judgment.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.019
In England, the performing of cycles began
sometime in the late 1300s and continued until

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.519
into the late 1500s, when they were banned
because of the English Reformation.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.380
The Protestants weren’t so keen on graven
images, even fun theatrical ones, and cycle

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.180
plays were seen as too Catholic.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.950
The same thing happened throughout Europe.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.809
In the age of religious disputes and wars,
religious drama was seen as too controversial

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.229
(even if it was very popular).

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.169
In some cities cycle plays were organized
by religious guilds, but in many places, especially

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.129
England, they were produced by trade and craft
guilds.

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.419
This is why they are sometimes known as mystery
plays, because a “mystery” was another

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.419
word for a trade.

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.689
So carpentry, that’s a mystery.

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:42.689
As are ship-building, blacksmithing, and baking.

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:43.689
Listen, have you ever tried to make croissants?

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:44.689
Or a schooner?

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:45.689
Very Mysterious!

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.020
The plays themselves are not mysteries like
Murder She Wrote or Serial.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.949
They’re more about mystery in the religious
sense.

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:51.949
Whodunnit?

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.569
God, pretty much always.

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.589
Or sometimes Judas.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:01.340
Cycle plays are also known as passion plays
if the particular cycle focuses on the passion

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.340
of the Christ.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.919
In most cases, each guild would be responsible
for staging a biblical story, usually one

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.849
overlapping with their work.

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.240
So the shipwrights might take on Noah and
the Ark, and the bakers the Last Supper.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.759
Each guild would supply the costumes, actors,
and set – and pile it all into a big cart,

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.439
known as a pageant wagon—basically, a theatremobile.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.879
The carts were trundled through the town,
stopping often at fixed points to perform.

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.819
Or maybe they stayed put and audiences moved?

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.189
Scholars aren’t sure.

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:35.569
And by the way, the move from cart to cart
mirrors the way dramatic action would move

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.430
from mansion to mansion in liturgical dramas.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.759
Each play lasted half an hour, and there were
upwards of forty plays!

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.970
If you thought Les Miz was long, get ready.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.569
The cycle dramas were often performed over
several days, though—you weren’t expected

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.610
to sit for twenty hours straight.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.669
You could relieve yourself, grab a beer or
a lard-based pie.

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.819
Most actors weren’t professionals, either:
they were men and boys, drawn from the working

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:01.819
class.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.569
In some towns, women participated.

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.409
Amateur actors were expected to take their
work very seriously, though: you got fined

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.259
if you didn’t know your lines.

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.900
The cycle plays were a big draw for tourists
and a chance for towns to show off their civic

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.529
pride, and their skills as craftspeople.

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.710
OOOooooOOOOoooo - mysteriiioooouuussss!

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.949
Most plays restated the basic action of a
Bible story, though guilds would dress stories

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:30.159
up with anachronistic jokes and the occasional
bit of troubling anti-Semitism.

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:34.669
Plays were typically a mix of highly stylized
action and contemporary realism.

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.259
And authors were mostly anonymous, although
a couple of Frenchmen signed their plays about

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.289
the lives of saints, also known as miracle
plays.

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:49.479
Medieval stagecraft wasn’t the most sophisticated–when
your stage is a wagon, there are limits–but

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.819
guilds wanted to put on a good show, so there
were plenty of special effects, like trap

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.389
doors, fake corpses, fake blood and some fire
effects.

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:57.389
I know, right?

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.080
Don’t tell the fire marshall guild!

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.319
One of the best preserved and best loved of
the cycle plays is “The Second Shepherd’s

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.319
Play.”

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.030
This English work is part of the Wakefield
Cycle.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.860
It was composed by an anonymous writer sometime
in the 15th century, known only as the Wakefield

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.860
Master.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.289
It’s called “The Second Shepherd’s Play,”
because there’s an earlier shepherd’s

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:19.680
play in the same manuscript trove.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.499
Let’s take it to the, Thoughtbubble:
It’s freezing cold in a meadow somewhere

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:28.882
in the Middle East (that looks a lot like
the north of England).

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:31.439
Coll, the first shepherd, enters … and complains
about the weather.

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:34.289
Then a second shepherd, Gib, arrives.

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:38.689
He complains about the weather, too, and also
about his wife, who he says is fat.

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:45.189
A third shepherd, Daw, shows up, saying, “Christ’s
cross me speed,” which is odd because Christ

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:46.690
hasn’t been born yet.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.690
Oh!

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.680
And he also complains about the weather.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.169
HASHTAG RELATABLE Northern England content
right here, huh?

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:54.309
Then Mak enters.

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:56.469
Mak is a sheep stealer.

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:57.509
Conflict!

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:59.860
He tries to trick the shepherds, but they’re
onto him.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.889
eventually they bond about how terrible Mak’s
drunk, baby-having wife is, and everyone goes

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:05.919
to sleep.

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.879
Except Mak!

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:11.870
He puts a spell on the rest, and runs off
with a sheep, bringing it home to his wife

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.819
Gill, who’s like, “Way to go.

00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:15.469
Now you’re going to be hanged.”

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:17.430
But Mak is like, “Come on!

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.430
It’s meat!”

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.460
So Gill comes up with a plan to put the sheep
in the cradle and say it’s a baby.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.429
Good thinking, Gill.

00:08:24.429 --> 00:08:27.729
Back in the meadow, Mak pretends to wake up
alongside the shepherds, but they realize

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:30.870
a sheep is missing, and go to search his house.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.830
Gill fends them off, joking about eating the
baby, which is maybe about the Eucharist?

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.060
but also about cannibalism?

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.890
The shepherds take off, but then they’re
like, “Oh wait, we forgot to bring gifts

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.169
for the baby.”

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.360
So they come back and find the sheep!

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.750
Instead of hanging Mak, they decide to roll
him up in a cloth and beat him black and blue.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.750
Hooray!

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.210
Another one of those famous happy Christian
endings!

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.710
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.850
Wait… wasn’t that supposed to be a Bible
story?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.520
Well, after the shepherd’s leave, an angel
comes down and tells them to go to Bethlehem

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.230
and see the Christ child.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.530
Bethlehem is conveniently very nearby.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.600
They go visit Mary and the little baby Jesus,
bringing him cherries, a bird, and a tennis

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
ball.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.870
Not a joke.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.140
An actual tennis ball.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.270
In this play, we can see the Bible story,
mostly borrowed from the gospel of Luke, intersect

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.220
pretty comfortably with the English vernacular:
entertaining an audience while also celebrating

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.220
Jesus.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.780
It’s comic and dramatic, serious and silly,
high and low, religious and folkloric.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.560
It reminds the audience that Christ was born
to save northern English shepherds, as well

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.750
as biblical types.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.210
And there’s just a little cannibalism—for
fun.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.400
Cycle plays weren’t the only fun in town,
though.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.860
Pretty soon another form of medieval drama
made its debut: the secular play!

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.460
Which first appeared in France in the late
13th century.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.460
These plays were often based on folklore,
hence “The Play of the Greenwood,” includes

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:02.150
both fairies and townspeople, and “The Play
of Robin and Marion,” which is the first

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.180
dramatization of the Robin Hood stories.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.750
We’re still dramatizing this one seven hundred
years later, though now with Kevin Costner

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.650
and the soothing pipes of Bryan Adams.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.280
The other important medieval genre is the
morality play, which Hildegarde of Bingen

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.280
started.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.400
The most famous morality play is “Everyman,”
which is still performed annually and often

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.800
updated.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.000
Morality plays have one simple message: YOU
GONNA DIE.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.990
So you’d better get your act together, because
all that love and wealth and fun aren’t

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.450
gonna follow you six feet under.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.490
Right, Yorick?

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.590
But you know what will follow you?

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.590
Good deeds.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.210
So go help some old ladies cross a cattle
path.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.110
Morality plays have a huge influence on the
plays of the English Renaissance.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.240
Mystery, folk, and morality plays had a good
run.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.220
They remained the dominant forms of theater
for more than 300 years.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.370
And as I mentioned, “Everyman” is still
being performed today.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.900
Take that, “Cats!”

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.220
But things get tricky at the beginning of
the Renaissance when Protestant reformers

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:05.860
look around and decide that drama and religion
shouldn’t mix, and they ban cycle dramas.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.860
Happy trails, pageant wagons.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:44.260
Until next time… curtain!
