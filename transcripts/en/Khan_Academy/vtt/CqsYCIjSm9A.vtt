00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.070
In the last video, we figured
out how much work or how much

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.710
energy we have to put into a
particle to move it within a

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.970
constant electric field.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.250
Let's see if we can do the same
thing now with a variable

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.340
electric field, and actually,
then we could figure out the

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.070
electric potential of one
position relative to another.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.220
So let's say we have
a point charge.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.580
It doesn't have to be a point
charge, but let's just say

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.140
that there's some field being
generated by this charge that

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.320
is a positive q1 coulombs.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.620
And if we wanted to draw field
lines-- and, of course, this

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.020
is different than the example
with the infinite uniformly

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.900
charged plate because this will
have a variable electric

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.610
field, right?

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.740
What is the electric field
of this charge?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.512
The electric field is going
to look like this.

00:00:52.512 --> 00:00:54.780
It's essentially the amount of
force it will exert on any

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.350
particle, and it's always going
to be pointed outwards,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.880
because we assume that the test
particle in question is

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.110
always a positive charge, so
a positive charge will be

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.930
repelled from this
positive charge.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.980
That field is Coulomb's constant
times this charge q1

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.650
over the distance that we
are from this charge.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.760
So if I were to draw this
electric field close up, it's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.010
pretty strong.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.340
And then as we get further, it
gets weaker a little bit.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.650
It's always radially outward
from the charge.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.800
This a bit review for you.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.820
And this is a vector field that
I'm drawing, where I'm

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.130
just randomly picking points and
showing the vector of the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.790
field at that point, that it's
pointed outward, and at any

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.370
given radius away from the
circle, these vectors should

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.090
be the same magnitude.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.040
I know mine aren't exactly,
but hopefully, you get the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.310
point, right?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.860
And the magnitude of these
vectors decrease with the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.830
square of the distance.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.540
So that's what the field is
going to look like if I were

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.420
to draw a bunch of vector
field lines.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.240
And that makes sense, just
as a review, right?

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.979
Because we know the force-- if
we had another test charge q2,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.600
we know that the force on that
test charge is just q2 times

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.400
this, and that's just Coulomb's
Law, right?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.450
That the force on some other
particle q2 is equal to the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:30.560
electric field times q2, which
is equal to k q1 q2 over r

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.060
squared, right?

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.180
This is just Coulomb's Law, and
actually this comes from

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.520
Coulomb's Law.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.880
So since we know that, let's
take some other positive

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.190
particle out here, and
let's call that q2.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.300
I'll write it up here since I
already messed up down there.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.260
q2, and let's say this is a
positive charge, so it is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.540
going to be repelled
from this q1.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.100
And let's figure out how much
work does it take to push in

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.870
this particle a certain
distance, right?

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.610
Because the field is
pushing it outward.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.180
It takes work to
push it inward.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.350
So let's say we want
to push it in.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.200
Let's say it's at 10 meters.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.810
Let's say that this distance
right here-- let me draw a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.260
radial line-- let's say that
this distance right here is 10

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.720
meters, and I want to push this
particle in 5 meters, so

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.320
it eventually gets right here.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.970
This is where I'm eventually
going to get it so then it's

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.260
going to be 5 meters away.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.430
So how much work does it take
to move it 5 meters towards

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.730
this charge?

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.070
Well, the way you think about
it is the field keeps

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.230
changing, right?

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.880
But we can assume over a very,
very, very, very infinitely

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.240
small distance, and let's call
that infinitely small distance

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.660
dr, change in radius, and as
you can see, we're about to

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.500
embark on some integral and
differential calculus.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.720
If you don't understand what any
of this is, you might want

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.250
to review or learn the calculus
in the calculus

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.040
playlist, but how much work does
it require to move this

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.019
particle a very, very
small distance?

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.720
Well, let's just assume over
this very, very, very small

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.940
distance, that the electric
field is roughly constant, and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.600
so we can say that the very,
very small amount of work to

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.750
move over that very, very small
distance is equal to

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.820
Coulomb's constant q1 q2 over
r squared times dr.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.150
Now before we move on,
let's think about

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.400
something for a second.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.290
Coulomb's Law tells us that this
is the outward force that

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.140
this charge is exerting on
this particle or that the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.570
field is exerting on
this particle.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.330
The force that we have to apply
to move the particle

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.380
from here to here has to
be an inward force.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.160
It has to be in the exact
opposite direction, so it has

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.410
to be a negative.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.300
And why is that?

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.230
Because we have to completely
offset the force of the field.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.630
Maybe if the particle was
already moving a little bit,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.280
then our force will keep it
from decelerating from the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.760
field, and if it wasn't already
moving, we would have

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.910
to nudge it just an infinitely
small amount just to get it

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.010
moving, and then our force would
completely offset the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.970
force of the field, and the
particle would neither

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.520
accelerate nor decelerate.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.890
So this is the amount of work,
and I just want to explain

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.660
that we want to put that
negative sign there because we

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.350
going in the opposite direction
of the field.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.210
So how do we figure out the
total amount of work?

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.000
We figured out the amount of
work to get it from here to

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.140
here, and I even drew it much
bigger than it would be.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.000
These dr's, this is
an infinitely

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.010
small change in radius.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.890
If we want to figure out the
total work, then we keep

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.450
adding them up.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.770
We say, OK, what's the work to
go from here to here, then the

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.480
work to go from there to there,
then the work to go

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.550
from there to there, all the way
until we get to 5 meters

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.190
away from this charge.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.740
And what we do when we take the
sum of these, we assume

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.190
that it's an infinite sum of
infinitely small increments.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.250
And as you learned, that is
nothing but the integral, and

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:23.790
so that is the total work is
equal to the integral.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.260
That's going to be a definite
integral because we're

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.210
starting at this point.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.900
We're summing from-- our radius
is equal to 10 meters--

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.800
that's our starting point--
to radius equals 5 meters.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.270
That might be a little
unintuitive that we're

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.020
starting at the higher value and
ending at the lower value,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.640
but that's what we're doing.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.780
We're pushing it inwards.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:50.210
And then we're taking the
integral of minus k q1 q2 over

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.550
r squared dr. All of these are
constant terms up here, right?

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.030
So we could take them out.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.520
So this is the same thing--
I don't want to run out of

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:14.350
space-- as minus k q1 q2 times
the integral from 10 to 5 of 1

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:20.950
over r squared-- or to the
negative 2-- dr. And that

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:28.310
equals minus k-- I'm running
out of space-- q1 q2.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.140
We take the antiderivative.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.720
We don't have to worry about
plus here because it's a

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.600
definite integral.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.580
r to the negative 2, what's
the antiderivative?

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.890
It's minus r to the
negative 1.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.900
Well, that minus r, the minus
on the minus r will just

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.760
cancel with this.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.340
That becomes a plus r to the
negative 1, And you evaluate

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.130
it at 5 and then subtract it
and evaluate it at 10.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.370
And then-- let me
just go up here.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.620
Actually, let me erase
some of this.

00:07:56.822 --> 00:07:58.885
Let me erase this up here.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.040
Valuable space to work on.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.010
So we said that the work
is equal to-- I'll

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.100
just rewrite that.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.040
We had the minus out here, but
then we had a minus and we

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.080
took the antiderivative and they
canceled out, so we have

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:25.990
k q1 q2 times the antiderivative
evaluated at 5,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.780
so 1 over 5, right?

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.960
r to the negative 1, so 1 over
r minus the antiderivative

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.250
evaluated at 10 minus 1 over 10
is equal to-- well, 1 over

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.049
5, that's the same thing
as 2 over 10, right?

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:50.280
So we have the work is equal
to k q1 q2 times 2 over 10

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.360
minus 1 over 10 is 1 over
10, so that equals

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.740
k q1 q2 over 10.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.760
That's the work to take the
particle from here to here.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.740
And so similarly, we could say
that the potential energy of

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.120
the particle at this-- the
potential difference of the

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.820
particle at this point relative
to this point, that

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.610
the potential difference here
is this much higher.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.670
It's going to be in joules
because that's the unit of

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.900
energy or work or potential,
because

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.940
potential is energy anyway.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.960
So the electric potential
difference between this point

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.030
and this point: at this point,
it is this value higher.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.510
Let's do another example, and
actually, you might just find

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.790
this interesting, just from
something to think about.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.550
The big difference between--
actually, let me just continue

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.510
this into the next video because
I realize I'm already

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.195
at 10 minutes.

00:09:48.195 --> 00:09:49.880
I'll see you soon.
