&gt;&gt; MIKE: Hi. I'm Mike and I'm here with Daniel
and Romain. We're all engineers from the Android

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.170
team. And we're going to be introducing a
concept called applications without borders.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.790
With Android, applications can integrate features
and data from other applications. They can

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.200
also use all of the hardware sensors on the
device including GPS, compass, accelerometer,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.000
and the camera. And, of course, they can also
use all of the content available through Web

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.419
APIs. Now, Daniel's application is a really
good example of this.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.050
&gt;&gt; DANIEL: I'm one of the engineers working
on Zebra Crossing, an open source library

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.050
to decode barcodes using a camera phone. We
have a great client for Android which really

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.050
shows off how we can integrate with the system.
So here's the application running using the

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:50.550
camera preview. Now, I'm going to scan a product.
There we go. And I can open product search

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:02.989
by sending an Intent. We can also recognize
2D barcodes called QR Codes. Let me show you.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.720
So here's my business card which has a barcode
on the back. And when I scan it, I get my

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.600
contact info. So you can add me as a contact
without having to type it out or if I cancel

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.710
it out of there. You can do a few other things.
You can dial a number using the dialer, or

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.180
you can send an email to my address.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.909
My app also publishes Intents so that other
applications can scan barcodes, too.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.510
&gt;&gt; ROMAIN: I found this really useful and
I decided to integrate it into my own application

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.479
without doing their work. This is a list of
books that I keep with me in my pocket at

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.000
all times. And I want it in a way to be able
to quickly and easily add new books to my

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.479
library. So when you click the add menu, I
simply fire in the Intent that starts Daniel's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.840
application. And I can now scan a book to
add it to the library. And once the book is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.009
scanned, the application downloads information
about the book on the Internet. So really

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.349
here, I created a match up that leverages
features of both of our application to create

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.569
a richer user-experience. Now, Mike will show
you a different kind of match up.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.939
&gt;&gt; MIKE: Now, my application mixes together
user creative content from the web along with

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:23.090
compass and GPS information and then an embedded
map view all into a kind of a geosocial stew.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.980
So we're going to start by launching the application.
And when it comes up, we see an embedded map

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.779
view. This is showing the area that I'm going
to use to search for pictures, and it's centered

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.730
on my current location using GPS. When you
hit the search button, it goes out to the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.939
Panoramio web service and finds the most popular
photographs that were taken in this area.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.680
Now, here we have a picture of the T-Rex skeleton
that's on Google's campus. Don't ask. When

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.159
you click on that, you get more details about
that photo. And if you want to find where

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.290
that actually is in the real world, you have
two choices: you can either click on the map

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.730
menu and that will bring up a custom map view
that has a push pin with the physical location

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.510
of where that picture was taken; and it also
shows your location using GPS. And if you

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.489
want to navigate there by walking, you can
hit the radar view and that will give you

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:22.150
a bearing to that statue, to that skeleton.
So the T-Rex is 200 yards that way. We hope

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.529
that these demos have shown that with Android
you can think about application development

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.150
on a fundamentally different way. We've already
seen examples where developers are building

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.839
on each other's work to combine features in
exciting new ways. And we can't wait to see

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:33.549
what you come up with.
