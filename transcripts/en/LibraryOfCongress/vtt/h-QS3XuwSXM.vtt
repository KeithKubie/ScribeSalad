&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.690
&gt;&gt; Good morning, I'm Carla
Hayden, the Librarian

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.460
of Congress, and I
want to welcome you

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.740
to this very special
story time at the library.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.040
I love reading.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.340
Don't you?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.800
It's so much fun to let
our imaginations run wild.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.530
We're excited to be teaming

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.940
up with Miss Dolly
Parton's Imagination Library

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.700
to introduce you to
some wonderful authors

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.430
who will share their
stories with us.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.600
Miss Parton's work through
her Imagination Library

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.660
is awe-inspiring.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.290
She and her team have given
away over 100 million books

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.630
to help encourage young readers
like you across the world.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.520
Here at the Library of
Congress, we share that passion

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.210
for developing young leaders,
and we know that the best way

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.460
to encourage people like you
to read is to make reading fun,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.880
so that's what we're here to do.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.560
I hope you enjoy
today's story time.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.860
Even more, I hope you keep
reading at home and having fun.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.600
Today you will warm up
by singing some songs,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.910
touching your toes, and
then get comfortable

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.920
and get ready to hear stories.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.020
Now let's get started.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.130
&gt;&gt; Welcome, welcome, everyone,
to the great Whittall Pavilion

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.430
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.010
We're so happy to have
you joining us today.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.920
My name is Miss Caroline for
the Young Readers Center,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.470
and today we have a very
special reader, Mr. Steve,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.860
Mr. Wizard from American
Folklife.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.320
All right, so today we are
featuring the songs and stories

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.860
of the great U.K.,
British author

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.430
and song composer
Julia Donaldson.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.500
So she is absolutely prolific

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.650
and the whole story time
will b her material.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.450
She is a former Children's
Laureate of the United Kingdom.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.580
And we're going to start
with our usual hello song,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.180
so remember, we are going
to do "hello, friends."

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.920
We salute "hello,"
and "friends,"

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.030
you link your index fingers,
then "hello" three times,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.220
and then "it's time
to say hello."

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.240
Hello, friends.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.780
Hello, friends.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.700
Hello, friends, it's
time to say hello.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.840
Great. All right, so
let's do open-shut them

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.160
to wake up our brain cells.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.350
Open, shut them,
open, shut them.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.470
Give a little clap, clap, clap.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.520
Open, shut them,
open, shut them.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.460
Put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.380
Creep them, crawl them,
creep them, crawl them right

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.330
up to your chin, chin, chin.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.690
Open up your little mouth,
but do not let them in.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.990
One more time.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.920
Open, shut them,
open, shut them.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.910
Give a little clap, clap, clap.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.920
Open, shut them,
open, shut them.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.770
Put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.750
Creep them, crawl them,
creep them, crawl them right

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.370
up to your chin, chin, chin.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.380
Open up your little mouth,
but do not let them in.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.420
Oh, good job.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.500
All right, well, Mr. Wizard,
will you read us a poem?

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.800
&gt;&gt; I will.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.800
I will. I'm going to read
a poem by Julia Donaldson,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.030
and this poem is about reading,
and that's why it's so great,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.020
and it's called "I
Opened a Book."

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.430
I opened a book and in I strode.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.570
Now nobody can find me.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.510
I've left my chair, my
house, my road, my town

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.760
and my world behind me.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.390
I'm wearing the cloak,
I've slipped on the ring,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.640
I've swallowed the magic potion,
I've fought with a dragon,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.670
I've dined with a king and
dived in a bottomless ocean.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.680
I opened a book and
made some friends.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.050
I shared their tears and
laughter and followed their road

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.480
with its bumps and bends
to the happily ever after.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.530
I finished my book
and out I came.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.450
The cloak no longer can hide me.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.240
My chair and my house
are just the same,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.850
but I have a book inside me.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.150
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.450
All right.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.890
Well, we have a very
special book today

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.930
about a spooky monster
named "The Gruffalo,"

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.380
and Mr. Steve, will
you have a seat?

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.290
&gt;&gt; I will, I will.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.530
&gt;&gt; Well, this book is
also by Julia Donaldson

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.380
and it's called "The Gruffalo."

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.990
A mouse took a stroll
through the deep dark wood.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.870
A fox saw the mouse and
the mouse looked good.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.410
"Where are you going
to, little brown mouse?

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.010
Come and have lunch in
my underground house."

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.540
"It's terribly kind
of you, Fox, but no.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.160
I'm going to have
lunch with a Gruffalo."

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.560
"A Gruffalo?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.210
What's a Gruffalo?"

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.510
"A Gruffalo, why,
didn't you know?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.340
He has terrible tusks
and terrible claws

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.200
and terrible teeth in
his terrible jaws."

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.840
"Where are you meeting him?"

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.820
"Here by these rocks, and his
favorite food is roasted fox."

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.470
"Roasted fox?

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.720
I'm off," Fox said.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.750
"Goodbye, little
mouse," and away he sped.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.050
"Silly old Fox.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.610
Doesn't he know there's no
such thing as a Gruffalo?"

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.700
On went the mouse through
the deep dark wood.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.290
An owl saw the mouse and
the mouse looked good.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.220
"Where are you going
to, little brown mouse?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.610
Come and have tea in
my treetop house."

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.240
"It's frightfully nice
of you, Owl, but no.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.990
I'm going to have
tea with a Gruffalo."

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.410
"A Gruffalo?

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.710
What's a Gruffalo?"

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.560
"A Gruffalo, why,
didn't you know?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.380
He has knobbly knees
and turned-out toes

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.250
and a poisonous wart on
the end of his nose."

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.410
"Where are you meeting him?"

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:16.370
"Here by this stream, and his
favorite food is owl ice cream."

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.670
"Owl ice cream?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.590
Too-whit, too-whoo, goodbye,

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.630
little mouse," and
away Owl flew.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.370
"Ha-ha, silly old Owl.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.700
Doesn't he know there's no
such thing as a Gruffalo?"

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.000
On went the mouse through
the deep dark wood.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.820
A snake saw the mouse and
the mouse looked good.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:47.330
"Where are you going
to, little brown mouse?

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.910
Come for a feast in
my log-pile house."

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.770
"It's wonderfully good
of you, Snake, but no.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.850
I'm having a feast
with a Gruffalo."

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.490
"A Gruffalo?

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.790
What's a Gruffalo?"

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.790
"A Gruffalo, why,
didn't you know?

His eyes are orange,
his tongue is black,

he has purple prickles
all over his back."

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.400
Where are you meeting him?"

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.120
"Here by this lake, and
his favorite food is

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.640
scrambled snake."

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.390
"Scrambled snake?

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.070
It's time I hid.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:33.670
Goodbye, little mouse,"
and away Snake slid.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.970
"Silly old Snake.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:40.890
Doesn't he know there's no
such thing as a gruffa -- oh.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.890
But who is this creature
with terrible claws

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.040
and terrible teeth
in his terrible jaws?

Oh, help. Oh, no,
it's a Gruffalo."

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.450

sing the Gruffalo song now.

So now we wonder what's going
on, and as you may remember,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:52.790
the mouse has just encountered
the real Gruffalo in the wood.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.170
"I hear a hiss in
the leaves ahead."

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.600
"It's Snake," said the mouse.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.470
"Why, Snake, hello."

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.820
Snake took one look
at the Gruffalo.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.590
"Oh, crumbs," he said.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:39.880
"Goodbye, little mouse," and off
he fled to his log-pile house.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.720
"You see," said the
mouse, "I told you so."

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.800
"Amazing," said the Gruffalo.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.670
They walked some more
till the Gruffalo said,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.350
"I hear a hoot in
the trees ahead."

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.050
"It's Owl," said the mouse.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.450
"Why, Owl, hello."

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.530
Owl took one look
at the Gruffalo.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.090
"Oh, dear," he said.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:06.020
"Goodbye, little mouse," and off
he flew to his treetop house.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.490
"You see," said the
mouse, "I told you so."

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.990
"Astounding," said the Gruffalo.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.880
They walked some more
till the Gruffalo said,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.100
"I can hear feet
on the path ahead."

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.200
"It's Fox," said the mouse.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.350
"Why, Fox, hello."

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.150
Fox took one look
at the Gruffalo.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.770
"Oh, help," he said.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:33.370
"Goodbye, little mouse," and off
he ran to his underground house.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.440
"Well, Gruffalo," said
the mouse, "you see,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.090
everyone is afraid of me,
but now my tummy is beginning

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:44.720
to rumble and my favorite
food is Gruffalo crumble."

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.470
"Gruffalo crumble,"
the Gruffalo said,

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:53.550
and quick as the wind
he turned and fled.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.160
All was quiet in
the deep dark wood.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:05.020
The mouse found a nut
and the nut was good.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.320
[applause].

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.620
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.920
Fantastic.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.440
Okay, here we go.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.100
Oops. Oh, dear.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.020
We are going to sing a
song now based on one

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:22.680
of Julia Donaldson's
little lift-the-flap books,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.310
which is called "It's
a Little Baby."

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.920
So we're going to do some
-- it's an action song,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.210
so we're going to peep through
our fingers, first verse,

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:37.510
then we're going to point,
then we're going to wave, wave,

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.380
and then clap, and
finally dance.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.550
So let's have everybody do
those actions when we sing them.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:50.010
Somebody's hiding, I wonder who.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.560
It's a little baby and
she's peeping at you.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.610
Can you peep, can you
peep, can you peep too?

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.240
Somebody's hiding, I wonder who.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.640
It's a little baby and
she's pointing at you.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.550
Can you point, can you
point, can you point too?

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:18.070
Somebody's hiding, I wonder who.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.560
It's a little baby and
he's waving at you.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.590
Can you wave, can you
wave, can you wave too?

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:32.050
Somebody's hiding, I wonder who.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.450
It's a little baby and
he's clapping for you.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:41.310
Can you clap, can you
clap, can you clap too?

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.760
Somebody's hiding, I wonder who.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.310
It's a little baby and
she's dancing for you.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:55.840
Can you dance, can you
dance, can you dance too?

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.140
Wonderful.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.680
Thank you.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.980
All right, so --

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.280
&gt;&gt; You all did that so well.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We've come to
the end of our livestream,

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.960
so let's do our goodbye song,

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.850
which is the opposite
of the hello.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.080
We're going to wave
and then friends,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.620
wave, friends three times.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.650
Look at your watch.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.320
Say goodbye.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.890
All right.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.670
Goodbye, friends.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.480
Goodbye, friends.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:33.180
Goodbye, friends, it's
time to say goodbye.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.630
Come again.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.310
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
