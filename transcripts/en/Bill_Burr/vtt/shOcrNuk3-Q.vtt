00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.650
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:06.890
Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.530
<v 1>Yeah. Or</v>

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.210
<v 0>just checking in on. Yeah. What's going on? Whoa, whoa. Jesus. The levels,</v>

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.330
the levels. What happened? You know,

6
00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:18.750
one of these days I'm actually going to have like a little podcast room.

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.130
I mean they have one in the all things, comedy studios.

8
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:22.880
I just never get over there.

9
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.970
I never get over there cause I'm a working stiff.

10
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.430
I go to work every day.

11
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.120
I'm in a job in fucking 20 years and I'll tell you right now I didn't miss it.

12
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.970
Oh I didn't miss getting in the fucking car bump up a but dude Lou to right.

13
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.610
I don't think I'll ever get over how fucking awful the drivers are out here.

14
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.360
I just, their complete lack of sense of where their fucking car is.

15
00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:54.310
If one more comment in front of me is going to make a left and they just sitting

16
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:56.760
right in the middle of the link, get over to the fucking left.

17
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.110
So everyone around you can go around you.

18
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.960
I know you've been the guy trying to get around the person.

19
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.370
Did you learn nothing? Obviously you did. Obviously it didn't.

20
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.380
I try, I play like a little game. Like how long can I go before I lose my shit?

21
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.430
Like I could literally just make a great youtube show. If I just put a,

22
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.301
I don't know about great,

23
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:20.380
but it'd be interesting if I just put a GoPro up on the inside of my fucking

24
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:24.970
Prius Dashboard and just, just maybe just call the show. How long can he go?

25
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.110
Right. It'd be like every day. Okay.

26
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:33.550
Bill drives from here to here. Right? I might do this.

27
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.870
Bill drives from here to here, whatever. It's you say the distance and then you,

28
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:39.070
you guys can gamble.

29
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.000
It's like fantasy football without the fucking football and you,

30
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.960
the LVL of an over under how many times is he gonna snap?

31
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.060
Um, or whatnot, you know, already forget the name of the show,

32
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.390
but whatever it could be. It could be interesting to me.

33
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.200
I don't know if it's interesting to Yo and you know,

34
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.560
carbon seen lately that I'm actually, I like,

35
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:05.080
is that Volkswagen GTI?

36
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:08.590
They brought the thing back and every time I peek in creepily into the fucking

37
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:11.440
cars as I walked by, I see that they still have the stick shift.

38
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.730
There's not a lot of those left. That's a great car. Good Bang for the buck,

39
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.950
right? All Frugal freckles yet,

40
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:24.040
God forbid he buys himself something flashy. Um,

41
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.760
I swear to God, you think that I lived in the depression,

42
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.160
always hear like my parents how fucking frugal their grandparents were.

43
00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:35.170
I think it rubbed off on them and then it's on to me.

44
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.800
I'll buy my fucking wife anything, but I won't buy myself shit.

45
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.380
I just won't do what I always get there. I'm going to buy it,

46
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:43.390
I'm going to do it. And I go, Hey, what the fuck am I going to do?

47
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:46.030
And then I'm going to have it and then what they want am I going to do with it?

48
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:47.380
Then it's just going to be sitting there.

49
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.860
It's either going to get dust on it or someone's going to drive into the fucking

50
00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:54.400
side of it. What's the point? You know,

51
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:58.210
a very wise man once told me, you know what true wealth is walking into,

52
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.450
into a mall, being able to buy anything and then you don't,

53
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.380
and it goes into your walkout and you have the freedom of that lack of debt.

54
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.400
And I'll tell you, it's fucking addicting. It really is.

55
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.460
Although recently somebody just gave me a fucking wireless breaker and I was

56
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.100
freaking out about the thing. I actually sinked up my phone to it.

57
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.960
I couldn't believe how great it sounded.

58
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.270
And I was gonna add it into my gym of course, until uh,

59
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.880
the lovely Nia heard out good at sound, she was like, touch it, be on the house.

60
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.400
We should both use it. So I, you know, I got fucked out of that thing,

61
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.930
but, um, so I'm like an ass. So I think it might even told this story on Monday.

62
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:42.100
I was actually texting people, telling them, you got to get a wireless speaker.

63
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.390
The sing is fucking incredible. And every one of my friends wrote me back. Like,

64
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.740
ah, yeah, I kind of bought one of those like five years ago. And it was like,

65
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.880
oh, you know, just, you know, case Shan, you know,

66
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.670
I just, uh, figured it out. You know what?

67
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.580
I'm actually recording this cause my wife's still sleeping and it's her

68
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:03.940
birthday. Bateau doodle [inaudible] right. So I don't want to wake her up,

69
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:08.920
which I probably already did. So, um, I'm in this, uh, how I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

70
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.640
I'm in this room and I have, these are all my old drum.

71
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.020
I can't even say DVDs. Most. Most of these are VHS I bought.

72
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.520
I bought like every instructional fucking video you could, the classic,

73
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:26.521
I got the Tommy Aldridge rock drums soloing and double bass workout.

74
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.000
I got another one, double bass drumming. I don't even know who that is.

75
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:33.400
I don't even play double bass. Uh,

76
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.550
Kenny aronoffs power workout number one and two with the workout booklet.

77
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.040
I got the Carter Beauford one that's a DVD. I get Steve,

78
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.030
get up close. I got the funky drummers who have the

79
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.880
David Garibaldi Tower of groove all Mara Keem let it flow.

80
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.540
The modern drummer festival year 2000.

81
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.760
This is all just drum geek shit. I got fucking everybody. Keith Carlock,

82
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.130
Dennis Chambers, the Drum Basadur, right?

83
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.360
The drummer collective 25th. Oh. Then I got Steve.

84
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.370
Glad up close on DVD and in session two copies of that for some fucking reason.

85
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.990
Jesus Christ. Look at all these fucking things. Modern drummer.

86
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:26.850
What year is that? One, 2008. That's not bad. John Blackwell. Greg Bissonette,

87
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:30.090
I got, I got them all. I got them off. Dave Weckl.

88
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.680
<v 0>Victor Wooten and Carter Beauford. Zoro I got,</v>

90
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.940
I got them all. Got them all. God knows it didn't help, but you know what?

91
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:44.710
I bought them off. Oh, I bought 'em all. Um, by the way.

92
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.850
So recently I said to a buddy of mine, um, I was like, you know what?

93
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.440
I think the best guitar sound,

94
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.840
my favorite guitar sound I ever heard on an ACDC album was the,

95
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.380
for those about to rock album. He was like, really?

96
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:00.290
I never listened to that fucking thing, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

97
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.280
And uh, that was the album that came out right after the back and black album,

98
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.090
which sold, you know, like fucking 90 zillion copies. So they get,

99
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.830
there's nowhere to go after that. Right?

100
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.800
There's no fucking way to go after that. So no matter what you come up with,

101
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:17.660
people are gonna say it's a flop. But I fucking love that album. And um,

102
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.580
and it just so happened Dean del Ray from, um,

103
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.291
oh Jesus,

104
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:29.180
I just spaced on the name of his fuck podcast for those about to talk.

105
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.040
No, let there be talk. And it was one of the ACDC alums.

106
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.960
Um, he, uh,

107
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.900
he sent me this great article on the making of the back and black album and I,

108
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.120
it was so crazy to me because I was old enough when that came out.

109
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.100
Like I remember when back in black came out,

110
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:52.700
I was 12 years old and then dirty deeds came out,

111
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.110
which was actually a bond, Scott. And he was already dead obviously,

112
00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:01.340
and then they released that for whatever fucking reason.

113
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.590
Now looking at it, um,

114
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.600
which is crazy because Bon Scott dies right after the highway to hell album and

115
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.950
ACDC gets Brian Johnson and it's literally like,

116
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.040
if this guy doesn't make it, they go right back to playing pubs.

117
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.070
Who knows what the fuck happens. The band's over.

118
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.650
And they ended up having one of the, you know,

119
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.060
just basically eight back and black album sold. Um,

120
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.010
more copies than anything probably other than like Michael Jackson thriller or

121
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.730
Pink Floyd, the wall, not the wall, the dark side of the moon, whatever. Jesus.

122
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.960
Bill, get to the point here.

123
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.030
So you think the last thing you would fucking do is after you've established a

124
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:46.031
new fucking singer is then put out some old shit by the last guy who's now dead.

125
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.080
So the, the fucking new guy has to reestablish himself all over again. Um,

126
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.920
I never really even thought about that cause I just loved everything that they

127
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:57.590
did. And I remember, um,

128
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.420
being confused of why back in black, the back,

129
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.710
the guy on back in black sounded so different on dirty dates cause there was no

130
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:08.180
fucking information back then.

131
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:12.510
There was no internet shit just came out and you're like, oh, another ac DCM.

132
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.040
Then you'd put it on, you had no fucking idea, especially at 12.

133
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.990
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

134
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.870
And then for those about the rock came out after that.

135
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.980
So this is great article talking about all of that and how that was Atlantic

136
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:25.371
records,

137
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:29.870
they thought AC DC was a flash in the pan and they thought the back and black

138
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:32.480
album, I don't know how the fuck you make an album is great as that.

139
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.610
You don't think that they have anything else left in the tank.

140
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.110
So they were like going,

141
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.850
well let's strike while the irons hot and they fucking put out dirty deeds and

142
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:44.750
the band didn't want them to. It had been released, I believe in Australia.

143
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:49.751
And then also in a and m England under a different fucking name.

144
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:54.950
I forget. I used to know all this shit when I was super fucking ACDC nerd. Um,

145
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.100
and also I hadn't talked on a cell phone for 20 years, so I had a memory. Um,

146
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.120
but then for those, about the rock came out,

147
00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:03.710
I remember this fucking kid in gym class going, look, you newish,

148
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.930
you show them those boats rock. I was like, I haven't heard yet.

149
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:10.490
You just fucking shocks. I remember thinking like, what do you mean?

150
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.200
I don't think it sucks. I like that album. You know,

151
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.680
I like the first song and I find I never bought the album because he told me

152
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:21.360
that it sucked until years later I found just like,

153
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:24.780
fuck this man, I'm going to buy this album. And um,

154
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.000
to this day I still listen to that. Like when I go downstairs, you know,

155
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:34.830
walk right into my garage with my fucking gym. Right. Which is so awesome.

156
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.750
That's what I play. That's what I've been playing lately. And uh,

157
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.060
it's fucking hilarious. Like I literally, when I go to my gym now,

158
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.410
which is just like back in the day when I lived in my parents house and I just

159
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.830
would go down to the basement and I would play either appetite for destruction,

160
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.460
the whole fucking album. I used to play that whole album, lift to it,

161
00:09:56.461 --> 00:10:00.180
and then I would go play drums to it or whatever, whatever album I was into,

162
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.840
I would lift weights to the entire album and then I would play drums to it or

163
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:07.890
try to. So I'm in the middle of doing that yet. Uh,

164
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:12.570
yesterday it was fucking a, you know, venician day,

165
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.810
your favorite fucking day, the only only fucking exercise.

166
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.190
You really keep track of what weight you putting up. And I had a flashback.

167
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:23.910
I fucking, I was half asleep, you know, right in all day.

168
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.790
And I'd try to get to workout in before I go into the writers room so I don't

169
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:30.300
become a fucking fat pasty fuck. And um,

170
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.670
so I had the 40 fives on either side, right. I do a set and then I was going,

171
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:41.150
I thought I grabbed tens right to just do one 55 and I w I wasn't paying

172
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:45.750
attention and I picked it up off the Barnes like, wow,

173
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:46.950
this feels really fucking heavy.

174
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:48.900
And I just brought it down on my chest and I was like,

175
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.090
and I couldn't lift it back. I grabbed 25, so I went up to one 85, which,

176
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:56.730
you know, I mean, when you get, that's a lot of weight for me. I mean,

177
00:10:56.731 --> 00:11:00.210
that's more than what I waste. So I'm sitting there,

178
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.720
I get it on my chest and knee is asleep and I'm going near B and I can't get it

179
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:06.540
off.

180
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.530
It took me back to the days when I was living at home with my parents and I'd be

181
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.870
gone, mom, mom, and she'd be gone.

182
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.220
I'll be down there and I'd be down there like with fucking like, you know,

183
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.970
one 85 one 90 sitting on my fucking pacey chest trying to get it off 200 pounds.

184
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:26.070
It was always like, I was always trying to get up to that, but I was just,

185
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:29.880
I'm a middleweight man. Like seriously, if I wasn't such a fucking booze bag,

186
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:35.180
like I probably should wait like between one 61 65 instead of a buck 80 but that

187
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.480
lasts 50 pounds up telling you is nothing but Scotch and pizza. Right.

188
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.810
So I got this shit sitting on my chest and I'm like, holy fuck I,

189
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.770
I didn't have the clips on it, but I didn't want to fucking,

190
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.750
I didn't want to dump it off to one side.

191
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.560
You know when you do that and then you get fucking whipped around because a,

192
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:55.810
I was worried I was gonna fly into the mirror, right.

193
00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.280
So I ended up having to roll the thing down, like back in the day.

194
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.990
And there's that brutal part where it gets right on your fucking hip bones and

195
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:07.510
then you gotta do the little up and over your junk.

196
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.040
And before all the weight rests on your fucking thighs.

197
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.283
Oh, it's the worst.

198
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.430
I hadn't done it so long and the closer it gets to your knee caps and then

199
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:20.530
finally you got to do that fucking thing where it just,

200
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:25.270
it just scraped your knee bones and then boom hits the floor. And um, yeah,

201
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:28.630
I did that as a a 47, soon to be 48 year old man.

202
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.530
That was my fucking yesterday morning. I love the hole in this wall.

203
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:33.130
Isn't that great?

204
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.620
You know why I liked the hole in the wall and I'm looking at right now is I can

205
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.810
see the copper fucking pipe that I had put in there.

206
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.430
Finally going to get this fixed, get this fucking room painted. Then that's it.

207
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.240
Then all I need to do is Redo the kitchen and then it's a brand new fucking

208
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:51.070
house. It's the house that it should have been that it used to be, you know,

209
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.310
then I'll probably put it on the market and a,

210
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.890
I'll take it for like a $400,000 loss.

211
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.680
<v 3>Ooh.</v>

212
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.790
<v 0>Buy a house. People. It's a great investment. I'm such a fucking Weirdo.</v>

213
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:08.820
Even though I'm going to lose money on this fucking house. I actually,

214
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.300
well I guess, uh, I guess I may never sell it. I won't. Right. Um,

215
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:17.790
what I like about it, what I did to the house is I actually,

216
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.531
this is going to be weird.

217
00:13:19.531 --> 00:13:22.140
I feel like a sense of responsibility when you own a fucking house,

218
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.680
you know that the next person should get it and they should be like,

219
00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:28.890
you know what an appreciate the lead of the last guy he pocket did this. Right.

220
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.640
He kept it nice. You know, you ever see an old guy with an old car,

221
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:37.530
but he kept it nice, still get it nice and fucking waxed and all of that shit.

222
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.210
And everybody goes, okay, that guy, like I was raised fucking right. You know,

223
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.300
that's what I'm hoping the next people are gonna think. But I know they're not,

224
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.160
they're just gonna come in here and do fucking blow and fuck hookers and you

225
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:53.100
have some goddamn kid running around with a fucking crayon and ruin all this

226
00:13:53.101 --> 00:13:54.870
shit. Not even appreciate that.

227
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:59.130
I got the fucking door locks fixed and there's a little skeleton key in there

228
00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:02.040
and you can lock all the doors like it's 19, 23. Again,

229
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.360
you know when you're going to have Charlie Chaplin over for some fucking non

230
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:10.050
genetically altered fucking horse meat burgers or whatever the fuck they used to

231
00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:14.490
eat back then. Um, anyways, uh,

232
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:17.760
I need to get glasses. By the way. I gotta do that. Um,

233
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.010
I get to get my physical here so I can, uh,

234
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.530
I told you what the pilot's license every two years. I got it. I don't,

235
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:26.790
I don't think I'm going to pass the eye exam. And, um,

236
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.910
I was actually thinking about it like, uh, I could probably get away with it,

237
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.130
you know, I could probably one more time get away with it. And it's like, Bill,

238
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.470
do you really want to be like 1300 feet off the ground?

239
00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:38.430
Getting Away with something? What are we doing here?

240
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.320
Why don't we try to get our fucking priorities straight, you know,

241
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.700
and make it fucking happen. Um, so I'm going to go get some and uh,

242
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.850
I know I'm going to look like a fucking sex offender.

243
00:14:50.851 --> 00:14:54.110
So already gonna be funny to me. Um, actually you know something,

244
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:58.220
you know who did a joke like that was a Ari Shaffir so I got to give them credit

245
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:01.040
even though that's, um,

246
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.710
that might have been like lifting a joke that that's exactly what I would look

247
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:03.891
like.

248
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:07.730
But then it just made me flash back when he shaved his head and he was talking

249
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:09.530
about, hey, he couldn't have his glasses on.

250
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.560
Cause if you put him on and he looked like a sex offender, see that?

251
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.390
That right there is why I don't like watching other people's acts because the

252
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:20.600
shit just rolls around in your head and all of a sudden it just puts one in the

253
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:23.480
chamber. Um, anyways,

254
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.740
plowing ahead here. Uh, did anybody, uh,

255
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.730
anybody listen to the Michael Rappaport podcasts? I am Rapaport.

256
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:36.731
I called in to his podcast and we talked some sports and uh,

257
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.660
you know, he ended up wanting to put money on game seven. All right.

258
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.810
Bet a steak dinner. And um,

259
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.510
I took OKC and he took, uh, the warriors. I forget what the spread was,

260
00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:52.610
but I just didn't feel like it was enough points.

261
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.140
I didn't feel comfortable with the bed.

262
00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:57.290
It was like seven or something like that. I just said, you know what?

263
00:15:57.291 --> 00:16:00.350
Bump it up to eight. You bump it up to eight, you give me eight points,

264
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:05.270
I'll take OKC. And he goes, all right, you know, bet. And you know what?

265
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.990
Bam right there, Fred fucking eight points.

266
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.740
It's exactly what the spread was, dude, I fucking called it.

267
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.170
So we didn't work out what a, what a what a push would be like, who would win?

268
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.650
So now we're a, we've bet the NBA finals, I took the Cleveland Cavaliers,

269
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.030
he took, uh, the Golden State Warriors. So it's a,

270
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.850
can't even say double or nothing cause nobody won the first one. So, um,

271
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.640
I don't know. That's always a great bet. You know, steak dinner.

272
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.850
It's not going to break the bank and then you get to go out and, uh,

273
00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:39.100
even though it's costing you money, you get a stake out of it, right?

274
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.600
Some bad when you say, alright, let's plow ahead here.

275
00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:48.400
Let's do a little bit of a read some advertising here for this lovely Thursday

276
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.330
afternoon. Ruby, the receptionist, okay,

277
00:16:52.331 --> 00:16:53.650
this is gonna be some fucking robot,

278
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.540
like the baseball kid moment at the baseball kid,

279
00:16:57.541 --> 00:17:01.320
the baseball kid at baseball's words you own to do the baseball kid,

280
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.160
we'll phd you. And it was literally like the, for the only child,

281
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.310
everybody always said it's for the kid with no friends. It's no,

282
00:17:08.311 --> 00:17:13.050
it's for the kid with no siblings. Cause even the kid with no siblings, I mean,

283
00:17:13.051 --> 00:17:16.950
no friends still had, still had a brother or sister. It'd be like, Hey,

284
00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:19.830
could you, uh, if everybody kind of hates me at school,

285
00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:24.120
could you earth throw the barber? Is there anything worse than that?

286
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.830
How mean kids are to each other? It's fucking brutal. But I'll tell you,

287
00:17:28.831 --> 00:17:33.210
you know what? It ends up producing some great comedians. You know,

288
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:38.010
some psychos driven to fucking take their app to the next level.

400
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.360
Because no one wants to get up off the couch and God damn it,

401
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:35.510
if a woman is born beautiful and all she's gotta do is walk around with her ass,

402
00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:38.990
jacked up in a tits, jiggling around a fucking office. And next thing you know,

403
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.600
she's got a beautiful home to go home to, right?

404
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.480
Cause some rich guy goes in there, go, you know what?

405
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:48.110
I'd like to stick my billionaire Dick between those tits and well,

406
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.890
what's wrong with that? And then meanwhile, so fucking, you know,

407
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.300
half for Leprechaun jerk off like me can come in and I got something to look,

408
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.360
look at while I'm waiting for the fucking doctor to finally come in and figure

What is wrong with that? You homely fucking haters of beautiful women.

411
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.500
God bless him. God bless them for just showing up and looking good. You know,

412
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.990
giving you some to rub one out too. You know,

413
00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.480
everything serves a purpose in life. Like right now,

414
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.360
if you some broad and you listen to me,

415
00:25:23.361 --> 00:25:27.740
I'm probably motivate you to go write some paper maybe in Portland, you know,

416
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.100
we all serve a fucking purpose.

417
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:36.360
Can't we just let the whores be whores? You know,

418
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.590
there's a reason that word exists. All right. And I, you know,

419
00:25:40.591 --> 00:25:45.150
I guess because men are running shit that sometimes there's fewer options,

420
00:25:45.151 --> 00:25:47.040
but give me a fucking break. You know what I mean?

421
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.470
It would be great if everything was lip like even, you know what I mean?

422
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.120
Everything was just fair and the best got the fucking job right.

423
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.700
But that's never going to happen because we're human beings.

424
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.490
And that includes those feminists who don't want it equal.

425
00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.350
They just want it better for them. Right.

426
00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:06.030
That's why they're only talking about women.

427
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.250
They're not talking about the poor kids that so together their bedsheets,

428
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.440
unless they go to boll and branch. Oh, that little call back to the advertising.

429
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.100
All right, let's just say it was free, not free.

430
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.840
Let's just say everything was fucking even,

431
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.080
are you really going to tell me that they wouldn't still be that chick running

432
00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:26.220
around? Just fucking blowing people cause she enjoys it. Why can't she just,

433
00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:30.860
you know, why can't she have a good time? Don't you judge a you home?

434
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.110
We hate her of a cock. Gobbler Huh?

435
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.420
I don't even want, I'm talking about, I'm just filling up time here.

436
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.460
Oh would you look at it at 26 minutes in 26 minutes in and I'm for my lady to

437
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:48.770
wake up. I've got a couple of nice gifts. Couple of right there.

438
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.593
Fred's Huh?

439
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:55.170
I'm a big fan of buying your wife like something that she wears,

440
00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.510
you know, cause the more shit that you buy her that she wears clothes,

441
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.920
necklace, jewelry, any of that bullshit, the more that shit that you buy her,

442
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.530
the bigger chance she's going to be wearing it.

443
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.430
When she's bitching at you about something and all you do is you just put your

444
00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:13.260
eyebrows up and then she's ran, ran, ran,

445
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.890
you just point to whatever you bought or you know,

446
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.450
stop some right in their tracks.

447
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.780
Well let's say you've got something on your wrist. Said, what is that?

448
00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.820
And then the first they looking at what did I, did I put my arm in something?

449
00:27:25.821 --> 00:27:29.030
No, no, no. Right there on your wrist. And then they just looked down.

450
00:27:29.031 --> 00:27:31.630
Then they realize what you're doing. Then they just go out, fuck you.

451
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.330
And then you laugh and it's over. You laugh and then it's over. Right.

452
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.870
And you go over and you do a couple of Jaeger bombs, Albert, your fucking bar.

453
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.080
You'd be like, what? Man? You're drinking too much.

454
00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:43.370
And then you point to their airings.

455
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.630
What if there's something on the side of the fence? Oh fuck you. Yeah,

456
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.200
it's great.

457
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:53.200
And then you get another round telling you all you assholes who are hiding your

458
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.680
booze in the back of your fucking toilet. Just ease off on the booze.

459
00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.200
Buy Your wife a couple of things that she's going to be wearing.

460
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.090
Then you can drink in public like a man. You know Jesus fucking Christ.

461
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:06.970
<v 6>Okay</v>

462
00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.090
<v 0>Jesus. You know, imagine being that big of a drunk that you're actually like,</v>

463
00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:14.530
cause that's so fucking cliched. You know it's also brilliant too.

464
00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.820
You know the first guy who did it cause he keeping it nice and chilled,

465
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.380
right? Taking it up the back.

466
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.720
Oh God. What a fucking, how unhappy is that God damn life.

467
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.040
Your wife just sitting there fucking yammering at you and you're going,

468
00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:36.770
oh my God, this I, I don't think I can get through this. You know?

469
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.600
And she thinks she gets some sort of weak bladder. You just keep going in there,

470
00:28:40.601 --> 00:28:44.460
you know, taking the little cork out,

471
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.220
taking a swig like a fuck it pirate

472
00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.760
mean you got to flush the toilet like you dropped another dose. Oh my God.

473
00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.790
I guess if you're an alcoholic you probably eat better, right?

474
00:28:57.791 --> 00:28:59.620
You just keep eating veggies all the time.

475
00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.280
So no one will get wise to the fact he had a little bottle back there.

476
00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.560
I really don't even know what I'm talking about right now.

477
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:09.730
All I know is that the Pittsburgh Penguins,

478
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.870
the knee breakers, they're up, uh, two games to none.

479
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.500
What a fucking story that's going to be if they win. I'm tell you right now,

480
00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.870
I don't know what the fucking odds were, but nobody,

481
00:29:19.871 --> 00:29:23.320
people even in Pittsburgh didn't even put money down. And if they did,

482
00:29:23.321 --> 00:29:24.910
they just did it because they loved their team.

483
00:29:24.911 --> 00:29:26.560
But nobody at the beginning of this season,

484
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.440
there's no Pittsburgh penguin fan that said, you know what,

485
00:29:29.441 --> 00:29:32.710
the penguins are going to make the fucking Stanley Cup final.

486
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.700
They're gonna make the finals, they're gonna make the Stanley Cup final. And,

487
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.340
uh, they're going to go up two games to none.

488
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.530
There's not one person that one parami a Panini,

489
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:46.060
whatever the fuck that place is called,

490
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:48.910
where they stick the French fries and like fucking your breakfast and your

491
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:53.350
dinner in between those buns. Right? There's nobody standing down there,

492
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.450
right. With the giant fucking back roll. You know,

493
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.460
Pittsburgh's big on that man.

494
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:05.440
People guys sit down at bars and you just got like those just softball size

495
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:09.660
chunk of fucking Lard, you know, just protect. It's like the,

496
00:30:09.661 --> 00:30:11.500
the kidney airbag, right?

497
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.800
It's sitting there. Right. And you know, that's not a set,

498
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.620
it's a fucking trifecta. Cause once you got those,

499
00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:23.410
then you got the fucking bud crack and that's what you got.

500
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.280
That's what you see when you go into those fucking places. And you know,

501
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:31.060
Pittsburgh's not the only place that goes, hey, you know,

502
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.400
we all like burgers and fries. You know, we all like a sandwich with fries,

503
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:39.340
but it isn't an annoying that, you know,

504
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.120
you got to hold the sandwich in one hand and then pick up the fries with the

505
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:43.480
other.

506
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.390
Wouldn't it be great if you could just have them all between the sandwich.

507
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.651
You know what I mean?

508
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:51.310
So you can just shove it down your fucking throat as you dial in another fucking

509
00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:55.660
pizza. You know, calling up dominoes as some shit.

510
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.300
They're not the only ones who do that. There's a,

511
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.720
there's a bunch of fucking places around the country that do it.

512
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.590
And I'm telling you, whenever you go into those places, it's, I'm telling you,

513
00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:07.110
you see the kidney airbags,

514
00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:11.890
those giant fucking hamhocks just hanging. I mean, literally like,

515
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.000
I swear to God, people in Pittsburgh, I'm telling you, like 40% of them,

516
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.260
you could literally take an aluminum bat and just fucking whacked him in the

517
00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.520
right in that back fat.

518
00:31:21.521 --> 00:31:26.521
And it would take them like probably a good 30 seconds before they turned around

519
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.680
you. They felt it in eight seconds, but they got to get all,

520
00:31:29.681 --> 00:31:33.160
they got to get the momentum to turn that torso around.

521
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:38.110
And all you gotta do is just stay outside of their meat hooks. But it's,

522
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.020
cause I'm telling you, if anybody from Pittsburgh gets their hands on you,

523
00:31:41.021 --> 00:31:41.854
it's fucking over.

524
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.860
They're going to pull you into that mass and you're just going to be

525
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:48.140
claustrophobic, like remember word just yet. You're going to,

526
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.850
they're going to drown you and their fucking man tits. I'm telling you,

527
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.380
the army tourists die a year just accidentally.

528
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.470
They go to Pittsburgh for a fucking pirate game where the most beautiful

529
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:01.060
stadiums ever, right?

530
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.780
One of those fucking ham hock Pittsburgh fatties gets a little too drunk.

531
00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:08.680
They lose their fucking equilibrium and they just fall. You know,

532
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:11.470
you ever see like when they go to detonate a building and it doesn't fall right

533
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.830
or some jerk off goes to cut down a train and lands on his own house.

534
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:19.420
That's what happens except the houses a tourist and the trees have fatty from

535
00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:22.300
Pittsburgh. All right. I don't know what I'm saying. All right, that's it.

536
00:32:22.301 --> 00:32:26.990
That's the podcast. Just checking in on you. All right, here's some music. Uh,

537
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.960
enjoy this. I don't know what the fuck it's going to be.

538
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:30.610
I don't handle this aspect of it.

539
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.110
And then we then you can listen to the last half hour, be a,

540
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:39.120
some podcasts from a year ago and buy from the same Frankel Douche that you're

541
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:42.440
listening to now. You have been listening to the Thursday afternoon,

542
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:44.600
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.

543
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.610
I hope you all have a wonderful weekend. You [inaudible] and um,

544
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.750
I hope San Jose wins. Not The whole series. I just, I just need seven games.

545
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.240
This is nothing against Pittsburgh. I was just breaking your balls.

546
00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.340
It's just that this is when like the panic, my sports panic starts settling in.

547
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:05.780
Like, Oh my God, the hockey season's over and VA's over.

548
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.630
It's just baseball, baseball, baseball.

549
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.610
That dog days of fucking baseball on the red sox are in first place too.

550
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:17.540
I love to get into it. Oh by the way, month of May,

551
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.410
the cigar count all freckles. I only had one.

552
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.980
I only had one last three months and I said I'd have two a month this year.

553
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:28.880
I had two in January, two in February, two and a half. Cause one wasn't lit.

554
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:32.330
Right. But I don't count that one. Fuck that. Two. Two had one in March,

555
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.470
one in April, one in May. So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

556
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:42.050
I like that. That's not bad. Now we're not going to discuss my drinking though,

557
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.940
cause I'll tell you it's off the fucking

558
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.083
<v 5>see you.</v>

559
00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:00.783
[inaudible]

560
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.653
the

561
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.443
[inaudible] this Guy

562
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.553
[inaudible] [inaudible] haven't yet

563
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.010
<v 7>going on. It's still birth.</v>

564
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:56.970
It's the Monday morning podcast that I am doing on Tuesday at 1120 in the

565
00:34:57.911 --> 00:34:59.470
morning, east coast time.

566
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:04.870
Fucking believe that we're going gonna be slipping. You know,

567
00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.410
no excuse. Actually, I do have an excuse.

568
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.870
It was my girlfriend's birthday yesterday. So, uh,

569
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.170
I was being a great boyfriend.

570
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:16.510
Paying attention to her and someone had to suffer. You know what I mean?

571
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.143
Like a threesome.

572
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:24.190
Someone always feels left out no matter how much you try to pay attention.

573
00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.990
My kid and I never had a threesome before. I couldn't have one once.

574
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:30.460
I think twice.

575
00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.600
The first time I didn't realize that it was going down.

576
00:35:34.601 --> 00:35:39.570
I was so young and stupid. I was actually there and I was thinking,

577
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:44.070
why won't her roommate leave? You know, the fuck.

578
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.570
And it wasn't until like literally seven years later I went, oh, wait a minute.

579
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.600
She wasn't leaving cause fuck. And then the other time,

580
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:58.130
uh, I was right there on the table. And, uh,

581
00:35:58.131 --> 00:36:01.370
one girl was absolutely gorgeous and the other one,

582
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.410
uh, was not gorgeous. Let's put it that way,

583
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.330
was so not gorgeous that she eclipsed the beauty of the other one.

584
00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:18.140
You know, so, so then you go, hey,

585
00:36:18.141 --> 00:36:22.640
you learned something about me right off the damn bat. Okay.

586
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.170
Oh, what does, this is what we're gonna do,

587
00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.980
do this week on the podcast if you guys are new to this shit, a new to my page,

588
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.940
um, I do one of these every goddamn week.

589
00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.890
And people asked me questions and I try to answer them. And other than that,

590
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.753
I babble.

591
00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:44.680
I give you information about my life and, uh,

592
00:36:44.681 --> 00:36:48.640
and that's it. I'm fucking, I have it all right. I drank last night. Okay.

593
00:36:48.641 --> 00:36:51.190
I was celebrating conviction,

594
00:36:51.191 --> 00:36:53.950
went to this God damn restaurant in New York and went to Bible.

595
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.900
And I'm big fan of Mario Batali, but I liked Lupa better.

596
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:03.910
Baba was just too, it was too, uh,

597
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:07.540
what, uh, my talent was not sophisticated enough. Right.

598
00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:10.420
I'll take the blame chooses Christ.

599
00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:15.250
It was like regular dishes with shit you'd never eat.

600
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:20.890
I had beef cheek, Ravioli. Yeah.

601
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.820
Once you fucking take that in for a minute. All right. And they had, you know,

602
00:37:24.821 --> 00:37:27.760
they had like pheasants face fucking Lasagna.

603
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:34.560
It was always like half what you would heard of like goose liver,

604
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:39.500
a fucking souffle. So I don't know.

605
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:44.480
It was, they was good, but a Lupa is the shit.

606
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:47.900
That's the one that I liked. That's got like a fucking, you know,

607
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.030
regular animals,

608
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:54.650
body parts that you eat mixed in with fucking a Rigatoni.

609
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.700
Oh, what the fuck are you going to do? You know? Yeah. You try shit.

610
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.000
You know, she wanted to go there. I fucking took it there.

611
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:10.230
And that's what happened. I ate two cupcakes for breakfast.

612
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.093
What are you think about that?

613
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.880
It was sitting there leftover from the party and I said,

614
00:38:14.881 --> 00:38:16.260
that's a great way to start my day.

615
00:38:16.261 --> 00:38:20.130
Let me give myself 9,000 calories of straight sugar.

616
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.520
It was unreal. It was like I did an eight ball.

617
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.220
That's where ate the two cupcakes for 20 minutes.

618
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:29.550
I was just sitting there thinking, how fucking great I wasn't. I'm like,

619
00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:33.270
I'm fucking awesome. I could do anything I want.

620
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.890
I'm fucking the greatest.

621
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.920
And 20 minutes later when the sugar started wearing off, oh my God.

622
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:43.920
I started pulling the drapes closed, laying in here like, uh, I dunno.

623
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:49.940
I Dunno. Don't ever start your day with fucking two, two cupcakes.

624
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.480
FTE had a beef.

625
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.640
She fucking Ravioli beef cheek. I was like, cheek like the ass.

626
00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:02.240
You being cute. They're like, no, they actually know what,

627
00:39:02.241 --> 00:39:04.460
I didn't have the fucking balls to ask him. I didn't want to know.

628
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.090
I was eating somebody's face meeting the Yech face. Yeah.

629
00:39:08.091 --> 00:39:12.380
Let me get the Yak taint red goon. Um,

630
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.370
all right, let's continue with the, uh,

631
00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:19.510
the continuing story of American Airlines. If you listened to my, uh,

632
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:24.370
my podcast last week, uh, these cheap ass motherfuckers at American Airlines,

633
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.270
uh, you know, they alligator armed the fucking right food up in first class.

634
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:30.363
You know what I mean?

635
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.600
They had 20 people in First Class and they made five onwards and next thing you

636
00:39:34.601 --> 00:39:39.430
know I was eating a bowl of total open Nebraska. Actually, no,

637
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:42.310
that's not what happened. Steve, a quick synopsis. I said,

638
00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:44.560
fuck you and your honeycomb cereal.

639
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:47.440
This is first class and I don't get a Goddamn Mama. I don't want anything.

640
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:51.130
I said all of that with a little less anger and no curses.

641
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.500
So a few seconds later the guy came back.

642
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:56.950
All of a sudden magically he has an outlet and I'm like, where did you get that?

643
00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.640
And he informed me that the pilots said he already ate so I could have his

644
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:05.080
onwards. And I was like, I don't want his fucking Omelet. I want my omelet.

645
00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.680
All right, I don't want to starving pilot. You know,

646
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.660
passing out up there, seeing bogeys leaning forward on the Goddamn yoke,

647
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:15.580
whatever you call it. All right.

648
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:22.380
So I sent them a letter and this is the letter that they sent back to me and I

649
00:40:22.961 --> 00:40:23.771
swear to God, you know,

650
00:40:23.771 --> 00:40:28.771
back in the day if something like this ever happened and you actually wrote a

651
00:40:29.141 --> 00:40:32.670
letter you prefer at least they give you a free airline ticket. And I'm,

652
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.820
when I say back in the day, I mean like 2005, 2006.

653
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.420
Now they don't give a shit. They just keep apologizing profusely.

654
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.940
This is a dumb ass letter they sent back to me.

655
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.600
I'm only going to read you part of it because they just keep saying the same

656
00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:49.510
thing over and over again. Okay. I think I got the hiccups.

657
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:53.620
Like I have sugar hiccups from stuffing down to cupcakes.

658
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.740
Hang on a second. Just from service. Hello? Yeah,

659
00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:02.350
I'm going to check out about like 15 minutes. Okay.

660
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:08.140
Thank you Jesus. They didn't say anything. She said hello?

661
00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.360
I said, yeah, I'm gonna check out 15 minutes.

662
00:41:10.361 --> 00:41:14.230
At which point she could have said, okay. Or older overlay, you know.

663
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.720
But no, she just closes the door. All right. Okay.

664
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:24.000
Here's the fucking, uh, what do we got here? This is still here. This is,

665
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.430
this is the letter that American Airlines sent me. Okay, dear Mr Burr,

666
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:29.920
thank you for contacting American Airlines.

667
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.130
It's our privilege to respond to your message. Okay. First of all,

668
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.790
right there. They already pissed me off. Okay. Don't,

669
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.450
don't start with off with your fucking stock line.

670
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:42.800
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

671
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.600
<v 7>Like your Jackie Gleason, you know, thank you for writing as in a way we go,</v>

672
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:50.930
you know, a little shoving off the buffalo. Uh, okay.

673
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.890
I'm very sorry to hear of your disappointment with us and regret that you did

674
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:58.460
not receive your preferred entree when you traveled with us in the first class

675
00:41:58.461 --> 00:41:59.900
cabin. Uh,

676
00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:04.190
sales soul assists because we want your travel experience or improving premium

677
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:06.460
cabins to be truly something special.

678
00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.880
We do our best to cater our entree selections so that we can serve each customer

679
00:42:12.251 --> 00:42:16.570
the entree they prefer. This is the part which is just complete bullshit.

680
00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.290
Okay. They want to make sure that they serve the entree that I prefer, you know,

681
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.070
and yeah, you can do that. Bringing up fucking eggs on the flight.

682
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.430
This is what they write to do.

683
00:42:27.431 --> 00:42:30.740
So we determine which entrees are selected most often.

684
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.650
It's often and provision accordingly. That's,

685
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.360
that's such fucking bullshit.

686
00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:43.270
But then they watched Jurassic Park when Jeff Goldbloom did his little rant

687
00:42:43.271 --> 00:42:44.350
about chaos theory.

688
00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.290
You think cause you'd take 10 flights or a hundred flights and you figure out,

689
00:42:50.291 --> 00:42:52.240
oh you know, seven people want the Omelet

690
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.330
and you know, nine people want something else. That sucked. Bullshit.

691
00:42:57.331 --> 00:42:59.370
First of all, nobody wants to fucking cereal.

692
00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:00.510
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

693
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.850
<v 7>no one wants cereal at first-class. Okay?</v>

694
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:04.050
<v 3>Okay,</v>

695
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:07.930
<v 7>you fucking dropped $1,500 or whatever the hell is 800 and $1,500 on tickets.</v>

696
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.950
You want something [inaudible] substance. I'm sick of bitching about this.

697
00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.430
Oh I know. It was in the end of it. I ended up flying fucking a middle seat.

698
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.400
The fucking Dallas and all I got was a $150 voucher,

699
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:24.070
which will pay for one third. They didn't give me anything Mr. Barrier.

700
00:43:24.071 --> 00:43:27.340
We are not unmindful of the inconvenience of you. Well,

701
00:43:27.341 --> 00:43:29.890
how the fuck would you be on Michael? I wrote your goddamn letter.

702
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.480
As hard as we are trying to deliver on respecting your time by operating our

703
00:43:34.481 --> 00:43:38.470
flights as scheduled. It just wasn't possible this time. Again,

704
00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:43.450
we apologize for the disruption of your travel plans. We're not giving you shit.

705
00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.520
Please sly with us again soon.

706
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:50.860
We'll do our best to get you to your destination as planned.

707
00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.710
Really, you're going to do your best. That's what you can give me.

708
00:43:53.711 --> 00:43:57.460
American Airlines. Well, Gee, you know, we're going to try.

709
00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.080
That's a comforting attitude to have when they're going to be flying the fucking

710
00:44:02.081 --> 00:44:06.790
36,000 feet off the goddamn ground. Oh, do I sound like a camp this week?

711
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.020
So that's basically it. That's, that's the, uh,

712
00:44:11.021 --> 00:44:14.380
the next level that they've taken it to where it used to be like, okay,

713
00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:18.250
we fuck you over. And the stewardess gives you a hand job. You know,

714
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:22.840
that was 1975 and in the 80s, it was, you know,

715
00:44:22.841 --> 00:44:27.460
we'll give you a free ticket and a skinny Michael J. Fox tie. But those things,

716
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.410
you know, when you had the little spiked out mullet and uh,

717
00:44:31.411 --> 00:44:33.660
they had lasted for a good 20 years and uh,

718
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.600
somewhere in the last four or five years it became a,

719
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:39.420
we're going to fuck you over. Read back, go fuck yourself.

720
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.700
What do think about that? Go Fuck Yourself.

721
00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.800
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

722
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.120
<v 7>299 other people on the plane that didn't fit in complaint. What do you do?</v>

723
00:44:48.121 --> 00:44:51.690
Take the train. It's going to take him nine days to get to New York.

724
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:55.050
Go Fuck Yourself. Do you know you're coming back? It's just eggs.

725
00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.570
You know yourself know what? They got me over God damn barrel sons of bitches.

726
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:04.660
What am I going to do? Fly ATA, you know Nina fucking,

727
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:06.440
yeah,

728
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.910
I don't know what in a goddamn chicken from actually I think ATA recently went

729
00:45:10.911 --> 00:45:14.870
out of business. You have a fly in airline and then you know, you're like, Eh,

730
00:45:14.871 --> 00:45:17.750
you know, it was kind of weird flight. You know, there was a crack in the uh,

731
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.590
inner window. Okay. Actually that happened to me on ATA was one of the windows,

732
00:45:21.591 --> 00:45:24.740
you know, they got like the, they got the, the double pane of glass,

733
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.360
they got the, the one on the outside,

734
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:30.950
the outside of the plane and then they have the one, uh, on the inside,

735
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.060
the extra level one.

736
00:45:32.061 --> 00:45:36.080
And that one was cracked and I believe it was a little bit of water in there.

737
00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:40.490
And I said to the, to the stewardess, I was like a woman,

738
00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.580
there's a fucking crack in the God damn window over here.

739
00:45:43.581 --> 00:45:47.690
I'm afraid I'm going to get sucked out once we get above 6,000 feet. She said,

740
00:45:47.691 --> 00:45:50.240
it's like I felt kind of like glass.

741
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.050
No. So I didn't feel bad when they went out of business.

742
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:57.750
Now I kind of feel bad because now there's no, there's no other option.

743
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.070
I guess that's my interruption.

744
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:03.720
Do I sit there and I take it on American Airlines and they go, go fuck yourself.

745
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.630
All right, we're going to give you a brand muffin.

746
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.940
I hope you brought some water.

747
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.230
Or I fly another airline when their inner window is cracked and no one thinks

748
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.203
it's a concern.

749
00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.813
<v 3>Okay.</v>

750
00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.780
<v 7>Tanner winters crack. Well that's, that's all we got. Two of them. Alright,</v>

751
00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.700
this podcast is just a cluster fuck. Um,

752
00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.770
let's get to some podcast questions that I didn't even,

753
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.860
I didn't even have the time to fucking look at this week. Actually.

754
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:34.380
That's not true. I went to look at them and somebody,

755
00:46:34.381 --> 00:46:36.330
I don't know what's going on with my, my space page.

756
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:38.650
I don't know if anybody else has had this problem, but, uh,

757
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:43.310
I ended up able to really add anybody for about a year. You know,

758
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.620
every couple of days they'll get about 45 requests, I'll accept them.

759
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:52.020
And then a day later I have 47 people taken off my page. And it's like,

760
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:56.820
really? We're all those people spammers. I don't know what's going on. So, uh,

761
00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:00.630
I'm having somebody look at my account. The only question I can remember,

762
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.360
I can't even remember. It was something about fucking, uh,

763
00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:11.730
you know, what movies do I find scary? Um, well, you know what,

764
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:14.490
if you turned my flight on American Airlines into a movie,

765
00:47:14.491 --> 00:47:19.020
I would've found that fucking scary. Um, what movies do I find scary?

766
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:22.830
Anything that involves a crazy woman? Um,

767
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:24.610
<v 3>I think</v>

768
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:29.610
<v 7>the scariest movies when I first got cable and the early eighties when I had a</v>

769
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.100
tight jeans and a pony high tops that just met the bottom of my jeans and no one

770
00:47:36.251 --> 00:47:40.360
complained because somehow you could get away with that back then. Um,

771
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:45.850
I remember the first Friday, the 13th, when Jason came up out of the lake,

772
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:50.750
that scared the shit out of me. And there was another one. Here's the,

773
00:47:50.751 --> 00:47:54.100
here's one for you. Okay. I got a podcast question for you guys.

774
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
There was a movie I saw late night cable and I can't remember what the fuck it

775
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:02.974
was,

776
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:09.350
but it somehow there was somebody skating across the pond in slow motion with an

777
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.710
ax. And I believe for some reason the, uh,

778
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.410
the monster I'm picturing is, is from that. I know this isn't it,

779
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:23.070
but the picture of my mind is, uh,

780
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.280
what does that monster book where the wild things are?

781
00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.920
I remember what those monsters look like in my memory.

782
00:48:29.921 --> 00:48:34.750
That's what the monster look like. Skating across the fucking lake. Uh,

783
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.440
and I know it isn't that, but I know somebody, what do you, what am I,

784
00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:43.360
14 listeners out there has to be a fucking horror or a film, uh,

785
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.550
whatever the, what do you call someone's really into horror films. Like d? Yeah,

786
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:53.380
exactly. A horror film. Fucking Dick. There was that one. And uh,

787
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.520
there was another one I was just thinking of and I just sat up and I can't

788
00:48:57.521 --> 00:48:59.680
remember it. I'm getting an echo fucking age.

789
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.740
I literally just moved my brain a little bit. The thought just went away.

790
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.660
Wait a second. What the fuck was I just thinking? Let me lay back down.

791
00:49:07.661 --> 00:49:10.150
Let me see what will come back to me. Okay. I was talking about, we've,

792
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.400
we gotta go back in time, you know, I was talking, okay.

793
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.820
The lake wild things are,

794
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.370
see the side of my brain works. It works linear. Once I go past the moment,

795
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:24.610
I can't go back. It's like a fucking traffic jam.

796
00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.350
What the fuck was I trying to think of

797
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:34.150
that shit. I don't know. Oh, I got it. Bam. There we go. Um,

798
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:40.120
dark night of the scare crow. I like the old horror movies.

799
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:41.381
Okay. This is what,

800
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:45.130
you know what I don't like about new horror movies that they would,

801
00:49:45.131 --> 00:49:48.040
that CGI shit, they,

802
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:53.190
they can do so much insane stuff with computers that they forgot how to build

803
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:58.690
suspense. The old ones they used, they used to build it up.

804
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:03.430
They used to build up the moment where the monster was going to jump out at you

805
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.880
because they had to because it was just a guy in a rubber fucking suit,

806
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.480
you know what I mean? But now that they could, they can, you know,

807
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:16.330
they can make it look like Godzilla's stepping on New York.

808
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.940
They forgot how to build, dispense.

809
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:22.810
That's what I don't like about fucking horror movies now. And that's a,

810
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.180
I think Japanese, I don't know,

811
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.760
everybody over in Asia seems to know how to fucking do that,

812
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:32.360
but nobody over here does. Even like the, like, like thrillers,

813
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.090
whatever the fuck that, whatever a goddamn thriller is like, take that,

814
00:50:38.091 --> 00:50:42.470
that movie a perfect storm. They had that God damn big wave,

815
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.120
that's all they showed in the trailer.

816
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:47.930
So everybody goes out to run out and see it and then they don't develop any of

817
00:50:47.931 --> 00:50:52.220
the goddamn characters because the point that I don't give a fuck about anybody

818
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:55.040
in the movie. So by the, by the end of the movie,

819
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.070
I'm actually praying for the wave.

820
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:03.500
I can't wait for them to kill George Clooney and Mark Walberg and all those

821
00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:05.930
other guys cause I don't give a fuck about their characters.

822
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:08.270
Cause if they haven't done anything to make me give a fuck,

823
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.860
they just had a couple people speaking Boston accent and you stick them on a

824
00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:14.450
tugboat and I'm supposed to give a shit.

825
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:20.190
They're going to die trying to get lobster. Um,

826
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:26.730
I'm just in a bad mood. I'm going to bet fucking mood today. I'm like,

827
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.450
you know what it is is to God and don't ever start your day with two fucking

828
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.560
cupcakes. It seems like such a great, you know, such a great idea, you know,

829
00:51:33.561 --> 00:51:36.230
like, oh I'm eight years old. This is what you'd want to do.

830
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:41.000
But your parents never loved you, you know, and now I'm 39 and 51 weeks.

831
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:45.650
And finally the dream that I thought was going to happen,

832
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:51.530
you know, oh it did happen. And it just doesn't play out. Right. Oh my God.

833
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:52.550
How did I forget this shit?

834
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.880
I know why I forgot it cause I have fucking two cupcakes where the sugar and my

835
00:51:55.881 --> 00:52:00.350
brain, I actually had a crazy week. How crazy was it bill?

836
00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:05.660
Um, I flew into New York on Wednesday. I did opie and Anthony Opening,

837
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:08.930
Anthony Ob and Anthony show Thursday morning.

838
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.980
Then I did my show at Caroline's in New York Thursday night.

839
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.760
I got up Friday morning, got on a plane, flew back to la.

840
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:21.440
I did the guys' choice awards on a spike TV,

841
00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.240
men, all these famous people. They were all cool. I had a great time.

842
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.600
I met Nikki six I was way more thrilled and the after party was at the fucking

843
00:52:32.631 --> 00:52:36.890
playboy mansion. And I know what you're thinking. Oh my God.

844
00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.820
Playboy fucking mansion. That must have been unbelievable. Um,

845
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:41.660
I quickly realized when I got there,

846
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:44.000
there's two kinds of parties at the playboy mansion.

847
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:49.030
There's the your famous and you can come by Wednesday afternoon and actually

848
00:52:49.131 --> 00:52:50.990
meet the broads that are in the magazine.

849
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.550
And then there's the one that I went to where it's like, yeah,

850
00:52:55.551 --> 00:52:58.280
why don't you guys all just stand on my, in my backyard?

851
00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:05.270
I literally thought I was going to show up to the mansion. Right.

852
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:08.510
It was going to be like me and eight other people and just, you know,

853
00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:12.380
for playboy bunnies eats just rubbing on my chest. Hey man, you're a big boy.

854
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:18.410
I heard your comedian now. They just had, they had the,

855
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:23.210
it was definitely the beat team of Playboy bunny. You know,

856
00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:25.420
they had the little bunny suits on the rabbit ears,

857
00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.330
but let me tell you something. They were, uh,

858
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:32.610
they would grade a hooter girls and he could tell there was three of them who

859
00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:35.100
were clearly being paid to frolic in the pool.

860
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:40.580
And any girl with bunny ears had like nine guys around her was a fucking sausage

861
00:53:41.071 --> 00:53:45.000
fest. And this is the funny thing. Nobody was hitting on them.

862
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:48.510
They was standing there with the fucking cameras out,

863
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.390
taking pictures like, uh,

864
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.930
like they were Disneyland and they ran into Donald Duck or something.

865
00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.760
It was pathetic. And uh, you know,

866
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:03.000
you have no was roped off with his three fucking girlfriends,

867
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.930
83 years old man guy. It was the shit that was the only thing I wanted to do.

868
00:54:06.931 --> 00:54:10.370
I just want to go in there and shake his hand and uh,

869
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:15.240
then immediately stick my hand in bleach to get the unbelievable smell of 50

870
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:20.100
years of pussy off of my hand. And uh, then fly back.

871
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:25.260
But he was busy. I understand. He had to meet a famous fucking people.

872
00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:29.790
So, uh, but still still shit. And then I flew back the next day,

873
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.860
six in the fucking morning, I landed in New York at about four 30. I got my bag,

I went over to Caroline's and I did three fucking shows, you know,

875
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.950
and then I went out drinking afterwards.

876
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:45.000
