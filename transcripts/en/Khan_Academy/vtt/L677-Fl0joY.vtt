00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.020
- [Voiceover] We already have an overview video of DNA

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.910
and I encourage you to watch that first.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.220
What I want to do in this video is

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.220
dig a little bit deeper.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.650
Actually get into the molecular structure of DNA.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.690
This is a starting point.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.250
Let's just remind ourselves what DNA stands for.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.890
I'm gonna write the different parts of the word

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.320
in different colors.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.030
It stands for deoxy.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.459
Deoxyribonucleic.

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.859
Ribonucleic.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.109
Ribonucleic acid.

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.189
Ribonucleic acid.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:36.619
So I'm just gonna put this on the side

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.219
and now let's actually look at the molecular structure

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.219
and how it relates to this actual name,

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.079
deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.119
DNA is just a junction for nucleic acid

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.659
and it's the term nucleic that comes from the fact

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.859
that it's found in the nucleus.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.789
It's found in the nucleus of eukaryotes.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.189
That's where the nucleic comes from

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.489
and we'll talk about in a second

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.389
why it's called an acid but I'll wait on that.

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:04.519
Now each DNA molecule is made up of a chain

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.109
of what we call nucleotides.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.419
What we call nucleotides.

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:13.459
It's made up of nucleo, nucleo,

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.019
nucleotides.

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:17.089
What does a nucleotide look like?

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:18.389
Well, what I have right over here

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:21.519
is I have two strands, I've zoomed two strands of DNA

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:24.429
or I've zoomed in two strands of DNA.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.889
You could view this side right over here

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:29.789
as one of the, I guess you can say

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.519
the backbones of one side of the ladder.

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:34.259
This is the other side of the ladder

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.189
and then each of these bridges,

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.659
and I will talk about what molecules these are.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.219
These are kind of the rungs of the ladder.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.419
A nucleotide, let me separate off the nucleotide.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:48.119
A nucleotide would...

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.419
What I am cordoning off,

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.909
what I am cordoning off right over here

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.589
could be considered,

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:57.819
could be considered a nucleotide.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.189
That's one nucleotide

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.189
and then it's connected to another.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.632
It's connected to another nucleotide.

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.709
Another nucleotide right over here.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.419
On the right hand side we have a nucleotide,

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.459
we have a nucleotide right over there

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.919
and then, actually I want to do it,

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.659
let me do it slightly different.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:27.459
We have a nucleotide right over here on the right side

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.019
and then right below that we have another.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.719
We have another nucleotide.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.659
We have another nucleotide.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.559
Depicted here, we essentially have four nucleotides.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.489
These two are on this left side of the ladder,

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.759
these two are on the right side of the ladder.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:42.919
Now let's think about the

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.559
different pieces of that nucleotide.

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.289
The one thing that might jump out at you

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.189
is we have these phosphate groups.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.789
This is a phosphate group right over here.

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.919
This is a phosphate group right over here.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.789
Each of these nucleotides have a phosphate group.

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.659
This is a phosphate group over here

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.619
and this is a phosphate group over here.

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.919
Now the phosphate groups are actually what make DNA

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.689
or actually what make nucleic acid an acid.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:09.549
You might say, wait, wait.

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.779
The way you've drawn it Sal,

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.159
you have a negative charge.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.019
Something with a negative charge would attract protons,

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.519
it would sap up protons.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.759
How can you call this an acid?

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.319
This actually looks more basic.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.519
The reason why its DNA is typically drawn

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.959
with these negative charges here

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.139
is that it's so acidic and that if you put it in

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.689
into a neutral solution,

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.889
it's actually going to lose its hydrogens.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.619
Actually the DNA if we actually want to be formal about it,

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.119
the DNA molecules would actually have

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.849
its phosphates protonated like this

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.679
but it so badly wants to lose these hydrogen protons

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:45.579
so it typically would be, let me draw it like this.

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.379
Let me get rid of the negative charge just on this one.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.189
Whoops.

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.189
Just on this phosphate group over here.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.519
If you get rid of the negative charge

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.259
and if this was bounded,

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.859
this is bonded to a hydrogen.

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.359
This so badly wants to grab these electrons.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.209
These oxygen can grab these electrons

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.719
and then these hydrogen will just be grabbed

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.709
by another water molecule or something

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.719
so the proton will be let go.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.869
That's why we call it an acid.

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.159
If it wasn't in a solution it would have the hydrogens

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.199
but it would be very acidic as soon as you put it into

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.589
a neutral solution it's going to lose those hydrogens.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.719
The phosphate groups are what make it,

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.049
are what make it an acid

00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:24.319
but it's confusing sometimes

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.889
because usually when you see it depicted,

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.419
you see it with these negative charges

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.719
and that's because it has already lost its hydrogen proton.

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.819
You're actually depicting the conjugate base here

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.019
but that's where it gets its acidic name from

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:38.319
because it starts protonated

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.219
or it gets in this acid form, it's protonated

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.979
but it readily loses it.

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.419
And so that's why it has its,

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.259
that's where it gets the name acid form from.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.249
Each of these nucleotides they have a phosphate group.

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.689
Now the next thing you might notice,

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.319
the next thing you might notice is.

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:56.859
The next thing you might notice is

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:58.419
this group right over here.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.089
It is a cycle, it is a ring

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.889
and it looks an awful lot like a sugar

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.459
and that's because it is a sugar.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:09.119
This sugar is based on, it's a five-carbon sugar.

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:12.779
What I have depicted here, this sugar, this is ribose.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.459
This sugar right over here is ribose.

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:19.489
This is when it's just as a straight chain

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:22.159
and like many sugars, it can take a cyclical form.

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.079
Actually it can take many different cyclical forms

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.159
but the one that's most typically described

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.319
is when you have that.

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.579
Let me number the carbons

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:30.089
because carbon numbering is important

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:31.379
when we talk about DNA.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.679
But if we start carbonyl group right over here

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:36.659
we call that the one carbon or the one prime carbon.

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.489
One prime, two prime, three prime,

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:43.589
four prime and five prime.

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.219
That's the five prime carbon.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.279
You form the cyclical form of ribose

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.009
as if you have the oxygen.

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.319
You have the oxygen right over here

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.019
on the four prime carbon.

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.219
It uses one of its lone pairs.

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.189
It uses one of its lone pairs

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:02.319
to form a bond.

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.319
To form a bond with the one prime.

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:08.519
With the one prime carbon

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:09.219
and I drew it that way

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:10.619
because it kind of does bend.

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:12.519
The whole molecule's going to have to bend that way

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:13.859
to form this structure.

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:15.359
And then when it forms that bond

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:17.989
the carbon can let go of one of these double bonds

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.319
and then that can, then the oxygen,

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.459
the oxygen can use that.

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:24.859
The oxygen can use those electrons

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:28.279
to go grab a hydrogen proton from some place.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.049
To nab on to a hydrogen proton.

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:32.919
When it does that you're in this form

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.589
and this form, just to be clear of what we're talking about,

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:38.019
this is the one prime carbon.

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:42.519
One prime, two prime, three prime,

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:47.869
four prime and five prime carbon.

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:49.319
Where we see this bond,

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.489
this is the one prime carbon.

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:51.959
it was part of a carbonyl.

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:55.019
Now it lets go of one of those double bonds

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.419
so that this oxygen can form a bond

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:57.889
with a hydrogen proton.

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.189
It let go of a double bond there

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:04.889
so that this could form a bond with a hydrogen proton.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.989
This hydrogen proton is

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:08.889
that hydrogen proton right over there

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.189
and this green bond that gets formed

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:14.149
between the four prime carbon and

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:15.989
or between the oxygen that's attached

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:19.579
to the four prime carbon and the one prime carbon,

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:20.759
that's this.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.389
That's this bond right over here.

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:25.289
This oxygen is that oxygen right there.

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:27.859
Notice, this oxygen is bound to the four prime carbon

00:07:27.859 --> 00:07:30.419
and now it's also bound to the one prime carbon.

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:32.759
It was also attached to a hydrogen.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.109
It was also attached to a hydrogen

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:35.289
so that hydrogen is there

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.159
but then that can get nabbed up by another

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.159
passing water molecule to become hydronium

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.959
so it can get lost.

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:44.789
It grabs up a hydrogen proton right over here

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:46.919
and so it can lose a hydrogen proton right there.

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.119
It's not adding or losing in that net.

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:52.349
You form this cyclical form

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:53.689
and the cyclical form right over here

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.419
is very close to what we see in a DNA molecule.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:59.389
It's actually what we would see in an RNA molecule,

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:01.119
in a ribonucleic acid.

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:02.249
And so what do we think we're talking about

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:05.659
when we say deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:07.919
Well, you can start with you have a ribose here

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.259
but if we got rid of one of the oxygen groups

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:11.589
and in particular one of...

00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:13.509
Well, actually if we just got rid of one of the oxygens

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:16.749
we replace a hydroxyl with just a hydrogen,

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:18.819
well then you're gonna have deoxyribose

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:20.226
and you see that over here.

00:08:20.226 --> 00:08:22.189
This five-member ring,

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:23.919
you have four carbons right over here.

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:25.719
it looks just like this.

00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:28.489
The hydrogens are implicit to the carbons,

00:08:28.489 --> 00:08:29.589
we've seen this multiple time.

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:33.458
The carbons are at where these lines intersect

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:35.318
or I guess at the edges or maybe

00:08:35.318 --> 00:08:39.649
and also where these lines end right over there.

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:41.619
But you see this does not have an...

00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:44.889
This molecule if we compare these two molecules,

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:47.389
if we compare these two molecules over here,

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:50.319
we see that this guy has an OH,

00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:53.119
and this guy implicitly just has...

00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:54.749
This has an OH and an H.

00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:58.189
This guy implicitly has just two hydrogens over here.

00:08:58.189 --> 00:08:59.819
He's missing an oxygen.

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:02.249
This is deoxyribose.

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:04.359
Deoxyribose.

00:09:04.359 --> 00:09:06.889
Deoxyribose doesn't have this oxygen.

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:08.859
It does not have the oxygen

00:09:08.859 --> 00:09:10.679
on the two prime carbon.

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:14.119
So this if you get rid of that, this is deoxyribose.

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:16.049
So let me circle that.

00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:19.389
This thing right over here,

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:22.600
this thing right over here, that is deoxyribose.

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:26.289
Deoxy or it's based on deoxyribose

00:09:26.289 --> 00:09:28.819
I guess before it bonded to these other constituents.

00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:32.289
You could consider this deoxyribose.

00:09:32.289 --> 00:09:35.519
That's where the deoxyribo comes from

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.189
and then the last piece of it,

00:09:37.189 --> 00:09:42.459
the last piece of it is this chunk right over here.

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:45.589
These we call nitrogenous bases.

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:47.559
Nitrogenous.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:49.789
Nitrogenous.

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.889
Nitrogenous bases.

00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:53.859
You could see we have different types of nitrogenous bases.

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.419
This is a nitrogenous base.

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:59.359
This right over here is a different nitrogenous base.

00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:02.089
This right over here is another different nitrogenous base.

00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:04.549
Notice, this one only has one ring, this one has one ring,

00:10:04.549 --> 00:10:05.859
this one has two rings.

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:09.489
This one over here has two rings

00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:10.619
and we have different names

00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:11.859
for these nitrogenous bases.

00:10:11.859 --> 00:10:14.789
The ones with two rings, the general categorization

00:10:14.789 --> 00:10:17.189
we call them purines.

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:20.319
Nitrogenous bases if you have two rings,

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:23.540
if you have two rings we call them purines.

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:26.189
That's a general classification term.

00:10:26.189 --> 00:10:28.059
Let me make sure, purines.

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:29.519
If you have one ring.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.389
Anyway, I'll just write this way.

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:31.889
One ring.

00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:34.189
One ring, we call these pyrimidines.

00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:35.840
Pyrimidine.

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:38.119
Pyrimidines.

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:39.589
We call these pyrimidines.

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:41.459
These particular, these two on the right,

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:42.759
these two purines,

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:44.689
this one up here this is adenine,

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:46.089
and we talk about how they pair

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:47.919
in the overview video on DNA.

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:50.559
This one right over here is adenine,

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:52.019
this nitrogenous base.

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:54.989
This one over here is guanine.

00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:57.289
That is guanine.

00:10:57.289 --> 00:11:01.789
And then over here, over here,

00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:05.619
this single ring nitrogenous base

00:11:05.619 --> 00:11:08.919
which makes it a pyrimidine, this is thymine.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:12.119
This right over here is thymine.

00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:14.659
This is thymine and then last but not least

00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:15.619
if we're talking about DNA,

00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:18.119
when we go into RNA, we're also gonna talk about uracil.

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:19.319
But when we talk about DNA

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:21.689
this one over here is cytosine.

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:24.059
Cytosine.

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.519
You could see the way it's structured.

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:28.259
The thymine is attracted to adenine.

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:29.789
It bonds with adenine

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:32.689
and cytosine bonds with guanine.

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:34.119
How are they bonding?

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:37.319
Well, the way that these nitrogenous bases

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:38.709
form the rungs of the ladder,

00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:41.659
how they want they're drawn to each other,

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.589
this is our good old friend hydrogen bonds.

00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:45.959
This all comes out of the fact,

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:48.079
that nitrogen is quite electronegative.

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:50.689
When nitrogen is bound to a hydrogen

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:52.159
you're going to have a partially

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:54.819
negative charge at the nitrogen.

00:11:54.819 --> 00:11:56.919
Let me do this in green.

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:57.919
You're going to have a partial

00:11:57.919 --> 00:11:59.459
negative charge at the nitrogen

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:02.559
and a partially positive charge at the hydrogen.

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:04.189
And then oxygen we've always talked about

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:05.259
as being electronegative

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:07.689
so it has a partial negative charge.

00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:09.619
The partial negative charge of this oxygen

00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:11.289
is going to be attracted to the partial

00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:13.619
positive charge of this hydrogen,

00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:17.589
and so you're going to have a hydrogen bond.

00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:19.519
That's then going to happen between this hydrogen

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:20.559
which is going...

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:23.419
Its electrons are being hogged by this nitrogen

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:26.499
and this nitrogen with who,

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:28.389
which itself hogs electrons.

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:31.789
That forms a hydrogen bond.

00:12:31.789 --> 00:12:34.089
And then down here you have a hydrogen

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:35.819
that has a partially positive charge

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:37.979
because its electrons are being hogged.

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:39.419
And then you have this oxygen

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:40.919
with a partially negative charge,

00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:42.409
they're going to be attracted to each other.

00:12:42.409 --> 00:12:43.859
That's a hydrogen bond.

00:12:43.859 --> 00:12:46.219
Same thing between this nitrogen and that hydrogen,

00:12:46.219 --> 00:12:48.849
and same thing between this oxygen and that hydrogen.

00:12:48.849 --> 00:12:51.719
That's why cytosine and guanine pair up

00:12:51.719 --> 00:12:54.159
and that's why thymine and adenine pair up,

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:55.789
and we talk about that as well

00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:59.069
in the overview video of DNA.
