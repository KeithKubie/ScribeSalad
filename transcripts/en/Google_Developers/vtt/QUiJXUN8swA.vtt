MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.680
Welcome to "Root Access,"
the show on Google Developers

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.770
Live about startups.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.030
My name is Martin Omander,
and I'm joined here

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.839
by Don Dodge, longtime
investor and startup advocate.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:18.380
Welcome, Don.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.505
DON DODGE: Thanks
for having me back.

00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:20.680
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.960
So lots of good
viewer questions.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.820
We'll go into one specific
question this episode

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.900
about pricing.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.810
Macovei Vlad-- I'm sorry if
I butchered your name-- asks,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.650
what should be the
factors determining

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.910
the initial price of an app?

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.930
And if a correction
is needed, what

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.680
should be the
transition strategy

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.110
to a lower or a
higher price point

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.579
without upsetting current or
future potential customers?

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.620
DON DODGE: Good question.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.540
There's actually
two questions there.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.720
So the first one is, how do
you determine the initial price

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.450
point?

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.080
Look at the competition,
and if you're

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.160
competing against an
entrenched competitor,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.690
then you want to
price under them.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.840
So, say, 10% to 20% under
the entrenched competitor.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.600
If there aren't
entrenched competitors,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.160
then there are alternatives.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.480
Like there might not be
a product or service that

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.390
is exactly like yours, but
there's always an alternative.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.640
If there's a need there,
they've figured out some way

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.170
to solve the problem.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.700
Maybe it's not as elegant as
your solution or as efficient

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.150
as your solution, but
there are ways to do it.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.400
So you have to look
at how are users

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.680
solving the problem today?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.200
And how much are they
paying to do that?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.590
And if they switch to
your product or service,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.560
how much additional productivity
or gains are they getting

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.080
so that they'll perhaps pay
more than the existing solution?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.770
So that's two ways to look
at how to price your product.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.600
Either against the competition
and come in a little lower,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.720
or against the alternatives
that may be inferior

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.466
and price a little higher.

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:12.770
MARTIN OMANDER: OK.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.980
So then you get
your initial price,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.450
and pretty soon you'll discover
that you weren't spot on.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.130
You will need to change it.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.170
What are the strategies
for going up or going down?

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.030
DON DODGE: Good question.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.500
My experience is
it's easier to go up

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.247
in price than it is
to go down in price.

00:02:33.247 --> 00:02:34.330
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh really?

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.788
I thought it would
be the opposite.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.550
Everybody likes
something cheaper.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.494
DON DODGE: Except the customers
who already paid for it.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:41.285
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh.

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:45.810
DON DODGE: So if you take
your product out at a price,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.491
say $100, and customers
pay $100 and you

00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:51.490
start getting customers.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.410
But you're not getting enough,
and then you lower it to $75,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.940
well, now you've alienated
all of those customers who

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.900
paid $100.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.370
They're going to be angry.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.300
You've disrupted the
value proposition

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.620
that you had going in.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.950
So now where are you
versus the competition?

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.760
And so you need to
think very carefully

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.630
before lowering the price.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.800
It's easier to come into
the market at a low price

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.450
and then raise the
price higher and higher.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.200
The reason for that
is that typically when

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.090
you raise the price, you're
giving additional features.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.060
So you're making
the product better,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.230
you're making it scale better,
you're making it faster,

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.540
you're having
additional features.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.430
There's more value
there, so customers

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.490
are willing to pay more money.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.640
So in my experience,
it's always easier

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.637
to go up in price
than it is to go down.

00:03:49.637 --> 00:03:50.470
MARTIN OMANDER: Hmm.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.720
Interesting.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.350
About that freemium, there's
a lot of talk about freemium.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.500
Is that the way to go, to have
a free tier and a premium tier?

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.120
DON DODGE: Yeah, that's
a great way to go.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.930
Because the idea behind
freemium is that if it's free,

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.690
you'll get a big
user base and lots

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.000
of network effects and feedback
from users that are free,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.190
and that's OK.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.180
And then you have a premium set.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.810
That's where the "emium"
in "freemium" comes from,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.630
the premium set of features that
they'll be willing to pay for.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.740
So that's a great way to go.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.580
And then that allows you to have
the free, or low price, option

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.610
and the higher priced
premium option.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.040
You can also do that
with no freemium model.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.290
You can just have a
base product that's

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.740
$100 and an advanced
product that's

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.760
$150 and a pro
product that's $300.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.190
So there are lots of ways
to do packaging and pricing,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.115
and you don't need to be tied
down to any particular model.

00:04:59.115 --> 00:05:00.490
MARTIN OMANDER:
And you shouldn't

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.150
be too afraid to get it wrong,
because you can change it.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.270
DON DODGE: Right.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.890
Exactly.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.400
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.190
Macovei also brings
up a great question.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.547
What about ads?

00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:11.380
That would be great.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.320
Then I don't have to
charge any of my users.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.120
DON DODGE: Oh, so an
ad supported model?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.250
MARTIN OMANDER: Ad
supported model, yeah.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.150
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.110
Ad supported model
was very, very popular

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.380
about 10 years ago,
five years ago.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.200
Lots of web content companies,
where viewing the content

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.960
was free and it was
ad supported or--

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.346
MARTIN OMANDER: I started one of
those that crashed and burned.

00:05:36.346 --> 00:05:39.320
DON DODGE: Well, it's
a very good model.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.212
Google itself is ad supported.

00:05:41.212 --> 00:05:42.170
MARTIN OMANDER: Mm hmm.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.130
DON DODGE: So Google is
an ad supported model.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:53.500
But ad supported sort of assumes
that you have a huge audience.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.170
Lots and lots of page views,
lots and lots of users.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.960
Because when you do the
math on how many page views

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.410
you need to make a million
dollars in revenue through ads,

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.105
it's billions of page views.

00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:11.630
I mean, it's significant.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.870
So you have to have a
pretty significant audience

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.220
to make ad supported
alone work well.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.900
Remnant ads-- and typically
remnant ads or run of the house

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.240
ads that aren't that targeted,
those are the kinds that sell

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.300
for $0.10 CPMs-- CPM
means cost per 1,000--

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.030
or very low kinds of prices.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.080
No one's going to make a
lot of money doing that.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.450
Conversely, if you're using
Google AdWords or AdSense,

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.570
those are very
targeted ads, so you

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.250
don't need billions
of page views.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.290
You just need a very targeted
audience and an advertiser

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.200
who's willing to pay a very
significant cost per 1,000

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.210
or a cost per click rate because
you have a targeted audience.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.935
So those are the two ways
to look at ad supported.

00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:15.320
It's if you have a
very targeted audience

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.050
where you can use Google
AdWords and command

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.180
pretty high cost per
click rates, that

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.060
can work very, very well.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.830
If it's a CPM kind of run of
the house remnant inventory,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.706
you better have billions of
page views to make that work.

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:34.070
MARTIN OMANDER: Billions.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.365
That's a big number.

00:07:35.365 --> 00:07:36.400
DON DODGE: It is.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.550
But there are lots
of websites out there

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.130
that do have that kind of
traffic and can make that work,

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.700
and that aren't
solely ad supported.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.900
Ad supported is one of
the revenue streams,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.900
and it can be significant.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.980
So you need to look at
your product, your users,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.500
your audience to see whether
ad supported will work

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.987
as the sole revenue source
or as one component of it.

00:08:01.987 --> 00:08:04.320
MARTIN OMANDER: So when I see
ads all over the internet,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.470
a lot of that is just people
generating incremental revenue

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.462
on top of what they
would otherwise?

00:08:10.462 --> 00:08:11.170
DON DODGE: Right.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.710
Yeah, typically it's a nice way
to have an incremental revenue

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.240
source.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.780
But it's not what their whole
business is predicated on.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.410
So it's a nice little
revenue stream,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.767
but probably not going
to make you rich.

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:24.850
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, great.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.070
Thanks Don.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.045
DON DODGE: Thank you.

00:08:27.045 --> 00:08:30.540
MARTIN OMANDER: Macovei, I hope
that answered your question.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.520
