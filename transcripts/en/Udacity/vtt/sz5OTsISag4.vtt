00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Promoters are typically found in front of

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.804
the transcription initiation site. Though, they don't

00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:12.180
always have to be. This serves an obvious purpose as a landing platform for all

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.288
the proteins that come together to initiate

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:18.648
transcription at this spot here. Remember, in the

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:21.588
cellular world proteins make the world go

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:25.370
round. Now there's a generic class of proteins

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.510
referred to as transcription factors. Which are just proteins

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.390
that bind DNA and regulate the initiation of transcription.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.300
As you can imagine, many of these proteins, many

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.660
of these transcription factors, essentially bind in this promoter region.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.390
And physically regulate the initiation of transcription via chemistry.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.460
Now, not only can these proteins interact with the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.830
DNA of the promoter region. But they interact with

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.560
each other as well. You can sort of see that

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.370
depicted here. They're all bound to one another.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.560
And through these many interactions, they're able to

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.960
facilitate the overall outcome for this particular gene.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.260
Now, although this is ultimately chemistry. We become pretty

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.700
good at representing chemistry with our letter symbols.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.990
Let's imagine that one of the transcription factors

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.620
up here, one of these proteins, is actually

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.780
binding to a very specific sequence here in the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.190
DNA. TGACGTCA. Let's just say there was a change in this sequence here so that

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.810
this G is missing, there's a small deletion, let's say. And now the sequence

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.900
reads TGAC-TCA. Do you think this change

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.520
in the DNA sequence at a promoter region

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.530
would result in the transcription factor binding

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.890
more tightly, less tightly, or not at all?
