00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.600
NETO MARIN: Hi, I'm Neto.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.350
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Hi, I'm Jessica.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.183
NETO MARIN: And we are
both from the Actions

00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:11.750
on Google Developer
Relations team.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.587
And we are here today to
introduce you a new series.

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:16.170
We are very excited
about this series.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.850
It's Behind the Actions, right?

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.170
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yay.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.870
NETO MARIN: So what is
this about, Jessica?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.010
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So
the Behind the Actions

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.145
is all about deep dives
into building for Actions

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:24.663
on Google and Google Assistant.

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:26.080
And so today, we're
actually going

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.070
to be starting with the basics.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.550
NETO MARIN: Nice.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.850
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And we're going

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.632
to be building our first action.

00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:30.340
NETO MARIN: Cool.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.840
Cool.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.280
So we've got to go through
[INAUDIBLE] understanding

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.600
where they should start, right?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.725
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Mm-hmm.

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:38.798
NETO MARIN: And until we are
actually testing a real device?

00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:41.340
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah, on a
Home, which will be super fun.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.040
NETO MARIN: Oh, nice.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.210
Yeah, this is very good.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.290
This is cool.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.720
And like I said, this is a
new series we are starting.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.550
If you have any
comments, feedback

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.220
please let the comments below.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.710
And also, follow us on Twitter.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.780
We have the Actions
on Google handle.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.510
In general, we post about
new blog posts, events

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.885
that we are going,
announcements.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:01.718
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Other videos like these.

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:03.370
NETO MARIN: Other
videos like this.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.560
So we are waiting
for your feedback.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.330
And let's start building.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.690
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So what
are we building, first of all?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.270
NETO MARIN: The idea today
is more, for example, build--

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.820
in this case, going to build
the Lucky Number Calculator

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.100
[INAUDIBLE] think about.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.290
You can tell me
your favorite color.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.170
And based on that, we
complete your number.

00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:24.700
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So the action

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.753
is going to, I'm
assuming, greet me.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.420
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.200
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: And ask
me what my favorite color is?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.470
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.762
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: And then
me, as a user, I tell you,

00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:33.190
my favorite color's purple.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.550
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.008
And then based on
this color, we're

00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:37.025
going to make some
AI machine learning--

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:37.350
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.670
NETO MARIN: No, no.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.170
I'm kidding.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.765
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.860
It's just counting the
number of letters in the word

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.270
and then calculate something.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.430
But before we jump
into this cold,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.200
there are some three
elements we must

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.390
understand when you are
developing for the Google

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.540
systems.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.030
I think the first one would be
the Google Assistant itself.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.072
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.680
NETO MARIN: And we can
say that the platform--

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.080
like, for example, it's where
your action going to live.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.010
So when you try to talk
with your Google Assistant,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.032
your action will be downloaded.

00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:06.490
And then you'll be
able to interact

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.930
with the Google
Assistant, the device

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.009
with the Google
Assistant built in.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.800
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.320
You don't even have
to download it.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.840
It's already available once
it's out in production.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.563
And so Google
Assistant's all about

00:02:15.563 --> 00:02:17.730
that conversation users can
have with Google, right?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.980
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.490
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And so you're

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.920
going to be able to talk
to it and be able to invoke

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.700
our action that we're building.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.075
NETO MARIN: Our
actions, exactly.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:25.795
And there's several devices that
have Google built in, right?

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:26.920
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.085
NETO MARIN: So I remember
some very cool headphones,

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:30.290
the new headphones you can wear.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.990
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Those are so cool.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.777
NETO MARIN: You also
have TV is already

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.360
working on Google
systems, so we don't

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.430
need to memorize the
number of the channel.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.180
So just say, hey, turn
on the sports and say,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.038
you can watch this--
something like that.

00:02:42.038 --> 00:02:44.080
But also have some other
formats, right, Jessica?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.785
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, laptops.

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:46.573
NETO MARIN: Home, of course.

00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:47.260
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Home Mini.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.600
NETO MARIN: And we'll have the
[INAUDIBLE] recently announced.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.395
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Oh, those are gorgeous.

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:50.680
NETO MARIN: They are great.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.090
Yeah.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.007
I have in the kitchen.

00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:53.460
I like to play
with my kids that,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.835
because they can
say some stories

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:56.460
and they can watch there.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.340
It's very cool.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.090
To make calls, for example.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.830
So it's very nice, very nice.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.330
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Definitely.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.830
Definitely.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.920
NETO MARIN: And
then as a developer,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.820
we can use this platform
and extend this platform

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.017
to our own apps.

00:03:09.017 --> 00:03:10.600
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And in this world,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.610
apps-- we call them actions.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.060
And so we're going to be
using the term actions.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.317
And that-- it's similar to
an app on any other platform.

00:03:18.317 --> 00:03:19.900
I know you have an
Android background,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.010
so I really love this analogy.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.820
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.770
I used to talk about this
when I'm on presentations.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.140
It's because if you think--

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.180
sometimes it's hard to not
say the abstraction, something

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.680
like that.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.740
But if you take
the Android world--

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.342
so we have the
Android as a platform

00:03:35.342 --> 00:03:36.550
is like the Google Assistant.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.130
So we have all the other
applications there.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.130
Then, if I have the
each device that runs

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.550
an Android-- can be your
phone, your tablet, your car,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.580
for example, running
Android auto.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.940
But also, you have the apps
that each developer develops

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.410
to deliver to their users.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.420
That's our actions.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.780
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.580
NETO MARIN: So I like
to think on that way

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.790
to imagine we are building
apps for the whole system

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.707
that we call actions for
the Google Assistant.

00:04:02.707 --> 00:04:04.165
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
I love analogy.

00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:05.590
That's so great,
because it really

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.050
does identify how they're
kind of equivalent.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.110
But the biggest
difference is that you

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.110
don't have to download--

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.500
NETO MARIN: No.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.875
You just--

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:12.450
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: --actions.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.840
NETO MARIN: --ask for it.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.430
You start talking,
and the action

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.200
will be totally right
available right now.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.370
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
That's so cool.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.412
NETO MARIN: So you just
talk with your Assistant.

00:04:20.412 --> 00:04:24.430
So this is one thing I really
like about Google Assistant,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.430
that it don't need to
install or go and search.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.423
And just ask.

00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:29.590
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exactly.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.048
And so what it
sounds like is, what

00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:32.423
we're going to be
doing is, we're

00:04:32.423 --> 00:04:34.570
going to be making a project
on Actions on Google--

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.910
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.800
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
--which is the platform

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.760
for Google Assistant.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.045
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:38.087
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Cool.

00:04:38.087 --> 00:04:39.587
NETO MARIN: So where
should I start?

00:04:39.587 --> 00:04:41.170
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So we should start

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.840
with the console, which is the
console.actions.google.com.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.423
Start there and build
a project there.

00:04:45.423 --> 00:04:47.882
NETO MARIN: And I think it's
pretty straightforward, right?

00:04:47.882 --> 00:04:49.330
Just remember, console, actions.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.900
It's great.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.380
And it will be your
home from now on.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.590
If you're becoming an
Action developer-- #AoGDevs,

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.440
our hashtag on
Twitter, by the way--

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.213
you can just log into
the Actions console

00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:02.130
and start the project.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.390
Jessica, you show us?

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.610
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.818
NETO MARIN: Jessica-- she
has a video on the channel.

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:08.020
So if you want to know
more about the console,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.853
she recorded a gorgeous
video about how to--

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:10.978
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Thanks.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:12.610
NETO MARIN: --use the console.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.875
Then you can see much more
details on that video.

00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:15.730
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Definitely.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.510
So we're going to
start off here.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.130
Right now, we have no projects.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.830
And so what we'll do is,
we'll add a project here.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.030
And let's call this
project Lucky Calculator?

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.780
NETO MARIN: Great.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.540
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Right?

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.540
NETO MARIN: Sounds good.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.080
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: And when
it comes to-- "calculator."

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.230
Haha.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.650
And I'm going to
click Create Project.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.370
And this is just a project ID.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.860
This is not actually the
name of the action, right?

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.890
NETO MARIN: No.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.120
Good point.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.810
Yes.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.140
Because it's not the way that
we interact with your actions.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.720
So you don't need to start
over think right now,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.840
oh, how's the name?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.390
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: I know.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.466
Having to name something
immediately is hard.

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:49.872
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:50.405
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:50.405 --> 00:05:51.822
And even the
domain's unavailable.

00:05:51.822 --> 00:05:53.770
I'm kidding.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.340
Now we have this screen.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.010
So we have a bunch
of categories here.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.135
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:58.135 --> 00:06:00.520
NETO MARIN: So
it's kind of, what

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.200
can I do from a bunch
of these things?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.830
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Oh my gosh, yeah.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.000
So this is where you
could just use a category

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.030
to label your action.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.310
But seeing that we're making a
custom action that's not really

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.810
going to--

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.090
it doesn't fit into one of
these categories neatly.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.382
We're actually going to make
it using the conversation.

00:06:15.382 --> 00:06:16.210
NETO MARIN: OK.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.002
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So
we'll click on that.

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:21.760
And that will take us
into the actual home page

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.212
of the console, which is great.

00:06:23.212 --> 00:06:24.670
NETO MARIN: And
here is the set up.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.910
So the Quick Setup
that says, decide

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.380
how your action is evoked.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.460
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So
let's click on that.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.820
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.403
What Jessica was
talking about-- don't

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:34.750
need to [INAUDIBLE] by
before the name of the ID

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.070
project, something like that.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.170
And here is the screen
where we actually

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.320
add the name, how our
action be invoked.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.630
So, for example, we
can use this when

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.157
you say, hey, Google, ask to--

00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:46.990
and then we must say
the name of the action.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.360
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.140
Mm-hmm.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.230
NETO MARIN: But to
choose these names,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.518
we have some policies, right?

00:06:51.518 --> 00:06:52.810
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Definitely.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.390
Yeah, you can't have action
names there are only one word.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.400
They need to be multi-word.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.320
They can't be of a brand
that you don't own.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.130
And they can't be Google.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.840
So you can't build an
action called Google.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.430
NETO MARIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.906
And, of course,
potentially some--

00:07:04.906 --> 00:07:08.965
sometimes we come with some
cool names, start up services,

00:07:08.965 --> 00:07:10.240
don't know.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.850
But, unfortunately, if
you try to say that name,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.030
it's actually pretty
hard for the Assistant

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.110
to develop natural
language processing

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.130
and understand
what you're saying.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.960
So before you test, before
you actually decide the name,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.010
try to hear how the Assistant is
expecting to hear from you when

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.240
you invoke the action.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.990
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Even how
your users are going to say it.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.222
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:07:30.222 --> 00:07:30.340
Yes.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.382
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Because
sometimes, some words

00:07:32.382 --> 00:07:34.742
could be real tongue twisters--
just like that sentence.

00:07:34.742 --> 00:07:35.450
Blah, blah, blah.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.662
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:35.716
Yeah.

00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:38.298
And remember, there's a lot of
non-native English speakers.

00:07:38.298 --> 00:07:39.340
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.560
NETO MARIN: And maybe
some challenge words

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.835
should be avoided, I think.

00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:43.960
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.720
So for this action, I'm thinking
we should call it "lucky number

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.410
calculator"?

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.118
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:07:48.118 --> 00:07:49.170
Sounds good.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.880
Lucky number calculator.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.470
And then we can hear, also,
how they expecting, right?

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:53.920
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.420
Yeah.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.432
So let's click here.

00:07:56.432 --> 00:07:57.890
SPEAKER 1: Lucky
number calculator.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:58.940
NETO MARIN: OK, sounds good.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.900
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
That sounds good, yeah.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.358
NETO MARIN: Then,
remember to save.

00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:03.490
Always save, please.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.090
And now, this saving our agent.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.250
And it's good.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.400
We are good to go.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.130
Now, this is what define
the base for our action.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.850
So we have the
name of our action.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.110
Now we need to start
creating our action.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.590
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Yeah, totally.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.953
We need the functionality of it.

00:08:17.953 --> 00:08:18.620
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.120
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So when it comes

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.480
to what happens under the
hood, the user is going to say,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.530
hey, Google, talk to
lucky number calculator.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.110
The device picks it up, sends
it to a Google Assistant.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.940
It figures out, it's
going to hit our code.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.270
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.530
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: And
then, after that, we

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.760
have to give it a response.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.750
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.500
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And then once the user

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.450
gives us something back, we have
to figure out what they want.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.320
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.403
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: And
that would be really hard,

00:08:44.403 --> 00:08:46.790
because imagine someone
saying, I love purple,

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.503
or, my favorite color is pink.

00:08:48.503 --> 00:08:50.420
There's so many different
ways of saying that.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.450
How do you process that
without going crazy?

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.480
NETO MARIN: We have
a very nice tool.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.620
Call it Dialogflow.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.790
That will be very tight
integrated with all the actions

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.960
on Google Console.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.720
So from here, we'll be able, for
example, to start our action,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.235
creating our first action--

00:09:07.235 --> 00:09:08.840
[INAUDIBLE] an action.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.493
And it will add us to
the Dialogflow console.

00:09:12.493 --> 00:09:13.910
And when we hit
there, we're going

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.077
to explain more about the
difference between the two

00:09:16.077 --> 00:09:18.942
consoles and how we're
going to work [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:18.942 --> 00:09:21.150
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So I'm
going to click on Actions.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.560
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.670
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And that takes us here.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.250
And then--

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.090
NETO MARIN: Oh, actually, yeah.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.670
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.545
And so this is all the
functionality we want.

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:28.078
So I'm going to click on Adding.

00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:29.120
NETO MARIN: What is this?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.390
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Right?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.610
And so this is where
we have this define.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.600
What is the type of intent
or type of functionality

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.710
we're going to provide?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.418
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:09:37.418 --> 00:09:38.870
Imagine intents like intention.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.300
So the user has the
intention to do something,

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.167
to ask something to our action.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.750
And this is what we
are talking about.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.425
We have some pre--

00:09:46.425 --> 00:09:47.900
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: There
are some cool ones in here.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:48.928
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:49.740
What does it mean?

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.400
Because, for example, instead
of having to train your agent

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.210
to detect all the possible
ways to say, for example,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.420
get fortune, something
like that, we already

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.280
have this pre-trained,
this kind of an action.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.305
So what we call building tents.

00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:05.347
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:10:05.347 --> 00:10:08.300
And it lets Google know that
that particular intent is

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.770
all about giving a fortune.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.420
So when it has to figure
out which action to surface,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:12.920
it knows.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.130
You already found
something there.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:14.370
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.560
But in our case, we are
building a custom one.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.072
So let's go with Custom
Intent and hit Build.

00:10:19.072 --> 00:10:20.780
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So let's click Build.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.850
And it looks like
it opened a new tab.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.330
NETO MARIN: Yes, one more tab.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.538
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: And now
I'm in a different world.

00:10:25.538 --> 00:10:26.038
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:26.038 --> 00:10:27.830
NETO MARIN: And this
is Dialogflow, people.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:33.320
This is where, now, our natural
language processing stuff

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.250
will be much easier.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.410
Imagine if you have to
implement this by yourself,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.080
like having to handle all
the languages, for example.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.890
We handle more
than 20 languages.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.280
So imagine you have to
handle all the languages,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.430
do all the processing on
the words and the phrases,

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.050
and then identify what the
user means by that method.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.020
Yeah, crazy, right?

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.620
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Too much.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.328
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:10:52.328 --> 00:10:53.705
Dialogflow is a very cool tool.

00:10:53.705 --> 00:10:54.510
It's free.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.540
It's open to use for
all of the projects

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.220
so you can plug and use
right away in your projects.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.750
So it's very nice.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.875
And you're going to see here,
we will type a few expressions,

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:06.560
we going to some answers,
and it will be great.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.220
Let's see.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.950
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Yeah, definitely.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.492
So it looks like
Dialogflow gives us,

00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:11.670
for free, two intents already.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.570
So one's called the
Fallback intent.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.260
And the other one is
the Welcome intent.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:15.920
NETO MARIN: Cool.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.628
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And so let's actually

00:11:17.628 --> 00:11:20.510
go and explore a little bit
of the Welcome intent first.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.880
So in here-- I'm going
to click right in here.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.640
And that'll take us
into the intent page.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.450
And we have a couple
of things going on.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.300
We're going to
skip over context,

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.790
because that's not being used.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.960
An event-- right
here, it says welcome.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.670
So anytime that this agent
in Dialogflow is invoked,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.177
that triggers this event.

00:11:39.177 --> 00:11:40.760
For Actions on Google,
we don't really

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.090
have to worry about
that component just yet,

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.822
because that's when
it first greets it.

00:11:44.822 --> 00:11:45.530
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.410
And just to make clear,
why this is here,

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.220
see if Action on
Google that we're

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.290
using, because you
can use Dialogflow

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.280
to build agents for several
different platforms.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.050
So it can go with many, many,
many options, social networks,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.410
shared applications.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.843
So we can check--

00:12:02.843 --> 00:12:05.010
when we start integrating
with the Google Assistant,

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.650
you'll see other links there.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.920
Then, you could use the
same agent, the same code

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.200
to integrate with your other
platforms, if you want.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.400
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:12.990
Super cool.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.310
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.850
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And so this one

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.490
has already some
training phrases

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.210
that they give us for free.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.750
And so When.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.167
It comes to training
phrases, this

00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:25.340
is what we would be adding to
give to Dialogflow to train,

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.390
to match whatever the user
says to match with this intent.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.130
And so this is some
training phrases,

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.467
like hello, hi, howdy, hi there.

00:12:33.467 --> 00:12:35.300
NETO MARIN: Ways you
start the conversation.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.500
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:36.920
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.200
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So
we're going to scroll down.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.963
And so down here--

00:12:39.963 --> 00:12:40.880
NETO MARIN: Responses.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.420
What is this?

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:41.750
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.728
So it looks like this
is what our action's

00:12:43.728 --> 00:12:45.020
going to give back to the user.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.620
NETO MARIN: Nice.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:45.890
Nice.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.480
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So here, let's change

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.605
this to make it customized.

00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:50.690
NETO MARIN: Yeah, it's
because when someone asks,

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.090
talk to the lucky
number calculator,

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.010
we are expecting to,
for example, receive

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.010
some instruction, right?

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.260
OK, what should I do next?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.677
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:59.677 --> 00:13:02.150
NETO MARIN: So we can start
saying what the user can do.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.192
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:13:03.192 --> 00:13:04.620
So I think we
should keep the hi.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.310
NETO MARIN: That's good.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:05.945
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So, hi.

00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:07.778
NETO MARIN: Yeah, have
a polite action here.

00:13:07.778 --> 00:13:09.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.410
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: "Hi,
what is your favorite color"?

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.118
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:13:11.118 --> 00:13:12.435
Sounds good.

00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:14.310
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So
what's really nice is,

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.553
if we keep it as
multiple, then Dialogflow

00:13:16.553 --> 00:13:18.470
will be able to randomly
choose one from this.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.676
NETO MARIN: Nice.

00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:19.176
Nice.

00:13:19.176 --> 00:13:22.952
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So I'm going
to just copy-paste this part.

00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:24.330
NETO MARIN: Control-C.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.060
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Thank you.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.185
NETO MARIN: It's not a Mac.

00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:27.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.420
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So I'm
going to replace all of these.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.042
That way--

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:32.750
NETO MARIN: Nice.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.720
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: --we have
just that variety of greeting.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.107
So then it doesn't feel robotic.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.690
Because imagine every
time you see me,

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.990
I'm always like, hello, Neto.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.870
And next time, hello, Neto.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.860
That would be weird.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.990
NETO MARIN: You know,
some people do this.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.040
It's creepy, but OK.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.157
Maybe they are robots.

00:13:48.157 --> 00:13:49.240
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Maybe.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.930
Well, but the brain is very
mechanical in that sense.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.400
If it works, then go for it.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.317
We want to have something
that's a little more

00:13:56.317 --> 00:13:57.140
loose of an action.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:57.260
NETO MARIN: OK, yes.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.060
I like it.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.300
Remember to save again.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.848
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And then we save.

00:14:01.848 --> 00:14:03.430
Perfect.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.298
NETO MARIN: Now,
we can test this?

00:14:05.298 --> 00:14:06.340
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.590
NETO MARIN: On the device.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.480
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: You
want to test on the device?

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.320
You want to test this
in the simulator first?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.700
NETO MARIN: Let's
go to simulator.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.150
Good idea.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.450
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Right?

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:13.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.960
NETO MARIN: That's for
the simulator [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.270
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah,
because I would love to show--

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:16.510
NETO MARIN: Calm down.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:16.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.880
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: --from here,
how do we go to the simulator

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.270
and be able to show
that connection?

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.353
So we're going to go on
the left-hand side and hit

00:14:22.353 --> 00:14:23.830
Integration.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.960
And under Integration,
there will be the page

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.500
that Neto was mentioning of
all the different integrations.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.890
But the best one is
Google Assistant.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:33.700
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.226
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So we're
going to click on that.

00:14:35.226 --> 00:14:36.351
We're going to scroll down.

00:14:36.351 --> 00:14:40.635
And then we're going to enable
the auto-preview changes.

00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:42.760
That way, if there's any
changes on her Dialogflow,

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.177
it automatically gets populated
on your Actions on Google.

00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:45.910
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.110
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And click Test.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.740
NETO MARIN: Oh.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.400
What's happening?

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.370
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: That's
because I didn't click it.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:51.600
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.100
Yes.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.590
It's opened another tab.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.180
Oh, my god.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.980
No, it's because now we
are going to the simulator.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.378
So this is very cool.

00:14:59.378 --> 00:15:01.670
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: The
simulator of Actions on Google.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.628
NETO MARIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:02.628 --> 00:15:03.385
Good point.

00:15:03.385 --> 00:15:04.760
If you want, for
example-- if you

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.760
are building for
other platforms,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.790
you want to test
integration, Dialogflow

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.710
also as a tool for you to test,
say, things to the Dialogflow.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.005
But here is specifically
about the Actions on Google,

00:15:16.005 --> 00:15:16.880
the Google Assistant.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.260
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yes.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.803
NETO MARIN: But there's some
nice things, some cool stuff

00:15:19.803 --> 00:15:20.720
on this screen, right?

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.510
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Oh my gosh, yes.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.660
The simulator is,
I think, the best

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.550
tool to be able to test
out your action just

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.990
to see if what you're
coding, what you're building

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.080
is really happening.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.900
NETO MARIN: Mm-hmm.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.358
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: And so in
here, we're in the simulator.

00:15:33.358 --> 00:15:36.920
On this main page, it's going to
be the log of the conversation.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.300
And on the right will be
what is displayed to the user

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.960
if it has some visual
elements to it.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.410
NETO MARIN: And we can, for
example, see here on Surface?

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.110
We can change the surface to see
how your action is performing

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.850
on a phone or a speaker
or a screen-enabled device

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:53.790
like smart displays.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.160
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exactly.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.820
NETO MARIN: It also
can change language

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.830
if you are trying
multi-language.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:58.530
Yes.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.660
Spanish or Brazilian Portuguese.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.620
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: All of them.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.328
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:02.580
So we have a lot of them.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.470
And even if you are
trying, for example,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.350
some service that
you need location,

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.900
you could walk or
change the location.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.970
Right now, you're
Googleplex, where you are.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.512
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Yeah, we're here.

00:16:12.512 --> 00:16:15.080
NETO MARIN: But you could change
this location if you want.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.510
And then you have
a bunch of tabs.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.250
We won't go through
all this right now.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.080
I think it's not
necessary in this video.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.960
We are already learning
a lot of things today.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.380
But you can explore this
later and see, for example,

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.650
how the request is going
and how the response is

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.150
coming from the Assistant.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.730
You can see all the
JSON communication,

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.980
because all the communication
between the Assistant

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.190
and Dialogflow, it's
all based on JSON.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:39.530
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.980
NETO MARIN: So you could
see what's going on

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.140
and if you have any errors.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.100
We have errors and debug.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.820
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.260
That's something I really enjoy.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.360
Whenever there is an
error, it automatically

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.620
takes you to that tab and
it tells you the error name.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.500
And that's usually when I'm
like, hello there, old friend.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.402
I see you again.

00:16:52.402 --> 00:16:53.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.660
NETO MARIN: It's good.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.210
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So
can we test this one out?

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.530
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.363
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Let's see if this works.

00:16:58.363 --> 00:17:01.088
NETO MARIN: You can
type or talk or click.

00:17:01.088 --> 00:17:02.505
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
I'm a clicker,

00:17:02.505 --> 00:17:03.770
so I'm going to click on it.

00:17:06.832 --> 00:17:09.020
SPEAKER 1: All right,
getting the test version

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.505
of Lucky Number Calculator.

00:17:11.505 --> 00:17:12.380
SPEAKER 2: Greetings.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.609
What is your favorite color?

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:14.651
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Nice.

00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:16.940
NETO MARIN: Wow,
deploying, it's working.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.030
Yeah.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:18.930
The demo writes.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.130
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.310
NETO MARIN: Well,
what's going on here

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:27.170
is, how you saw, it's going to
the Assistant, asking for, hey,

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.260
do you have some action called
Lucky Number Calculator?

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.500
And the Assistant say,
yeah, actually, I have.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.280
And this testing
is in your account.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.140
Because I don't know
if you realized,

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.150
but we called it here.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.405
And Jessica didn't did any kind
of deploy or something like--

00:17:41.405 --> 00:17:42.530
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Mm-hmm.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.060
Didn't have to.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.730
NETO MARIN: --send it to that.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.130
When you do the testing,
it's already enable

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.913
any or all devices.

00:17:47.913 --> 00:17:49.330
So if you have
anything configured

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.220
to the Google Assistant,
you're already working there.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.860
So even you have a same team
sharing the same account

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.570
or different accounts, it
would very fast, very quickly

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.100
enabled to the other
people to test.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.360
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.610
It's accessible,
which is really nice.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:03.960
And there's also other ways
that you could do that.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.470
And we'll talk about that
when it comes to releasing

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.200
and how do you actually
test in a larger scale, too.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.210
NETO MARIN: So let's--

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.150
excuse me.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.220
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Sure.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.300
So we're in that
transition phase

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.230
where our action has given
a question to the user.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.930
We said hi.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.370
It gave you a question.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.750
And now we have to allow
the user to respond back

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.980
with their favorite color.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.772
And then we have to
build the functionality

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.630
to capture that and then
do our machine learning

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.010
really great, fun stuff.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.110
NETO MARIN:
[INAUDIBLE],, yeah, yeah.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.400
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
All his analysis.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.410
And then return back a response.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.630
NETO MARIN: You're going to see,
it's, like, 100 lines of code.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.270
Prepare yourself.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.320
Brace yourselves.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:39.820
I'm kidding.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.445
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So we have to build

00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:42.860
that turn of conversation.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.363
User says their favorite
color, and we're responding

00:18:45.363 --> 00:18:46.280
with the lucky number.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.370
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.390
So we are here.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.760
I just clicked on Cancel
to stop the emulator.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.970
I go back to the other tab,
where we have the Dialogflow.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.190
I can close the test.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.200
And then I'll go
back to intents.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.570
So again, you see,
again, the full welcome.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.890
We can now create a new intent.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.820
So this new intent is what
we are building, exactly.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.520
So in this case, it's our
lucky number calculator.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.068
So let's call it that
Lucky Number is good?

00:19:20.068 --> 00:19:21.110
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Sure.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.027
NETO MARIN: Just Lucky
Number, because then we

00:19:23.027 --> 00:19:25.090
will return the lucky number.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.380
Context-- we are
not talking this.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.560
It's a much more deeper topic.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.930
In the future, we will have,
for sure, an episode about this.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.727
Just have in mind, it is a
way you can remember what's

00:19:36.727 --> 00:19:37.810
going on the conversation.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.680
So like a person, you can--

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.400
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Keep the context.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.060
NETO MARIN: --keep your context.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.840
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.040
NETO MARIN: So the same thing.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.250
Events, already talked about.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.240
So let's add the
training phrases.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.820
And this point,
remember, the action

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.920
already greeted
the user, saying,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.700
what's their favorite color?

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.492
So now, how would you
answer this question?

00:19:56.492 --> 00:19:57.950
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
I think I would

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.860
answer by saying something like,
my favorite color is purple.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.320
NETO MARIN: My favorite
color is purple.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:04.820
Right?

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.140
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.320
NETO MARIN: Is right?

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:05.670
Is good?

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.020
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, yeah.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.232
NETO MARIN: So what happened?

00:20:07.232 --> 00:20:08.190
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.648
NETO MARIN: There's
something here.

00:20:09.648 --> 00:20:12.260
Yellow you see here highlighted.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.638
What happened here is, our
natural language processing

00:20:15.638 --> 00:20:17.180
tool-- that's
Dialogflow-- identified

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.940
that purple is a color and then
is mapping this as an entity.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.420
Because it's something on
the real world that probably,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.180
based on this phrase, is
something that the user

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.808
once you communicate
your action.

00:20:30.808 --> 00:20:31.850
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.558
Yeah, definitely.

00:20:32.558 --> 00:20:33.950
Dialogflow is
smart enough and is

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.220
aware of things
like colors, time--

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.380
not just time of the
day, but then also time

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.595
in regards to days.

00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:41.942
NETO MARIN: CDs, countries.

00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:43.400
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So many things.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.410
NETO MARIN: Currencies.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.110
There's a lot.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.930
In our documentation page, you
have a specific-- on Dialogflow

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:48.820
documentation, sorry.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.810
There's a specific page
with all the system.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.360
We call system
entities, this case.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.570
You could create your own.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.120
For example, if you
have a unicorn color,

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.370
you have something like that--

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.780
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: I do.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.300
That sounds great.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.110
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.970
Yeah, my daughter
will love this color.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:02.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.367
Then I can go to Entities, here,
and create a new entity custom

00:21:06.367 --> 00:21:08.450
color or [INAUDIBLE] color
or something like that.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.920
You can and your colors to that.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.010
But in this case, let's work
only the well-known colors.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.010
Let's say that.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:14.570
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.490
So we should provide just
more than one training phrase,

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.157
because I don't think
a machine learning

00:21:18.157 --> 00:21:19.348
model is happy with one.

00:21:19.348 --> 00:21:20.640
NETO MARIN: I think not enough.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.670
[INAUDIBLE],, for example,
you said, my favorite color

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:23.170
is purple.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.067
But since they asked,
what's your favorite color?

00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:27.650
I would say just,
orange, for example.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.030
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh,
yeah, just respond back.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.870
See, and this is what I like.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.650
There's so many
different varieties

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.700
that you could just provide
Dialogflow a handful

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.532
and it figures out the rest of
the diversity of that phrase.

00:21:37.532 --> 00:21:38.240
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.450
This is the point.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.530
If you have, for example--

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.350
imagine you are building
a service for your custom

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.200
service.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:46.880
Let's say that.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.520
And you have a bunch of ways
that people make question

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.190
to your call center.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.810
And you have these
questions already

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.130
collected on a spreadsheet,
something like that.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.450
You can also import these
from the spreadsheet,

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.910
from other sources, and
put here as a training.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:02.540
But take care.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.330
Don't put, also,
too much questions.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.125
Because then what
could happen is,

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:12.050
all the process get confused
by the amount of question.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.510
You are overloading this.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.588
And then gets confused
with another questions

00:22:16.588 --> 00:22:17.630
from another [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.260
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Oh, another intent.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:18.650
Exactly.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.067
NETO MARIN: So you
need to be very

00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:24.440
clear on delimiting the limit
between one intent and another.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.190
But in our case, I think
orange one, or say,

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.890
"my favorite color is purple."

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.160
"Orange."

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.600
"I like blue."

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.785
What else?

00:22:36.785 --> 00:22:39.410
"Is green."

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.710
Something like that.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.610
So I think we have a
good variety, right?

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:42.870
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, totally.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.630
Especially for this demo,
I think we're good here.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.000
I believe we recommend doing
about 10 to 15 training phrases

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.060
for a production-level action.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.950
NETO MARIN: So right now, we
have a very straightforward

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.560
training phrases.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.390
But now, I can respond to
the user about something.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:08.487
I want to make sure that it's
understanding my question--

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:09.320
not question, sorry.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.610
My answer.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.900
I can go here, Add
Response, for example,

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.050
and I can create just
a dummy answer just

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.940
to make sure that
this is working.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.850
And then I say, yeah,
let's imagine that we

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.380
have here a polite action.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.920
Say, yes, or, nice.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.678
"I like--" I want to
refer to the same color.

00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:29.720
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: The
color that the user said.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.053
NETO MARIN: How could I do this?

00:23:31.053 --> 00:23:35.400
If you go here, you see
when you click on this part,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.050
there is a parameter name.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.150
So this color that the user
said is mapped to a parameter.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:41.150
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yes.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.070
And so we could use that
variable or that parameter

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.040
in this response, now.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.170
NETO MARIN: So I
would say here, color.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.700
Why color?

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:55.760
So it's like this action is
responding, "like I nice"

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.230
and the color for
whatever you say to it.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.440
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So this is
not your machine learning part,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:00.620
right?

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:00.820
NETO MARIN: No, no.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.820
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: This
is not your fancy math.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.100
This is just for testing.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.840
NETO MARIN: Just
for test, exactly.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.300
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Perfect.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:05.880
NETO MARIN: You got it.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.550
It's just like, let's warm up.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.050
So Save.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.175
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Always.

00:24:09.175 --> 00:24:11.210
NETO MARIN: Remember
to save lucky number.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.320
And again, integration.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.400
And then-- example, we can
go just without hitting this,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.820
but there is sometimes some
delay between the propagation

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.220
of the new version.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:27.210
So for faster here, let's just
export the lucky number intent

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.660
here and then test again.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.330
You'll see another
simulator going up.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.080
And then we can close
the previous one.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.310
No problem.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.960
And then let's try again.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.350
But this time, I'm going to
answer it when the action ask

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.860
me about my favorite color.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.513
So going to use the same again.

00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:48.180
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.827
Getting the test version
of Lucky Number Calculator.

00:24:51.827 --> 00:24:52.410
SPEAKER 2: Hi.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.770
What is your favorite color?

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.660
NETO MARIN: I'm
going to say I like--

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.327
let's use a color
that's not on my list.

00:25:00.327 --> 00:25:01.368
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Pink.

00:25:01.368 --> 00:25:02.290
NETO MARIN: Pink.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.910
It's [INAUDIBLE] of fashion.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.243
SPEAKER 2: Nice I like pink.

00:25:07.243 --> 00:25:08.160
NETO MARIN: That's it.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:08.740
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Nice.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.448
So we confirmed--

00:25:09.448 --> 00:25:10.782
NETO MARIN: It's so intelligent.

00:25:10.782 --> 00:25:11.613
I like it so much.

00:25:11.613 --> 00:25:12.280
No, I'm kidding.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.050
So what we're going
to have here--

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:14.920
can hit Cancel.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.306
So just end the session.

00:25:17.306 --> 00:25:18.685
But it's not so useful, right?

00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:19.810
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: No, no.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:20.900
We want something dynamic.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.442
But we at least know that our
intent that we filled out works

00:25:23.442 --> 00:25:26.040
and that the training
phrases was triggered

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040
using a different word--

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.430
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.940
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
--which is great.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.580
So now what we want to
do is grab that color

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.740
and, in our back end--

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:32.550
NETO MARIN: Oh, back end, no.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.110
Yes.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.850
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.830
Do all the fun stuff
that you promised me.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.910
NETO MARIN: Nice.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.850
I had to show my
[INAUDIBLE] machine learning

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.270
and everything else.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:46.570
So again, close this case
and go back to your intent.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.080
Click again on, in our
case, Lucky Number.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.870
And you'll see, here, all the
things we already entered.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.740
At the end of the
page, and scroll down,

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.783
you'll see fulfillment.

00:25:57.783 --> 00:25:59.450
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
What is fulfillment?

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.850
NETO MARIN:
Fulfillment's the way

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:04.960
that we actually going
to link the Dialogflow

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.960
to our culture, the web hook.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.760
Because this is the
way that we offer

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.040
to connect to your back end,
to the Google and Dialogflow

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.540
server.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.900
Because how we could know how to
send your request instead of--

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.320
for example, we don't
like you to keep

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.160
pulling to ask for something.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.200
Then the easiest way, just
call a web hook-- like URL

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.840
that you're going to give to us.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.882
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:26:28.882 --> 00:26:31.910
NETO MARIN: But in this case--
so enable fulfillment here.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.128
And then we can enable web
hook call for this intent.

00:26:34.128 --> 00:26:35.170
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.340
So our welcome line, we are not
going to touch our back end.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:37.620
NETO MARIN: No.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.670
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Because it's not needed.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.140
It's overhead we don't need.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:40.360
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.443
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: So
that one we'll leave as is.

00:26:42.443 --> 00:26:45.100
This one, when this gets hit,
that goes and hits our code.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.933
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:26:45.933 --> 00:26:47.778
We need these action
goes to the back end.

00:26:47.778 --> 00:26:48.820
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Nice.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.243
NETO MARIN: There's another
option here without enabling.

00:26:51.243 --> 00:26:52.910
Right now, it's about
this [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.330
So you could enable
these two if you

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.820
need to check some
parameters, other thing.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.530
But it's not default
because right now--

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.210
so remember to save.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:01.510
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Always save.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.330
Always save.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.640
NETO MARIN: And then, done.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.140
Look.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.150
There's some--

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:07.520
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Mm.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.420
Something different.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:08.680
NETO MARIN: What is this?

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.425
The screen has got this
green thing going on.

00:27:10.425 --> 00:27:10.780
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.092
It looks like that the agent
is actually being trained.

00:27:13.092 --> 00:27:14.800
So it's grabbing all
the training phrases

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.732
and creating the--

00:27:17.732 --> 00:27:18.940
NETO MARIN: Training phrases?

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.990
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yes, it's
grabbing the training phrases

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.573
to make the model for
the machine learning.

00:27:22.573 --> 00:27:23.240
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.680
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And so it looks

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.055
like it just created all that.

00:27:25.055 --> 00:27:25.930
And then it finished.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.240
NETO MARIN: Because
it's not just not

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.480
doing, if this
equal your phrase--

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.620
it's actually
creating more options.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.750
So this is what
it's saying to us.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.420
You'll see a bunch of these
communication going out,

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.710
sometimes, on here.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.340
And there is another option
here, on the left menu.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.760
Fulfillment.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.720
So click here.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:43.824
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:27:43.824 --> 00:27:46.180
So this is a fulfillment in
the regards of connecting

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.643
our actual code to Dialogflow.

00:27:49.643 --> 00:27:50.310
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.750
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Right?

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.190
OK.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.607
NETO MARIN: One
of the option here

00:27:52.607 --> 00:27:53.990
is to use external web hooks.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.290
So imagine where we have your
own backhand configurator

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.400
can use this.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.250
You can enter your URL here.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.220
Only requirement, that
it must be HTTPS--

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:03.845
a secure point.

00:28:03.845 --> 00:28:04.887
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:28:04.887 --> 00:28:05.770
Got to be safe.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.370
NETO MARIN: But
there's no dangerous

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.190
should put my basic
authentication

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.760
here, user name, password.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.000
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: No, you
could totally do that, yeah.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.320
NETO MARIN: Yeah, because
this is SSL communication.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.230
And this information will
be stored in our servers.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.030
Nobody has access.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.840
If you need something else,
like API key or something,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.930
it could go here.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.340
Enter a key in [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.070
So imagine, API key
or a specific header

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.060
that you want to use
it can also use here.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.590
So no problem.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.020
You can use your own server.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.220
But we don't have a server.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.620
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Well, we
don't need a server for this.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.550
NETO MARIN: We
don't need, exactly.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.280
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.613
We could use something that
Dialogflow already has built

00:28:38.613 --> 00:28:40.340
in, which is the inline editor.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.650
NETO MARIN: This is great.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:46.120
So here, I have my code
right on this screen.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.930
I don't need to go and create,
download an intstant key,

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.550
create nothing, and
just type my code here.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.950
And just an explanation--

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:55.330
I kind of lazy, people.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.510
So I'm going to replace all this
code with one magic comment.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.650
But the point is--

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.740
I've got to explain why.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.300
You see here,
Dialogflow fulfillment.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.920
But we're going to
change this, right?

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.130
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.590
We're going to use our Actions
on Google client library

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.310
instead.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.018
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:29:10.018 --> 00:29:13.300
This client library has
been built by our team.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.200
And we take care.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.160
It's open source.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.720
And it's on GitHub.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.160
You can take a look, can open
issues if you find something,

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.760
or can talk with us if
you have any problem.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.010
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Well,
don't talk to us through that.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:24.910
Talk to us through Twitter.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:25.150
But, yeah.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:25.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:25.420
NETO MARIN: Ah, of course.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.940
But then, if you have any
problem with the library,

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.890
It's good, because
then this will help

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.480
you wrapping all functionality.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.100
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh my gosh,
it makes it so much easier.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:33.808
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:29:33.808 --> 00:29:36.340
Like, you don't need to take
care about the JSON format,

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.150
specifically.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.695
So you can go use the library.

00:29:38.695 --> 00:29:39.810
You're going to see, here.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.060
It's very useful.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.310
But if you're not a Node.js
person, you can also use Java.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.040
So we have recently
announced the Java client

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.750
library and Java [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.210
So you can use on Java
[INAUDIBLE] environments.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.390
And we are planning to pull
out more tools and libraries.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:56.890
So stay tuned.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.300
But so I'm going to
replace this code.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.500
I'm kind of lazy, you know.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.280
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: The
power of the internet.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.033
NETO MARIN: No.

00:30:03.033 --> 00:30:05.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.387
Jessica--

00:30:06.387 --> 00:30:07.720
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: That was me.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.870
NETO MARIN: It was.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:09.600
But no problem.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.347
We have here.

00:30:10.347 --> 00:30:11.680
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: There we go.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.300
NETO MARIN: Let's do the magic.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:12.570
Yes.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.570
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yep.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.880
Woohoo, it's there.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.830
NETO MARIN: What we
have here is basically,

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.770
we are importing some
things we might use.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.350
For example, the library
has this Dialogflow,

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.720
the basic objects.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.170
So it's where all the
functionalities, the features

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:28.940
are.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.390
But also, we have base
card on the image.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.420
These are other
classes, other objects

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.910
that we might use to have a
rich response, for example.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:36.390
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exactly.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.010
NETO MARIN: But we have, also--

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.830
promising one more
episode, we have something

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.220
about this in the future.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.387
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: We will.

00:30:43.387 --> 00:30:46.380
NETO MARIN: Right now, let's
use only the Dialogflow here,

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.420
because we don't
need the other one.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.700
And then these others,
just about the function.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.950
So it's required
by this, because we

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.860
are hosting this on a Firebase
Cloud Functions, right?

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.277
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Exactly, yeah.

00:31:00.277 --> 00:31:02.040
So under the hood,
what's happening

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.550
when we do hit
Deploy is, it's going

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.605
to spin up a Firebase
Functions only project.

00:31:06.605 --> 00:31:07.980
It's going to
create the project.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.360
It's going to upload our code.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.360
It's going to deploy it.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.230
And then it's going to
connect the URL to Dialogflow

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.215
and do all this magic.

00:31:14.215 --> 00:31:15.840
So we need to have
that, because that's

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.382
how we use Firebase Functions.

00:31:17.382 --> 00:31:18.090
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.280
Then, here, we are
starting the Dialogflow app

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.500
that we imported here before.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.862
Then, here is the intent.

00:31:24.862 --> 00:31:27.320
So remember when we create the
intent, lucky number, there?

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.530
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yep.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.090
NETO MARIN: Here
is where I mapped

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.250
that intent, that it's
on the Dialogflow side

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.935
to in the web hook
on my back end

00:31:35.935 --> 00:31:40.530
to say, hey, when the user says
something this intent, this

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.878
is the code that will
answer your request.

00:31:42.878 --> 00:31:43.920
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.040
So when the user says
a color, Dialogflow

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.480
does the machine learning,
matches it with the intent.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.242
That intent name is that name.

00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:51.450
NETO MARIN: Be the same, yes.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:52.260
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So those match.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.280
NETO MARIN: And here you
can see the parameter.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.320
So remember, when you check the
parameter there with the color,

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.010
use the same name here.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.570
So, color.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.427
And then here is my
extremely advanced code.

00:32:03.427 --> 00:32:04.385
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh.

00:32:04.385 --> 00:32:04.720
Hm.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.428
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:32:05.428 --> 00:32:07.827
So we got [INAUDIBLE] of
that color and multiply--

00:32:07.827 --> 00:32:08.910
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: By 35.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:09.780
NETO MARIN: 35?

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.645
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Is
35 a special number?

00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:13.020
NETO MARIN: No,
I can't say that.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.830
This is my machine
learning thing, here.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.200
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Top secret?

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.367
NETO MARIN: Top secret, yes.

00:32:17.367 --> 00:32:19.225
I run after a million
of lines of code,

00:32:19.225 --> 00:32:20.600
and then I came
with this number.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.060
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh,
so that's the answer.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.200
So then we grab
the lucky number.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.390
We do your really
cool mathematics.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.598
NETO MARIN: And what is this?

00:32:25.598 --> 00:32:27.660
I'm returning the
conversation.ask.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.460
So you have your lucky number.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.090
This is when we calculate it.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.760
Imagine you have
here your API call.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.460
You can read from database
or whatever you want.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:42.122
And then you have
conv.ask or conv.close.

00:32:42.122 --> 00:32:43.080
What is the difference?

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.700
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So conv.ask is

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.070
where you could give the
response a string where

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.740
the conversation
continues with the user.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.460
When you use conv.close
and you still

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.280
pass in the string,
what happens is,

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.880
the conversation
ends after that.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.760
So there's no more
dialogue after that.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.360
NETO MARIN: Exactly
in this case,

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.377
we could use close to
finish the conversation.

00:33:00.377 --> 00:33:01.710
I think, let's change for close.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:02.880
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: I
think that makes sense.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.838
NETO MARIN: Yeah, because
you asked the number.

00:33:04.838 --> 00:33:07.130
I said the color, asked
the number, return.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:08.010
I think it's done.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:08.300
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.480
NETO MARIN: We don't need.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.770
And then we're going to hit--

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.480
and this last line,
just remember, must--

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.860
it will be there when you
started doing your code.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.280
Can, like I said,
replace at the top code.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.640
But this last line--

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.030
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Oh, you need.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.800
NETO MARIN: --must
be this way because

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.780
this
DialogflowFirebaseFulfillment

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.200
is the name of the function
that Dialogflow is expecting

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.583
to hit in your back end.

00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:30.750
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exactly.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.990
NETO MARIN: So don't
change this name, please.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.250
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.000
Let's just delete that
"Want to try again,"

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.030
because we're ending
the conversation.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.530
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.220
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Since we changed that,

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.650
let's make it so
that it really ends.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:38.310
NETO MARIN: OK.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.330
Finish here.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.190
So is lucky number.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:47.050
And then I can hit Deploy
right now and send [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.020
Successfully provision it.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.100
So it means it already
sent to the call function.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.063
So create your project.

00:33:54.063 --> 00:33:55.230
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Project.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.300
NETO MARIN: But
remember, right now, it's

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.180
speeding up the deploy.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.882
It's creating your instance,
downloading your dependencies.

00:34:02.882 --> 00:34:04.590
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
All the requirements.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.423
NETO MARIN: Exactly.

00:34:05.423 --> 00:34:08.370
So in the first time,
it's not so fast.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.210
It would take one minute,
maybe, or a few seconds.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.377
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exactly.

00:34:12.377 --> 00:34:14.370
NETO MARIN: But then,
the following executions

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:15.070
would be much faster.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.230
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, totally,
because you're not having to do

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.280
all of that structural inte--

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.100
the structure to
just start it up.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:20.250
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.120
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
So after that,

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.290
it's just those minor changes.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:22.998
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:34:22.998 --> 00:34:24.630
And let's remember,
we don't have

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.800
version control inside here.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.770
So if you change
your code, you're

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.940
not sure about what
you're changed,

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.742
save these on another
editor, something like that.

00:34:34.742 --> 00:34:35.909
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exactly.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:37.742
NETO MARIN: And do your
own version control.

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.270
Because here, when
you change, it's

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.250
updated in the Cloud
Functions projects.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.765
So if you change something you
don't remember how you did,

00:34:44.765 --> 00:34:45.265
you're lost.

00:34:45.265 --> 00:34:45.710
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.260
Oh, no, no.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:46.560
Totally.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.150
Yeah, you always want
to use version control

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:49.275
whenever you're developing.

00:34:49.275 --> 00:34:51.000
Because I know
you don't discover

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.389
that you need to do that
until it bites you in the tush

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.690
and you're just like,
why didn't I do that?

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:55.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.460
NETO MARIN: Yes, exactly.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.950
In this case, we're going to
test on the device right now.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.862
I think we can mute so--

00:35:01.862 --> 00:35:03.070
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, yeah.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:03.970
I'll totally mute it.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:04.720
NETO MARIN: Yes.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.017
GOOGLE HOME: The mic's back on.

00:35:06.017 --> 00:35:06.850
NETO MARIN: You see?

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.130
Now we can talk with her.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.880
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
But we do need to wait

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.900
for it to deploy completely.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.140
NETO MARIN: Yeah, sure.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.010
We are waiting.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.070
And, by the way,
in this episode,

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.810
we're going to stop
right after this--

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:20.440
how can I say?

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.118
This goal, that it's
create the action and test.

00:35:24.118 --> 00:35:25.660
And in the next
episode, you're going

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.720
to see how we can take this
action that we just developed

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.532
and publish for everybody use.

00:35:31.532 --> 00:35:32.740
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exciting.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:37.792
NETO MARIN: So we have to
wait a little bit more.

00:35:37.792 --> 00:35:38.500
So it's deployed.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.000
Yeah!

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.376
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah!

00:35:40.376 --> 00:35:42.110
NETO MARIN: Deploy dance.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.360
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: It worked.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.700
NETO MARIN: Now we can use?

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.100
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.870
NETO MARIN: So I'll go
to Integration again,

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:48.280
just make sure that
it's integrated.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.300
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah, let's
just test this out just in--

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.570
NETO MARIN: Remember, this
name here, Lucky Number,

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:55.420
must match the intent name here.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.420
So Lucky Number here is OK.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.113
Go again Integration,
Google Assistant.

00:36:01.113 --> 00:36:02.155
It's there, Lucky Number.

00:36:02.155 --> 00:36:03.130
Test.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.550
But this time, we won't
use the simulator.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.360
Right?

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:07.810
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
We don't have

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:08.980
to, because we have
something else.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.640
NETO MARIN: Oh, nice.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.098
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
I'm so nervous.

00:36:11.098 --> 00:36:11.950
NETO MARIN: Me, too.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:12.910
The chance--

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:13.270
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: I know.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.937
NETO MARIN: --to go
wrong is big, right?

00:36:14.937 --> 00:36:16.150
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.610
NETO MARIN: OK.

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:22.660
OK, Google, talk to
lucky number calculator.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.410
GOOGLE HOME: Sure.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.795
Here's the test version of
Lucky Number Calculator.

00:36:26.795 --> 00:36:27.670
SPEAKER 2: Greetings.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:29.851
What is your favorite color?

00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:31.476
NETO MARIN: My favorite
color is brown.

00:36:34.878 --> 00:36:37.342
GOOGLE HOME: Your
lucky number is 175.

00:36:37.342 --> 00:36:38.700
NETO MARIN: Whoa, yes.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.155
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah!

00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:39.655
Woohoo.

00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:40.647
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:40.647 --> 00:36:41.730
NETO MARIN: We are winner.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.050
We are the champ-- no.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.410
So you see how its easy?

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.990
I didn't upload nothing.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.820
I didn't connect
any cable to there.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.480
Just the power
source is connected.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.200
So that's great.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.600
So it's ready to test.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.710
And you can test your--

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.973
this something I really
like about mobile device

00:37:01.973 --> 00:37:03.390
when I was developing
for Android,

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.770
and now that I
develop for this--

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.430
it's because you can see your
code running and actually

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.472
working right beside you.

00:37:09.472 --> 00:37:10.472
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yes.

00:37:10.472 --> 00:37:11.272
It's a real thing.

00:37:11.272 --> 00:37:11.980
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:12.690
It's very nice.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.170
But so I think, for this
one, I think we are good.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.350
So these are the way you can
wrap up on doing your action.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.560
With these, you are able
to make more changes.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.350
For example, can go back
to Dialogflow and then

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.563
you can create more intents--

00:37:26.563 --> 00:37:27.730
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exactly.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.460
NETO MARIN: --more entities,
if you need, and keep testing.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.460
So I think it is, right?

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:32.700
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.773
NETO MARIN: So in
the next episode,

00:37:34.773 --> 00:37:36.690
you're going to see how
to publish this action

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.050
and make it available
for everybody.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:38.730
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Everyone.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:39.438
NETO MARIN: Yeah.

00:37:39.438 --> 00:37:41.770
So you can share with your
mom, with your partner,

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:42.395
with everybody.

00:37:42.395 --> 00:37:42.670
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Exactly.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.190
NETO MARIN: So it can test.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.290
And thanks for watching us.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:47.970

for a next episode--
so an idea you have.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:53.830

because that's why we're here.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.522
NETO MARIN: Yes, exactly.

00:38:01.522 --> 00:38:03.158
So thanks for watching.
