00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.703 align:start size:91% position:9%
Gene, look, this piece is
totally slanted...

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.939 align:start size:94% position:6%
it lacks in-depth reporting,
it has no sources...

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:09.509
and it makes outrageous claims.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.546 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's what we in the news world
like to call... perfect.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.114
Oh, my gosh.

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:17.216
Thought you were gonna go a
different way with that. Wow!

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.252 align:start size:88% position:13%
Thank you! I felt really
good about it.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.821
Like a regular Barb Walters.

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.423 align:start size:91% position:9%
So you wanna just give me
my press badge...

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.091 align:start position:0%
and I'll head off
to the big match?

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.393 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, unfortunately I can't
do that.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.995 size:81% position:41%
What's up?

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:31.631 align:start size:97% position:3%
Your GPA... it's too low.
Your exam grades were posted.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:37.070 align:start size:84% position:16%
What? She failed me...
and passed Matt!

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.006
Oh, that bitch!

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:50.884
Oh, that bitch!

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:57.824 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hi, Gene, I can't talk
right now.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.393 align:start size:97% position:3%
Oh, are you in a hurry, on the
way to the big match?

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.828
Yeah, actually, I am.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.930 align:start size:47% position:53%
Oh, that bitch!

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.164
What?

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.632 align:start size:97% position:3%
You posted our grades online,
Billie!

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:08.835 align:start size:94% position:6%
I saw that you passed Matt,
even though he failed.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.303
How did you know--

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
Because I let him copy off of me
and he passed and I failed!

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.008 align:start size:94% position:6%
And now I can't be the
Bob Costas of the school...

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.477
because my GPA is so low.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.912 align:start size:88% position:13%
And it's all your fault,
you stupid bitch!

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:21.514 align:start size:78% position:22%
Roxie, play death metal.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:26.552
Gene, wait! Stop circling me,
Gene, I am going to tell them!

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:29.989 align:start size:94% position:6%
Will you shut off your
dance club music? Thank you.

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:31.657 align:start size:94% position:6%
Look, I know what I did was
wrong.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.659 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm going right now to tell
the truth! Will you--

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:36.329 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Roxie, play death metal!

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:36.329
I'm going to tell the truth!

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.897
Will you turn that off!

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.899 align:start size:97% position:3%
Gene, would you turn that off,
please!

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.467 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
What?

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.002
I said I'm going right now...

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.504 align:start size:22% position:78% line:85%
Yeah?

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
...to stop it.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.438 line:85%
I'm going to tell the coach...

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.438 align:start size:59% position:41%
Roxie, death metal!

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.206
...and the dean that he failed.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.908
Will you stop being such a baby!

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:50.409
Oh, I'm a baby?

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:53.579
You had no problem failing
this baby, did you, Billie?

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:56.382 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's because I expect more
from you, Gene!

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.050
Plus, you let him cheat!

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.587 align:start size:84% position:16% line:85%
Me cheats?

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.587 size:84% position:58%
Yeah, you cheats.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.756 line:85%
You cheat, sweets.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.756
Yeah, you cheat, sweets.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.558 size:75% position:38% line:85%
You cheat!

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.558
Eat sweet-- take cheats!

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:06.792 align:start size:91% position:9% line:85%
You cheat!

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:06.792
You cheat! Sweep streets!

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:07.994
Hey, give me that.
Give me that, Hand!

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.128 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is the only thing I
learned...

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:10.563 align:start size:81% position:19% line:85%
No!

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:10.563
...in your stupid class, Billie!

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:12.765 size:88% position:56% line:85%
The joust!

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:12.765 align:start size:47% position:53%
No! No! Stop!

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:15.168 align:start size:97% position:3%
This isn't fair, your Rascal's
way faster than mine!

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.903
Oh, yeah, you're right,
I'll handicap myself.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:20.540 align:start position:0%
No, you have a metal flag pole!
This is crazy!

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.875
Hey, you! Gimme this!

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:24.443 size:78% position:39%
Hey, that's my hand, man.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.212
Relax, Shane, I'll give it back.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.215
Do you guys not have anything
more battle-worthy than a--

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:30.850 align:start size:41% position:59% line:85%
Never mind.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:30.850
How do you know my name?

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:34.353 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're in my class, you idiot!
You have very sweaty hands.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.656
Live fast, die slow, bitch!

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.591 align:start size:94% position:6%
That doesn't make any sense,
bitch!

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:39.959
I need my flag.

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.195 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Agh!

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.195 align:start size:47% position:53%
Agh!

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:46.232 line:85%
Agh!

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:46.232 align:start size:44% position:56%
Agh!

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:47.166 align:start size:81% position:19% line:85%
Agh!

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:48.132 align:start size:16% position:84%
Agh!
