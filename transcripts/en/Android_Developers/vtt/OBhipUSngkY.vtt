SPEAKER: In this video, we'll go
over setting up a grace period

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.940
and how to help a user fix
their payment method to recover

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.880
from a grace period.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.930
A grace period for
your subscription

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.090
allows your users
to retain access

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.970
to your content or services
after a payment has

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.230
been missed.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.590
To set up grace period, sign
into the Google Play console,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.180
and select your app.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.040
On the left menu, click Store
Presence, In-app Products.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.196
Then select the Subscriptions
tab, and select a subscription.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.070
You can choose the length
of the grace period

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.510
for that subscription--

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.810
0, 3, or 7 days.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.750
We recommend also enabling
account hold, which is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.000
covered in a subsequent video.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.500
With real-time
developer notifications,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.940
you'll receive a notification
from Google Cloud Pub/Sub

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.250
that a subscription
status has changed.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.340
In this example, it's
entered a grace period.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.530
Call the Google
Play Developer API

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.050
from your server to
verify this change,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.790
and then record this
new subscription

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.910
information on your back end.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.280
Next, you'll want to provide
a message in your app

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.430
that alerts your user
to their account status.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.460
You should also provide them
a deep link to the Google Play

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.330
Subscription Center so the user
can fix their payment method.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.730
For more information on
setting up deep links,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.010
visit the link onscreen.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.710
The user should retain
access to your services

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.930
throughout the grace period.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.510

visit the link onscreen,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.900
