00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now it's time for a quiz to see if you understand the differences between

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
CBC mode and Counter mode.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So the question is: If Alice wants to quickly encrypt a large file

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and she's got a multi-core machine, or she's got access to a large distributed

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
computing resource, which of these two modes will allow her to encrypt the file

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
more quickly? The choices are that it doesn't matter--that CBC mode would

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
be faster or that CTR mode would be faster.
