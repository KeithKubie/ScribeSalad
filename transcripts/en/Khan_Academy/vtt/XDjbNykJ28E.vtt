00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.340
Ken and Isaiah are eating
pumpkin pie with their friends.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.029
They want to figure out how
much pie they have eaten so far.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.120
There are 7 of them in
total and each of them

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.870
has eaten 2/5 of a pie.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.720
Ken said you can
solve this problem

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.455
by multiplying 2/5 times 7.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:17.330
And that makes sense.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.310
Each of them ate 2/5,
and there are 7 folks.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.340
I would multiply 2/5 times 7.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.480
So he multiplied and got 14/35.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.387
Now this is a little
bit suspicious.

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:27.720
And here's the work that he did.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.540
He said 2/5 times 7 is equal
to 2 times 7 over 5 times 7,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.410
which equals 14/35.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.650
So this is starting to
smell real fishy right now.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.250
Isaiah says that 14/35 cannot
be correct because 14/35 is less

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.330
than one whole pie.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.680
So this is definitely
true, that 14/35

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.350
is less than one whole pie.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.820
Which of the following best
explains this situation?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.620
So before even looking
at the explanations,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.150
let's see what's
fishy about this.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
So let me get my little
notepad and write it out.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.069
So he literally took 2/5, and he
attempted to multiply it by 7.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.360
And he said that this is the
same thing as taking the 2

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.160
times the 7, over
the 5 times the 7.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.880
And that's how he got the 14/35.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.300
And I encourage you to pause
this and try to figure out

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.599
why this doesn't
make sense yourself.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.640
Now let's think about what
actually went on here.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.620
If you multiply the
numerator times 7

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.460
and the denominator
by 7, you're actually

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.450
not changing the
value of the fraction.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.820
This is equivalent to saying 2/5
times 7/7, which is equivalent

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.640
to 2/5 times 1, which
is equivalent to 2/5.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.390
14/35 is just another way, it's
an equivalent representation

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.990
of 2/5.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.970
This is just how much pie only
one person should have eaten.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.732
So how should he have
thought about this?

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:53.940
Well, there's a couple of
ways you could think of it.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.800
2/5 times 7 could
literally mean seven 2/5.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.520
It literally could
mean, so 2/5 times 7,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.370
literally means one 2/5, plus
another 2/5, plus another 2/5.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.330
So we do this seven times.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.080
So that's four 2/5.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.990
That's five 2/5.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.710
That's six 2/5.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.640
And that's seven 2/5.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.430
Sorry, my brain isn't working.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.012
And that's seven 2/5.

00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:20.470
And if you were to
add all of these

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.820
together, how many
fifths do you have?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.750
How many fifths do you have?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.802
Well, you have 2 plus
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2.

00:02:29.802 --> 00:02:30.760
Let's see, that's five.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.900
Plus 2, plus 2.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.220
You have 2, seven times, fifths.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.650
Or this is another way of saying
you have 7 times-- let me write

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.420
it this way-- you
have 2 times 7 fifths.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.335
Or another way of saying it
is this is equal to 14/5.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.830
This is well over more than 1.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.460
5 goes into 14 two times, and
you have a remainder of 4.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.290
So it's 2 and 4/5 pie.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.590
So this is what he
should have done.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.730
But you might be saying, well,
how would I just multiply this

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.030
if I didn't even have
to think it through,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.874
adding all these 2/5 together?

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:12.290
Well, one way to
think about it is

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.900
that 7 is the same thing as 7/1.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.160
So he could have just
said 2/5 times 7/1.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.410
7/1 is the exact
same thing as 7.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.190
And that would be
equal to 2 times 7

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.250
in the numerator, which is 14.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.240
And the denominator would be 5
times 1, which is equal to 5.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.360
And you would get
the same answer.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.440
So now let's actually go back
and select the right choice.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.570
I forgot that we actually
had to say which explanation

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.660
is the right explanation.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.440
So explanation 1 is that Ken
didn't multiply correctly.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.254
Multiplying 2/5 times 7 is the
same as adding 2/5 seven times.

00:03:49.254 --> 00:03:50.170
This is exactly right.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.100
This is exactly what
we just went through.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.460
The correct answer
is 14/5 or 2 and 4/5.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.570
So explanation A seems
to be the right one,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.230
but we'll just read
the other ones just

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.810
to see if there's
some flaws in them.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.820
Explanation B, Ken multiplied
correctly but forgot

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.760
to cancel out the
7's in the fractions.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.040
Since 7/7 is equal
to 1, 2/5 times 7

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.610
is equal to 2/5 times 1.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.340
Well, obviously,
2/5 times 7 is not

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.750
the same thing as 2/5 times 1.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.700
So this is kind of nutty.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.060
Explanation C, since Ken
must add up all the pie

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.930
for 7 of them, he should
have added 7 and 2/5

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.450
instead of multiplying.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.510
No, that makes no sense.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.551
He should be multiplying.

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:29.989
Ken is correct.

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:31.780
His friends just didn't
each that much pie.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.600
No, that doesn't
make sense either.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.710
It's explanation A.
