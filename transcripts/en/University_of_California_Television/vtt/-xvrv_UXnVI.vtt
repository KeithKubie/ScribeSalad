00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.130
- It's my pleasure to
introduce Dr. Meghan Miller

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.930
who is an assistant
professor in the department

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.010
of psychiatry and behavioral sciences

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.670
in the the MIND Institute at UC Davis.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.660
I'm not going to read
all your stuff Meghan,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.449
I'm sorry but that's the end of the day.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.911
And Meghan's going to talk to
us about some of her research

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:37.275
on siblings of children with
autism and other topics.

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:41.110
From the MIND Institute Dr. Miller.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.110
(audience clapping)

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.170
- Well thank you very much
for having me here today,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.023
I'm going to be kind of doing.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.435
I'm going to be shifting
gears a little bit I guess

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:56.833
from what you've been
talking about so far.

00:00:58.055 --> 00:00:59.310
And spending some time
talking about autism

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.010
and also talking about very young kids

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.950
all the way up through
adolescents and adulthood.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.758
I have nothing to disclose,
in terms of an overview

00:01:09.758 --> 00:01:13.014
I'm going to tell you a
little bit actually not about

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:14.990
some of my research at the beginning.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.430
I'm going to spend a little
time just to tell you

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.630
about some of the work that's
going on at the MIND Institute

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.810
that I'm not involved
in but I think you might

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.038
have interest in then I'll
talk about we've learned

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:27.498
about early detection
of autism by studying

00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:29.670
younger siblings of children with autism.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.594
Talk a little bit about
longer term outcomes of these

00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:35.514
younger siblings of children
of autism in school age

00:01:35.514 --> 00:01:38.300
which is some work that
I've been involved with

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
Sally Ozonoff at the MIND
Institute at also into

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.420
adulthood which is worked by some other

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.630
folks not at the MIND Institute.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.234
And then I think after the Kagels talk

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:49.620
we'll have some time for questions.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.395
So just to tell you a little
about the MIND Institute

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:55.617
if people aren't familiar it
was founded by six families

00:01:55.617 --> 00:02:00.617
of children with autism and
the research and assessment

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.780
clinics opened in the late '90's.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.416
So it's been around for about 20 years now

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:09.996
in name but the complex
the building itself

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:13.496
was built in 2003 and we
have a number of clinical

00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:16.730
and research projects going
on at the MIND Institute

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.638
spanning a lot of
different areas including

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.980
research on using brain imaging.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.610
So findings about boys
with autism who experience

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.060
regression having larger brain sizes.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.136
Studies looking at risk
factors and protective factors

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:37.136
like the use of folic acid taken
preconception or prenatally

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.594
and that being related to
decreasing risk for autism.

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:43.860
There's studies of animal
models of neurodevelopmental

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.580
disorders and then I'll
talk a little bit about

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.394
studies focused on
early markers of autism.

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.400
There are other folks
at the MIND of course

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.056
that are studying early
interventions for autism as well.

00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:59.010
And I'll talk about two
center grant projects

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.958
that have recently been
awarded to the MIND Institute

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.720
from the National Institutes health.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.550
These are autism centers
of excellence or ACE awards

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.970
and the first one is
led by Dr. David Amaral

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.960
and it's focused on two subgroups
of children with autism.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.271
So one is children with
autism who also experience

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:20.440
significant anxiety and
trying to understand better

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.875
how do identify that,
how do we diagnose it,

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.896
how do we treat it so
combine treatment study

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:28.259
of cognitive behavioral
therapy and medication.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.472
They're also gonna looking
at brain imaging and whether

00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:34.800
their brain changes in
response to treatment.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.660
And then the other subgroup
their focused on is the group

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.834
of children with autism who
also have larger brains.

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:42.390
And this is really kind
of a basic science project

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.590
where they're gonna be trying
to determine which brain

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.035
systems are affected,
they're gonna use stem cells

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:52.135
to grow neurons, to identify
genetic changes that might

00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:55.380
be related to enlarged brains.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.120
So it's kind of a combination
of a clinical and a basic

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.955
science project and then the
other one that I'm gonna spend

00:04:02.955 --> 00:04:05.556
a little more time to tell
you about mostly 'cause

00:04:05.556 --> 00:04:06.900
I'm really excited about
it, I'm not involved in this

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.620
but it's led by Aubyn Stahmer.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.979
And this is focused on kind
of the combined effort to

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.312
identify symptoms early but
also to intervene early.

00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:21.850
And there's good evidence at
this point which I'll tell you

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.156
a bit more about later
that screening early

00:04:25.156 --> 00:04:28.990
can detect autism earlier and the harm

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.937
from screening early
is likely to be small.

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:36.598
But there was this paper
that came out from the U.S.

00:04:36.598 --> 00:04:40.080
preventive services task force suggesting

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.490
actually or concluding that
there is inadequate evidence

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.992
at this point that it has benefit.

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:48.830
That earlier intervention
necessarily has longer term

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.840
benefits or that early
detection has longer term

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.600
benefits when it comes
to early intervention.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.430
There's a lack of research
studies that are focused

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.879
on treating cases of children
who have been identified

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.335
by early screening and so this
is a really big limitation

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:09.310
in trying to understand that
pipeline of early detection

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.730
to early intervention and
how that impacts outcomes.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.330
So that's what this particular
ACE project is trying

00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:18.450
to address this pipeline
of early screening

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.115
to early intervention and
then proving outcome overtime.

00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:26.270
And this is a busy slide
but just to give you a sense

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.478
of what the study looks like,
they're actually intervening

00:05:29.478 --> 00:05:33.213
firstly on providers, so
they're assigning providers

00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:38.213
to either screen in a standardized
way, routine surveillance

00:05:39.097 --> 00:05:43.434
or as usual how their
practice does autism screening

00:05:43.434 --> 00:05:46.060
early in the first three years of life.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.977
And then they're taking
the screen positive cases

00:05:48.977 --> 00:05:51.440
and doing early intervention,
early start denver

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.853
model with these cases and
looking at various outcomes.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.310
So the screening is
universal, they're screening

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.737
all children, the 18 month
checkup in the intervention

00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:05.060
group meaning they're
intervening on the providers

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:08.261
and training them how to do this.

00:06:08.261 --> 00:06:10.258
They're standardized so
they're screening the same way

00:06:10.258 --> 00:06:13.290
using the Mchat and it's high fidelity.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.460
So their goal is to avoid
all the common errors,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.310
to encourage all screen
positive families to attend

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.917
a fuller evaluation and
potentially into their treatment.

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:28.579
So what they do after
there's a positive screen

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:30.940
or there's provider concerns,
they'll do an evaluation

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.117
if it's determined that
yes this child has autism.

00:06:34.117 --> 00:06:36.810
They'll do a year of
intensive treatment and then

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.277
they'll document their
progress a year later

00:06:39.277 --> 00:06:41.850
to see if this really
standardized high fidelity

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.717
way of doing early screening
has a higher probability

00:06:44.717 --> 00:06:47.420
of getting kids into early intervention

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.342
and a higher probability
of improved outcomes.

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:53.320
We also have some clinics
at the MIND Institute

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.260
related to assessment
and diagnosis of various

00:06:57.952 --> 00:06:59.800
neurodevelopmental disorders,
social skills programs.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.113
So the big focus at the MIND
has been autism but we also

00:07:03.113 --> 00:07:07.014
have research and clinical
services related to ADHD,

00:07:07.014 --> 00:07:11.090
genetic syndrome and so
on and then we have also

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.712
have some educational
and outreach programs.

00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:16.730
Centers for excellence in
developmental disabilities,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.640
we have a post doctoral training program.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.300
The autism research training
program and we're a LEND

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.050
site, Leadership Education in
Neurodevelopmental Disorders

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.820
as well and then also have a developmental

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.212
and behavioral pediatrics
fellowship program.

00:07:30.212 --> 00:07:33.972
So now I'm gonna move into
talking a bit about early

00:07:33.972 --> 00:07:38.972
detection of ASD and I've
sort of alluded to this

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.675
all ready but one of the
first questions is why.

00:07:41.675 --> 00:07:44.055
Why do we care about early
detection and the idea

00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:48.212
is we think that early
identification will result

00:07:48.212 --> 00:07:52.490
in earlier treatment and
hopefully improved outcomes.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.190
Now that ACE project led by
Dr. Stahmer will hopefully

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.355
prove that that's truly
correct and provide

00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:59.595
us really solid evidence
of that but that's

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:03.972
a strongly held belief in
the field and probably true.

00:08:03.972 --> 00:08:08.435
But more broadly it
could also have an impact

00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:12.040
on decreasing service utilization cost

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.392
and economic broaden more broadly.

00:08:14.392 --> 00:08:18.850
One of the big challenges
related to early detection

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.930
or one of the critique's
people might have is the risk

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.917
of false positives, so
identifying a child as having

00:08:24.917 --> 00:08:28.051
autism, referring for treatment
but in fact we were wrong.

00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:30.693
They didn't have autism and
they were just really young

00:08:30.693 --> 00:08:34.913
but in general the interventions
that are commonly used

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:37.252
we tend to think that the benefits

00:08:37.252 --> 00:08:40.654
likely outweigh that negative.

00:08:40.654 --> 00:08:45.270
And really focusing on
infancy and early childhood

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.240
is a great time period
to try to understand how

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.055
these conditions develop
and to help with improving

00:08:52.055 --> 00:08:56.400
accurate earlier detection,
identifying the time periods

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.710
that are most important for identification

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.700
and maybe early intervention
and what areas of functioning

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.940
are the most relevant in
this developmental period

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.874
that might help us
identify autism earlier.

00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:11.840
So the next question is how do we do it.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.730
And what I'm gonna tell
you about is one particular

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.020
study design that gets
used to try to identify

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.593
early signs of autism and
this is focused on siblings.

00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:25.350
So it's called an infant
sibling study design

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.670
and what we do is we study families.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.990
So we have the parents here
and then they have a child

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.880
with autism and then the family has a baby

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.320
and this baby is considered
to at elevated risk

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.935
for autism based on
family history genetics.

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:43.410
So we know the recurrent
rate of autism in younger

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.870
siblings of children with
autism is significantly higher

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.580
than the rate in the general population.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.812
And then we have our
comparison group of babies

00:09:51.812 --> 00:09:54.894
who have only typically
developing older siblings,

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:57.194
no family history of
autism spectrum disorder.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.950
And then we have them come
into the lab for assessments

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.192
at regular intervals in the
first several years of life

00:10:05.192 --> 00:10:10.109
so they would come in at
six, nine, 12, 15, 18,

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:13.110
24 and 36 months of life
and we'll do a whole

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.110
range of assessments with them.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.780
Developmental assessments,
we'll do some eye tracking

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.260
assessments to see kind
of what they'll focus on

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.520
and are interested in, parents
will fill out a variety

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.740
of questionnaires,
starting at 18 months we'll

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.446
do an ADOS which is the Autism
Diagnostic Observation skill

00:10:31.446 --> 00:10:34.693
and then when they turn three
we'll determine which babies

00:10:34.693 --> 00:10:38.173
went on and developed autism by age three.

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:41.630
And which babies ended being
typically developing and then

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.280
we could go back and look at
all of the data and see where

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.129
the difference is between
those groups of children begin

00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:48.712
to emerge and in what
areas of functioning.

00:10:48.712 --> 00:10:53.710
So I'll just say that if a
child meets criteria before

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.726
age we will certainly make
the diagnosis and provide

00:10:56.726 --> 00:10:59.750
referrals and recommendations
but kind of the final

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.632
determination for the
studies at age three.

00:11:02.632 --> 00:11:07.570
Interesting I think excitingly
Sally Ozonoff has gotten

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.952
a follow up grant to study
cohorts of these babies

00:11:09.952 --> 00:11:14.952
into school age period, so
now they're between seven

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.068
and fourteen and we're seeing them back

00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:21.270
to see how they're functioning
later in development.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.770
Whether they develop autism
or not so all of them.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.870
So in terms of what we're
learning from siblings

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.640
in the infancy period,
we're learning about

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.120
the recurrence risk for autism,
we're learning about how

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.549
symptoms emerge on onset,
what are the early markers.

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:40.050
I'm not gonna talk
about biological markers

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.890
but some studies using
this study design do study,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.580
they do brain scans or
EEG I'll talk a bit about

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.410
some of the behavioral markers.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.810
And then we can learn more about target

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.233
for prevention and intervention programs.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.810
So in terms of recurrence
risk, previously it was thought

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.850
that about three to 10% of
younger siblings of children

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.450
with autism would
develop autism themselves

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.440
which is significantly
higher than the population

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.252
prevalence but through these
infant sibling study design

00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:15.520
there's a consortium
across the globe really

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.010
with multiple investigators
involved called the baby

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.780
siblings research consortium
and they've pooled their data.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.071
They all sort of follow
this study design to answer

00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:27.410
this question of what's
the updated recurrence rate

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.253
in these samples that we get
from these types of studies.

00:12:30.253 --> 00:12:33.580
And it's much closer to
20% at least in these

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.133
infant sibling samples that we've studied

00:12:36.133 --> 00:12:38.670
which is significantly
higher than we thought

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.240
and certainly significantly
higher than the general

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.200
population prevalence
of about one and a half

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.053
percent which was referenced earlier.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.300
So that has some implications
I think about kind

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.900
of what families are thinking
about and I think it's helpful

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.710
to know just so you can monitor
and watch for early signs.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.600
In terms of those early
signs and in terms of early

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.440
behavioral markers that
we might be looking for

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.520
especially thinking about
the symptoms of autism,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.970
social communication
challenges and then also

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.130
thinking about infancy or early childhood.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.040
We're really looking for
things like differences

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.693
in eye gaze, differences in
frequency of vocalization,

00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:20.135
smiling or sharing their
affect with other people.

00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:23.530
Responding to their names,
I'm gonna show you a little

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.615
bit of data about each of these
things that we've collected

00:13:25.615 --> 00:13:28.372
through these studies and
this data was collected

00:13:28.372 --> 00:13:31.193
through Sally Ozonoff
infant sibling studies.

00:13:31.193 --> 00:13:35.472
And this was a paper she
published in 2010 where they

00:13:35.472 --> 00:13:39.920
collected the data on these babies between

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.775
six and 36 months of age
and they video recorded

00:13:42.775 --> 00:13:46.120
all of the assessments and
then they had people who

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.893
are trained up to really
high fidelity and reliability

00:13:48.893 --> 00:13:52.173
to code very specific behaviors
that they saw in the videos.

00:13:52.173 --> 00:13:57.095
Things like eye contact or
gazing into the face of the other

00:13:57.095 --> 00:14:02.080
person in the video or
directing their smiles

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.380
to the other person or vocalizing.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.150
And what you can see is this
group in red is the group

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.500
who went on to be diagnosed
with ASD by age three.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.892
And you could see that in
these basic building block

00:14:15.892 --> 00:14:18.342
social communication
behaviors, you see declining

00:14:19.311 --> 00:14:21.270
trajectories or sort of
low flat trajectories

00:14:22.574 --> 00:14:23.443
in the group who went
on to develop autism.

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:26.460
And the differences really
begin to emerge between

00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:30.410
12 and 18 months of age or we
see these changes happening.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.130
What I think is really
interesting and especially

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.550
for clinicians is that when
we ask clinicians to rate

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.234
very similar behaviors after
they have assessed the child

00:14:39.234 --> 00:14:42.880
and these are blind examiners
they don't know anything

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.510
about the family history, they
don't know whether they're

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.240
at risk for autism or
not at risk for autism.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.600
You see a really similar
pattern in these declining

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.650
trajectories of the examiner
or expert kind of clinician

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.480
ratings with the
differences really becoming

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.440
most different between 12 and 18 months.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.220
So I think we can kind of get
at the same thing that this

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.213
pain staking really takes a
long time to do this coding

00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:06.935
we can get at the same thing
from the clinician ratings.

00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:11.935
In terms of another social
behavior that we've noticed

00:15:12.613 --> 00:15:15.312
is different in infants who
are going on to develop autism

00:15:15.312 --> 00:15:20.312
it's response to names, so
we know that infants use

00:15:20.732 --> 00:15:22.630
their names as social cues
which helps them to orient

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.460
to salient aspects of
their environment including

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.393
social partners and what
has been shown in the past

00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:33.840
is that there has been a
diminishment in the response

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.730
to name by about 12 months of age.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.730
And this was found in
babies who developed autism

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.730
but this was found using retrospective

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:47.730
chart review or videos basically
or paper pencil measures

00:15:47.773 --> 00:15:51.093
that parents fill out and
so we really wanted to look

00:15:51.093 --> 00:15:54.513
at this from our
prospectively collected data.

00:15:54.513 --> 00:15:57.911
And kind of overtime so the
developmental progression

00:15:57.911 --> 00:16:02.250
of responding to name and what we found.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.500
So we used a measure from
it's the AOSI, it's a task

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.400
that this is an item from
that task where examiner

00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:13.072
calls the baby's name up to two times

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.627
and there are two trials like that.

00:16:15.627 --> 00:16:17.860
So up to four total times at
different intervals during

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.710
the assessment and we
were pretty stringent

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.120
in our definition of a
failure so to fail we said

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.673
that they had to not respond
to any of the four trials.

00:16:26.673 --> 00:16:30.450
And what we found was that the
group who went on to develop

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:33.900
autism was more likely to
fail by nine months of age

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.320
and persisting through 24 months of age.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.190
So this appears to be
distinguishing that group

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.183
as early as nine months of age.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.410
So ultimately I think this
work focused on infants

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.434
at risk for autism has
kind of resulted in a lot

00:16:49.434 --> 00:16:53.510
important information
for clinical practice

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.071
and I think that it has made
its way into clinical practice.

00:16:56.071 --> 00:17:00.700
Related to red flags and
early screenings for autism

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.820
in the first couple of years of life.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.410
So I think families know
a lot more because they've

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.090
heard a lot more about these early signs,

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.160
they're watching for it, the
American Academy of Pediatrics

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.831
have implemented kind of
regular or universal screening

00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:17.530
at specific intervals with recommended

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.350
measures early in life
so I think it has some

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.815
significant clinical impact thus far.

00:17:24.815 --> 00:17:29.640
Now I mentioned earlier
that about just under 20%

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.540
of these infant siblings
go on to develop autism

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.670
by age three but so if you do your math

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.210
it means most of them don't, right.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.480
So there's a question about
what about all of these

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.113
other children who were at
risk but did not develop autism

00:17:43.113 --> 00:17:47.440
and so we've been interested
in this concept of the broader

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.600
autism phenotype so
sort of non diagnostic,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.771
sub clinical, more like
traits or characteristics

00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:57.110
that are kind of inline with
autism spectrum disorder.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.610
So sub threshold social
communication challenges

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.680
for example but are not
at the clinical level.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.595
And we see this sometimes in
family members of individuals

00:18:05.595 --> 00:18:08.655
with autism and we were
interested in trying to understand

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:13.653
how early can we identify
those sub clinical differences.

00:18:13.653 --> 00:18:18.210
So what we did was we
characterized our sample of these

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.140
babies when they were three,
whether they were typically

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.650
developing or non
typically developing based

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.060
on their MULLEN standardized
developing scores

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.350
and or ADOS scores being
within several points

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:37.280
of the autism cut off and
then looked backward to see

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.940
where did that group of
children start to differ

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.170
from the children who
were typically developing.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.180
And the answer was around 12 months of age

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.240
that we say differences, so
again we can see differences

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.330
in these children who are
experiencing some threshold

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.928
challenges even earlier
than we kind of expected.

00:18:54.928 --> 00:18:59.928
So now the question is
that's up to age three

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.730
and there's been a lot of
work across all of these

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.760
baby sibling consortium
sights to study these infant

00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:10.480
siblings up to age three
but then it sort of stopped.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.195
And of course we all know that
children continue to develop

00:19:13.195 --> 00:19:16.330
and that's one of the reasons
that we've been interested

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.160
and Sally Ozonoff has been
interested in understanding

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.970
some of the longer term outcomes of these

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.893
siblings beyond the preschool period.

00:19:23.893 --> 00:19:28.833
And again 80% of younger
siblings don't develop autism

00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:32.820
but are there risks for
other things that come along

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.348
later in life, that's a
question that's worth answering

00:19:35.348 --> 00:19:39.500
and the answer is generally yeah.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.893
So about 35% we found of
children develop some other

00:19:42.893 --> 00:19:47.660
non ASD concern by school age
that doesn't mean diagnosable

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.308
but some level of concern
across a variety of different

00:19:50.308 --> 00:19:52.593
measures so I'll give you some examples.

00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:57.593
This is sort of a pilot
project that was looking

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.330
at one cohort of these baby
siblings when they were

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.870
six to eight years of age,
so they had grown up into

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.820
that early school age period
and what we found here

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.730
is kind of when we looked
at it different ways we kind

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.180
of found the same thing
whether we were looking

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.492
at clinical concerns as
expressed by a clinician

00:20:16.492 --> 00:20:21.492
who assessed the child or
scores above clinical cutoff

00:20:21.873 --> 00:20:25.530
on measures of psycho pathology
symptoms like depression,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:30.530
anxiety or autism related
symptoms or language scores

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.810
on standardized language testing.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.090
We see a higher proportion
of the group who has a family

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.780
history of autism falling
into that impaired

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.880
or concerning range and
these are the children

00:20:43.834 --> 00:20:45.680
who do not have autism themselves.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.896
So I like I said anywhere
from 25 to 40% of these

00:20:48.896 --> 00:20:51.950
siblings were falling into these sort

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.254
of elevated or clinical concern ranges.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:58.130
Now one of the things that was
coming up in that age range

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.516
a lot for us was concerns
about ADHD and so we

00:21:01.516 --> 00:21:05.115
did another sort of smaller
pilot where we looked

00:21:05.115 --> 00:21:07.470
at eight to 11 years of age
and really tried to do a better

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.353
job of characterizing ADHD
and I think there is some

00:21:12.353 --> 00:21:16.893
caveat I would mention
here, you could see a pretty

00:21:16.893 --> 00:21:20.597
high rate of ADHD in our low risk group.

00:21:20.597 --> 00:21:23.813
So it's certainly
possible that the families

00:21:23.813 --> 00:21:25.480
that are most concerned
are the ones who came back

00:21:26.454 --> 00:21:28.740
really easily but there
is a difference in terms

00:21:30.076 --> 00:21:31.970
of the group that had a
family history of autism had

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.515
significantly higher rates of
ADHD than our low risk group.

00:21:35.515 --> 00:21:40.515
So that kind of piqued our
interest and led to the current

00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:45.036
follow up that we're
doing a little bit older,

00:21:45.036 --> 00:21:49.547
12 to 15 years of age
for most of the children,

00:21:49.547 --> 00:21:52.960
some of them may come in
a little earlier than that

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.011
maybe eight to 15 in the end
across three different cohorts

00:21:57.011 --> 00:22:00.350
that had been recruited in
the last 15 years or so.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:04.350
And we're doing more comprehensive
assessments of symptoms

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.616
of psychopathology like
ADHD, anxiety, mood concerns,

00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:12.470
so we're doing a full diagnostic
workup on those things.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.110
We're also assessing academic
skills, pragmatic language

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.593
abilities which we know are
challenging for children

00:22:19.593 --> 00:22:21.660
with autism but also there's
suggestion that it may

00:22:22.635 --> 00:22:24.490
be an area that's a little
bit challenging for siblings

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:28.091
who don't have autism, we're
kind of doing a deep dive

00:22:28.091 --> 00:22:29.880
into their attention skill,
their activity level,

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.274
their ability to control
their inhibitions.

00:22:33.274 --> 00:22:38.200
Or kind of inhibit the responses
and then lastly I think

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.050
really importantly their
peer relationships and social

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.740
functioning so we're having
teachers fill out ratings

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.250
about how well the child
is liked and how what their

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.000
social skills are like, how many friends

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.350
they have those kinds of things.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.940
And one of the reasons we're
really interested in doing

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.960
this is because we really want
to understand how siblings

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.890
are functioning later in
development but we also see

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.870
these higher rates of other
kind of concerns outcomes

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.680
in this population and so
our thinking is that we might

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.210
be able by following them up
to use the data that we've

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.410
been collecting for the last
15 year for their whole lives

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.390
really to predict other
non autism outcomes.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.350
Like what might be early
markers of ADHD, what might

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.731
be early markers of
anxiety in these siblings.

00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:26.553
So I don't know if we'll
get to adulthood through

00:23:26.553 --> 00:23:28.893
following these same
cohorts but there have been

00:23:28.893 --> 00:23:33.893
certainly studies of
adult siblings of children

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.350
with autism, this is not work
that we've done ourselves.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.160
But there was a study a
few years back by Holland

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.096
where they looked at 87
adult siblings of children

00:23:44.096 --> 00:23:47.236
with autism, the average
age was just under 40.

00:23:47.236 --> 00:23:51.155
And they had a group within
this group of siblings

00:23:51.155 --> 00:23:55.300
a sub group that had previously
been evaluated at a prior

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.920
time point and identified
as either having that kind

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.991
of broader autism phenotype
traits and sub threshold

00:24:02.991 --> 00:24:07.811
symptoms or traits
characteristics were unaffected

00:24:07.811 --> 00:24:12.000
or typically developing and
when they followed them up

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.460
at this adult time point
what they found was that

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.490
the previously determined
or defined unaffected group

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:22.194
had average intellectual
functioning, basic academic skills.

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:25.332
They were functioning really well in jobs,

00:24:25.332 --> 00:24:28.180
in their independence and
their social relationships,

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.592
so they were just functioning
average or above average.

00:24:31.592 --> 00:24:34.870
The group that had been
previously identified as having

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.960
some of these sub threshold
characteristics had some

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.740
challenges with employment,
they had lower social

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:45.180
relationship levels and
they had elevated ASD traits

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.900
as would be expected as
well as elevated rates

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.270
of other mental health symptoms.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.553
So this is I hope you can
see it relatively well,

00:24:53.553 --> 00:24:57.175
but the group in pink is
that group that had the

00:24:57.175 --> 00:25:00.230
sub threshold autism
traits in an earlier age

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.420
and what you can see here
is that they're elevated

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.030
across several different
aspects of functioning

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:12.790
so OCD symptoms, so
episodic depression symptoms

00:25:13.934 --> 00:25:18.096
was the same but chronic
depression symptoms was different,

00:25:18.096 --> 00:25:23.096
higher levels of anxiety and
higher rates of being above

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.734
a clinical threshold for
ADHD and these were symptoms

00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:29.730
here that actually had
the required treatment.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.909
So this was significantly
elevated symptoms,

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:34.913
so there do seem to be some
concerns that persist across

00:25:34.913 --> 00:25:38.870
the lifespan for a subset
of siblings of children

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.563
with autism who don't
have autism themselves.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.652
So just to summarize here
I would say that we've made

00:25:45.652 --> 00:25:48.610
a lot of progress by studying
siblings in the early

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.450
detection of autism spectrum disorder.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.740
That I do think have clear
implications for clinical

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.060
practice especially for
those of us who are working

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.950
in the early intervention,
early identification role.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.610
The birth to three world
and I think as a result

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.250
of studying these baby
siblings we're realizing that

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.210
there's a really big
gap here that we really

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.840
don't know about longer term outcomes.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.890
We've sort of just kind
of cut them off at three

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.792
and then moved on but we have
this opportunity to really

00:26:15.792 --> 00:26:20.792
understand the full developmental
life course by continuing

00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:25.250
to follow up these siblings
who have truly been enrolled

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:29.430
in these studies since the
beginning of their lives

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.230
which is pretty amazing, and
this could help us really

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.674
understand early predictors
of other outcomes

00:26:35.674 --> 00:26:38.730
later in life like ADHD for example.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.960
I think the other thing we
really need to do more of is try

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.800
to understand resilience
and protective factors

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.770
and I think these studies,
these samples really provide

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.680
an opportunity for that as well.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.010
And so I think we'll
probably start to see more

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.763
of that over the next few years.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.880
I just wanna put a plug out
because we're not too far

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.348
from the MIND Institute for
a study that I'm currently

00:27:03.348 --> 00:27:06.210
doing and we have lots
of families who enroll

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.935
from the Bay Area but if you
have any clients or patients

00:27:09.935 --> 00:27:13.180
or know any families
that might be interested

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.420
in this type of work where
we do kind of regular

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.960
close monitoring of
the babies development.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.416
We're recruiting babies and
we're doing an infant sibling

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:27.110
study that's kind of combined
across autism risk and ADHD.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.660
So we're also studying babies
at risk for ADHD to see

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.680
if we can apply the same
methods that have been so useful

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.170
in autism that have been
used to identify some early

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.480
markers of ADHD as well,
so there's information

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.495
there if you're interested,
so I'll just like to thank

00:27:41.495 --> 00:27:45.670
the early risk study lab
which is my lab and the

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.780
infant sibling study which
is Sally Ozonoff's study.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.810
A lot of the data that I
shared with you today is from

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.700
her research that I have
just been fortunate to be

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.730
a part of for the last several years.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.937
As well as funding sources
and my contact information

00:27:57.937 --> 00:28:00.929
is available here if you
have any follow up questions.

00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:03.488
And I think there will
be a few minutes after

00:28:03.488 --> 00:28:08.153
the Kagel's talk now, thank you very much.

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:11.153
