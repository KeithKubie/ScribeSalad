00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.229
You might know me from somewhere.

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:07.330
I’m always nervous that I won't have enough
time to do my work.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.920
I just want to be left alone so I can get
on with it.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.700
When people ask me to do things, even going
for a walk in the park, I’m always saying,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.250
‘I don’t have enough time…’

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.910
I have so much to do!

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.859
So it's great when, at last, I've got a clear
day.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.639
The house is quiet.
I've got eight hours. That should be plenty.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.440
But when there’s so much time, it seems
silly not to read this article in the paper.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.700
It’s about a celebrity - he just got married.
She’s pretty…

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.900
I might just look up what film she was in
online.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.270
… interesting…

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.340
Wonder what they’re saying over on this
website…

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.820
...a volcano… in Indonesia… wow...

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.300
Oh, Poor things...

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.290
I’m peckish now.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.400
It's hard to stop, when there's nothing else

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.280
to do that's as nice.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.900
Some people say I should go out and take a
break.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.480
Why not go for a walk? But you see I like to be near my work.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.840
If I’m too far, I get guilty.
But if I’m too near, well…

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.130
The perfect distance for doing nothing is
when you have the constant chance to do something.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.909
It’s a bit frightening to be honest.
Someone told me an average life only has 600,000

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.969
hours in it.
So many people around me are getting on, doing stuff.

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.900
But if you scare me too much with all this,
I get sad.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.380
I lie down and think I'm so hopeless there’s
no point getting up.

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:46.200
I'm ashamed.
I don't like myself much.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.939
It seems like I'm lazy.
That's what everyone would say, I know.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.619
But in truth, I do nothing, not because I'm
lazy, but because I’m scared.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.840
I'm terrified that if I start, what I do will
be horrible.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.179
I want things to be so amazing - and I know
they can't be, so it seems best not even to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.700
begin.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.250
What helps me most is when occasionally, it
feels like it doesn't matter...

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.620
When it feels I can mess up and that would
be OK.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.640
When the pressure isn’t so great.
Like when I was younger - and there was less at stake

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.140
There's a bit of me inside you.
It's best to try to understand me.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.459
And not scare me with perfection.
Go gently...

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.019
Once you've worked out how I work, you’ll
get a lot more done.
