00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
[inaudible] joining me today is an author,

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:10.220
a speaker,
and the president of the Reagan Legacy Foundation.
Mike,
Greg,

3
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:12.810
and welcome to the Rubin report.
Hey,
good to be with you.
Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.100
I am glad to have you here.
You come from a famous family.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
Is that fair to say?
They tell me,
you know what,
I tell people and love you.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.620
They say famous family,
but they don't understand how absolutely famous to this.

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.173
There's only,

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.240
there's only two people ever born and or raised in a family that the mother

9
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.960
would go on to become an academy award winning actress,

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.230
and the father would go on to become president of the United States.

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.300
And that's my sister,
Maureen passed away in 2001 and myself.

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.220
No one else has lived that life.

13
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.540
And so that makes it more understandable to me why people always say,

14
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:53.580
so tell me about your family.
Yeah.
You know,

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.210
no matter what I've done in life would tell me about your family.
Well,

16
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:00.150
it's truly a,
I don't even know if bizarre is the word,

17
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.920
but it seemingly is a bizarre level of fame because there's a political element

18
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:07.710
and the Hollywood element,
and you combine those two things,

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.820
and especially the way these days where politics and Hollywood have become the

20
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.570
same thing.
It's,
it's a unique place.
It is a unique place.

21
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.870
I like to tell people about my mom,
Jane Wyman,
you know,
I say,
you know,

22
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.740
but my mother has two stars on the Hollywood walk of fame.
My Dad only has one,

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.980
and my mother also has her hand prints and footprints are Grumman's.

24
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.830
Chinese dad does not.
Wow.
So in Hollywood,

25
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:33.600
she won the game politics.
He did.
Yeah.
All right,
so let's,
let's do a little,

26
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:36.690
we're going to spend the first half doing a little bio and talking about your

27
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:38.100
dad and your mom and the family and all that.

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.330
So just tell me a little bit about just growing up.
You've grow.
Yeah.
Well,

29
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:46.740
you know it growing up it shit because people think,
hey,
you're so lucky.

30
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.270
I used to get that school.
You're so lucky.

31
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.000
Your parents are rich or famous and you go,
yeah,

32
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.840
but I'm boarding at school at six years old and that's what a lot of people

33
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.540
don't understand.
That era of Hollywood children,

34
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:01.470
that's what we all grew up mad at.
Our parents,
because we're boarding school,

35
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.910
six years old,
I'm at Chad Reese school,
Rancho Ponte,
pals,
Verdi's.

36
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:07.710
My sister's four years older than me.

37
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.950
She's there also and people are saying how lucky you are as you're crying

38
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.620
yourself to sleep every night.
And so we did.

39
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:18.621
We grew up angry because we're very jealous of the parents or the children who

40
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:23.460
got dropped off by their moms and dads every single day at school and then got

41
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:27.720
picked up and we didn't get picked up.
And so we grew up a little,

42
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.100
a little angst,
if you will.

43
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:34.070
Some of us wrote books about those those days and that era as well that,

44
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.290
what were your folks doing at that time?
Well,
my mom,
my mom was an actress.

45
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:42.291
She just won an academy award in 1948 best actress back in 48 my dad was,

46
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.040
you know,
doing Hollywood.

47
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:47.430
He was president of screen actors guild dealing with all those issues.

48
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:51.980
They got divorced and in 1948 so I was living with my mom at that time in,

49
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.130
in Beverly Hills.
I say to my mom,
mom,
I want to be in your business.

50
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.840
And she would say,
no,
no,
it's,

51
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:00.350
if you don't want to be in this business is really tough.
You know,

52
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.460
it's a tough grind.
You never know if you're going to make it.

53
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.970
And I'm thinking to myself,
I'm living in a mansion in Beverly Hills.

54
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.900
We've got a maid,
we got to cook.
I've got a Cadillac,

55
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.950
two stories.
I said,
I kind of liked this industry.

56
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.450
Maybe you just don't want the competition from a child.
And,
and so that's,

57
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.170
that's what I grew up.
But you know something,
it was really,

58
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.060
it was really a great life in so many levels because my parents never forgot

59
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.080
where they were from.
My mom was from Saint Joe,
Missouri.

60
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.390
My Dad from Tampico,
Illinois.

61
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.170
And they brought those values with them when they came to California.

62
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.790
So Maureen and I,

63
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.820
even though not liking boarding at school and being angry at times and missing

64
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:48.040
our parents terribly,
uh,

65
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.130
really got grounded well with both my mom and my dad because my dad even

66
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.390
divorced from my mother.

67
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.110
Never forgot he had another family even after he married Nancy.

68
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.480
So when did your dad get involved in politics?
When was that shit?

69
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.520
Well,
use was when he became president of screen actors guild.
Very,

70
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.050
very to golf with that.
Yeah.
And it's like,
what year is that?
That's around 19,

71
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:18.260
1950s.
Late forties to 50s or what have you.
Yeah,

72
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.190
well a lot of people don't know.

73
00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:22.630
We got involved more and more in politics because of things kept on happening to

74
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:26.890
him.
You know,
he uh,
uh,
was the king of the bees.

75
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:30.690
My mom was the king of the A's,
if you will,
at the time.
Uh,

76
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.630
so his career wasn't going really well.
It wasn't magic,
if you will.

77
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.370
He had to go to Las Vegas to do a stand up act at a hotel in Vegas to make
money.

78
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.950
They have to have the family be able to eat.

79
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.760
There's no video of that because their Pasta,
oh,

80
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:47.950
there probably is video somewhere on that.
Credible.
But again,
you know,

81
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:52.060
back then the parents didn't share what their children to tough times.

82
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:56.200
Now parents tell everything to their children.
Uh,
which is crazy.

83
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:58.930
That's a whole other show.
But it really is.
But you know,

84
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:03.070
we never knew until later on that tough things dad was going through.

85
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.780
Ended up getting a show,
General Electric Theater,
if you will.
Out of that,

86
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.170
he's doing GE theater and going around the country and speaking to General

87
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.130
Electric Plants.
Bobby candy picks up the phone,

88
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.380
calls the president of General Electric and says,
we have a problem.

89
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.070
The President of Ge is,
why is the attorney general calling me?

90
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.870
And the problem is this,

91
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:30.871
Ronald Reagan's going around the country speaking not well of his brother John

92
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.740
Candy at these plants about government.
And Bobby Kennedy says to him,

93
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.070
basically,
you know,
your,
your,

94
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.840
your government contracts are coming up for renewal.

95
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.160
And if you could find a way to get rid of that guy,

96
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.510
you could probably get your government contracts renewed within 72 hours.

97
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.790
My father,
a Democrat at the time.
Yeah.

98
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.300
General Electric Theater is canceled.
Ronald Reagan doesn't have a job.

99
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.430
So what does he do?
Changes to Republican.
Yeah.

100
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.460
So that was the moment that was the moment changes to a Republican and then he

101
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:13.640
has time to sit down cause he not giving the speeches anymore and he combines

102
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.960
all the speeches he's been giving and he ends up with a brand new speech.

103
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.010
You might've heard of it,

104
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.400
a time for choosing and gives it for Barry Goldwater in 1964 and the rest is

105
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:28.190
history.
Bobby Kennedy does not make that phone call.

106
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.610
My Dad's not doing anything for Goldwater because he's too busy hosting one of

107
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:38.000
the top 10 television shows on Sunday night on TV.

108
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.950
It's such an incredible story because in an odd way,

109
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:44.840
he was almost forced into the real part of his political career.

110
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.170
Yeah.
He never,
he never thought he was gonna run for governor or president.

111
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:50.760
I'd states whatever.
He needed a job.
Yeah.

112
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.990
And he was forced out of the job and you had the job and was made very angry by

113
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.770
Bobby Kennedy and it forced him to go to the other other side,

114
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:02.840
if you will.
And really,
as I said,

115
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:05.750
the rest of his pick your folks talk politics at all.
Oh No.

116
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.650
I called my mom one time after my dad gave one of those great speeches he gave.

117
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.730
I said,
Monte,
just here,
dad's speech last night.
She says,
no,

118
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:17.780
I heard it in 1938 didn't like it.
They don't think much of it now.

119
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.310
But interestingly enough,

120
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.760
you know that I found after she passed going through were things she'd written

121
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:29.540
letters to my dad.
She'd sent money to his campaigns for governor,

122
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.290
for President United States.
Returned letters from my father to my mom.

123
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.423
Never knew,

124
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.430
cause she never really talked politics at all during your years in television.

125
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:41.390
She's stayed completely away from it.

126
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.710
And she never say anything about my dad when he was president until the day we

127
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:48.200
buried him.
And then she said some very nice kind things.

128
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.550
What year did your folks get divorced?
1948 they were married.

129
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:57.110
1940 divorced in 1948 men on a set of a movie.

130
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.610
So,
all right,
so let's flash forward a little bit to now your dad.
Now it's,

131
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:05.810
you know,
late seventies,
and now he's sort of the it guy.

132
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.410
What was that like different,
you know,

133
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:13.220
we had my dad got an anything in that 20 year.
Oh yeah.

134
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.320
Here you're never,

135
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.970
you're never ready for a man or anybody in your home to become president United

136
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.210
States of America because secret service comes into your house.
Uh,

137
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.110
I went all over the country in 19 eight,
well 76 and 80,

138
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.760
I think the last month of 1980,
66 airplane rides,

139
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:32.870
19 states.

140
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.400
My sister Maureen was doing this very same thing and you know,

141
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:42.020
he gets elected in three days later.
I've got secret service in my life.
Uh,

142
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.770
and our son gets secret service at that time.

143
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.540
He was like too,
they ended up going to school with him.
Uh,

144
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.950
it really changes your life completely.
Uh,
anonymity,

145
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.050
don't have a,
you can't really go anywhere.

146
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:01.980
You got to tell somebody you're going there and have the secret service follow

147
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:06.690
you wherever you go.
It's not the easiest life in the world.

148
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.410
If you're gonna imagine a three year old going to preschool with secret service

149
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.800
protection,
um,
or my wife Colleen,

150
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:17.910
when she gave birth to our daughter Ashley,
we found out her code name,
which was,

151
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.890
you know,
raindrop before we knew she was a girl.
Huh?
I mean,

152
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:27.510
the first thing my wife heard as ash,
who was being born was,
we have an arrival.

153
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.840
Raindrop has arrived.
We have an arrival.
Raindrop has arrived.

154
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.610
And my wife looked at me,
she said,

155
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.900
is there anything private about my life anymore?
I said,
no,
not really.
Yeah,
boy,

156
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:41.340
that's where children stop with two because that's never gonna happen again.

157
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.280
But we found out her code name before we found out she was a girl.

158
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.470
How did that wear on you guys?

159
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:50.370
Once that level of fame and that level of intrusiveness,
if,
if you can,

160
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.070
if you can keep a marriage together for eight years with secret service

161
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:55.320
protection,
your marriage will last forever.

162
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.140
And we just had our 43rd wedding anniversary.

163
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.060
We celebrated our 45th year of our first date last December 7th.

164
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.171
It's very,

165
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:08.250
very tough because secret service has given to blood relatives downward,

166
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.510
not given the spouses.
So clean didn't have secret service.

167
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.730
We did.
Huh.
And,
and it's very different,
you know,

168
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:22.140
clean had these visions of driving on the freeway,
family accident,

169
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.560
all thrown from the car,
secret service.
Pick up Cameron,

170
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.280
Ashley and may put us in an ambulance,

171
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.310
take us to the hospital through a clean and cell phone and say,
call someone.

172
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.100
I think that is the vision you're at.
Right.
Because she got,

173
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.690
she doesn't have that protection.
So not easy at all.
Uh,

174
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.540
being married,
you know,
in that situation.
But we muddled through,

175
00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:47.730
I got a great wife from Nebraska,
very strong.
She looks at me as a stock of corn.

176
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.940
She planted me and she just keeps on taking care of me all these years.
What,

177
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.680
what was your relationship with your dad like as he was first running for

178
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:56.370
president?

179
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.300
I wrote a book called lesson my father taught me about all those years going out

180
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:03.720
to the ranch when I was a child,
learned about America,

181
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.780
heard every,
every song of every military operation known to mankind.

182
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.190
He was a true patriot and that's why I learned about the tax laws in America.

183
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.020
That's where I learned about American and the greatness of America and,

184
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.860
and riding out to the ranch with them and riding horses and shooting ground

185
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:25.020
squirrels and going swimming and cutting firewood.

186
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.070
I bought him his first chainsaw.
When you become president,

187
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.460
that all goes away because now he's got John Barletta secret service who just

188
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:38.040
passed away a few months ago,
you know,
riding with my dad and,

189
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.340
and it just completely changed.

190
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:45.350
You don't have those close moments that in fact you had previous so migrated

191
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:46.330
years.

192
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:51.330
My Dad was prior to the election and the great years after he out of office,

193
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:57.970
we got to spend time together and,
and when he had,
you know,
that terrible,

194
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.990
terrible disease that he had so many people had Alzheimer's,

195
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.560
we probably build the best relationship for a ship of our lives because in 1992

196
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.840
I made a decision and the decision was the next time I see my dad,

197
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.620
I'm going to hug him and tell him I love him.

198
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.970
And I did that in 1992 and he hugged me back and said,
I love you too.

199
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.080
And from that point on,
every time we would see each other,

200
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.990
we would hug each other and say,
I love you.

201
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.150
When he got ahold timers and he got to a point he could no longer say my name,

202
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.160
he remembered I was the young man who hugged him alone and hugged him goodbye.

203
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.730
And so when he saw me,
he would open up his arms,

204
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:48.030
not able to say my name and I'd fall into his arms and he gave me that little

205
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:49.450
hug and I'd hug him.

206
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.040
And one day we're up visiting Nancy at the house because you no longer visit

207
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:58.180
with dad and we'd be there.
And uh,

208
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.110
I got up to leave and got to the car and Coleen says to me,

209
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:04.600
you forgot days or whatever,
forget,
look at the door.

210
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.550
I looked back at the front door of the House and dad had remembered that I had

211
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:11.140
forgotten to hug him goodbye.
Wow.

212
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.360
And he had gotten up and Nancy had helped him a little baby steps all the way to

213
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.500
the front door and he was standing in the front door like this.

214
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:22.240
I had forgotten to hug him goodbye.
And I said,
oh my God.

215
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:26.860
And ran pool tear up thinking about and hugged him and he hugged me back and he

216
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:29.710
turned,
took the baby steps back into the house.

217
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:35.070
But just one of those wonderful moments I just had with my dad after he was out

218
00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:38.550
of the White House.
Yeah.
Was there,
was it tough for you,
the,

219
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:42.920
the way people would talk about your dad and Nancy obviously,
that she wasn't,

220
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.310
she wasn't your mom,
that,
that,
that,

221
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:47.450
that relationship was the one that everyone focused on what,

222
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.670
and it was a relationship that was in the house saying the relationship you saw

223
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.700
is what patty,
Ron and I am marine lived.
Yeah.

224
00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.040
It was about them.
You couldn't get them apart with a crow bar.
Um,
and,

225
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.660
and that's just the way it was.
I write,

226
00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:07.090
I write in my book about the fact that Dad,
when my mom divorced him,

227
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.820
uh,
he will tell you,
or you would have told you it was the worst day of his life.

228
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.430
He thought,
I'm never going to let this happen to me again.

229
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.520
Nancy's dad walked out on her and her mother the day she was born,

230
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.960
walked out.
Wow.
Gone.
Goodbye.
Didn't want a kid.
I'm Outta here.

231
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.750
She swore when she grew up,
I'm never going to have another man walk out on me.

232
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.840
These two Meta Chasen's for dinner,

233
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.320
get together and these two people,

234
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.750
you could not get them apart with a crowbar.

235
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.940
And so even as kids had a fight our way into the system to get our time,

236
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.020
you know,
with dad,
uh,
especially,

237
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.310
and that's just the way it was.

238
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.370
I think it was depicted pretty well on the funeral for Nancy Dad and so on.

239
00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.050
That's just the way it was with Nancy.
She was kind of the gatekeeper,

240
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:00.884
if you will,

241
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.920
getting to our father and the place you could really spend time with him is get

242
00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:08.810
them to the ranch.
You can be with them at the ranch.

243
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:11.990
You got a lot of great times.
Was He happiest there?
I mean,

244
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.160
when he could get away from the political craziness.
Love the ranch.
Yeah.
Uh,

245
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:19.070
you know,
young America's foundation who bought it a few years ago.

246
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:21.340
I do a lot of things with them.
Uh,

247
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.590
they bring high school kids up there and college kids up there and I speak to

248
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.424
them.

249
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.520
He really referred to it as his cathedral and it really was his cathedral.

250
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.620
It's where he could go up and really relaxed that cutting wood.

251
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.350
He did all that stuff.
When you go and see the ranch,

252
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:39.050
he's the one that really built the fences and did all of it.

253
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.050
So when you see all those pictures of mean it's real as opposed to now where

254
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:43.370
everything is so staged,

255
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:46.520
every time politician shows up anywhere in a hat with this,

256
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:50.920
they're holding the pitchfork or just any,
anything that now it's so,
oh yeah.

257
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.070
He was a lot of firsts.
I mean that very true about immuno,

258
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.120
he was the first president to show up on d day at normally.

259
00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.500
Yeah.

260
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.950
He was the first president to salute getting on and off Air Force One or marine

261
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:05.210
one.
You know,

262
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.810
he put a lot of firsts that are after that now have been followed by others.

263
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.560
Yeah.

264
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.320
Talk to me a little bit about those first couple of years of the presidency.

265
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.610
And it was definitely not all easy.
No,
it wasn't easy.
And,
uh,

266
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.880
but you know the interesting enough when I was campaigning for him in 1980,

267
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.810
call them on the phone from Iowa and he,
uh,

268
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.110
and he talking to me and I said,
dad,
you know,

269
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.750
you're going to get beat by George h w Bush here in Iowa.

270
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.680
Could you I just got off the phone,
the campaign staff and they said,

271
00:16:36.681 --> 00:16:39.470
we're doing fine.
It's one of,
they're lying to you.
I said,

272
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:42.710
I've been all over this state now for the last three weeks doing coffees.

273
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:47.390
I've them 20 doughnuts by eight o'clock in the morning,
87 cups of coffee.

274
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:50.720
That's commitment and uh,
doing all these things.
I said,
I'm telling you,

275
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:54.020
you're going to get beat because you're not here.
This is your state.

276
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:57.050
You're the favorite son of the state who is doing an event Saturday.

277
00:16:57.051 --> 00:16:59.990
You're not even going to be at it cause you're staffed than think you need to be

278
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:00.470
there.

279
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.980
They're running you as if you're better than the people in Iowa and he's going

280
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.710
to beat you.
And he gave me a typical father.
Thank you Michael.

281
00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:09.050
I appreciate the call.
Thank you for helping out in Iowa,

282
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.980
but my staff says I'm good.
Who Wins?
Iowa Hw Bush.
Yeah.

283
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.790
Couple of weeks later in New Hampshire,

284
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.120
I get a call at six 30 in the morning at the house.
He says,

285
00:17:20.121 --> 00:17:23.150
I have a press release for you.
I said,
why are you calling me?

286
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.500
Is that press release?
I need your approval on or disapproval.
It's up to you,

287
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:28.970
so why are you calling me?
He said,

288
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.870
let me read you the press release and you knew,

289
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.700
tell me whether I should give it to the media or not.

290
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.590
It's your call is to press release firing Roger Stone.

291
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.370
Paul Manafort,
John Sears and Charlie Black,

292
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.100
and he calls me and and I said the news.
That's right,
and I said,

293
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.570
done,
do it.
He says,
fine.
You'll be hearing about in your seven o'clock news hour,

294
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:57.090
I'm going to get off the phone with you and give it to the media.

295
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.420
And then I thought to myself,
what happens if he loses the day?

296
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:03.810
They're going to blame me.
I sit up.
My Dad said,
you're going to win today.

297
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:06.840
He says,
yeah,
we're going to win today.
So go ahead,
go ahead and do it.
He says,

298
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:11.040
give my love to Coleen and,
and Cameron,
at the time we didn't have Ashley,

299
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.300
I said Goodbye Dad.
So,
you know,
the,

300
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.300
these are the things he would do when he was president because he knew the

301
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:23.301
dynamics to allow me the opportunity to fire these guys was amazing.

302
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:31.260
So when you hear these guys names down Manafort and stone and some of the others

303
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:34.710
that they're so in the news lately,
votes stuff,
what does that ring to you?

304
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.910
I've known they meant evil for years.
I mean,
I,
it's amaze me,

305
00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:41.040
the Republican party and keeps on going back to the same,

306
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:44.340
well over all these years.
I mean,
Charlie's okay.

307
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.610
But I mean stone and in,
in,
in,

308
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.990
in Manaford have always been like this.
I mean,

309
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.290
it just,
the truth and I,
I tweeted,

310
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:58.470
I remember during the campaign with Trump,
I said,
you know,

311
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.710
Ronald Reagan with Manafort and stone,

312
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.910
never one without them,
never lost.

313
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.610
And I said,
I suggest you know,
to Trump,
you want to see the same dynamic.

314
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.560
I would get rid of both of them and it really turned it around because he was

315
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.430
doing very badly when they got rid of them.
He never lost again.

316
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.330
What year was these fascinations of those 19 and March 31 1981 81 actually,

317
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:31.390
I think that is my first real memory of anything.
You know,

318
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.900
visually I was five years old at the time,
not even five.

319
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.010
It's about four and a half years ago.

320
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.160
And I remember my folks watching that and I'd,
I remember seeing on the news,

321
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.260
you know,
they had like a,
an image,
a cart,
you know,

322
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:43.910
like that richer character of his body.
And I,

323
00:19:43.911 --> 00:19:47.550
I vividly remember that at that age.
What was that like for you guys?
You know,

324
00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:50.430
I was in my office secret service.
I was in business,

325
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:53.340
meaning my office and secret service agent came in.

326
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.060
So there's been an assassination attempt back in Washington and everything's

327
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.280
okay.
It was Mike Ludy and who my agent George,

328
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.510
my detail that day and he's been,
everything's okay.
Close the door,
and I went,

329
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:09.240
people looked at me like that was cold,
that was cold.

330
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.230
So I picked up the phone,
called the White House,
asked for Nancy.

331
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.820
Nancy was at the White House.
I walked out and said,
Mike,
my dad's been shot.

332
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.240
He says,
no,
he's fine.
I said,
no,
Nancy,
not at the White House.

333
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.240
There's only one reason she wouldn't be at the White House.

334
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:27.270
And the car was on the way to the White House.
If she's not there,

335
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:30.810
she's someplace else.
And I would say that would be the hospital.

336
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.930
And Mike said,
no.
They say he's fine.
I said,
check it.
Five minutes later,

337
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:39.360
Mike says,
you're right.
He was shot.

338
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.160
So now we go home and of course the press to surrounded our house,

339
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.230
we're being held captive basically in the home.

340
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.790
And they finally sent a plane out from Washington to pick us up.
Uh,

341
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.200
but we're asked to stay home.

342
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.000
They didn't was to rush to Washington for fear of the markets would crash.

343
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.850
People would think it was worse than it really was.

344
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.770
But it really was worse than people thought it was because he was very close to

345
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:10.540
depth.
If Jerry Parr was the Asian charge that day,
if Jerry,

346
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.070
if dad and not coughed up oxygenated blood,
uh,

347
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.940
they would have gone to the White House.
He would have bled to death internally.

348
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.460
But he did right at the right time and they went to the hospital and I tell the

349
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:28.120
story when they get the hospital,
they cut the suit off.
My Dad,

350
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.710
you now see you at the library.

351
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.460
And I remember the next day when we able to see that we finally got in very late

352
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:36.070
at night,
saw dad 10 o'clock the next morning.

353
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.070
And the humor that he shared with the country,

354
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.570
it's the same humory always shared with the family.
He always had a joke.

355
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.740
He always had a sense of humor,
helps.
What was great about debt in,

356
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:52.000
unless you were rushing his life was great.
Yeah,
we'll get to that.
And,
and I,

357
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.590
so I walk in,
I walk in 10 o'clock with my family and my dad looks at me.
She's,

358
00:21:56.591 --> 00:22:00.430
you know,
uh,
you know,
yesterday I was shot.
I said,
dad,

359
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:02.950
the world knows you were shot yesterday.
He says,
well,

360
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:07.540
if you're ever gonna get shot,
don't be wearing a new suit.
I said,
what?

361
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.460
He says,
when I was shot yesterday,

362
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:13.120
I had a brand new suit and I had just picked it up the day before.
He says,

363
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:13.570
I can't.

364
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:17.530
I walked into the hospital and they put me on this Gurney and the cut that suit

365
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:21.070
off of my body and the last time I saw I was in shreds in the corner of the

366
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:24.910
hospital room.
That's why I tell you Michael,
but everybody gets shot.

367
00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:28.600
Don't be wearing a new suit.
I said,
fine,
I won't wear a new suit.

368
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:32.040
I'll talk to lead to put something else on me.
And he says,

369
00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:35.140
that young man who shot me,
I said,
yeah,
John Hinckley.
Yes,
it was John Hinckley.

370
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:40.210
I said,
what?
He says hydro stand his parents from in the oil business?
Yes.

371
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.080
Understand they live in Denver?
Yeah.

372
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.300
Do you think they have any money now?

373
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.810
He understand he was on the table close to death six hours before I'm in the

374
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:57.760
room.
Put that in perspective.
And I said,

375
00:22:57.761 --> 00:23:01.120
well,
they live in Denver.
They're in the oil business.
Dan,

376
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:04.510
I'm sure they have money.
He says,

377
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:06.340
do you think they'd ever buy me a new suit?

378
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.300
That's what he says to me.
And I just looked at him,
I said,
ask,

379
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.253
I don't know,

380
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:19.000
but that's what he says to me six hours after off the table.

381
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.600
How did that experience change him?

382
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.250
You know how a change was,

383
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:29.200
and people have written books,
they really need to call family members.

384
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:34.060
So many people write books,
don't they think they know everything.

385
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.630
But you know,
family members have the inside baseball stories.

386
00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:40.660
You don't want to go there.
And so it's been upsetting.

387
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.710
Some of the things been said,

388
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.220
how it changed and was that he believed he was truly saved for a reason.

389
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:53.330
Can we became closer really to God,
if you will.
Uh,

390
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:56.750
and that,
and that's where he was.
And,
and,

391
00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.280
and a lot of people just misunderstood that.
The,
you know,
wasn't the same guy,

392
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.840
he wasn't the same guy,

393
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.700
but he didn't put a gym in the second floor of the White House.

394
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.730
But two and a half inches on his chest,
you know,

395
00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:15.080
and got stronger because of the,
the bullet in the wound and what have you.

396
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.080
But he just became more,
he came,

397
00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:22.640
became closer to God and felt that there was a reason he was there.
And you know,

398
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:24.230
some,
he ended up being right.

399
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.460
So did that then galvanize a lot of the things that he ended up doing in the

400
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:30.580
second term and everything that happened with Russia had Mr Gorbachev tear down

401
00:24:30.581 --> 00:24:34.900
this wall and everything else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because if you look,

402
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:40.060
I mean you got to stay on my dad.
It's March 31st three months later.

403
00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:44.470
Who Shot Pope John Paul.
Oh yeah.
And he lives.

404
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.990
So what is the first thing my father does?

405
00:24:46.991 --> 00:24:51.160
I tell people that just want to go out and speak.
How many people you speak to,

406
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.250
if you asked the question,
how many can recite the Lord's prayer?

407
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.160
How many people raised their hand?
I'm ready.
You know

408
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.790
how many people go live the Lord's prayer?

409
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:05.290
Cause my dad before he went back to the White House for gave John Hinckley for

410
00:25:05.291 --> 00:25:10.000
trying to kill him.
Pope John Paul before he went back to his paypal duties for,

411
00:25:10.001 --> 00:25:14.320
gave the young man who tried to kill him two months later,

412
00:25:14.321 --> 00:25:17.290
three months later,
both of them meet in Rome at the Vatican,

413
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:23.010
one of they now have in common to really talk about both believing they've been

414
00:25:23.081 --> 00:25:24.760
saved for a higher purpose.

415
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.720
And the higher purpose becomes what freedom to Poland and the Berlin walls when

416
00:25:31.511 --> 00:25:32.344
we coming down.

417
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.620
So that he always had that message of freedom in it.
I mean that,
that,

418
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.870
that idea of the individual and freedom and you know,

419
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.890
so the line,
and you touched on this earlier,

420
00:25:43.891 --> 00:25:46.410
but the line of I didn't leave the Democratic Party,

421
00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:50.550
the Democratic Party left me.
That's become very,
to me that's like,

422
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.510
that's it.

423
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.170
Because I was a big lefty most of my life and even just in the last five years

424
00:25:55.171 --> 00:25:58.050
I've sort of woken up to them to what they've become.

425
00:25:58.051 --> 00:26:00.560
I know that's probably funny to you and if you're not,
but you know,

426
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.501
dad was sitting here,

427
00:26:01.501 --> 00:26:05.110
he'd say [inaudible] sister Maria was the first Republican in the family.
Yeah.

428
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.250
She's the one that really,
you know,
pushed him and pushed him and pushed him to,

429
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:14.240
to do all this.
So,
so when he said that was,
was he really saying,
well that was,

430
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.020
was the effect of what he was saying.
I get,

431
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.300
I get what happened with GM was just that,
that when they left me,

432
00:26:19.301 --> 00:26:22.540
meaning that they want government to solve everything and that's just not what I

433
00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:24.880
want.
Yeah.
And that's not the way they used to be.

434
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:29.560
But if you go back and take you back historically,
yeah.
Back then a,

435
00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:33.900
uh,
a Liberal Democrat was a conservative.
Yeah.

436
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.460
Today of course.
Would it be a conservative,
I mean,

437
00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:40.770
the reality is John Kennedy would be like,
today would be a conservative.
Yeah.

438
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:44.610
And the fact is that today Reagan may be a liberal.
Yeah.

439
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.210
I mean not where they are,
but people are going to miss quote.
Yeah.

440
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.430
I realized that,
no,
I can go back and say,
you know,
as governor,
he raised taxes,

441
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.540
signed abortion bill and what have you,
and instead things later on in his life.

442
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.280
But now with all the social meaning all of the things out there,
you know,

443
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.240
people remember what you did,
you know,

444
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:07.320
at birth and they holding against you in the public opinion in that court,

445
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.140
which is tough,
uh,
to do so.
It's a,
it's a tough world out there anymore.

446
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.680
And Elo for all the regular who gave amnesty in 1986 which Stan,
you know,

447
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.440
there's people who wouldn't support him today.
Yeah.

448
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.580
What do you think he would make of just generally the way politics is now in

449
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:26.720
terms of it's the,
that seemingly won't talk to each other.
We're in the,

450
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.000
we're in what week six of the shutdown.
Um,

451
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.160
just the whole tenor of everything.
Yeah.
It's just,

452
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.520
it's not something that he would wrap his arms around.

453
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:40.080
You remember when he was elected?
Uh,
W we don't have any statesman anymore.

454
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.890
We used to have states,
both sides.
Yeah.
You know,
Hubert Humphrey,
you,

455
00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:47.130
let's go through the list of people you disagreed with,
maybe politically,

456
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.600
but they were a great statesman.
You know you great debate.

457
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:55.380
At the end of the debate,
we all had dinner together type thing.
You know,

458
00:27:55.381 --> 00:27:58.170
back in the day we got the largest tax break in American history,

459
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.400
but how do we get that?
Tip O'Neill was the head of the house.

460
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.773
He was speaker house.

461
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.190
Here's the guy who would disagree with my father on everything known to mankind.

462
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.600
Yeah.
Boy,
his dad do invites him to the White House for dinner with his wife.

463
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.090
He goes up there for dinner a couple of days later when he's back in his office,

464
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:19.201
tells the staff,

465
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:22.620
I'm going to carry the legislation on the tax cut staff looks at him and said,

466
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:26.610
you're nuts.
There's boll weevils.
They used to be boll weevil before they can.

467
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:29.260
Blue Dog Democrats by the way,
give me some period pieces,

468
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:33.710
but there's enough bull wheels on the,
on the house floor.
They will pass through.

469
00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:36.630
You put it on the floor.
What did the president of promise you?

470
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.420
What did he say was going to give you to put it on the floor?
Nothing.

471
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.760
Nothing.
Then what did you talk about?
We never talked about taxes all night long.

472
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.430
Then what did you talk about with the president?
Greatness of America,

473
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.770
the goodness of her people and how the two of us working together and make it

474
00:28:55.771 --> 00:29:00.060
better for all Americans.
Before I knew it,
we're telling iris stories,

475
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.770
we're having a glass of wine today.

476
00:29:01.771 --> 00:29:05.550
I'm telling I'm going to carry the legislation.
You can't do that today.

477
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.210
So do you think that was his greatest skill beyond political maneuvering per se?

478
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:12.810
Although I guess that is political maneuvering at its,
at its core,
yeah.

479
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.190
Here will,
you also said to him as an aside,
he says,
and by the way,

480
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:21.750
I promised not to campaign against any Democrats who supported in the next

481
00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:24.570
election,
which helped a lot.
Yeah.
That's cause he had a lot going for him.

482
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:29.110
But he used the same thing,
work with Gorbachev,
you know,
same thing,
work with,

483
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.010
with all of them.
He just,
you know,

484
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:34.870
Ronald Reagan for best friend as Jimmy Stewart said,

485
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.180
Ronald Reagan for best friend,
he was that kind of a guy,
easy to get along with.

486
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.870
But he knew what he wanted and he knew the best way to go about getting it.

487
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:49.270
And He,
and he did it.
What was it like watching the media go after your dad,

488
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:54.400
either,
either justly or unjustly,
that could not have been fun?
Well,
yeah,

489
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:56.770
it's something,
you know,

490
00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.640
it gets maddening.
I remember Maureen,
I,
when he,

491
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.490
when he was campaigning in New Hampshire,

492
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:07.660
he paid for the microphone and Maureen and I looked at each other when it's

493
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:10.750
about time,
he got mad.
God never gets mad.

494
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:15.010
He finally got mad and we thought that was,
that was a change of tune.

495
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.530
Excuse me.
And,
uh,
in New Hampshire,

496
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.180
but it's tough watching people attack anybody in your family.

497
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.740
Um,
it didn't bother.
Dad did nothing to bother him at all.

498
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:33.850
That Nancy would eat bananas at night.
She wouldn't sleep.
She toss and turn.

499
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.900
She call everybody known to mankind to see how do we stop this?

500
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:42.370
How do we stop it?
But Dad was just nonplus pie.

501
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.720
He didn't let it bother him.
He wasn't thin skinned.
Yeah.
I want to,
I mean,

502
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:50.050
some of that has to maybe some of the acting career.
And he was,

503
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:54.250
he was at a level of fame that was so absurd that he had,

504
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.650
he had lived through the struggle years and no,

505
00:30:56.651 --> 00:30:59.930
you have to have the tough years too much where they came after him.
I mean,

506
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.170
he had the tough years.
It wasn't an easy life.
He,

507
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:07.360
but he never let anything stop him from really moving the ball forward and,
and,

508
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.290
and getting things done.
And I think that's important.
A lot of people today,

509
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:15.850
you know,
if they get stopped here,
you know,
they stopped.

510
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:19.810
They don't do anything else,
you know,
instead of fighting,
you know,
what next,

511
00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:23.290
what door opened up now that I can go into and,

512
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.590
and maybe make a career out of it,
if you will.
Um,

513
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.700
and I think those lessons that can be taught to a lot of people today that,

514
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.370
you know,
everything's a work in progress.
Amir,

515
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:37.610
a ups guy the other day was at my house delivering something.
And,
and,
uh,

516
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.110
and said kind of a snide remark,
Nice House as,

517
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.360
as he was leaving and I said,
yeah,
I took me 50 years to get here.

518
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.760
It didn't cut.
It wasn't born here.
I took me 50 years to get this house.

519
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:55.060
A lot of people don't know about,
you know,
if you want something,

520
00:31:55.061 --> 00:31:58.570
you gotta work for it.
Nobody's going to hand it to you.
My mother taught me that,

521
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.870
you know,
back when I was 10 years old,
I want a 10 speed bike.

522
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.100
All my other friends were getting 10 speaks bikes given to them by their parents

523
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.383
for free.

524
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:13.290
I went down to hand sort Sacary Santa Monica picked out a blue 10 speed Schwinn

525
00:32:13.961 --> 00:32:17.320
bike,
went home and said to my mom,
mom,
you buy me this.

526
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.130
I'm going to love you forever.
No kids ever done that with his parents.

527
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.640
My mom said,
well,
how badly do you want it?
I said,
mom,
well,

528
00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:27.580
I'm more than anything good.
Do you want it enough to get a job?
I said,
what job?

529
00:32:27.581 --> 00:32:30.730
I'm 10 years old.
She to deliver papers.
What?

530
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.330
So she opens up the paper looking for ads.
Ah,

531
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.990
you could sell papers in front of the Good Shepherd Church in Santa Monica where

532
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.260
we go to church on Sunday mornings.
It's available sign here.

533
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.200
I signed a contract with my mother when I was 10 years old.

534
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.440
She loaned me the money to buy that bike and I would pay her back on Sunday

535
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.960
afternoon after church with some of the profits I made from selling by the 25

536
00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.100
cents for a Sunday paper that was this thick.
But what I made,
what I made I,

537
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.270
I give it back to her and I asked her,
I said,
why are you doing this to me?

538
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:09.560
All my friends are getting bikes given to them.
She says,
because I build men,

539
00:33:09.561 --> 00:33:14.300
not boys.
If I give you what you want,
you'll be a 40 year old child.

540
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.080
But if I teach you now that you have to work for what you want in life,

541
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.490
you'd be a 40 year old man.
And that's what I built.
So you deserve that house.

542
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.040
Damn rights.
All right.

543
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:27.410
So let's just do a little bit more about your dad and then I want to spend the

544
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:29.570
rest of the time talking about what you're doing now with the foundation and

545
00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:32.540
everything else.
So I think it's pretty fair to say that the,

546
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:36.510
that the fall of the Soviet Union was,
was his greatest accomplishment within,

547
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.160
I think you'd agree with that.
No,
y'all get the fuck.
I don't know.

548
00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:42.530
You might pull in something here that I don't know what you're,

549
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:44.180
rather than bringing me into the family.
Yeah.

550
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:45.970
So other than the other [inaudible] coming in the family.
Yeah.

551
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.190
Was there anything when he,

552
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.800
when he left the presidency that he really felt was undone or that he had

553
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.090
really,
uh,
made an error on or anything like that?
Did he have any regrets?
No,

554
00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:57.230
he had no regrets at all.

555
00:33:57.231 --> 00:33:58.850
I think we'll be looking at his last speech that he gave,

556
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:01.430
really talked about the things that had been accomplished.

557
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.890
He was a great guy for using wean on I,

558
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.220
and he really understood it was a team effort,
um,

559
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:12.170
and [inaudible] very happy with what he was able to accomplish.

560
00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:15.580
And being able to work with with others.
And,

561
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:20.420
and I said to Margaret Thatcher,
the day after the funeral,

562
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.430
she came to me,
we were having breakfast hotel and she said,
Oh,
Michael,

563
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:30.410
uh,
uh,
about your dad.
Just think of w w w what he,

564
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:34.010
we could have accomplished.
Who would've been elected in 1976?
I said,

565
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.490
Lady Thatcher,
if he'd been elected in [inaudible] 76,

566
00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:41.510
the Berlin wall would still be up.
The Cold War would still be in place.

567
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.040
She said,
why do you say that?
I said,
where were you in 76?

568
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.800
Or was John Paul,
where was like,

569
00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:53.120
Valencia work was Wako hovel where it was Mikhail Gorbachev.

570
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.110
They all need each other.

571
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.430
The fact of matter is he'd been elected then he would have been an out of office

572
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.330
even.
It was a two term president by the time of college,
Gorbachev came in.

573
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:07.790
The wall would still be up for some reason.
Faith,
you name it.

574
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.360
All the right people were in the right place at the right time.

575
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.440
And my dad was that leader able to work with each and every one of you.

576
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:18.410
Helmut Kohl,
you name it,
to bring everybody together.

577
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:22.790
Pope John Paul that ultimately brought down that Berlin Wall.

578
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.550
All of you are on the same page up until that point,

579
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.420
all of you are on other pages and if it's my dads that that one Cardi had on his

580
00:35:31.971 --> 00:35:32.600
desk,

581
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.410
no telling you what you had accomplished and where you can go if you don't worry

582
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:39.630
who gets the credit.
Dad didn't worry about credit.

583
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.260
He worried about getting the job done.
He wanted to bring that wall down.

584
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.040
If you go back historically and look and listen to my father,
his speeches,

585
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:52.000
he was talking about that wall back when it was put up back in what,

586
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.650
1961 two o'clock in the morning.

587
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.330
August 13th I believe.

588
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.970
He talked about that wall from that point forward in his life.
And so that was,

589
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.930
that was a seminal thing for him and that wall coming down,

590
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.633
change the world.

591
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.600
So he obviously was an incredible communicator and the speeches and all that.

592
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:14.670
And obviously you had a way of reaching across the aisle.

593
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:19.760
Where there any people either that were us politicians or international fingers

594
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:23.040
that he just absolutely hated or felt that he could not work with?

595
00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:28.170
Is there anyone know a way he didn't feel that way about anybody?
Um,

596
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.310
he,
he brought him all.
He really,
because there were people that hated him.
I mean,

597
00:36:32.311 --> 00:36:35.970
we're all Yada,
but you know,
he look,
it was sitting behind us.

598
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.680
If you go to his funeral,
look who was sitting behind us at the,

599
00:36:40.681 --> 00:36:45.610
at the church,
Mikhail Gorbachev,
you know,

600
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.020
he made friends of enemies.

601
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:54.020
You didn't make enemies of friends and he diffused so many things because of his

602
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:57.150
humor.
Being able to laugh at himself.

603
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.630
Last year or the year before on February six,

604
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:04.560
his birthday celebrated at the everywhere,
but the Reagan library,

605
00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:07.590
it was a big event.
US Marines come up and what have you,

606
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:12.930
guest speaker last year,
Sam Donaldson.
That wouldn't happen today.

607
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:17.850
Yeah.
Not going to happen at all.
Even though they had this adversarial way.

608
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.340
They have mutual respect and,
and ultimately you have Sam Donaldson speaking,

609
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.653
you know,

610
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.830
on behalf of my father had his birthday last year at the library.

611
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.770
He made friends of people who were enemies and got things accomplished.

612
00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:37.660
Whether it's Pope John Paul,
like the lengths of vocal hobby,

613
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:38.820
doesn't matter who it is,

614
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.820
Mikhail Gorbachev and turn turn him and Mikhail Gorbachev.

615
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:47.370
I worked with the Eureka College a few years ago.

616
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.300
We were able to get Mikhail Gorbachev,
go to Eureka College,
my dad's Alma Mater,

617
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.840
and speak to the Reagan Society at Eureka College about his relationship with my

618
00:37:58.261 --> 00:38:02.910
dad wouldn't happen today.
And,
and that's what's,

619
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.340
that's what sad things.

620
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:09.270
See things deteriorate possibly when they were at such a great high level

621
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:12.240
relationship in all areas.
Yeah.

622
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.560
So you obviously mentioned your dad in the later years and obviously Alzheimer's

623
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.820
is,
there's no words to truly describe it in the story.
He told us incredible.

624
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:25.820
Do you remember the moment that you knew something was off because he must've

625
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.470
been this other worldly figure in a way even to you?

626
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.800
Do you remember seeing him one day and be out?
He was a,
he was gay,

627
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.860
he was losing a step,
if you will.

628
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:39.230
And they had an event celebrating his birthday,
um,

629
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.460
at the library or not the library,
what would become,

630
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.480
and they had the big event and a Lady Thatcher was a speaker and there had to be

631
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:54.400
a thousand people.
And under this tent is great.
And uh,

632
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.470
my dad introduced Lady Thatcher and uh,

633
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.550
to a great round of applause.
And when the bylaws was over,

634
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:09.930
he reintroduced her the exact same way he had just done and everybody got it and

635
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:14.560
everybody applauded again.

636
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.840
And that was the moment where I think the decision was probably made that a,

637
00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:23.830
there's too many people in the room that sought that.
He had to say something.

638
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:28.150
And that's when the letter comes out in 19,
uh,
1994,

639
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.390
the letter comes in November 3rd,
I think 1994 when the letter comes out,

640
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.960
because too many people in the room saw that moment,
if you will.

641
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.050
But everybody you know,

642
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:41.050
who had just give a standing ovation to Lady Thatcher and my dad stood up and

643
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:45.580
gave another standing ovation to leave that your and my dad.
And,

644
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:46.930
and that,
that was the,

645
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.960
that was the moment where we knew that it was going to blossom from there to

646
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:56.470
national inquire.
And you didn't want national enquirer breaking the story.

647
00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.870
You wanted the family to breaking the story in Dad.

648
00:39:58.871 --> 00:40:01.750
Of course with the letter he wrote to the nation after the letter.

649
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:05.920
He didn't do any public appearances.
Diddy,
I,
I don't think he,

650
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.550
I don't think he did any after that.
Um,

651
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:14.860
I think the last one he gave was in that year,
but prior to the,

652
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.540
prior to the letter,
he might've given one a,
if you will.
Uh,

653
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:22.240
but it wasn't a,
it wasn't easy still.
I mean,

654
00:40:22.241 --> 00:40:26.470
it wasn't just the early onset,
if you will,
of what he had.

655
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.610
I chaired the John Dug his French Alzheimer's foundation for four years.

656
00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:36.520
I just left it,
this,
this last year.
And,
uh,
we just,
uh,

657
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:41.130
we're doing a whole program with Ucla and USC and,
uh,

658
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.820
colleges.
We took a university of San Francisco,
uh,
where were,
we took ethic,

659
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:46.301
we had 10,

660
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:50.620
$11 million in the bank and what we're doing is doing matching funds with these

661
00:40:50.621 --> 00:40:52.540
universities and creating chairs.

662
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:57.540
So we turned the 11 to 22 million that is used strictly for research for

663
00:40:57.851 --> 00:41:00.010
Alzheimer's.
There's a new program,

664
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:04.870
crisper that looked very promising in the future.
We're part of that.
Uh,

665
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.040
so you know,

666
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:10.060
people think maybe within five years something of Crispr does what everybody

667
00:41:10.061 --> 00:41:13.810
thinks it might be able to do.
Uh,
it'd be great for,
for that,

668
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.380
for that issue.
All right,
so that's a pretty good segue.

669
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.110
What you're doing now and your dad's legacy,

670
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.890
you are the president of the Reagan Legacy Foundation.
Uh,

671
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.890
how do you keep a legacy like this live this,

672
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.930
this is not an easy thing to cut you off.
You know,

673
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:32.680
when my sister Maureen was dying of melanoma back in 2001,

674
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.570
I was with her in her hospital room.

675
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.460
This was about three months before she passed.

676
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.210
She was saint John's in Santa Monica,
chased everybody else out,
new state.

677
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.730
And we have that brothers sister conversation.

678
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:48.580
And she really worried about our dad's legacy.
And she asked,
he said,
Michael,

679
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.540
if it ever gets to a point you can walk away from radio,
would you?
I said,

680
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:55.820
why are you asking?
She says,

681
00:41:55.821 --> 00:42:00.821
our father is a very important legacy and I would hope that you in fact would

682
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.480
help carry it for people.
Remember who he was,

683
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.230
who he is and who he was.
And I promised her then I would,

684
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:14.580
so 2009,
I chose to leave 26 years in radio,
uh,

685
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.800
walked away from radio I,
which is pretty tough because all of a sudden,
oh,

686
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:23.600
I've got to make a living too,
and I take no money from the foundation.
I said,
oh,

687
00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:25.760
that's why I need to do,
create a foundation,
make money.

688
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.870
Media won't have fun with that one.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
Uh,

689
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:33.020
so out speaking premiere speakers bureau picked me up,
I thought speaking a lot,

690
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.640
30,
40,
50 speeches a year,
and we haven't started this foundation,

691
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.270
which originally was used to,
uh,
it still does,
uh,

692
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.680
to provide scholarships to men and women who serve aboard the USS Ronald Reagan,

693
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.090
which now is in Tokyo,
Japan,
keeping an eye on North Korea.

694
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.470
And so we provide scholarships to the young men and women who serve on the

695
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:56.120
Reagan,
but we do something different.

696
00:42:56.121 --> 00:42:59.960
We also provide scholarships to their family members who are left back home.

697
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:01.820
Nobody else thinks about that.

698
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.780
They're serving as much as the one on the ship and they're trying to better

699
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:06.920
their lives education.

700
00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:10.400
So we provide thousand dollars scholarships to those on the ship,

701
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:15.470
$2,000 scholarships to those left home.
And we do it every single year.
Um,

702
00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.860
you know,
it,
but somewhere between 25 and $50,000 a year.
We,

703
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.560
whenever we can raise,
so we raised a million,
it'll be a million,

704
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.230
whatever it might be.
We do that.
Uh,
and,

705
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:28.490
and then I was in Germany a few years ago and I was at the Berlin Wall.

706
00:43:28.491 --> 00:43:31.490
Ask them young man,
what do you know,
Berlin Wall?
He said,
well,

707
00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:35.120
the Americans put it up to keep the communists out of their sector is,
excuse me.

708
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.600
I said,
boy,
we did a great job with our education system,

709
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:42.710
but there is no mention of Ronald Reagan,
nothing at the Brandenburg Gate,

710
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:47.370
nothing.
So I build a relationship with prowl Hildebrand,
her,

711
00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.390
her and her husband who created the,
uh,
the malware museum,

712
00:43:50.391 --> 00:43:52.310
which is the checkpoint Charlie Museum in Berlin.

713
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:58.390
And we funded through the Reagan legacy foundation around Reagan exhibit

714
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:03.230
overlooking Checkpoint Charlie there at that museum.

715
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:07.400
So you can learn about my father who got chain saw there,
all kinds of stuff.

716
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:12.050
The speech from the Brandenburg Gate is there and that's where we need to put

717
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:13.670
something in the ground,
the brand new brigade.

718
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.430
So I worked almost three years working with the red red government of Berlin.

719
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.390
And uh,
finally about two years ago,
three years ago,

720
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.040
they approved us putting a plaque in the ground.
So the,
the Adelai hotel,

721
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:32.400
which is back from the brand of brigade,
there's,
we have a huge

722
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.770
program there now are the thing that my dad,
uh,

723
00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:41.550
commemorating the speech of black,
my dad commemorating his speech back in 1987.

724
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:45.140
June 12th.
So I did that.
Were Fun.
Right?
That's great.
Yeah.

725
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.170
Then I'm playing golf with a young man here in Los Angeles,
Beers later,

726
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.770
28 years old.
I said,
you know,

727
00:44:52.771 --> 00:44:56.120
I'm leaving tomorrow for Paris and then I'm going out to a,

728
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.220
going out to Normandy on Saturday and Sunday.

729
00:44:59.221 --> 00:45:02.310
I've been asked to raise the American flag at the American cemetery.

730
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.360
28 year old young man says to me,
why is there an American cemetery at Normandy?

731
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.190
I went,
oh my God.
Did you think d day is when your report card came home?

732
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:13.620
So I did that,

733
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:18.480
spent more time out there then and realized there was no mention of Ronald

734
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.210
Reagan,
their enormity,
especially at that great speech.

735
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:26.930
And so we now have partnered with the airborne museum at Saint Mary Glee's,

736
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:28.431
Saint Mary Glee's,

737
00:45:28.431 --> 00:45:32.610
first time freed by American d day after all the paratroopers are going saving

738
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:35.240
private Ryan.
That's where they read it.
That's where the bridge is,

739
00:45:35.241 --> 00:45:36.390
where it is the,

740
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.950
the 82nd airborne in the hundred and first there,

741
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.080
Waterloo if you will,
or their Gettysburg.
Um,

742
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:49.150
and we partner with them and we have now a Ronald Reagan center there.
Yeah.

743
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.840
Uh,
to,
to have,
uh,
conferences.

744
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.890
We've produced a film about that.
You go on my website,

745
00:45:55.891 --> 00:46:00.550
Reagan Legacy foundation.org watched the film on that and say,

746
00:46:00.551 --> 00:46:01.500
what else can we do?

747
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:07.050
And so last year we put together a program with the airborne museum to start

748
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:11.640
doing what we call a walkway to victory,
where you can,
you can buy a brick,

749
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:15.000
go online walkway to victory dot Tom Reagan legacy foundation dental work.

750
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.110
And you can purchase a brick $250 or 500 whatever you want to spend.

751
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.700
And we're putting the names of those who served in the European theatre and the

752
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:26.490
Second World War.
And if you don't know somebody,

753
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:29.730
you can donate to the foundation and we'll find that somebody,

754
00:46:29.731 --> 00:46:33.380
so you're actually building it over time.
Oh Billy it over time in it.

755
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:37.320
It's coming.
And so it launched last June that lastly,
I think,
yeah,

756
00:46:37.321 --> 00:46:39.840
just we put the first group in,
I think April or May,

757
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:44.370
we have about 300 bricks now.
We have another order in now to put more bricks in.

758
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:49.050
A lot of it's weather,
you can't do it because of weather or had enormously,

759
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.760
but people go online and do that.

760
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.050
And it's a great way to honor those who fought in the second world war in the

761
00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:59.280
European theater.
And it really changed the world.
Absolutely changed it.

762
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.200
Part of what you guys are teaching about.
I mean there's,

763
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:04.560
there's incredible stories that would never happen now.
I mean about,

764
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.660
about actors.
So accurate,

765
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.640
some accurate and athletes that actually put their careers on hold.
Uh,
you know,

766
00:47:11.641 --> 00:47:12.720
to fight in World War II,

767
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.830
which now to an athlete or an actor these days would sound,

768
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:20.460
sounded insane to Oh yeah.
And my dad couldn't go there,
uh,

769
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:25.200
because he was legally blind.
So he did over 300 films,

770
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.320
uh,
training films for those who didn't go there,

771
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:33.400
but have so many of these actors who,
who signed up and when are you have a,

772
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:36.950
there was a,
there was a TV show on Netflix,
I think it was the five.

773
00:47:36.951 --> 00:47:41.951
The kids five came back during the famous directors of the time who came back,

774
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:47.590
but they were sent there and they're the ones who took the film of all those

775
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:50.200
encampments that we saw of the Jews.

776
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:52.780
That's how we found out about these things that were going on.

777
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.650
So we'll have special places put out for them.
Actors,

778
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.380
sports people who were involved,

779
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:04.180
who went there and gave up their careers,
if you will,

780
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:07.840
to go there.
Came back and we got the career's going,
if you will.

781
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.010
But it is,
it's such a great place.

782
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.820
Anybody who goes to normity needs to stop at Saint Marie Gleason.

783
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:19.870
People know that the,
the grave sites,
did you see at the American cemetery,

784
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:24.880
all of them were in that area of Saint Marie Gleason through there.
There,
Gosh,

785
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:30.090
thousand 15,000 grave sites that were there and the wife for the DDA,

786
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:35.610
mayor of Saint Mary Glee's called the mother of normity was the one who took

787
00:48:35.741 --> 00:48:40.120
care of those grave sites all of those years making contact with the loved ones

788
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:43.060
that were left home.
And when they made the agreement,

789
00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:45.610
the Americans with the French to have the American cemetery,

790
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.240
they gave the availability to the family members home to have their loved ones

791
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:52.360
sent back home or sent to the American cemetery.

792
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:56.830
That's where there's 9,600 the American cemetery and there are 15,000 sprint

793
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.860
spread throughout Saint Marie Gullies.
And,

794
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:03.430
and to go there and go the airborne museum and,
and,
and,

795
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:08.200
and see the gliders and see how these,
these guys came in and what,

796
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:13.360
what was going on that day at Saint Marie Glee's is absolutely phenomenal.

797
00:49:13.361 --> 00:49:15.730
And to be able to remember them with these bricks and what happens?

798
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.700
The 250 bucks.
Okay.
What happens with the money?
I'll tell you what happens.

799
00:49:18.701 --> 00:49:21.940
The money we paid by the get the brick,
put it in the ground.

800
00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.430
The profits are leftover,
which are pretty good,

801
00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.100
are split between the airborne museum for their museum.
Yeah.

802
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.720
The upkeep and the Reagan Legacy Foundation,
which does what?

803
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.680
Provide scholarships to men and women in the board.
The USS Ronald Reagan.
Yeah.

804
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.300
So you got a real good guy.
Oh,
that's what it is.
Like as the lie that,
that,

805
00:49:39.301 --> 00:49:42.780
and that's when we did to it because that was my father.

806
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:46.150
A lot of people don't know.
You go back and you'll listen to that speech point,

807
00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:49.060
the hoc speech and think he was the first president.
Think about that.

808
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.140
It was 40th anniversary.
He was the first president of thought,
you know,

809
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:58.141
maybe I should show up on d day at Saint Mary Gleaves or at Normandy and give a

810
00:49:58.631 --> 00:50:02.500
speech.
And He,
and he did.
Ah,
and,

811
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:07.330
and that his idea,
yeah.
It was his idea.
He,
you know,

812
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:12.070
my sister and I used to laugh about dad that uh,
uh,

813
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.970
if he didn't win the presidency of the United States and we tell them as a boy

814
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:16.804
scout,

815
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:20.980
we've taught him running for the presidency was like going for your eagle badge.

816
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:25.270
Yeah.
I mean that was my dad.
He was the Eagle Scout going for his eagle badge.

817
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:30.470
He never forgot about those who,
who gave their lives,

818
00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.790
as I said,
300 training films,
uh,

819
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:37.070
that he did it.
He was legally blind.

820
00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:42.140
He couldn't serve overseas wanting to be in the army was in the,

821
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:47.360
he was in the cavalry,
but to get in the army had a pass an I examined.

822
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:51.140
So what does he do?
He went out and he memorized the eye charts.

823
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:55.640
So when we went in to join the army and they put him in front of an eye chart,

824
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:59.730
cover your left eye or right eye read line three he hadn't memorized.
Wow.

825
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:03.440
And so d e F Pq,
you're in Reagan.

826
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.160
And then when they offered him the rank of major to stay in,

827
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:10.940
he said,
no,

828
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:15.740
the rank of major should be given only to someone who's able to serve overseas,

829
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.970
not someone who has to be able,
can only stay home.

830
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.090
So please give that major.
As someone who serves overseas,

831
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.580
I'll retire as a captain and that's what he did.

832
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:29.330
And then he retired as president,
great state.
So it worked out pretty well.

833
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:34.520
But that was his heart.
It was never about him.
Do you feel it's a well,

834
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:38.270
and that's,
let me tell you how tough that is to live up to.
Yeah.
I mean,

835
00:51:38.271 --> 00:51:40.430
when you go by car iconic parents,

836
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:43.460
well that's exactly what I was gonna ask you that for you right now.

837
00:51:43.461 --> 00:51:47.390
It's like you have your mission,
which is the next part of his mission in a way.

838
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.340
And I've been up to the,
to the library and in Simeon.
It's incredible.

839
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:56.050
I was at the,
uh,
the first Democrat debate there,
two,

840
00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:00.260
two and a half years ago or so in this incredible building and just wonderful.

841
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.020
What else are you guys doing to keep these ideas alive?

842
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:06.350
Because that's really what will,
I mean the library,

843
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:10.310
the library does what they do and having the people come up there,

844
00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:14.870
the debate that they have there,
they have guests up there on a regular,
uh,

845
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.080
Gary's,
Denise is going to be up there pretty soon.
Um,

846
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.860
and then I work with the young America's foundation at the Reagan ranch center

847
00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:24.650
in Santa Barbara and the Reagan ranch where they bring high school kids from all

848
00:52:24.651 --> 00:52:26.450
over the country come in,

849
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.860
they bring in speakers to speak there at the ranch center.
Uh,

850
00:52:30.861 --> 00:52:33.730
they have lunches on Friday with speakers.
Uh,

851
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.800
they bring in college kids from all over the country,
uh,

852
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:40.710
to be able to come in and go up and walk in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan and

853
00:52:40.711 --> 00:52:41.990
see the ranch.
I mean,

854
00:52:41.991 --> 00:52:45.050
people go up there and think they're going to see this great mansion.

855
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.080
His,
his,

856
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:53.060
his ranch house would probably fit in your studio.
I mean,

857
00:52:53.061 --> 00:52:54.860
it just really,
it's a ranch house.

858
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.490
You don't go in there and see pictures of him with famous people.

859
00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:02.800
You go in there and see paintings of horses.
It's a very good chance.

860
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:06.890
That's what it is.
And that's where he loved to be in [inaudible].

861
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:11.800
When you walk in the door of the ranch house,
you'll see a,
uh,
a,
uh,
a big,
uh,

862
00:53:11.801 --> 00:53:16.310
a magazine,
uh,
from Montgomery Ward.
Uh,

863
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:17.780
and the reason he has that there,

864
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:21.530
his first job he ever tried to get was with Montgomery Ward and Iowa.

865
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:26.230
He turned him down and that's how he got into radio.

866
00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.350
He turned him down for Montgomery Ward job.

867
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.370
You'll never make a kid goes over to who are WOC radio.
Yeah.

868
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:37.540
Ends up getting a job as a sports caster.
WSC and Louise,
where I look,

869
00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:39.400
he never let someone else,

870
00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:44.320
my wife told me this and my dad lived it and greatest thing that Colleen ever

871
00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:44.950
told me,

872
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:49.900
don't let somebody else's attitude determine your attitude for the remainder of

873
00:53:49.901 --> 00:53:51.930
the day.
And,

874
00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:56.960
and my dad lived it and until I started to learn to live that I was a train

875
00:53:56.961 --> 00:54:00.710
wreck.
So the ideas,

876
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:02.860
the ideas that he believed in the corners though,

877
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.720
things you've talked about here,
about,
about freedom and that he's,

878
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.920
he basically saved capitalism and saved the west and all of these things.
When,

879
00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.360
when you see these days that there's this idea out there that socialism is cool

880
00:54:14.361 --> 00:54:17.090
for young people or you,
you hear this now,
I mean,
I see you on Twitter,

881
00:54:17.091 --> 00:54:21.870
you talk about this stuff.
Um,
scary.
It is scary.
Yeah.

882
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.480
Because our education system scary.
Yeah.

883
00:54:25.481 --> 00:54:28.810
When you think can think about the thinking about state cal from born and raised

884
00:54:28.811 --> 00:54:30.610
him,
people don't know.

885
00:54:30.611 --> 00:54:35.611
They used to be number one in education is now 46th in education.

886
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.180
I mean we're not educating our kids who we become politically correct to the

887
00:54:40.181 --> 00:54:44.050
education system.
Uh,
I remember when I went to Arizona State,

888
00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:48.940
which would disallow me from ever running for Supreme Court justice.

889
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:52.660
Um,
because we're on social probation,
Arizona state,

890
00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:57.370
everybody's on social probation.
We earned it the old fashioned way.
But you know,

891
00:54:57.371 --> 00:55:01.720
when I went to school,
you know,
we're heard from many different philosophers,

892
00:55:01.721 --> 00:55:06.010
different and different beliefs.
You heard them all and you know,

893
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.860
every week you said,
that sounds really good.
I think I'll be that this week,

894
00:55:09.861 --> 00:55:13.990
weekend,
the next week or another.
But you,
you,
you learn things.

895
00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:17.320
You had the breadth of knowledge.
Yeah,
you did.
Today it's,

896
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.860
it's completely different when you have schools who,

897
00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:26.080
who if you walk into some schools and you have a,
uh,

898
00:55:26.081 --> 00:55:30.240
Reagan hat,
yeah.
You know,
they get upset with you.

899
00:55:30.241 --> 00:55:34.510
Or if you're so polarized,
nobody's conversing.
Nobody's talking,

900
00:55:34.511 --> 00:55:37.390
nobody's sitting down.
Just let's have a conversation.

901
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:42.700
Let's find things that we agree on it.
It's always your,

902
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.100
you go to dinner,
you're afraid of,

903
00:55:45.101 --> 00:55:48.570
there's somebody sitting next to you afraid of saying anything for,

904
00:55:48.571 --> 00:55:52.030
for these people on this side of that stuff may get upset with what you're

905
00:55:52.031 --> 00:55:56.680
saying and start yelling and screaming at you and that sad.

906
00:55:56.681 --> 00:56:01.440
Or you have husbands or wives sitting down won't talk to each other.
[inaudible]

907
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:03.760
and it never used to be like that.

908
00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:06.760
We used to be able to communicate and just sit down and talk.

909
00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:10.330
I remember my dad saying to me one day,
his dad told him,
he said,

910
00:56:10.331 --> 00:56:14.320
you know when the government starts paying and not to not to work,
why work?

911
00:56:14.321 --> 00:56:17.260
His Dad taught him that.
My Dad taught me that,
you know,

912
00:56:17.261 --> 00:56:18.700
you try to teach your kids that,

913
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:21.730
but now you try to teach them and everybody's got their,
like their,

914
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:23.980
their handout.
It's really interesting.

915
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.480
We support a little school in the middle of a slum,
not the foundation.

916
00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:32.590
Clay and I know of a slum in India,
in Africa,

917
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.270
in Nairobi,
800,000 the slum school in the middle of it,
there were uniforms.

918
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.560
They teach them English.

919
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:41.970
They sing and they're smiling and they tell you is you're going through this

920
00:56:41.971 --> 00:56:44.790
slum.
They say if you see somebody with their handout,

921
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:49.210
please don't put anything in it.
Why?
Because will keep them in the slum.

922
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:53.170
You want to help the people,
the slum,
give them educational material.

923
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:57.250
Education's the only way out of this slump.
And I'm thinking to myself,

924
00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:58.780
why do they get it?

925
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:04.530
Why do they understand it in a slum of 800,000 in the middle of Nairobi?

926
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:10.240
And if I talk about it here,
I'm ridiculed.
How can you do that?

927
00:57:10.241 --> 00:57:13.990
How can you say that?
Yeah.
Maybe we've become fat on some of the success.

928
00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:17.830
That's because of a guy like your dad,
you know,
and it's uh,

929
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:22.780
it really,
it really is sad to,
to,
to look at.
I love traveling around the world.

930
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:26.290
You travel around the world and there's too many people here talking what they

931
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:30.010
think they know and they don't know anything cause they never been across their

932
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:33.550
own border,
but they know more than you do.
Don't you find that amazing yourself?

933
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:36.670
You'd go like,
really,
I've been,
you know,
you go,
I've been there.

934
00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:39.550
How do you know that?
Yeah,
we'll all the time now you hear all the,

935
00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:42.070
all the progressive,
they,
well we should just be more like Sweden.

936
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:44.530
Sweden's a tiny socialist country.

937
00:57:44.531 --> 00:57:47.650
That's basically a homogenous until the last couple of years where no longer is

938
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.770
and now they have all sorts of problems and it's like,
have you guys been there?

939
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:52.210
Have you seen what's going on?
And they'd never been there,

940
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:56.110
but I know more about than you do.
You just didn't see it when you were there,

941
00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:59.410
you know,
you didn't understand it called [inaudible].
Okay.
And that,

942
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.660
and so you do,
you find yourself,

943
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:06.430
unfortunately in a world today where people are afraid of dialogue,

944
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.900
they don't want to dialogue and,

945
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:13.050
and find that commonality like my father and tip O'Neill had to find a common

946
00:58:13.181 --> 00:58:16.390
ground to give you the largest tax break in American history and you just had to

947
00:58:16.391 --> 00:58:21.100
find it,
whatever it was.
And there's the people that elected Ronald Reagan,

948
00:58:21.101 --> 00:58:24.490
you're talking about the Reagan Democrats didn't necessarily agree with him,

949
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:29.950
but they liked it.
They liked it.
And because they liked him,

950
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:34.630
they supported him and,
and,
and voted for him.
And you know,

951
00:58:34.631 --> 00:58:39.100
it's getting to a point,
you know,
I want to see us be likable again.
Yeah.

952
00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.070
All right.
So I don't want to end on that note.
So let's end on,

953
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:45.400
if your dad was here,
what would he be telling us in this,

954
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:49.120
in this strange polarizing time they were talking about right now.
Grow Up.

955
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:54.610
Just grow up.
I mean,
really just hear,
like you said,

956
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:56.230
there they go again.

957
00:58:57.070 --> 00:59:00.550
Grow up and find a way to work together.

958
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:06.370
Uh,
that's,
that's what he's saying.
Fees very short and very sweet.

959
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.870
Grow Up.
You do a pretty good impression of your day,
by the way.

960
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:13.720
I only heard it for a second there,
but you know,

961
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:16.030
we had lunch while you're busting it out.

962
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:21.090
I did it on my radio show one time to interview with my dad doing both sides and

963
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:25.460
the office called me and they said,
how'd you get your dad on the air?

964
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.830
I said,
what are you talking about yesterday?
What are you talking about?
ABC,
NBC,

965
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:34.310
all these people call and there's a blackout on your dad because of Alzheimer's.

966
00:59:34.311 --> 00:59:38.420
How'd you get him on the air?
All of a sudden I realized,
oh my God,
wow.
I said,

967
00:59:38.421 --> 00:59:38.541
well,

968
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:42.320
I called and he answered the phone when he's not supposed to use on the phone.

969
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:45.140
I said,
well,
somebody should tell him.
And they said,
well,

970
00:59:45.141 --> 00:59:47.610
Nancy supposed to answer the phone.
I said,
well,
that's not my problem.
I call,

971
00:59:47.611 --> 00:59:50.690
he picked up the phone and say,
well,
you can't have them on the,

972
00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:54.470
on your show anymore.
And as well,
why don't you let me ask my dad.
I said,
Dad,

973
00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:57.440
do you want to be in my show again and well,
yes I do.

974
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:01.610
And also the office goes,
oh my God,

975
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.790
I see a volume full ABC,
NBC and CBS and my Dad's office.
I'm doing pretty good.

976
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.780
I'm going to tell the people to go to Reagan Legacy foundation.org.

977
01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:15.380
But would you prefer to do that as your dad?
Uh,
well yes.

978
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:20.980
If you could go to Reagan's legacy foundation.org or walkway to victory.com and

979
01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:27.440
really help help remember those who truly did save the world,

980
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:32.570
uh,
back in,
back in the day in,
in France.
And this is the way you can do it.

981
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.440
And as I said,
if you don't know someone who served,

982
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.320
then you can donate to the foundation.

983
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:44.950
And we have plenty of people and names that we'll put a name on a brick and put

984
01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:48.620
it out there.
And what we do is we'll send you a video.

985
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.870
We have a 50 minute video that we did,

986
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.510
heroes of World War II that we give this people who purchase a brick and you'll

987
01:00:55.511 --> 01:00:57.230
get a photo of the,
uh,

988
01:00:57.231 --> 01:01:01.430
of the brick in the ground there at Saint Mary Glee's,
Normandy,
France.

989
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:06.470
And when you visit normally go to Saint Mary Gullies and look at the look at the

990
01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:07.720
walkway to,

991
01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:11.630
to freedom block walkway delivery of the walkway and,

992
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:15.770
and see the name of the person that you bought.
If you put a name on a brick,

993
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:18.060
W it's been a pleasure chatting with you.

994
01:01:18.061 --> 01:01:22.070
And I sent to your dad's legacy is in good hands and I will tell them where to

995
01:01:22.071 --> 01:01:24.980
go,
but I'm not going to do the impression you guys go to Reagan Legacy

996
01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:26.480
foundation.org.
