00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.411
Uh, Mr. Cosby,
we're your lawyers.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.312
I think you know
why we've called this meeting.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.615
Of course, I do.
Because I did the ludes, and

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:19.919
the so-called raping, then
the licking and the bah, bah.

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.955
And the spewing and the fluids,
you know, all over the place.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.524
Well, well, well,
talking like that,

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.626
uh, in a deposition
is not a good idea.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.094
Yeah, we're gonna need
a really good defense,

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:29.896
a story you can stick to.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.765
My story is that I had a hit
TV show, and I danced,

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:37.170
and I went, bah, bah,
bah, boom, boo, boo.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.006
Boo. That's how we opened
the show. It was amazing.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.175
-That's my show.
-MAN: Um, how about this?

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.578
Michael Jackson,
Mike Tyson and you.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:48.181
-Mm-hmm. -What do all three
of you have in common?

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.482
COSBY:
Mah!

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:53.653
Come on now! We did the alleged
raping with the ludes.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.955
I did my knock 'em down,
I did the putting...

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:57.256
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.891
You're all successful black men.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.460
-COSBY: Yes.
-Okay?

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.462
Systematically taken down

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.665
because white America
couldn't stomach it.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.533
-Just like O.J.
-COSBY: Yes.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.269
Like O.J., the Simpson,
not the juice. Bah.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:14.107
Mr. Cosby, it's a conspiracy,
a race-based conspiracy.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.008
COSBY:
Correct.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.211
Cappuccino?

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.046
I mean, I may regret this,

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.181
but that doesn't look delicious,
right?

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:24.016
I could use a little afternoon
pick-me-up. I mean...

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.952
-Yeah. Milk. -Oh, look at that.
Come on.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:29.088
He's putting sugar or whatever
that is in it. It's fine.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.691
There you go, young man.
Have a sip. Bah!

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.728
-Go! Go! -Uh, maybe these women
were paid to bring you down.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.498
Hmm? Maybe they entrapped you.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.500
Yes. You were just trying
to mentor them.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.235
-You're the real victim.
-Good.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.769
-COSBY: That's exactly right.
-MAN: Yes!

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.072
And then, I did the alleged
sucking on the toes,

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:50.109
and the woos-woos and, uh, and
the licking of the pudding pop.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.612
-Bah, bah, bah.
-(whooshing)

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.547
Smoothie? Hmm?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.549
-I probably shouldn't.
-Bah!

00:01:56.582 --> 00:02:01.921
But I did skip lunch, so maybe
just have a little... Mmm!

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:04.357
Delicious?
Is that a banana?

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.626
Well, there's some banana
and some ludes.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.795
You know, the secret is
in the ludes.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:11.130
And that is a great example
of things

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.132
we should definitely not say
during a deposition.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:17.036
Agreed, Counsel. Uh, we need
to be more specific here.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.272
Let's think of some white groups
that would hate you the most.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.373
THEDE:
Yes.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.507
Hate, yes.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.308
White liberals.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.543
Correctamundo.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:24.777
That is exactly true.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.512
White liberals hate

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.915
when you tell black teens
to pull their pants up.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.082
-Yes.
-COSBY: Ugh.

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:31.417
This is precisely

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.219
what I've been trying
to tell you all this time.

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.488
And these belt-aphobes
are trying to take you down

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.090
because you tell teens
to pull their pants up.

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:39.926
That's right.
This can work. I like this.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:40.993
-Yeah.
-(whirring)

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:41.928
Snow cone?

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.095
Oh, that's a fun surprise.

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:44.130
Yes!

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:45.364
Don't mind if I do.

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:47.266
-Really can't see
why I wouldn't. -COSBY: Oh.

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.868
To the Cosby
and the getting off,

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:52.505
and not in the sexual way,
but in the legal way. Bah!

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:54.874
Oh!

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.511
Cosby, you did it again.

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:01.847
Bah! Bur.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.880
Ooh.
