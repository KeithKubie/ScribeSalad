00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
This is the story of the man who helped turn conservative evangelicals into a political force.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.719
I want to talk a little bit about how much our family respects and admires

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.620
Paul Weyrich… I want to be like Paul Weyrich when I grow up.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.240
Paul Weyrich has been called the main architect of the religious right. Here he is in 2005.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.040
Those people were not active in politics, and I served as sort of a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.280
a coach to get them active in the political process.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.420
He also co-founded conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and the Free

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.140
Congress Foundation. And he managed to galvanize the evangelical vote around a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.980
man who wasn’t even an evangelical.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.900
God bless America. Thank you.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.700
Does that feel familiar? Because a similar thing happened in 2016 with the election of President Donald Trump.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.140
Two corinthians, Two corinthians 3:17. That’s the whole ball game.  Is that the one? Is that the one you like?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.620
I think that’s the one you like, ‘cause I loved it.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.140
Hey fam, I’m Imaeyen, and this Sunday we're going to look at the man behind the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.610
evangelical political movement – and how it wasn't abortion that created the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.560
religious right in the United States.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.880
You might have been told that the movement began with Roe v Wade, but

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.460
according to Randall Balmer, a religious historian, it actually began with Paul Weyrich.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.360
One of the most cherished myths of the religious right is that this is a

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.759
movement that got its origins in reaction to the Roe v. Wade decision.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.610
It's a great story. It's been repeated many, many times. It is also utter fiction.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.509
It was Weyrich’s calculated effort that made the religious right a political force,

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.920
and his plan took years to complete.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.160
Conservatives were wandering around lost in the liberal wilderness. And then Paul Weyrich came to Washington.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.210
When Weyrich arrived in Washington, DC in the late 1960s he was to the right of

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.200
more liberal Republicans, which made him a minority in his own party.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.840
Back then, the worlds of religion and politics were largely separate.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.640
But Weyrich was determined to change that by courting white Evangelicals.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.380
The group had retreated from politics after the so-called “Scopes Monkey Trial” in 1925,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.220
which really centered around teaching evolution in schools. Not only did the white

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.910
evangelicals lose, but they also were humiliated in the public eye.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.049
Paul Weyrich, according to his own account, had been trying since the 1964

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.670
presidential campaign to get evangelicals active in politics. He tried

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.959
everything. He said he tried the school prayer issue, he tried the abortion issue,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.160
he tried pornography. In the end, Weyrich landed on school segregation in the South.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.740
Some carried a doll in a miniature coffin – an effigy of Federal Judge J. Skelly

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.180
Wright, who ordered the admission of five Negro girls to [inaudible] in New Orleans last week.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.880
And I have to give you a bit of backstory first, so

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.769
please stay with me. In 1970, public schools in seven states were racially

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.090
segregated. This was over a decade and a half after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.750
segregated schools were unconstitutional with its Brown v. Board of Education

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.739
decision. Mississippi was one of the states fighting hardest against

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.340
integration. State leaders claimed that their "freedom of choice" system allowed

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.660
black children to attend white schools. In reality, black families were subject

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.280
to intimidation if they tried to enroll.
And some white families were so opposed

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.610
to integration that they abandoned public schools altogether.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.420
In Holmes County, Mississippi, there were no white students left in the public school

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.710
system just two years after desegregation. So where were they all going?

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.780
Well, between 1966 and 1970 the percentage of private schools in the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.250
state rose, and the number of students attending those schools tripled. Most of

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.640
this growth occurred in black-majority districts.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.680
There were segregation academies -- church-sponsored, that were applying for tax-exempt status.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.620
Then, in 1969, a group of African-American parents in Holmes County sued

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.250
the Treasury Department to prevent three new segregation academies from getting that

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.980
tax-exempt status. And they won.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.980
The court ruled that any organization that engages in racial segregation, or racial discrimination,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.400
is not by definition a charitable institution. The following year, President Richard Nixon ordered the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.780
IRS to enact new policy denying tax exemptions to all segregated schools.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.540
In 1971, the Green v. Connally district court case ruling upheld the new IRS policy.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.820
And evangelical leaders didn’t like it, which is where Paul Weyrich re-enters our story.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.400
Paul Weyrich finally found the issue

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.760
would get the attention of people like
Jerry Falwell ,who had his own

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.050
segregation academy in Lynchburg,
Virginia, Bob Jones Jr., Bob Jones

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.540
University; and a broader array of evangelical leaders.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.560
Weyrich and Falwell managed to shift the grounds of the debate. They turned it into a

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.290
conversation about government interference and religious freedom,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.700
instead of what it really was: a defense of racist policies. They used the issue to

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.060
attack Democratic president and evangelical Jimmy Carter even though it

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.210
was Republican President Nixon who came down hard on segregation academies.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.010
Bob Jones University lost its tax exemption a year and a day

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.210
before Carter was inaugurated. So Weyrich had figured out how to win

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.190
over evangelical leaders. But to win elections, he still needed an issue to

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.890
get grassroots evangelical voters to the polls.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.930
He realized that defending racial discrimination might not be it.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.480
Now this is where the abortion debate comes in. Here’s Falwell in 1982.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:49.340
It began in January of '73, when Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade ruled abortion legal on demand.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.600
But pause. Balmer says evangelical leaders didn’t pursue abortion as an issue right away.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.780
Jerry Falwell, by his own admission, did not preach against abortion

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.780
until February of 1978, more than five years after the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:15.120
The key moment for abortion comes in the 1978 midterm elections.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.900
Weyrich then resolved that he would go out and elect some improbable people.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.189
Weyrich threw all his effort into getting anti-abortion Republican

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:30.009
candidates elected in Minnesota and Iowa. The final weekend of the campaign, pro-lifers

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.889
leafletted church parking lots. And two days later, in an election with a very

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:45.550
low turnout, all four Democratic nominees lost to pro-life Republicans.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.360
That’s when Weyrich realized abortion was an issue he could use to bring evangelicals

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.800
to the polls, and maybe even turn them against one of their own - President Jimmy Carter.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.320
Before he was elected, Jimmy Carter was a Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.960
And what does the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy…

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.219
He embodied the idea of progressive evangelicalism and won the presidential election

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:18.219
in 1976. In 1979, Falwell created a group called the Moral Majority – but

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:22.060
the term was actually coined by Weyrich. The Moral Majority declared war on

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.740
abortion and homosexuality. Then the group enlisted the help of Francis A.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.520
Schaeffer.  Schaeffer worked with C. Everett Koop to produce a series

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.539
of films called Whatever Happened to the Human Race, and toured the country

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:39.729
screening them for evangelical audiences. Here’s what the films looked like.

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:44.589
The fact that human life is being devaluated is demonstrated by some of the major

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:51.029
issues which are being debated by society today: abortion, infanticide,

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:55.699
euthanasia. And as that series of films begins to travel

00:07:55.699 --> 00:08:01.249
and circulate across North America, evangelicals become finely attuned to the

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:05.520
abortion issue in advance of the 1980 presidential campaign.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.480
Ronald Reagan courted conservative evangelicals. And he won their support, despite the fact that

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.180
he signed a bill making it easier for women to have abortions back when he was

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.689
the governor of California. Here he is, employing explicitly

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:24.379
religious language in his acceptance speech: Can we begin our crusade joined

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:30.110
together in a moment of silent prayer? Reagan is a man who wasn’t even a

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.740
regular church attendee. Yet during his presidential campaign, he spoke

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:40.580
to 10,000 evangelicals at a rally in Dallas, Texas. He talked about the “unconstitutional regulatory agenda”

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.220
directed by the IRS “against independent schools” AKA segregation academies.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.060
He mentions creationism, he also mentions

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.860
the IRS going after the tax-exempt status of segregation

00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:00.110
academies. He does not mention abortion in the course of that speech. So even as late as

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:06.980
August 1980, the Republican Party was not sure that abortion would work for them as a political issue.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.560
Listen, there are a number of reasons Reagan won the election.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:15.300
But he very well might have tapped into something that Trump and Steve Bannon utilized decades later.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.120
In the 2016 election, 81% of white

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:24.079
evangelicals voted for Donald Trump, a man who, at least on the face of it, does

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.440
does not seem to be a logical representative for family values.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.940
Evangelicals have been able to persuade, at least themselves, that they are victims of some sort

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.620
of religious discrimination. Christianity, it’s under siege.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:44.540
Balmer also says there are parallels between the beginnings of the religious right and the rhetoric that

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.320
Donald Trump used during his presidential campaign.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:54.880
The 2016 election allowed the religious right finally to circle back to the founding principles of

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:58.230
their movement, and the founding principles, sadly enough,

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.540
are racism and racial segregation.
