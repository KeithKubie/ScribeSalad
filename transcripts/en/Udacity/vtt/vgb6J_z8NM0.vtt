00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.692
Now we're ready for a quiz where you're going to define a procedure yourself.

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:10.000
Your goal is to define a procedure named square that takes 1 number as its input

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and outputs the square of that number.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What I mean by square is the result of multiplying the input number by itself.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.754
See if you can define a procedure that does that.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:23.000
If it's correct, you should get results like this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So if you do print the result of square(5), the output that's printed should be 25.
