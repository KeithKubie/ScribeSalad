00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.850
The first thing that comes through your mind when you see a white shark coming towards you is,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.960
"Oh my goodness, that's a white shark.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.660
It looks like in the movies."

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.180
They're long, but their girth is what's incredible.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.130
The bodies of these animals are just enormous.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.609
They're very aggressive and dangerous animals, but we could collect very close, within inches,

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.669
footage of these animals by getting in there with the virtual reality technology.

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.900
The idea is to create the most realistic fear exploration studies

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.000
and the only way to do that is to go into the field and experience real fear.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.620
The Huberman Lab is basically a wide-range kingdom of neuroscience tools and techniques.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.740
Everyone in the lab is interested in some
basic and important question

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.500
about how the brain works, how it wires up during development, or how to make it better

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.440
in response to injury, disease, or experience.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.340
The other question that we're working on is:
how is fear represented in the brain?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.530
We discovered recently a brain area that,
when itâ€™s active, converts the fear response

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.550
into a courage response.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.820
People talk about 'fight or flight,' but that's
really a misnomer.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.100
Most animals, including humans, don't fight
when they're afraid.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.700
They either run or they freeze.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.409
But we found a brain area that sits smack
dab in the middle of the brain that,

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.460
when activated, encourages the animal to confront their fears behaviorally.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.360
The Huberman Lab is using virtual reality to test some of the ideas and mechanisms

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.109
that we discovered in mice, in humans.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:41.900
By combining visual stimulation through the VR with auditory stimulation and even tactile stimulation,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.000
or what we call mixed reality, you can create brain and body sensations, if you will,

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.679
that are extremely realistic.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.670
And from that standpoint, it's not just a
tool; it's a power tool for neuroscience.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.149
Not just the belief, but the sensation, the
feeling, that they're in that real-world environment.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.119
That real-world environment could be walking along the edge of a very tall building,

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.050
with fear of falling off, or the experience of swimming with great white sharks.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.180
And at the same time, we're monitoring things like the size of their pupil of their eye,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.709
which is a readout of how much stress or arousal they're undergoing at any moment.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.880
We're recording their breathing. We're recording their body posture.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.030
We want to create the most realistic fear
neuroscience laboratory possible

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.420
and in order to do that, we have to go straight to the source and have the real experiences

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.020
to bring them to the lab.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.150
We're out next to, not on but next to, Guadalupe Island, Mexico.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.220
There's nothing else around.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.850
The great white sharks come here each year to feed.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.640
The waters here are loaded with tuna and mackerel and seals.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.409
We plant anchor, then we lower cages each day.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.800
One cage is for viewing the sharks that come in to the surface to feed,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.500
and there's another cage that we lower by crane from the boat, which drops down to 30 feet.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.500
I was measuring people's stress levels, and giving people tools to control their stress levels.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.640
And the reason for this is to be able to compare those tools that we use in the field

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.320
with the tools that we're using in the laboratory.

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:19.060
We edit the footage and then bring it into
the laboratory, where you or other subjects

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.870
can come in and get the experience of what it's like to swim with those animals.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.580
You basically get the experience as real as it can get, except you're not in the actual water.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.700
We want to change the way that mental disease, and fear-related mental diseases,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.810
like chronic anxiety, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as depression

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.750
and other anxiety-related disorders, are diagnosed by incorporating objective, measurable things

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.439
like heart rate, like breathing, like pupil
size, in addition to what people say.

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:55.400
And so, we imagine that the data are going to be immensely useful for diagnosing mental disease,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.269
so that when people say that they're
feeling better or that they're not feeling better,

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.560
we can start to attach some real physiological measures to those statements

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.880
and start to compare them.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.489
I feel it's my obligation as a scientist and
as a human being really, to develop new tools

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.390
for the treatment of these incredibly debilitating disorders.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.380
It's also just an immensely interesting problem.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.160
At a very basic level, I want to understand
how the brain works,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.880
and if I get to dive with some great white sharks too, well, that's pretty cool.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.460
In another episode of Science In The Extremes,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.120
a hurricane hunter goes straight to the eye of the storm.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.440
