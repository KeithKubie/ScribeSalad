00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.460
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.660
So this is the second
lecture about these pictures,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.990
in the phase plane
that's with axes y and y

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.330
prime, for a second order
constant coefficient

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.470
linear, good problem.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.160
Good problem.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.330
And you remember that
we study that equation

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.360
by looking for special
solutions y equals e to the st.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.400
When we plug that
into the equation,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.250
we get this simple
quadratic equation.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.530
And everything depends on that.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.260
So today this video
is about the case

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.340
when the roots are complex.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.680
You remember, so the
roots, complex roots, you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.080
have a real part, plus or
minus an imaginary part.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.720
And this happens when b
squared is smaller than 4ac.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.830
Because you remember,
there's a square root

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.280
in the formula for the solution
of a quadratic equation.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.620
There's a square root
of b squared minus 4ac,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.770
the usual formula from school.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.420
And if b squared is smaller,
we have a negative number

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.990
under the square root.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.560
And we get complex roots.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.370
So last time the
roots were real.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.420
The pictures in the phase
plane set off to infinity,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.990
or came in to 0, more or less
almost on straight lines.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.970
Now we're going to have
curves and spirals, because

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.070
of the complex part.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.390
So here are the three
possibilities now.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.130
We had three last time.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.560
Here are the other three
with complex roots.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.050
So the complex, the
real part, everything

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.230
depends on this real
part that the stability

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.850
going in, going out,
staying on a circle

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.900
depends on that real part.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.640
If the real part is
positive, then we go out.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.260
We have an exponential e
to the a plus i omega t.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.190
And if a is positive that e to
the at would blow up, unstable.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.170
So that's unstable.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.390
Here is a center.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.020
When a is zero, then we just
have e to the i omega t.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.660
That's the nicest example.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.430
I do that one first.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.075
So in that case we're just
going around in a circle

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:46.620
or around in an ellipse.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.600
And finally, the
physical problem

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.360
where we have damping,
but not too much damping.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.970
So the roots are still complex.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.630
But they're going in.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.930
Because if a is negative,
e to the at is going to 0.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.210
So that's a stable case.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.970
That's a physical case.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.340
We hope to have a little damping
in our system, and be stable.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.730
This one we could
say neutrally stable.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.010
This one is certainly unstable.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.360
Let me start with that,
the neutrally stable.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.920
Because that's the most famous
equation in second order

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.240
equation in mechanics.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.170
It's pure oscillation, a
spring going up and down,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.440
an LC circuit going back
and forth, pure oscillation.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.720
And we see the solutions.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.160
So I've written-- I've taken
this particular equation.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.740
You notice no damping.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.630
There's no y prime term.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.320
OK.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.500
So here is the solution,
famous, famous solution.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.910
And y prime it
will be c1, I guess

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.990
the derivative of the
cosine is minus omega times

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.380
sine omega t, plus c2.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.600
The derivative of that
is omega cos omega t.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.630
So that's the y and y prime.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.170
So for every t, it's going
to be an easy figure.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.530
Here is y.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.400
Here is y prime.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.650
And that's the phase
plane, phase plane.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.810
So at each time t, I
have a y and a y prime.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.245
And it gives me a point.

00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:48.110
So let me put it in there.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.440
As time moves on
that point moves.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.080
And it's the picture
in the phase plane,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.320
the orbit sometimes
you could say,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.840
it's kind of like
a planet or a moon.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.740
So for that, what is
the orbit for that one?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.390
Well it goes around
in an ellipse.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.280
It would be a circle
with-- let me draw it.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.800
This is the case omega equal 1.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.150
In that case, in that
most famous case,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.310
we simply go around a circle.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.250
There's y.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.120
There's y prime.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.630
We have cosine and sine and
cos squared plus sine squared

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.100
is 1 squared.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.780
And we're going around a circle
of radius 1, or another circle

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.930
depending on the
initial condition.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.460
Here there's a factor
omega, giving an extra push

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.050
to y prime.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.160
So if omega was 2, for
example, then we'd have a 2

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.160
in y prime from the omega,
which is not in the y.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.860
And that would make y
prime a little larger.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.750
And it would be twice as--
it would go up to twice as--

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.850
that's meant to be, meant to
be an ellipse with height 2 up

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:17.320
there, or in general
omega, and 1 there.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.180
So in the y direction
there is no factor omega.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.670
And we just have
cosine and sine.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.260
And that would be a typical
picture in the phase plane.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.730
But if we started with
smaller initial conditions,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.950
we would travel on
another ellipse.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.200
But the point is--
and these are called,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.060
this picture is called a center.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.010
So that's one of the six
possibilities, and in some way,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.980
kind of the most beautiful.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.200
You get ellipsis
in the phase plane.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.370
They close off.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.870
Because the solution just
repeats itself every period.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.470
It's periodic.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.700
y is periodic.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.280
y prime is periodic.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.280
They come around again
and again and again.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.450
No energy is lost, conservation
of energy, perfection.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.735
And I would say neutrally
stable, neutral stability.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.670
The solution doesn't go into 0.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.260
Because there's no damping.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.500
It doesn't go out to infinity.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.030
Because there's constant energy.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.560
And that's the picture
in the phase plane.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.490
OK.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.820
So that's the center.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.950
And now I'll draw one
with a source, or a sink.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.730
I just have to change
the sign on damping

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.640
to get source or sink.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.560
So let me do that.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:56.235
So now I'm going to do
a spiral source or sink.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.090
This is the unstable one,
going out to infinity.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.970
This is the stable
one coming in to 0.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:14.960
And let me do y double prime,
plus or maybe minus 4y prime,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.470
plus 4y equals 0.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.850
Suppose I take that equation.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:25.570
Then I have s squared
plus 4s, oh maybe--

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.740
maybe 2 is a nicer number.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.340
2 is nicer than 4.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.510
Let me change this
to a 2, and a 2.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:41.210
And so I have s
squared plus 2s plus 2

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.390
or minus 2s plus 2 equals 0.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:53.400
So those are my-- positive
damping would be with a plus.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:01.010
So with a plus sign, the roots
are s squared plus 2s plus 2.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:08.200
The roots are 1, or rather
a minus 1 plus or minus i.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:19.890
Plus sign, and then the
minus sign, with a minus 2.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:26.320
Then all the roots have
a plus, plus or minus i.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.890
Everything is depending on
these roots, these exponents,

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.900
which are the solutions of
the special characteristic

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.970
equation, the simple
quadratic equation.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.190
And you see that depending
on positive damping

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:48.110
or a negative damping, I get
stability or instability.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.240
And let me draw a picture.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.050
I don't if I can try two
pictures in the same thing,

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.830
probably not.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.170
That wouldn't be smart.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.620
So what's happening then?

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.040
Let's take this one.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:06.010
So this solution y
is e to the minus t.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.120
That's what's making it
stable coming into 0, times--

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:20.810
and from here we have
c1 cos t and c2 sine t.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.460
That's what we get
from the usual,

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.560
as in the case of a center that
carries us around the circle.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.540
So what's happening in this
picture, in this phase plane?

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:38.080
Here's a phase plane
again, y and y prime.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.270
Without the minus
1, we have a center.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.830
We just go around in a circle.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.780
But now because of
the minus 1, which

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.380
is the factor e to the
minus t in the solution,

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.360
as we go around we come in.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.300
And the word for that
curve is a spiral.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:08.130
So this would be the center,
going around in a circle.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.630
But now suppose we start here.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:17.210
Suppose we start at y equal
1, and y prime equal 0,

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.090
start there at time 0.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.190
Let time go.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.980
Plot where we go.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.310
Where does this y
and the y prime,

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.770
where is the point, y, y prime?

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.410
OK.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.950
I'm starting it at-- so I'm
probably taking c1 as 1,

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.560
and c2 as 0.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.780
So I'm starting it right there.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.680
And then I'll travel
along, depending on sines.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.330
I would go, I think,
probably this way.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.150
So it will travel
on a-- it comes in

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.960
pretty fast, of course.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.780
Because that exponential
is a powerful guy

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.460
that e to the minus t.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:12.980
So this is the solution,
damping out to 0.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.890
That's with the plus
sign, plus damping,

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:23.240
which gives the minus sign
in the s, in the exponent.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.310
And then so that
is a spiral sink.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.790
Sink meaning just as
water in a bathtub

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.330
flows in, that's what happens.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.260
Now what happens in a
spiral source that's

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.490
what we have with a minus sign.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.110
Now we have a 1.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.500
Now we have an e to the plus t.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.940
Everything is growing.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:53.340
So instead of decaying, we're
going around but growing-- OK.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:59.110
I'm off the board, way off
the board with that spiral.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.170
Which is going to
keep going around,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.240
but explode out to infinity.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.640
So those are the
three possibilities

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.790
for complex roots, centers,
spiral source, and spiral sink.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.520
For real roots we
had ordinary source,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.070
and ordinary sink, no spiral.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:25.060
And then the other possibility
was a saddle point,

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.000
where almost surely we go out.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.160
But there was one direction
that came into the saddle point.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.660
OK.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.560
Those six pictures
are going to control

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.790
the whole problem of stability,
which is our next subject.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.570
Thank you.
