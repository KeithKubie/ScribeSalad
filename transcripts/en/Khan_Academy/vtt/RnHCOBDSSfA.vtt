00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.380
- [Instructor] In this
video, we are going to talk

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.000
about the evolution of
photosynthesis on Earth

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.840
because that's the only place that,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.130
at least so far, we're aware
of photosynthesis occurring.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.890
I personally believe that it's occurring

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.190
in many places in the universe

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.420
but we don't really know just yet.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.760
But first, a reminder of
what photosynthesis even is.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.080
It's the process where organisms

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.040
are able to take carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.270
in the presence of water.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.783
And then use the sun's
energy, so sunlight,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.573
to then produce sugars,

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:42.610
C6H12O6

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.660
and three oxygen, so O2.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.550
Now, the way I've written it,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.320
this chemical equation right
over here, it hasn't balanced.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.910
So see, I have six carbons here,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.210
so let me put a six out front there.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.730
But now, let's see, I
have 12 hydrogens here.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.370
I only have two hydrogens here,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.830
so let me multiply this by six as well.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.470
And let's see, on the left-hand side,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.860
I have two oxygens times six is 12

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.540
plus another six oxygens, 18 oxygens,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.160
so I need 18 oxygens over here.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.080
I already have six right over here,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.700
so I'll need another 12 right over here,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.080
so I'll put a six out front.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.820
So, I have balanced that.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.510
It's important for you to realize

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.530
that this is a really big deal.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.330
You would not exist
without photosynthesis,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.340
and I know what you're thinking.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.570
You don't photosynthesize things.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.130
But the things that you eat

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.970
or the things that you eat,
the things that they eat,

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.770
they do some sort of photosynthesis.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.830
At the end of the day, our
energy is coming from the sun.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.560
Even if you're eating an animal,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.330
that animal might be eating another animal

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.960
that eats a plant, and that
plant is using the sun's energy

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.940
and it's storing it in the form

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.060
of carbon-based molecules,
oftentimes sugars.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.010
And then when we eat these things,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.190
we are able to produce energy for them

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.110
and do things like educational videos.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.680
But an interesting question
is where does this come from.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.280
And a straightforward answer

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.460
is we don't have all the answers

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.470
but scientists have a reasonably good idea

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.850
of where it probably came from.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.410
Today, we can observe cyanobacteria.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.640
This is what cyanobacteria looks like.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.320
It is like all bacteria prokaryotic

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.880
and it is able to conduct photosynthesis.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.670
And scientists believe

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.870
that organisms not too
different from cyanobacteria,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.560
probably an ancestor of cyanobacteria,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.350
existed on Earth two
and half, three billion,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.510
maybe even older,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.260
maybe even further back
in time, years ago,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.300
and that's early in Earth's history.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.810
Earth has only been around

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.680
for about four and a half billion years.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.420
And that ancestor of
cyanobacteria, like cyanobacteria,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.350
was able to take carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.840
in the presence of water
and produce oxygen.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.730
And even though this is bacteria

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.360
and each of these
organisms are very small,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.610
in aggregate, they can have
a pretty significant impact.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.560
For example, this is a
cyanobacteria plume near Fiji

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.550
and you can see that these
are pretty significant things

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.730
that can be a significant contributor

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.820
to oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.740
And scientists believe

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.680
that it was these
ancestors of cyanobacteria

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.360
that as they evolved on Earth

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.600
and started growing and
growing and multiplying

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.500
that they started to
affect Earth's atmosphere.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.500
So, what you see in this
chart right over here

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.410
is our best sense of
what the oxygen content

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.210
in the atmosphere was
if we go back in time.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.990
And we can start to figure this out

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.640
based by looking at rock
samples that are very, very old,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.300
by looking at the fossil
record, very, very old.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.830
So, just so you get, you
understand what's going on here,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.040
this horizontal axis right over here,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.710
this is billions of years ago.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.630
This is one billion years
ago, two billion years ago,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.210
three billion years ago,
3.8 billion years ago,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.860
so it covers most of Earth's history.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.770
If you just wanna put things in context,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.080
humans, modern humans
have only been around

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.030
for about two or 300,000 years,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.120
so we wouldn't even show up as a pixel

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.360
on this diagram right over here.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.720
So we're going back into deep time.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.960
And scientists believe

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.420
that the first photosynthetic organisms

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.690
might have evolved approaching
three billion years ago,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.500
although we're not exactly sure.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.930
And those organisms might
have been producing oxygen

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.960
from the photosynthesis, but
it might have been absorbed

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.400
by things like the ocean.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.380
But eventually, those organisms,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.160
probably these ancestors of cyanobacteria

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.300
became significant enough

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.050
that the oxygen started
pouring in the atmosphere,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.930
and we start to see that right over here.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.170
Before this point,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.450
the oxygen was pretty
close to zero percent

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.860
and then right over here at
the Great Oxygenation Event,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.960
I'll just call it GOE,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.680
all of a sudden, oxygen becomes a larger

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.240
and larger percentage of the atmosphere,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.720
and these two lines represent
two different estimates

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.070
of what percentage of
the atmosphere oxygen was

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.350
at these various times,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.300
and it grew all the way to modern times

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.210
where oxygen is roughly 20
or 21% of our atmosphere.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.043
And the reason why

00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:17.750
this is sometimes called
the Oxygen Catastrophe,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.590
is that there were a lot
of anaerobic organisms

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.870
that found oxygen poisonous,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.810
and so there was a great extinction event

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.310
from all of these oxygen
in the atmosphere,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.050
but it was not a catastrophe
for what eventually would be us

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.980
because we are dependent,
not just on the sugars

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.730
from photosynthesis,
but we're also dependent

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.640
on the oxygen from photosynthesis.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.100
We use this oxygen to conduct respiration.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.240
You can almost view respiration
as a backwards process.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.730
You take your sugars and
in the presence of oxygen,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.470
you are able to extract that
energy from those sugars

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.560
so that we can live.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.040
Now, an interesting question
is at what point did we go

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.270
from these prokaryotic bacteria organisms

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.290
to eukaryotic organisms

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.750
that are able to perform photosynthesis?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.960
Most notably, plants.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.820
Well, this goes back to
endosymbiosis theory.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.960
We have a whole other video on that,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.230
but it's this idea that the ancestors

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.920
of the cyanobacteria might
have lived in symbiosis

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.970
with another eukaryotic cell,

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.140
where the cyanobacteria ancestor

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.050
was able to harness light energy

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.230
to produce sugars for the larger cell.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.770
And in return, the larger cell

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.800
was able to give protection or nutrients.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.630
And so, we believe, based
on endosymbiosis theory

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.550
that chloroplasts, and right
over here, you see plant cells

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.730
with visible chloroplasts in them,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.770
that chloroplasts are actually descendants

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.140
of those ancestors of cyanobacteria,

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.930
cyanobacteria would be
other descendants of them,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.180
but these are the ones
that started to live

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.960
in symbiosis with what would
later become plant cells.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.010
And good evidence that
these might have ancestors

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.410
that used to live independently
is that they have DNA

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.570
that is very similar to
the DNA of cyanobacteria.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.060
They have ribosomes, their own ribosomes,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.350
that are very similar to the
ribosomes of cyanobacteria.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.450
And so, like mitochondria,
we believe chloroplast

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.740
originated as independent
bacteria-like organisms

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.720
and eventually were engulfed
into eukaryotic cells.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.250
So, I will leave you there.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.400
Photosynthesis is a big deal,
and it's really interesting

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.580
to think about where it came from.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.470
It likely evolved on Earth
many billions of years ago,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.380
probably close to three billion years ago,

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.140
but around 2.3, 2.4 billions years ago,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.460
it fundamentally changed the planet

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.050
where you had oxygen
pouring into the atmosphere,

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.610
killing a lot of organisms,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.740
but making it possible for
many other organisms to live.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.380
And those early photosynthetic organisms,

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.710
some of them had descendants

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.760
that ended up living in symbiosis

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.570
with larger eukaryotic cells

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.353
that would eventually evolve
into things like plant cells.
