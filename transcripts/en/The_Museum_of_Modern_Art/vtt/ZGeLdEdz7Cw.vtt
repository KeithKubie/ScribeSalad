00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We dug the boat out of the mire

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
at the seashore in my hometown.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.300
It was actually covered in sludge.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So we waited till the tide had taken
some of the sludge away

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to dig the boat out.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Then we cleaned and disassembled it,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.500
and eventually brought it to New York.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
I wanted to expose the skeleton

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.200
the frame of the boat, which looked more like an artwork.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The story of borrowing the enemy's arrows is about borrowing the opponent's strength

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to make oneself strong in a short time.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.500
There was a very resourceful
general called Zhuge Liang.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.200
He filled the boats with straw soldiers and sailed toward the enemy's camp.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.000
Mistaking the boats with straw soldiers for a surprise attack

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.000
the enemy showered the decoys with volleys of arrows.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.300
The boat is a very familiar object to me.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.000
It is one of the earliest vehicles that helped humans understand their relationship with gravity.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
However, when the body of the boat is full of arrows like feathers

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.000
it suddenly transforms into a bird and seems able to fly.
