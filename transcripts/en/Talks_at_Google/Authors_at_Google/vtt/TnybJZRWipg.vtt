IJEOMA OLUO: Thank you so much
for coming out and hearing

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.931
my talk.

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:10.721
Just so you guys know,
what I'm going to do

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:12.840
is I'm going to briefly
read just an introduction

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.600
from my book, which
I think actually ties

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.100
pretty well into
what we're going

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.400
to be talking about today.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.030
And then I'm going to
talk a little bit about,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.990
as was said before, why it is
so tough to talk about race.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.719
And then, why do we still
kind of have to do it anyway.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.010
And then I'm going to open
up to questions and answers,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.080
and hopefully you will be
inspired to ask questions now

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.180
that you've learned
why we need to be

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.570
talking about these things.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.445
Now of course I
expect that we will

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:43.570
be kind to each other and
respectful of each other,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.300
and when we ask these
questions that we

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.220
will be considerate of the
feelings of people here,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.600
especially people who are
living with the realities

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.580
of racial oppression
everyday and whom

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.290
this discussion will always
take a little bit more out of.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.310
So I'm going to start reading.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.200
As a black woman,
race has always

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.590
been a prominent
part of my life.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.310
I have never been able
to escape the fact

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.700
that I am a black woman in
a white supremacist country.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.670
My blackness is woven into
how I dress each morning, what

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.030
bars I feel comfortable
going to, what music I enjoy,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.340
what neighborhoods
I hang out in.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.820
The realities of race have not
always been welcome in my life,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.560
but they have always been there.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.880
When I was a young child, it
was the constant questions

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.820
of why I was so dark
when my mom was so white.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.140
Was I adopted?

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.180
Where did I come from?

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.330
When I became older, it was the
clothes not cut for my shape,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.630
and the snide comments
about my hair and lips,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.090
and the teen idols that
would never, ever find

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.680
a girl like me beautiful.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.590
Then it was the clerks who
would follow me around stores,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.990
and the jobs that were hiring
until I walked in the door

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.820
and then they were not.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.570
It was the bosses who told
me that I was too loud,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.280
the compliments that my hair--

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.610
the comments that my hair was
too ethnic for the office,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.490
and why, even though I
was a valued employee,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.820
I was making so much less money
than other white employees

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.760
doing the same job.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.630
It is the cops I can't
make eye contact with,

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.770
the Ubers that
abandon their pickup,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.380
driving on instead of
stopping when they see me.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.560
When I had my sons,
it was the assumptions

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.720
that they were older
than they were,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.480
and that their roughhousing
was too violent.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.010
It was the tears they
came home with when

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.040
a classmate had repeated
an ignorant comment

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.980
of their parents.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.070
But race has also been
countless hours spent

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.320
marveling at our
history, evenings

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.420
spent dancing and
cheering to jazz and rap

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.380
and R&amp;B, cookouts with
ribs and potato salad

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.110
and sweet potato pie.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.890
It has been hands of
women braiding my hair.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.140
It has been reading the magic
of the words of Toni Morrison,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.140
Maya Angelou, and Alice
Walker, and knowing

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.480
that they are written for you.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.090
It has been parties filled
with jollof rice and fufu,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.880
and Nigerian women wearing
sequined covered gowns

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.000
and giant geles on their heads.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.520
It has been the nod to
the black stranger walking

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.110
by that says, I see you, fam.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.460
It has been pride in Malcolm,
Martin, Rosa, and Angela.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.580
It has been a room full of
the most uninhibited laughter

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.440
you've ever heard.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.180
It has been the
touch of my young son

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.830
as he lays his hand over mine
and says, we're the same brown.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.060
Race, my race, has been one
of the most defining forces

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.610
in my life, but it
is not something

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.650
I always talked about, certainly
not in the way I do now.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.570
Like many people,
most of my days

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.850
were spent just
trying to get by.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.980
Life is busy and hard.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.596
There are work and kids
and chores and friends.

00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:54.470
We spend a lot of time
bouncing from one mini

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.570
crisis to the next.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.860
Yes, my days were just as
full of microaggressions,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.310
of the pain and oppression
of racism as they are now,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.460
but I just had to keep
going on like normal.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.190
It is very hard to survive as
a woman of color in this world,

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.120
and I remember saying once
that if I stopped to feel,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.779
really feel the pain of
the racism I encountered,

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.570
I would start screaming
and I would never stop.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.550
So I did what most of us do, I
tried to make the best of it.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.220
I worked 50% harder
than my white coworkers.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.030
I stayed late every day.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.810
I dressed like every
day was a job interview.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.230
I was over polite to white
people I encountered in public.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.380
I bent over backwards to
prove that I was not angry,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.510
that I was not a threat.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.410
I laughed off racist jokes as
if I didn't feel the sting.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.800
I told myself that it would
all be worth it one day,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.610
that being a successful black
woman was revolution enough.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.430
But as I got older, as the
successes I had reached

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.250
for slowly became a
reality, something inside me

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.240
began to shift.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.600
I would try to make my voice
quieter in meetings and I

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.070
couldn't.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.790
I would try to laugh off the
racist jokes and I couldn't.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.520
I would try to accept my boss's
reasons for why I could have

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720
my promotion but not my
raise, and I couldn't.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.970
And I started talking.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.520
I started to question, I started
to resist, I started to demand.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.560
I wanted to know why it was
considered a bad thing that I

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.000
was opinionated.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.360
I wanted to know what exactly
it was about my hair that

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.490
was unprofessional.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.250
I wanted to know what exactly
it was about that joke

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.830
that people found funny.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.520
And once I started
talking, I couldn't stop.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.650
I also started writing.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.560
I shifted my food
blog into a me blog,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.080
and I started saying all the
things that everybody around me

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.840
had always said were too
negative, too abrasive, and too

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.880
confrontational.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.480
I started writing down my
frustrations and my heartbreak.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.770
I started writing about my fears
for my community and my family.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.830
I had started to see myself, and
once you start to see yourself,

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.520
you cannot pretend anymore.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.070
It did not go over well.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.440
My white friends-- having
grown up in Seattle,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.750
the majority of my
friends were white,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.730
some of whom I'd known
since high school--

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.650
were not happy with the real me.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.440
This was not the
deal they had struck.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.780
Yes, they would rage
over global warming

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.935
and yell about
Republican shenanigans,

00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:31.310
but they would not say a word
about the racial oppression

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.330
and brutality facing people
of color in this country.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.970
It's not my place, they'd
explain when in frustration I'd

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.880
beg for some comment.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.790
I don't really feel comfortable.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.470
And as I walked
around my town and I

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.140
saw that my neighbors were
not really my neighbors,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.710
as I saw that my friends no
longer considered me fun,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.170
I began to yell even louder.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.060
Somebody had to hear me.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.141
Somebody had to care.

00:06:58.141 --> 00:06:59.015
I could not be alone.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.140
Like dialysis, the old went
out and in came the new.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.260
Suddenly people I had
never met were reaching out

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.070
locally and from all across the
country, in person and online,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.560
just to let me know that
they had read my blog post

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.080
and in reading, it
they felt heard.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.140
Then, online publishers
started reaching out to me,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.930
asking if they could
republish my work.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.195
And locally, isolated and
invisible people of color

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:29.050
started reaching out, showing
me that I did have neighbors

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.980
after all.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.310
I was talking and writing at
first for my very survival,

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.250
not for anybody else's benefit.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.410
Thanks to the power and
freedom of the internet,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.910
many other people
of color have been

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.550
able to speak their
truths as well.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.950
We've been able to reach
out across cities, states,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.830
even countries to
share and reaffirm

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.620
that, yes, what we are
experiencing is true.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.900
But the internet has
a very white audience,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.720
and even though we were
writing for ourselves,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.410
the power of the hurt
anger, fear, pride, and love

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.350
of countless people of
color could not go unnoticed

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.510
by white people,
especially those

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.100
who were genuinely committed
to fighting injustice.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.880
While some had chosen
to turn away, upset

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.970
that this unpleasantness had
invaded their space of cat

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.054
videos and baby pictures,
others drew closer,

00:08:24.054 --> 00:08:25.970
realizing that they had
been missing something

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.110
very important all along.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.750
These last few years,
the rise of voices

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.780
of color coupled with the
widespread dissemination

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.659
of video proof of
brutality and injustice

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:41.559
against people of color has
brought the urgency of racism

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.950
in America to the forefront
of all of our consciousness.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.240
Race is not something people
can choose to ignore anymore.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.760
Some of us have been
speaking all along

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.270
and have not been heard, others
are trying out their voices

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.780
for the first time.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.960
These are very scary times for
a lot of people who are just

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.170
now realizing that America
is not and has never

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.800
been the melting pot utopia that
their parents and teachers told

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.590
them it was.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.570
These are very scary
times for those

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.500
who are just now realizing
how justifiably hurt, angry,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.250
and terrified so many people
of color have been all along.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.550
These are very stressful
times for people of color

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.860
who have been fighting
and yelling and trying

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.130
to protect themselves from
a world that doesn't care,

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.290
to suddenly be asked by
those who've ignored them

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.940
for so long, what has been
happening your entire life?

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.610
Can you educate me?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.640
Now that we're all in the room,
how do we start the discussion?

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.360
This is not just a gap in
experience and viewpoint.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.700
The Grand Canyon is a gap.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.290
This is a chasm you can drop
entire solar systems into.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.480
But no matter how
daunting, you are here

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.980
because you want to hear
and you want to be heard.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.530
You are here because you know
that something is very wrong

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.530
and you want to change.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.600
We can find our
way to each other.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.820
We can find our
way to our truths.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.560
I've seen it happen.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.660
My life is a testament to it.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.250
And it all starts
with conversation.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.030
So I'm going to leave it there.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.800
I didn't quite realize how
long my introduction was.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.220
So I'm here to talk about race.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.140
And I know that you're here
because at least perhaps you

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.850
might want to hear
me talk about race,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.470
even if you don't want to
talk about race yourself.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.160
I don't like talking about race.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.680
I can't stand it.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.570
I do not enjoy a minute of it.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.520
I would rather be talking
about plenty of other things.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.620
I have to talk about race.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.312
And I want to make
progress on issues of race.

00:10:58.312 --> 00:11:00.770
It's funny that I titled my
book "So You Want To Talk About

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.940
Race?" because I
don't really know

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.148
a lot of people who actually
want to talk about race.

00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:06.080
But I would guess
saying, so you have

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.030
to talk about race sounds a
little odd to put on a book.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.810
So why is it so hard?

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.500
Race is not a new topic.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.140
This is not brand new.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.340
This doesn't seem that obscure.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.520
We have people of
different races.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.650
Why can't we talk about it?

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.300
Why has this been such
a difficult subject

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.100
for hundreds of years?

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.740
There's a couple of reasons why.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.690
One of the main reasons why
is because we are deliberately

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.870
denied the tools we
need to talk about it.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.990
And I say deliberately.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.520
I really firmly believe this.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.020
We must first understand that
race is a system of power.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.480
It is a system designed
to benefit some

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.180
at the expense of others.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.070
By sheer convenience,
when you need

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.990
to pick a group of people
who can be singled out,

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.030
if they look different
from another group,

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.010
that's a pretty easy
identifier provided

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.230
you're in the group
that wins when

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.150
you're setting up this system.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.660
One of the reasons why
it has been so lasting

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.230
is because it is very
hard for black people

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.710
to no longer be black people.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.960
Now, because this is
a system of power,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.810
and it is a system
of power that does

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:34.000
a lot of harm, brutal, inhuman
harm to a lot of people,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.550
and because fundamentally
the vast majority of us

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:41.590
do not want to sign onto systems
that brutalize and murder

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.910
fellow human beings,
it is very important

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.380
that we are unable to
accurately describe

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:55.660
what is happening in this
system in order for that system

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.180
to continue.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.560
I have met a lot of very
committed racists in my life,

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.570
but I have yet to
actually come face

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.550
to face with someone
who says, I want

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.750
to solely be responsible for
the mass imprisonment, murder,

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.450
and terror of people of
color in this country.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:21.480
Even at that extreme, calling
it what it is is very difficult.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.970
Now, the reason why it is kept
is not because everybody's bad

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.720
and everyone's
trying to lie, it's

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.136
because the system needs us
to continue to do nothing.

00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:35.510
And in order to
do that, in order

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:40.080
to stifle what would be
our outrage at how unjust

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.910
our system is, we have to
not be able to describe it.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.120
It has to be the vague
nothing that cannot--

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.800
you can't make any progress.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.150
So often, people come up to
me and they say, it's too big.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.757
What can I do?

00:13:56.757 --> 00:13:57.590
I'm just one person.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.173
It's too much.

00:13:58.173 --> 00:14:03.110
You can't change a system
that's been around for so long.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.000
But think of how
long you've been

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.620
told you can't change the
system without actually

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.120
being told what the system is.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.272
It's like Voldemort,
you just can't say it.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.010
If you say it, then
it will be bad.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.830
But nobody knows what it is
that they're so afraid of.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.140
Now, the good news is the
thing that we actually

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.240
are so afraid of is an economic,
cultural, and political system.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.230
Not that scary.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.740
The thing we are afraid of
is a collection of decisions

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.690
we are making every day.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.640
Where we spend our
money, how we vote,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.760
what we expect from
our elected officials,

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.670
what we deem as professional
or unprofessional,

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.340
or valued as unvalued.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.370
This collection of
everyday decisions we make

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.080
turns into a system of race.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.780
It upholds a system of
race that in the end,

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.880
even if we don't know why it
is we're participating in it,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.460
has a hefty payout
for a very select few.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.770
And it is in their interest
that we never stop and question

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.750
what race actually
is in this country

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.477
and what racial oppression
is in this country.

00:15:17.477 --> 00:15:19.060
So if you don't have
the words for it,

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.480
think of how often in school
you were given the words for it.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.480
Even if you did that exercise
where like half your class have

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.050
blue eyes and half your
class had brown eyes,

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:32.080
were you then given the
words to actually talk

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.245
about race in your house
or with your friends?

00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:37.620
Were you actually
given the words

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.870
beyond, this makes people
feel bad, as to what

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.970
the impact that has on society?

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.900
On, let's say, the
employment outcomes

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.126
for people of color
in this country?

00:15:49.126 --> 00:15:53.640
Throughout every one of our
efforts to get forward on this,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.020
we kind of stop
at the whole, stop

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.730
doing mean things
to people of color

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.770
because it hurts their feelings.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.069
And then we wonder why
we don't get anywhere.

00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:06.860
Which brings me to one
of the other reasons

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.030
why it's so hard
to talk about race.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.320
Because we want this
to be about intentions,

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.280
we want to be good people and we
want to be seen as good people.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.060
And we all know that
racism is bad, right?

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.400
We've been told this forever.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.200
And it is.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.270
I'm not here to, like, shock
you and say, it's good.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.950
That part's true.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.760
There's just a lot more to it.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.230
Our idea of a racist
is someone who

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.440
can't stop shouting the n-word.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.970
Or yelling that Mexicans are
coming to take all your jobs.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.110
Or it's someone on
horseback, lighting

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.670
a cross in someone's lawn.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.550
These are people with
hate in their hearts

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.632
who want to do harm.

00:16:54.632 --> 00:16:56.340
Now this stops us from
being able to talk

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.100
about race because when someone
says, you did this thing

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.610
and it was racist
and it hurt me,

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.619
you don't want to
be in that group.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:09.780
You, yourself, have never
said the n-word in your life.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.060
You are a good person.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.015
You don't want to
be a bad person.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.700
But that's not the
way race works.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.890
The personal outcomes for
people of color in our society

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.890
is not built upon how many
racial slurs have been hurled

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.400
at them in their lifetime.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.720
It is not black
households in this country

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.440
have 13 times less net
worth than white households

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.760
because they were called
the n-word this many times,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.620
and every time, their
bank account dropped.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.480
That's not how race works.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.610
Furthermore, there
are plenty of people

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.450
who would shout racial
slurs at me all day,

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.610
and outside of that moment of
terror, which it does have,

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.780
they have no other
impact on my life.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.740
There are plenty of people who
dedicate their lives to racism

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.840
who aren't registered
to vote, who

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.500
don't hold any positions of
social power, who kind of stick

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.290
around with other white people
who hate people of color

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.240
and never leave that
weird little hovel.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.330
They are impacting
me nearly as much

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.250
as someone who has a Black Lives
Matter poster in their window,

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.240
but then votes for tighter
policing because she's

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.122
a little scared about
the way the demographics

00:18:34.122 --> 00:18:35.455
of her neighborhood is changing.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:44.050
When it comes to my safety
and my ability to live,

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.220
she is making a much bigger
negative impact on my life

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.600
and the life of my family
and the life of my friends.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.620
And that's where
we have to realize

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.230
that in a system that only
requires that you do nothing

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.050
in order to continue
to perpetrate itself,

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.190
your intentions
don't mean squat.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.990
So if you did not
mean to harm someone,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.770
it does not mean that
the harm wasn't done.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.070
And it does not mean
that you then hate them

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.260
and you must be discarded.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.290
But it also doesn't mean
that they must immediately

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.770
forgive you and act
like it never happened.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.390
But it's very hard
to talk about race

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.300
when we can't update
our ideas of what

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.330
racial oppression
actually looks like,

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.120
and what racism looks like
when it hits people of color.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.410
It's also really
tough to talk about

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.586
because we never
actually say what

00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:53.710
we're trying to talk about.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.930
What we're doing when
we're talking about race,

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:05.930
usually, is we have people
who are trying to come

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.430
to their own personal goals.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.150
And usually people of color
coming to talk about race

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.290
are trying to get other
people to understand

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.260
what is harming them.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.000
And very often, white
people come to--

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.094
come to talks about
race to try to make sure

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:20.510
that the person
they're talking to

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:25.600
knows that they are not the
person who is harming them.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.100
Those are two completely
different conversations

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.470
that will never meet.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.170
Because you have one person
whose lived experience says,

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.040
you are harming me and I
need you to understand.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.881
And you have another person
whose lived experience says,

00:20:40.881 --> 00:20:42.880
I am not part of the
problem, I am a good person

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.650
and I need you to understand.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.030
Because we don't
state what it is

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.640
that we're trying to talk
about when we talk about race,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.260
you can dissolve an entire
friendship in a discussion.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.500
And if you were to ask why of
each person in that discussion,

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.763
the reasons would be
completely different.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.930
So we know it is tough.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.107
We know there's a lot at risk.

00:21:11.107 --> 00:21:12.940
And if you are a white
person in this room--

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.550
and most of you are--

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.992
and you're thinking, what
if I get called racist?

00:21:17.992 --> 00:21:19.700
Oh, the last time I
tried a couple times,

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.533
it ended really bad.

00:21:20.533 --> 00:21:23.180
Trust me, no
conversation on race

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.010
has ever ended
nearly as bad for you

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.190
as it ends for people of color.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.180
So before we launch into why
we have to do it anyways,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.430
I want to first say
if a person of color

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.415
is willing to talk
to you about race,

00:21:38.415 --> 00:21:40.540
even if they don't seem
very friendly while they're

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.104
doing it, it's a generosity.

00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:45.520
I asked a lot of
my friends when I

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.740
was working on my book,
what are your greatest

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.140
fears about talking about race?

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.010
And a lot of white
people were like, oh, you

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.830
know I'm just afraid of
being seen as a racist.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.400
I'm really afraid,
you know, that I'll

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.130
get dragged on Black Twitter.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.820
And then my friends
of color were

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.540
like, I'm afraid I'm going
to get fired from my job.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.240
I'm afraid I will be
physically attacked.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.280
I'm afraid I will be harassed.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.980
And there are plenty of people
who said, I have been harassed.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.910
I currently have a restraining
order out on someone

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:21.440
who I said was racist, and then
tried to ruin my entire life.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.650
I have people of color who have
actual threats to their life

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.774
and liberty and their ability
to feed their families.

00:22:27.774 --> 00:22:29.190
And then you have
white people who

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.570
are afraid that they
will be called racist.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:36.450
So note when people of color
come to these discussions,

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.970
first off, they're already
bringing their pain,

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.670
pain that you do not know.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.220
They're bringing a damage
that has already been done.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.720
And they're bringing it to you
knowing that there's probably

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.630
a 90% chance this conversation
isn't going to go well,

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.010
that they're going to lose out.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.845
They're going to be
seen as angry, at best.

00:22:57.845 --> 00:23:03.640
They'll be dismissed
as overly race focused,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:09.460
and that they will lose esteem
for you, which hurts them.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.040
They may lose a
friend in the process

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.380
of just trying desperately to
get you to see their humanity.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:22.400
So think about
how generous it is

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.880
to have a lifetime of
experience that says,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:31.620
this is not going to end well
for you, and you do it anyway.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.930
And then wonder,
should you really

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.710
be that afraid to join
them, to meet them halfway?

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.810
Should you really be afraid
to talk to your uncle

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.930
at the dinner table when he
says something a bit off?

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.860
It's something we
have to talk about.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.830
So why is it something
we have to talk about?

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.874
First of all, we're
always talking about it.

00:23:53.874 --> 00:23:55.290
And I think that
this is something

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.600
that people always forget.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.750
We live in a society
with a white default.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.910
Everything is whiteness.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.930
Our holidays, our calendar.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.780
What we view as professional.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.910
Our films, our books.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.120
The art that we call
fine art versus the art

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.880
that we call ethnic art.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.450
We live in a world
defined by whiteness.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.660
I understand a lot
about white people.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.440
I grew up here in Seattle and
I was raised by a white mother.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.250
But I will never know what it's
like to be able to walk around

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.920
in a world built for
me and never have

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.470
to say it was built for me.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:50.116
To never have to recognize
white culture as white culture.

00:24:50.116 --> 00:24:52.490
I always have to recognize
black culture as black culture

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.781
because even if I'm going
about my day in my blackness,

00:24:54.781 --> 00:24:57.890
someone's going to make it
apparent I am doing something

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.922
that is outside of the norm.

00:24:59.922 --> 00:25:03.960
Walking around with my hair,
people make it very apparent.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.110
Whether it's weird comments
about how glad they

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:12.350
are I've embraced who I am,
or the comments about how

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:17.710
it's a little, oh, that's
wild, that's funky, I like it.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.350
It's not wild or funky, it's the
hair that grows out of my head.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.900
I don't walk up to everyone
who gets out of the shower,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.430
comes to work and
go, wild, funky.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.680
It's kind of stringy.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.735
I like it.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.700
We live in a culture
defined by whiteness.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:45.410
Which means that any time
you're not talking about race,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.720
you're talking about whiteness.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.230
What you're basically saying
is everything is white

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.040
until I deem it otherwise.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.270
And you're saying, here, people
of color, you navigate that.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.690
You navigate this
culture 24 hours

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.310
a day until I am
comfortable enough

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.080
to ask if maybe it
doesn't always suit you.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.310
If maybe I need to be
the one to step around

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.410
and try a different path.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.010
We like to act as if it's people
of color always bringing up

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:29.970
race, but if I go for a
job interview and the way

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.710
that my hair grows
out of my head is not

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:38.250
deemed professional, I am
not making it about race.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.310
I'm the one who,
because those doing

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.150
the interview didn't stop to
think about their definition

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.580
and whether or not it included
everyone who might show up

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.260
for job, who has to figure
out what professional means

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.830
to white people, and
then has to go and modify

00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:00.780
the hair that goes out of my
head in a way to fit that.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.000
I don't want to
make it about race.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.880
I would like to just
show up in the hair that

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.160
grows out of my head.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.320
I didn't make it about race.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.200
And me saying, hey, I
should be able to show up

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.220
with the hair that
comes out of my head,

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:20.620
is my attempt to no
longer make it about race.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.170
To no longer make
it about whiteness.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.892
So often these issues that
you find yourself saying,

00:27:27.892 --> 00:27:29.600
why does it always
have to be about race?

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.058
It's because it
was about race when

00:27:31.058 --> 00:27:35.070
you decided that the only people
who needed to be considered

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.140
were white.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.744
That's what made it about race.

00:27:39.744 --> 00:27:41.160
And oftentimes
people of color are

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.190
trying to get it back to
a place where it's not.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:52.110
We have to talk about
it because right now we

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.610
are all harming other
people, because we

00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:02.070
have spent a lifetime absorbing
incredibly harmful messaging

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:06.950
about people of different
races, about people of color.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.930
That means I have spent
a lifetime absorbing

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.470
harmful messaging
about Asian-Americans,

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.620
about indigenous people,
about Latinx-Americans,

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:21.820
and about Black Americans,
it means everyone here has.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.940
And when you say something
and it hits a person of color,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.980
and they know deep inside
that that's not right,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.690
but they're not
comfortable telling you,

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.500
you are missing the opportunity
to become a better person

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.680
and to stop hurting people.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:45.080
If you don't want to talk about
it, what you're saying is,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.740
you just continue to carry
that hurt, and the next person

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.520
after you should continue
to carry that hurt,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.670
because the thought of
carrying my piece of it

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.880
and doing the work necessary to
stop is just a little too much.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:04.850
I would rather continue
the blissful ignorance

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:10.240
of doing harm and having
other people pick up the mess.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.850
I don't think that's the type
of person you want to be.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.430
I myself personally in my work
have to constantly challenge

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.290
that because even
as a black woman,

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:23.220
there is a lot of messaging
I have absorbed about people

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.490
of color that in my
work requires me to face

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.640
and recognize where I
may have harmed people,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.900
and try to make amends.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.360
Because as much as it stings
to know I've hurt someone,

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.500
I would rather know so I
can do better than continue

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.592
to think I'm the greatest
thing since sliced bread

00:29:43.592 --> 00:29:45.175
while I'm hurting
everyone in my path.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.500
We have to talk about race
because it's the only way

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.000
to identify solutions.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.810
What we're talking about here
is not just big group therapy

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.640
where we're crying and
hugging our way out of this.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.610
I honestly don't
believe that will work,

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:08.430
and I really don't
want people to hug me.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.120
I'm talking about
identifying where

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.490
we are missing opportunities
to be a part of the solution.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:19.130
And that actually means
you have to talk to people

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:22.350
and find out where
the problem is.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.542
And we miss a lot
of opportunities.

00:30:25.542 --> 00:30:27.250
You know, think of
the last time a friend

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.500
of yours made a joke
that just wasn't cool,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.920
and you decided to let it go.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.652
Now if you are a
white person and you

00:30:36.652 --> 00:30:38.110
hear a joke that's
not cool and you

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.100
decide to let it go because
you want to ruin the evening,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.250
think about who never
gets the opportunity

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.210
to make that choice.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.680
I don't get the opportunity.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.180
My evening's ruined.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.980
I don't even--
there's no saving it.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.290
My evening's ruined, my
relationship with that person

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.870
is forever altered.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.650
I don't get a chance
to say, I'm going

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.840
to not be black for the evening,
and not have that hurt me.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.090
I don't get to say, I'm going
to wait until next month

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.240
and then maybe I'll
bring it up if they

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.460
make a joke at the expense
of my humanity again.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.696
Then I'll bring it up.

00:31:13.696 --> 00:31:14.820
No matter what, I'm harmed.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.280
We have to talk about it
because what we are doing

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.570
not only causes hurt feelings,
not only causes trauma,

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:31.250
but it has actual
measurable impacts

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.560
in the well-being for people
of color in this country.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.660
So if you don't understand what
the school to prison pipeline

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.230
looks like, and you
haven't heard from mothers

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.830
of black children whose
kindergartners have been

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:53.670
dragged out of their classrooms
by school police officers,

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.432
then you will not make
an informed voting choice

00:31:57.432 --> 00:31:59.140
when it comes to your
local school board.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.410
Chances are you probably
won't even vote for it.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.510
Especially if it's
in an off year.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.780
And you're going to leave
that 10% of the population

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:13.800
most at risk to fight
that battle on their own.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.880
And then you'll wonder,
as your kid gets older,

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.200
why these black kids can't
just get it together.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.470
Why are they always
getting suspended?

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.670
Why are they always
getting expelled?

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.390
And you'll think
it's their problem,

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.930
when you had an opportunity
four years earlier

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.762
to put in school board
members who could say,

00:32:33.762 --> 00:32:35.970
we're going to take a look
at the way in which we are

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.490
disciplining children of
color to see if it's fair,

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.740
to see if it's in the best
interest of these children.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.710
If you don't talk
to people of color

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.740
about how hard it is for
them to access resources

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.430
in their neighborhood, how
you vote for taxes and levies

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.610
in your city and state
that could give money

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.570
to neighborhoods that don't
even have working sidewalks--

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.840
and we do have stretches
here in the Seattle area that

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.280
don't have working sidewalks.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.710
Kids are walking to
school on busy highways--

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.060
then you're not going
to vote accordingly.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.077
Because your street's fine.

00:33:17.077 --> 00:33:18.660
But you didn't want
to talk about race

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.420
and why money is kept
from these neighborhoods.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.190
Why so much of it's
about how wealthy

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:27.560
the tax bracket is
for that neighborhood.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.980
And then you wonder why
people aren't rising up,

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.310
when they can't even
get to school safely.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:36.265
When they can't have updated
books in their classrooms.

00:33:36.265 --> 00:33:38.390
When the nearest grocery
store that would give them

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.514
the nutrition they need to
be able to pay attention

00:33:40.514 --> 00:33:43.340
for the day is a mile and
a half away and there's

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.490
good bus routes.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:50.090
But we're going to keep voting
to lower our tabs, right?

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:51.530
Without looking
at the impact that

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.290
has on the people
who need reliable

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.274
low-cost transportation
more than anyone else.

00:33:57.274 --> 00:33:58.690
These are
conversations, these are

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:04.170
solutions you come to
when you talk about race.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:09.670
But there are also
solutions you are rejecting

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:12.739
when you don't talk about race.

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:17.020
It is not just something from
the heaven comes down and says,

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:21.460
would you like a bonus
solution for race today?

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:25.409
And you accept it and
you're glad for this extra.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:29.040
These are responsibilities
that you're abdicating,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.340
but no one else will pick up.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:40.389
These are opportunities that you
are morally obligated to take,

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:43.500
that you are denying because
you don't want to have

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.889
an uncomfortable conversation.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.620
Now it's not as easy-- and
please, for the love of God,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.900
do not rush out of here,
find the nearest black person

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.699
in the office, and be like,
hey, let's have a conversation

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:54.730
about race.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.059
Please.

00:34:56.059 --> 00:34:58.350
There's a reason why there's
a lot chapters in my book.

00:35:00.792 --> 00:35:02.250
Because we have to
do this in a way

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.500
that is not putting
even more of a burden

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.431
on marginalized people.

00:35:07.431 --> 00:35:08.680
But it definitely can be done.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.060
And first I would
say start Googling.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.340
Google, oh my gosh, you guys.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:14.940
Right?

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.820
Start Googling.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.304
There is not a question you
have that hasn't been asked.

00:35:19.304 --> 00:35:20.720
There's not a
sticky situation you

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.290
are in that someone
else hasn't been in.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:29.040
Before you stop and say, I'm
going to go and talk to Letisha

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.730
and she's going to be my new
dictionary of race relations,

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.440
Google it.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.510
Figure out what
you're talking about.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.190
Read my book.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.960
Get some pointers.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.579
And then start looking
in everyday opportunities

00:35:42.579 --> 00:35:44.370
to have conversations,
not just with people

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.610
of a different race from you,
but people in your own race.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.842
Especially if you're
white in this audience,

00:35:49.842 --> 00:35:52.050
please start talking to
other white people about this

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.030
because there's only
like five black people

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.710
in this entire city.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.630
We can't have all
these conversations.

00:35:59.976 --> 00:36:01.350
And make sure that
you're talking

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.780
to people of multiple races.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.204
I speak as a black woman,
I write as a black woman.

00:36:06.204 --> 00:36:08.370
My experience in this world,
though, is not the same

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:14.100
as it is for a Latinx woman
or an Asian-American man.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.650
And you can't say, I
talked to a black person,

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.440
they're cool with it.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.265
We're fine.

00:36:21.265 --> 00:36:23.897
But come to it knowing
that as hard as it is,

00:36:23.897 --> 00:36:25.730
it's always going to
give you an opportunity

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.020
to be a better
person and to make

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.870
a difference in this world.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.010
And that should excite you,
because for the first time,

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:39.480
you may actually see an
ability to make progress

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.350
where you've been told forever
that you couldn't, that there

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.410
were just some people that
were always going to hate,

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.810
and some people like you
that were going to love.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.280
And maybe one day,
love would win.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.065
And then you wonder why
things aren't getting better.

00:36:52.065 --> 00:36:53.690
You will have actual,
measurable things

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.220
you can do to make it better.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.380
But it starts with conversation.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.840
So that's kind of my talk.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:10.670
And now-- he is walking
around so I think--

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.620
I hope there will be questions.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.800
AUDIENCE: So when
I decided I wanted

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.420
to come to a talk
that was called

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.670
So You Want to
Talk About Race, I

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:25.220
was kind of sold already on that
that seems like a good idea.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.930
One of my main takeaways
was that if I end up

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:34.010
talking about race with
somebody who is not white,

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.710
that they will have a bad time.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.889
How do you reconcile those?

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:40.430
IJEOMA OLUO: I mean,
that's the thing

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:43.942
is I've never left a
conversation about race,

00:37:43.942 --> 00:37:46.400
especially with someone of a
different race, and been like,

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.885
man, that was fun.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.500
I want you to come
to that knowing

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.910
that the reason why
people engage with it

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.400
is because that's
how urgent it is.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.140
So there are things
you want to do,

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.860
and there are things
you need to do.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.670
Now that means that
there are going

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.550
to be times where, even
as painful as it is,

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.349
I am dying to talk about race.

00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:12.140
Because I know that's
the only thing that's

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.617
going to make the
situation better,

00:38:13.617 --> 00:38:15.200
or the only thing
that's going to make

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.960
it seem like I'm not completely
invisible to the people

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.220
around me.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.570
It's like you're walking
around in your world is on fire

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:26.290
and people are
literally going, God I'm

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:30.140
so cold and putting on parkas.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.549
And you're dying.

00:38:31.549 --> 00:38:32.840
And you're like, what are you--

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.110
what are you doing?

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.400
Now you don't want to talk
about what that feels like.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.774
You don't want to
be like, let me

00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:40.880
explain to you for an hour
what it's like to be this hot.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.220
But sometimes you
know, if I don't

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.210
get someone to ask, why
are you so hot right now,

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.997
I'm going to actually die.

00:38:48.997 --> 00:38:51.080
And that's often times
what talking about race is.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.538
Now, it doesn't mean that it
won't be rewarding in the end,

00:38:53.538 --> 00:38:54.650
even if it's not pleasant.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.233
Because I do think when you do
go well-- and the more of these

00:38:57.233 --> 00:38:59.750
that do, it will shift.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.670
Part of the reason
why it's not pleasant

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:04.544
is because most of the
time it goes really bad.

00:39:04.544 --> 00:39:06.710
And so we are already
entering in talking about pain

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.540
we're going through
knowing that chances

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:12.680
are all of that investment
isn't going to pay off.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.150
So part of it is
committing to be

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.700
someone who it might pay off.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.829
Be like, hey, you know what?

00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:20.870
I'm going to try my best
to be a little different

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.517
and listen, and
hear, and be here.

00:39:23.517 --> 00:39:24.350
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:29.670
So how do I present
as someone who

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.970
is less likely to
cause somebody I'm

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:37.200
having a conversation with to
have a bad time without giving

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.460
everyone a minority tax.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.562
Being like, hey,
you're a black person.

00:39:41.562 --> 00:39:42.630
Hmm?

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.380
IJEOMA OLUO: Yeah.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.230
You know, I would definitely say
first off always try and gauge

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.100
people's comfort level
in a conversation.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:48.600
Right?

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.270
So people, of course, especially
because of the work I do,

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:52.770
want to talk to me
about race a lot.

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:53.700
In fact, sometimes
people kind of

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.158
save the conversations
they're been

00:39:55.158 --> 00:39:57.900
afraid to have with
anyone else for me.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.780
But when people gauge my comfort
level, say, hey, you know,

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.964
I had a question about
something with race,

00:40:03.964 --> 00:40:05.880
or I was wondering if
maybe this was something

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.650
you wanted to talk about?

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:08.760
Are you comfortable?

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.380
Is this a good time?

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.040
If not, I fully understand.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:13.800
Start that way.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.790
Because a lot of
times what happens

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.860
is people get really
eager and they think,

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.270
I'm going to make a person
of color's day today.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.070
I'm going to go up to him and
start asking him about race.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.240
And that's just not
the way to go about it,

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.770
but it happens more
than you would assume.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:30.942
And instead saying,
are you comfortable?

00:40:30.942 --> 00:40:31.650
Do you feel safe?

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.680
Do you want to have
this conversation?

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.640
Oftentimes even that
alone, like knowing

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.070
that someone took the
time to even wonder

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.750
if I want to have
that conversation,

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.390
is a good sign to me
it's going to go better.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:44.422
Because it's already
starting with listening.

00:40:44.422 --> 00:40:46.380
It's already starting
with consideration for me

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.430
as a human.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.440
So I'd definitely start there.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.420
And then always
take time to pause

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.050
and make sure we're listening
more than you're talking.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.916
And that you're stating
your intentions,

00:40:56.916 --> 00:40:59.040
and that you're checking
in and looking for signals

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.040
that someone is
still comfortable.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.577
If they're not,
say, I'm sorry, I

00:41:04.577 --> 00:41:06.160
didn't mean to make
you uncomfortable.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.122
We can totally pause, or be out
of this conversation entirely.

00:41:09.122 --> 00:41:10.830
But a lot of times
what ends up happening

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.690
is you'll start a
conversation, and it

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:15.420
will veer into areas that are
no longer safe and comfortable

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:16.860
for people of color.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.390
And then it becomes,
well, I thought

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:19.431
you wanted to end racism.

00:41:19.431 --> 00:41:22.080
Why aren't you still
talking to me about it?

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.810
But the truth is this will
be the 20th conversation I'm

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.520
going to have today.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:33.244
I need to be able to reserve
what I have left and move on.

00:41:33.244 --> 00:41:34.660
So I would say
definitely starting

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.368
with finding their
comfort level, if they

00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:38.290
want to talk about it
or not, and stating

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.770
why it is you want to talk
about it are going to get you

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:46.000
probably at least half way there
to having a conversation that's

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.460
going to be one of the ones
that actually surprises people

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.100
of color by going pretty well.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.420
AUDIENCE: So you're a
parent, I'm a parent.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.290
And I unfortunately
grew up in a household

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.750
where when race was brought
up, it always negative.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:00.930
And I knew when I
had my children,

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.489
and even just
growing up that that

00:42:02.489 --> 00:42:05.020
wasn't the type of
household I wanted to have.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.120
I want to know what I can
be doing to be a better

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.010
parent to be
teaching my kids how

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:13.440
to have these conversations, how
to be better people as far as

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.740
how they're treating their
friends and the people

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.620
that they encounter
every day properly.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.640
IJEOMA OLUO: It's
a great question.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.940
I'm assuming you
have white kids?

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.523
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:21.523 --> 00:42:22.450
IJEOMA OLUO: OK.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.439
What I would definitely
say, and I refer to this

00:42:25.439 --> 00:42:27.730
quite often because I think
it's a really good example.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.364
I was actually talking with
an associate awhile back.

00:42:30.364 --> 00:42:31.780
He was asking me
about what it was

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.000
like-- this was a white man.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.708
He was asking me what
it was like to have

00:42:34.708 --> 00:42:38.760
to explain to my kids
about avoiding cops,

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.260
and what police
brutality is, and why

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.320
store clerks might follow
them around, things like this.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.360
And he said, I'm so glad
I don't have to have

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.420
that conversation with my kids.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:53.920
And I paused and I was
like, why wouldn't you

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.870
have to have that
conversation with your kids?

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:57.490
He was like, well,
you know what I mean.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:58.865
I'm like, no, no,
I really don't.

00:42:58.865 --> 00:43:01.314
Because you're grateful that
your kids have been spared

00:43:01.314 --> 00:43:02.980
this painful conversation,
but your kids

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.820
are in community with my kids.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.990
Why would your kids be
spared this conversation?

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.460
Why would they be spared
the knowledge of what

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.820
their friends are dealing with?

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.670
Why would they be
spared the opportunity

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.710
to lift that burden?

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:18.250
At least some of it.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.000
By showing at least
they understand.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.040
It's really important
to realize your kids are

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.623
going to be absorbing
what's happening

00:43:24.623 --> 00:43:27.200
in the world, no matter what.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.810
And you have to provide context.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.170
And you have to provide
empowerment and places

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:33.130
of action.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:36.960
So I personally-- I have, of
course, two kids of color.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.430
And so I talk with
them oftentimes

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.990
to see outside
their own experience

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.104
to other kids of color, maybe
kids of different races.

00:43:44.104 --> 00:43:45.520
What I like to do,
especially when

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.750
we're listening to
the news and you

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.333
hear all these awful
things happening,

00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:50.020
and kids really feel powerless.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.510
They feel like grownups are
kind of screwing everything up

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.550
for them, and they are.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.930
And there's nothing
they can do about it.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:01.510
So I always like to talk
with my kids about solutions

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.700
that they can help be a part of.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.840
They have no power as to who
is President in this country,

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.210
but they have a lot of power as
to what their friends at school

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.800
are saying to other
kids at school.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.300
Right?

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.550
They have the power to raise
their hand to the teacher

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.650
and say, hey, I don't
think that's right.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.150
So we like to
listen to the news.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.841
And especially my-- well, both.

00:44:21.841 --> 00:44:24.340
My teenager kind of like thinks
he's got it all figured out,

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.419
right?

00:44:25.419 --> 00:44:25.960
I don't know.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.890
He's absorbing
probably half of it.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.890
I talk nonstop and he's
like, yeah, mom, I know.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:30.720
I know, mom.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.580
I have the internet.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.570
My 10-year-old,
on the other hand,

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.600
is incredibly
passionately concerned

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.747
about what's happening.

00:44:38.747 --> 00:44:40.330
He's very concerned
about immigration.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:41.840
Very, very concerned
about immigration.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.214
He has friends who come home
whose parents have told them

00:44:44.214 --> 00:44:46.740
they might have to
go away one day.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.581
He's very, very concerned
about transgender rights.

00:44:49.581 --> 00:44:51.830
And so these are things where
instead of saying, yeah,

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.290
man, it sucks.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.300
The world is horrible.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.380
Because you grow up being an
adult that just says that.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.080
Instead I think, OK,
well you know what?

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.520
Chances are right now you
have kids in your class

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.760
who are worried about where
their parents are going to be.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.990
So are you talking with your
friends about this issue

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:14.451
and letting them know
that you support them?

00:45:14.451 --> 00:45:15.950
Are you listening
for kids who might

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:17.908
be saying hateful things
that their parents are

00:45:17.908 --> 00:45:20.930
saying and challenging that?

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:24.860
You have kids in your class
who may one day come out

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.420
as transgender.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.940
So are you making sure that
no one is saying anything

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.800
that would harm them right now?

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.290
Are you talking to your
teachers about the bathrooms?

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:34.970
Maybe there's something that
can be done about your school

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:35.750
bathrooms, right?

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.208
Giving them the
opportunity to know

00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:41.390
there's always a way to be
reaching out and finding

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.550
solutions, even in
their own little corner.

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:45.080
And that not only
is going to keep

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:50.027
them being solution-oriented and
reaching out and looking out,

00:45:50.027 --> 00:45:52.110
but it's also going to
keep them feeling empowered

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.690
so they don't enter
adulthood jaded

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:57.620
and feeling like there's
nothing they can do about it.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.400
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.770
I actually have the privilege
of having the last question.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.436
Just FYI.

00:46:04.436 --> 00:46:06.810
First of all, thank you so
much for putting on this talk.

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:10.350
You're a wonderful writer
and speaker as well.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.730
So thank you very much.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:18.370
I wanted to ask if you have
any advice for someone who

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:23.830
is a person of color, black
specifically, who is navigating

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.680
a white workplace.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.860
I have worked at Google for
about a year and a half,

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:34.210
and I didn't know that I was
going to be like the only

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:36.880
black female engineer here.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.710
And that's cool, but
sometimes I wish I wasn't.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.890
Do you have any advice
for feeling kind of alone

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:49.965
and feeling like you want to be
with people who look like you?

00:46:49.965 --> 00:46:51.590
IJEOMA OLUO: I
understand that feeling.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:53.589
Before I was a writer, I
actually worked in tech

00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:56.690
for a decade and I was
always the only black person,

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.990
except for once, I had
a black supervisor.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:03.230
I know that feeling and it's
a very lonely place to be.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.120
And unfortunately
because of the way

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.890
the world is, the more you rise
up, the more lonely you end up.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.780
And first off, that's a
completely normal way to feel.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.780
It definitely is.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:15.620
I would say twofold.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.209
One, personally, you
have to find community,

00:47:18.209 --> 00:47:19.250
even if it's not in work.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.625
And you know it's
hard because we

00:47:20.625 --> 00:47:23.300
spend so much time at work, and
especially in fields like this.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.550
But you got to find community,
you got to find people.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:29.540
There are groups of black people
in the greater Seattle area,

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.700
especially tech focused
black people, that kind of

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.870
seek each other out.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:34.580
So definitely hit
me up after this

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.370
if you have any
questions on that.

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:38.370
So definitely do that.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:43.840
But then also I
would say always know

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.300
it's going to be harder to
change the rules of how people

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.549
engage with you later than
it is to set it upfront.

00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:52.090
And that's something I started
learning about halfway through

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.209
my tech career when I was
in tech was there are a lot

00:47:55.209 --> 00:47:57.250
of compromises we find
ourselves having to make--

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.830
things we don't talk about,
things we don't address--

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.120
in order to get where we are.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.740
What I realized was
the further I got,

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.900
the harder it was to
go back and correct.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:10.450
And so I had to always
weigh in smart ways,

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.252
to not get my ass fired,
how to challenge things

00:48:14.252 --> 00:48:15.710
so that people knew
from the moment

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:18.782
they started doing
business with me

00:48:18.782 --> 00:48:20.990
that I was going to be
challenging these assumptions.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.198
So I started with a lot of
innocent questions, right?

00:48:23.198 --> 00:48:25.385
My favorite thing to do
would be, what do you mean?

00:48:25.385 --> 00:48:26.660
What does that mean?

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.340
I don't-- I'm sorry, I
just don't understand.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.290
And I'm not trying to be
like, no, what do you mean?

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.270
I'm like, no, I don't get it.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.390
What does that joke mean?

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.360
What's funny about that thing?

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.200
You know?

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.650
I always like to point out those
little things just to be like--

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:44.125
not like, we're going to
have a discussion about this

00:48:44.125 --> 00:48:44.632
but like--

00:48:44.632 --> 00:48:46.840
I remember one time there
was this thing at work that

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.220
used to drive me bonkers.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.720
It actually still
happens to me even

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.000
as a writer online where
I would say I'm hungry

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.630
and someone would say--

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.740
someone would try
and give me cheese.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.490
All the time, people
will be like, cheese.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:59.250
I don't know what it is
about Seattle white people

00:48:59.250 --> 00:48:59.750
and cheese.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:02.646
I don't know if this is
like a Swedish thing.

00:49:02.646 --> 00:49:03.766
I don't know.

00:49:03.766 --> 00:49:05.640
People are like, man,
go get you some cheese.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.134
And I'm like, I
hope you understand

00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:10.300
the majority of black people
are lactose intolerant.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.940
I'm like, are you trying to not
only ruin my day, but your day

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.970
because you have
to sit next to me.

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:18.760
And it wasn't like, how
dare you not know this?

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.416
Just like, hey, were you aware?

00:49:22.416 --> 00:49:24.630
And every time people are
like what do you mean?

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.710
Where I'd say,
yeah, cheese isn't

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:28.400
going to work for me
because I'm black.

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.650
Sometimes I would leave it
at that because then people

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:34.380
will be like, what do you mean?

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.130
And think a little bit
is there something,

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:37.530
like-- yeah, no, it's magic.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:38.030
Cheese.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:39.700
It's my mortal enemy.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.010
Like no, actually, the
majority of people of

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.750
color-- not just black people.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.750
Asian people,
indigenous people--

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.072
we don't do cheese too well.

00:49:48.072 --> 00:49:49.780
I'm like getting people
starting to think

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.988
and I would start to challenge
a lot of those things.

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:56.165
We would have get-togethers
after work and be like, hey,

00:49:56.165 --> 00:49:58.666
did you know that's
not necessarily

00:49:58.666 --> 00:50:00.790
that cool dive or you think
it would be fun to slum

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:03.400
in with the Confederate
flag in a corner?

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.300
Not necessarily a place
where I'm going to be safe.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.940
And I would just constantly,
in like a very even keel,

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.800
say these things.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.440
And I learned that
when people started

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.710
to figure out that I
was never actually going

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.660
to let those things
go but it wasn't going

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.090
to turn into a fight,
sometimes it was just like,

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.060
well, it's less annoying if
I actually start thinking

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.744
about these things ahead
of time and start really

00:50:31.744 --> 00:50:32.410
addressing them.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:35.730
But I would definitely
say find community.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:38.600
Learn what compromises
you are and are not

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.010
willing to make early.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:43.190
And think, if I make
it all the way to VP,

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:46.250
do I still want to be
ignoring these jokes?

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.194
Do I still want to be having
these horrible conversations?

00:50:49.194 --> 00:50:51.110
Do I still want to be
acting like my needs are

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:51.980
being met when they're not?

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.938
Because believe it or
not, it's actually harder

00:50:53.938 --> 00:50:55.610
when you get to
that level, to have

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.380
those conversations than now.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:58.320
I hope that helps.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.986
I mean, unfortunately
you shouldn't have

00:50:59.986 --> 00:51:01.760
to be asking these questions.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.936
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:51:02.936 --> 00:51:04.310
IJEOMA OLUO: And
hopefully people

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:06.020
listening in this
room will help make it

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.970
so that that won't be the case.

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:09.230
Right?

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.990
AUDIENCE: I mostly ask this
question for their benefit, not

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:15.390
mine, to be honest.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:18.470
IJEOMA OLUO: I like
the way you think.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:21.830
AUDIENCE: So thank you very much
for coming to talk to us today.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.680
[APPLAUSE]
