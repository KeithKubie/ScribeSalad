00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:11.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's the end of the
regular school day for Justin Marks.

00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:13.926
&gt;&gt;Did you turn in that assignment?

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:14.056
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:14.396
&gt;&gt;Me too.

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:15.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And it's
only twelve o'clock.

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:20.196
A senior at San Francisco's School
of the Arts, Marks has one hour

00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:23.966
to grab lunch and drive from his high
school campus to a downtown office,

00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:27.446
where he'll spend the rest of his
learning day as an intern at one

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:29.496
of the city's top architectural
firms.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.716
&gt;&gt;We did a walkthrough at the
base of clock tower to find out--

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:34.846
&gt;&gt;Justin: I'm pretty much
an assistant architect,

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.666
like I get to see everything
an architect has to do,

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:42.316
has to go through, has to
deal with, and it's school.

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:44.986
I go there and I just learn tons.

00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:46.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Marks works
here twice a week

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.316
and spends his other
three weekday afternoons

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:52.756
at the Build San Francisco
Institute, a small school created

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:56.596
by the Architectural Foundation
of San Francisco, in partnership

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.536
with the city's unified
school district.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.966
&gt;&gt;Frank: What we've targeted are
students who have not done well

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.976
in school and we want them to finish
and we want to give them a reason

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:10.296
for finishing, and hopefully
along the way, for them to see

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:11.836
that there's career opportunities

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:14.096
for them beyond getting
their high school diploma.

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:18.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students from high
schools all over the city arrive

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:19.846
at this Market Street office space

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:22.766
and spend the next three
hours immersed in projects

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.006
that satisfy core curriculum
objectives

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:28.436
in integrated studies,
fine arts and math.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:29.056
&gt;&gt;Nine.

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:31.406
&gt;&gt;Diameter, nine in diameter.

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And there's a night and
day difference between what goes

00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:37.176
on here and what usually goes on
at the schools they come from.

00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:40.936
&gt;&gt;Will: In a traditional math
class, they begin with a textbook.

00:01:41.386 --> 00:01:43.446
They have the students open
to the page for the day.

00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:47.076
They might be working on something
like perimeter or area or volume.

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:49.816
If I were the teacher, I would
stand in front of the class,

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:53.856
teach all thirty students
this one concept at one time.

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:57.396
I'd write things on the board,
work out a few sample problems

00:01:57.396 --> 00:02:00.046
and then send the students home,
and they would either get it

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:01.866
or not, and then they'd move on.

00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:04.556
Here, we do design challenges

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:09.016
where students actually apply the
mathematics in a real world problem.

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:13.766
This particular problem was to design
a million dollar condominium using

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.196
San Francisco housing costs,

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:17.096
which are eight hundred
dollars a square foot.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:20.276
From there, it becomes a
very challenging process

00:02:20.276 --> 00:02:22.626
to develop a three
bedroom condominium.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:28.166
Working with the mathematics all the
way, scale, proportion, area, volume,

00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:32.846
applying the knowledge rather than
just working it through once on a set

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:35.416
of problems, and I think
that's the road to mastery.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.646
&gt;&gt;Casey: We're gonna
have to fix this somehow.

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:41.606
We're probably gonna have to take
this wall out and do it again.

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.366
&gt;&gt;Will: And there's no
room for C plus work.

00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:47.426
If you're going to build a building
in San Francisco, everything has

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:49.816
to be pretty tight,
so they understand

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:53.766
that we don't accept second
rate work here, because we know

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:56.056
that they're not going to be
doing that in the real world,

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:58.836
so why start them with the
sense that they can get by?

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:00.686
&gt;&gt;It has to be done, why?

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:04.606
&gt;&gt;Because people are
gonna live there.

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:07.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fowler and teacher
Casey Brennan carefully review the

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:11.186
curriculum standards for the math and
fine arts courses they will teach.

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:14.296
&gt;&gt;Casey: Students analyze issues of
international trade and explain--

00:03:14.296 --> 00:03:16.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Then they design
projects that engage their students

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:18.156
in mastering the subject.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.976
&gt;&gt;Casey: You don't have
to scrap the design,

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:23.416
'cause the design is beautiful, but
what you need to do is rescale it

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:25.316
so that it stays within
those parameters.

00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:28.286
&gt;&gt;I don't stand in front
of the kids and say,

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:31.136
"This is how you're
going to learn today."

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:33.476
I mean, they do have
an agenda every day.

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:38.046
They know what the objectives are,
but they do the investigating.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:42.756
I give them the materials,
and they do the research.

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:45.696
They do the uncovering
of their own curriculum,

00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:50.076
and the kids take ownership
of their education

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:52.976
and it becomes more
meaningful to them.

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:55.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Before any
major project is undertaken,

00:03:55.436 --> 00:03:58.896
students complete small projects
like a PowerPoint presentation

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.536
on various architectural styles.

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:03.096
&gt;&gt;Mikalynn: You get to
learn about architecture.

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:06.976
You get to learn like more sharpen
up your skills on like algebra,

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:11.556
you know, 'cause like I'm in geometry
now, so like you can forget some

00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:12.896
of those little things,
so it helps you

00:04:12.896 --> 00:04:14.706
like remember and like keep ahead.

00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:16.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For their
second major project,

00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:19.066
students had to create
a performance space

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:20.986
on a three thousand square foot lot.

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:23.556
&gt;&gt;Casey: So first they
sketch out a blueprint.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:26.346
From that, based on their
design and the specs,

00:04:26.406 --> 00:04:28.236
they take it to Autodesk Revit.

00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:30.656
&gt;&gt;Student: This is what my
model looks like when it's

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:35.226
in three D. I have a fireman's
pole in case kids wanna slide down.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.686
&gt;&gt;Casey: It's incredible
design software.

00:04:38.016 --> 00:04:41.576
They're able to unfold
their blueprint

00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:43.586
into a three dimensional object

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:47.326
that meets all the
specifications of their design.

00:04:47.886 --> 00:04:52.026
&gt;&gt;Mikalynn: So right here is where
I did my internet cafe and I decided

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:53.466
to make half of it a sunroom.

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:57.166
So since the sun moves
in a southward direction,

00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:58.896
so I decided to put it there

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:02.076
so that there would be more
sunlight during most of the day.

00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:03.396
&gt;&gt;Where was your plumbing setup?

00:05:03.706 --> 00:05:05.866
&gt;&gt;Casey: I mean, technically,
they could take a design

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:08.866
that they've created and print it out

00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:11.656
and actually present
it to a developer.

00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:15.736
&gt;&gt;The first step is to
sketch everything out.

00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:19.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Brennan grades students
on a rubric that includes design,

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:23.026
creativity, presentation
skills and peer review,

00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:25.726
and she makes the grading
process transparent.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:29.566
&gt;&gt;Casey: Kids should know
what they're being graded on.

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:32.466
Kids should know from the very
beginning what the objectives are

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:33.926
and what the expectation are.

00:05:34.196 --> 00:05:37.216
Those should be clearly
communicated and understood.

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:42.176
And after that if, you know, it's
done right, then students can say,

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:46.226
"Okay, these are all of the
areas in which I succeeded

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:50.136
or I need improvement," and
that should be a no brainer.

00:05:50.886 --> 00:05:53.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Seniors at the institute
took part in a public art project,

00:05:54.096 --> 00:05:57.976
installing ceramic tiles
depicting historic vessels as part

00:05:57.976 --> 00:06:00.876
of a peer restoration project
for the port of San Francisco.

00:06:01.906 --> 00:06:06.206
&gt;&gt;Justin: This model I made in
Three D Studio Max and basically,

00:06:06.246 --> 00:06:09.166
it's just a little
diagram of the peer.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.606
I showed it to the Port of San
Francisco, they really liked it,

00:06:11.606 --> 00:06:14.516
and it turns out that they kinda use
railings that look kinda like this.

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Marks acted as project
manager for the art project.

00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:21.746
He sees a vast difference between
learning here and what goes

00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:23.746
on in the school he
comes from each day.

00:06:24.186 --> 00:06:27.756
&gt;&gt;Justin: Difference is, we all
sit there and the work you have

00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:28.986
to do is just in a textbook.

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:30.686
You're not allowed to get up.

00:06:30.686 --> 00:06:33.926
You're not free, you're just stuck
there in your uncomfortable desk.

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:36.956
Here, everybody has more
of a positive attitude.

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:39.406
Everybody works together,
pretty much.

00:06:39.406 --> 00:06:42.596
&gt;&gt;The earlier design had a
very clear pattern system.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Twice a week, seniors
spend the afternoon in internships

00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:48.576
at major architectural
firms in the city.

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:51.136
&gt;&gt;Man: We have, you know, all
these digital photographs,

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:56.326
so we can verify our drawing and
actually fill in the missing parts--

00:06:56.506 --> 00:06:58.536
&gt;&gt;Justin: It definitely
gives you a motivation.

00:06:58.536 --> 00:06:59.666
You're doing something different.

00:06:59.766 --> 00:07:01.796
It just gives you a
positive effect really,

00:07:01.946 --> 00:07:03.846
just doing something that you enjoy.

00:07:05.156 --> 00:07:08.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Architect Richard Hannum
created the internship program

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:10.866
that became the Build
San Francisco Institute.

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:14.106
He saw the value of
working outside the system

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.416
when he became disenchanted
with his own son's public high

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:19.066
school experience.

00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:21.496
&gt;&gt;Richard: One Friday, I went
into my son's school and pointed

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:24.946
out that he wouldn't be there on
Monday, and after a few moments,

00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:27.046
they realized that I meant not
just Monday, but any Monday

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.976
and that was it, and we walked out.

00:07:29.686 --> 00:07:34.476
And I started homeschooling James,
my wife and I decided to do that,

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:36.216
and we didn't really
actually know what that meant.

00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:39.186
What we found, what we discovered
was as soon as we were away

00:07:39.286 --> 00:07:41.856
from the system, as it
was then postulated,

00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:45.466
we found all these extremely
interesting, highly educated people

00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:49.666
with very creative ideas about
education, with no limitations.

00:07:49.866 --> 00:07:51.956
&gt;&gt;Man: Right now, we have
this module here, for example,

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:55.016
and this is a balcony
and this is a window.

00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:56.626
&gt;&gt;Richard: We created our own school.

00:07:57.146 --> 00:07:59.666
We have several students that we
simply took out of other places

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.086
and had come to our
office and it's a school.

00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:04.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Hannum's
mentoring concept,

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:07.426
with the school district's
backing, has created a model

00:08:07.506 --> 00:08:11.126
for other PBL initiatives that could
dramatically change the way young

00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:11.896
people learn.

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:14.626
&gt;&gt;Richard: If you find
the current situation

00:08:14.626 --> 00:08:17.936
to be unacceptable intellectually,
with what we're doing with children

00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:21.046
as a nation, then you have
to actively make change.

00:08:22.216 --> 00:08:26.146
And to have found something that has
the level of impact that this has

00:08:26.146 --> 00:08:29.906
on children, that's really
so easy to do, is fantastic.

00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:31.996
&gt;&gt;Mark where it's going to be.

00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:35.226
&gt;&gt;Will: We know this works first
by the reaction from the students.

00:08:35.436 --> 00:08:38.076
We get feedback from the
mentors on the growth

00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:41.396
that they see the students working
in their firms, and we're starting

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.386
to get feedback from test scores.

00:08:43.386 --> 00:08:45.656
This is only our second year,
but we're starting to see

00:08:45.656 --> 00:08:48.086
that the students are having a
higher success rate in high school,

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:50.686
because they go back to
their high schools energized.

00:08:51.226 --> 00:08:53.706
&gt;&gt;Richard: Every time we start a
session, I get frustrated because,

00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:54.966
you know, they're just
not gonna make it

00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:56.796
and this group's different
than the last group.

00:08:57.146 --> 00:09:00.016
And for me, my moment is six
weeks in, when all of a sudden,

00:09:00.016 --> 00:09:02.376

00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:06.626
And it's like another group of
great kids who are no longer going

00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:11.036
to see education the same way again.

00:09:11.286 --> 00:09:13.286
