00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:11.479
The talented young herbalist named Xu Xian
was in trouble.

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.422
It should have been a victorious moment–

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:16.212
he had just opened his very 
own medicine shop.

00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:19.132
But he bought his supplies from 
his former employer,

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:22.252
and the resentful man 
sold him rotten herbs.

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:25.722
As Xu Xian wondered what to do with this 
useless inventory,

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.892
patients flooded into his shop.

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:29.502
A plague had stricken the city,

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:31.752
and he had nothing to treat them.

00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:33.502
Just as he was starting to panic,

00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:39.242
his wife, Bai Su Zhen, produced a recipe
to use the rotten herbs as medicine.

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:43.113
Her remedy cured all the plague-afflicted
citizens immediately.

00:00:43.113 --> 00:00:46.503
Xu Xian’s former boss even had to buy back
some of the rotten herbs

00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:48.193
to treat his own family.

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:52.793
Shortly after, a monk named Fa Hai 
approached Xu Xian,

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:55.882
warning him that there was 
a demon in his house.

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:58.502
The demon, he said, was Bai Su Zhen.

00:00:58.502 --> 00:00:59.932
Xu Xian laughed.

00:00:59.932 --> 00:01:03.512
His kindhearted, resourceful wife 
was not a demon.

00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:04.922
Fa Hai insisted.

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:10.122
He told Xu Xian to serve his wife realgar
wine on the 5th day of the 5th month,

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:12.052
when demons’ powers are weakest.

00:01:12.052 --> 00:01:15.312
If she wasn’t a demon, he explained, 
it wouldn’t hurt her.

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:17.292
Xu Xian dismissed the monk politely,

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:20.152
with no intention of serving 
Bai Su Zhen the wine.

00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:23.252
But as the day approached, 
he decided to try it.

00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:25.902
As soon as the wine touched 
Bai Su Zhen’s lips,

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:29.122
she ran to the bedroom, 
claiming she wasn’t feeling well.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.262
Xu Xian prepared some medicine 
and went to check on her.

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:33.712
But instead of his wife,

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:37.952
he found a giant white serpent with a
bloody forked tongue in the bed.

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:40.512
He collapsed, killed by the shock.

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:42.482
When Bai Su Zhen opened her eyes,

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:45.292
she realized immediately what 
must have happened.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:48.522
The truth was that Bai Su Zhen was 
an immortal snake

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:50.792
with formidable magical powers.

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:53.362
She had used her powers to take a 
human form

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:56.212
and improve her and 
her husband’s fortunes.

00:01:56.212 --> 00:01:58.412
Her magic couldn’t revive Xu Xian,

00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:00.822
but she had one more idea to save him:

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:05.052
an herb that could grant longevity 
and even bring the dead back to life,

00:02:05.052 --> 00:02:07.400
guarded by the Old Man of the South Pole

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.250
in the forbidden peaks of the 
Kun Lun Mountains.

00:02:12.253 --> 00:02:15.543
She rode to the mountains on a cloud,

00:02:15.543 --> 00:02:18.303
then continued on foot passed gateways 
and arches

00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:21.103
until she reached one 
marked “beyond mortals”

00:02:21.103 --> 00:02:22.783
hanging over a silver bridge.

00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:24.013
On the other side,

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:27.293
two of the Old Man’s disciples 
guarded the herb.

00:02:27.293 --> 00:02:29.753
Bai Su Zhen disguised herself as a monk

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:33.883
and told them she’d come to invite 
the Old Man to a gathering of the gods.

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:35.377
While they relayed her message,

00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:37.575
she plucked some leaves 
from the herb and ran.

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:40.595
The servants realized they had been 
tricked and chased her.

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:43.715
Bai Su Zhen coughed up a magic ball 
and threw it at one.

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:45.695
As the other closed in on her,

00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:48.485
she put the herb under her tongue 
for safekeeping,

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:51.915
but its magic forced both of them 
into their true forms.

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:54.355
As the crane’s long beak 
clamped around her,

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:55.985
the Old Man appeared.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:59.125
Why, he asked, would she risk her life 
to steal his herb

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:00.995
when she was already immortal?

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:03.745
Bai Su Zhen explained 
her love for Xu Xian.

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:07.235
Even if he didn’t want to be with her 
now that he knew she was a demon,

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:09.725
she was determined to 
bring him back to life.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:13.575
The two had a karmic connection dating 
back more than a thousand years.

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:15.625
When Bai Su Zhen was a small snake,

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:17.675
a beggar was about to kill her,

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:19.965
but a kind passerby rescued her.

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:23.405
Her rescuer was Xu Xian in a past life.

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:25.885
Touched by her willingness 
to risk her life for him,

00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:30.905
the Old Man permitted her to leave the 
mountain with the immortal herb.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:35.831
Bai Su Zhen returned home 
to revive Xu Xian.

00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:37.032
When he opened his eyes,

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:40.512
the terrified look frozen on his face 
became a smile.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:41.411
Demon or not,

00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:43.811
he was still happy to see his wife.
