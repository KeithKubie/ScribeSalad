00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.540
Using the genetic code, we see that an insertion

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.710
of just one nucleotide pushes everything else out of

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.250
frame. Here we had TCA, now we have TTC.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.940
We had TCA, now we have ATC. Sure, we changed

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.770
the codon where the actual mutation occurred, but we

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.520
also changed all the codons downstream of that, so this

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.140
would best be described as a frameshift mutation. Now

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.520
some of you may have wanted to put missense and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.810
it's true, you are changing the individual amino acids

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.880
for that particular codon. But you're also changing all

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.850
the amino acids down stream and so the best

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.460
categorization of this kind of mutation is a framshift. Remember

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.900
that when we say frameshift. It's implied that all

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.580
the other codons are going to get changed, which

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.300
means all the amino acids are changing as well

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.640
likely. And so we going to have lot's of missense effects

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.880
in the over all protein.
