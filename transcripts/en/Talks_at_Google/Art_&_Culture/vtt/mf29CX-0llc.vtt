[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.390
SPEAKER 1: We wanted
to really kick it off

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.000
with a taste of what
the magazine is like.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.460
So we're going to
hear a quick reading

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.350
from Gary over here who was a
contributor to the first issue.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.930
And he's going to read you
a part of his contribution

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.213
to the magazine.

00:00:21.213 --> 00:00:22.020
Woo-hoo!

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.997
[LAUGH]

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:25.919
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.326
GARY YEH: Hello.

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:27.867
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.240
GARY YEH: So I'll
be reading excerpts

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.404
from my piece called "Depression
and the Art That Saved Me."

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.600
"I was 14 when I first felt
the urge to end my own life.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.584
Most mornings, I would wake
up feeling cold and unwanted.

00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:47.000
Even in the spring when the
dogwood tree outside my window

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.580
blossomed, I struggled to
find beauty in the world,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.504
to motivate myself
to get out of bed.

00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:54.170
Although there were
spurts of happiness,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.380
my teenage years were haunted
by the desire to call it quits.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.870
I struggled with my emotions,
but more importantly, I

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.670
struggled with why.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.900
Why did I feel these urges?

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.760
Why was I unhappy?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.390
For years, I tried
answering these questions,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.140
and wondered if my
parents' rocky marriage

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.140
or my failed two-week
middle school relationship

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.540
factored into my depression.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.170
As I entered high
school, however, I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.510
began to realize that these
contortions of the mind

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.780
were rooted in an
internal struggle

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.890
with my race and my identity.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.930
I grew up in a predominantly
white community.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.120
I surrounded myself
with white friends.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.370
I ignored our
differences in race,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.710
and fundamentally, our
differences in culture.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.660
And I sacrificed an
important part of myself

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.010
to blend in among my peers.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.779
I ate different foods at
home than I did at school.

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:39.570
I was annoyed when my
parents mispronounced

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.820
basic English words,
yet I would shamelessly

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.480
laugh when white students
made mocking impersonations

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.962
of other Asians.

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:48.420
I wondered whether
my true self was

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.180
the person I was at home,
the person I was at school,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.620
or neither.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.410
I remember a time when I was
flipping through movie channels

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.080
and lingered on a Jackie
Chan film, a scene where

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.035
he was distressed and exclaimed
in a heavy accent, "Who am I?"

00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:03.480
It was branded in
my mind for years.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.050
Who am I?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.169
A major challenge of my
depression was desensitization.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.870
In order to cope with
suicidal thoughts,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.650
I largely ignored them.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.530
I set my emotions aside
and put on a plastic smile

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.090
wherever I went.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.190
Over time, not only
did I become an expert

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.530
at hiding how I felt
inside, but I also

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.560
became incapable of
letting my emotions flow.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.590
For years I never cried, despite
how desperately I begged to.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.840
I lost the sensation
of being human

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.080
and felt completely out
of touch with my emotions.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.790
One summer during
high school, my dad

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.670
dropped me off on the National
Mall in Washington, DC.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.690
Go explore, he said, as
he drove off to work.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.304
I loathed the experience.

00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:43.720
I wanted to spend my summer
at home playing "Call of Duty"

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.646
or aimlessly scrolling
through Facebook.

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:47.395
After a few days
wandering through museums

00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:51.012
of natural history,
airplanes, and design,

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:52.720
I eventually stumbled
into the Hirshhorn,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.010
a Smithsonian Museum dedicated
to modern and contemporary art.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.230
On view was an Yves
Klein retrospective,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.630
highlighted by monochromes
and blue impressions

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.774
of the female body
pulled across canvas.

00:03:03.774 --> 00:03:05.440
Searching for meaning
in these paintings

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.870
sparked a sense of
curiosity, and what I

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.342
would later discover to
be a sense of purpose.

00:03:11.342 --> 00:03:13.300
I devoted the remainder
of my high school years

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.050
pursuing my fledgling
interest in the arts

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.990
to see how far I could take it.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.264
Fortunately, my parents
supported this move,

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:20.680
because they thought
it would make

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.240
me a unique candidate
when it came time

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.281
for college applications.

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:24.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.290
In fact, the focus
shifted from making

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.660
sure I had good grades in
calculus and statistics

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.660
to allowing me to curate my
identity around the arts,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.750
in order to "stand out" from
the Asians who had perfect SAT

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.970
scores.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.310
I enrolled in AP art
history and subsequently

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.187
in independent study.

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.520
But something was still missing.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.170
Academia bored me.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.570
I was never satisfied
simply reading about it.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.091
Plus, for however
much I loved art,

00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:50.590
studying art at a suburban high
school where the jocks still

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.100
ruled supreme was perceived
as less than cool.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.960
I continued living
as an outsider, not

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.840
fully in the Asian community,
and not fully in any other.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.820
Even as I pursued what I
loved, I still felt alone.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.440
At Duke University,
that sentiment

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.260
persisted into my
sophomore year.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.410
I was the only male art history
major and the only minority

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.830
in my class.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.760
Even though I had found a group
of like-minded individuals,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.240
I couldn't get over how
different I was on the surface.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.860
Searching for an
escape, I proceeded

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.420
with the only
millennial thing to do,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.950
and I created an Instagram.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.780
It became my diary.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.120
My Instagram @artdrunk
began as a means

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.040
to document artwork
I liked, hated,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.715
and everything in between.

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:33.340
Ultimately, I realized
it was an outlet

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.350
for communicating my emotions.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.850
What I posted in
this digital world

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.480
often reflected how I felt in
real time and in real life.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.330
Posting a Lucio Fontana,
an Italian artist

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.830
known for slashing
into canvases,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.500
reflected one of my troubled
moments and my connection

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.770
with the rawness of breaking
an otherwise perfect surface.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.960
Posting a Richard Serra,
an American sculptor

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.030
known for massive
expanses of steel,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.215
reflected how I enjoyed
feeling human again

00:04:57.215 --> 00:04:59.590
under a towering wall of metal,
and knowing that it would

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.440
exist centuries beyond my life.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.332
As my Instagram following grew,
so did my sense of purpose.

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:08.290
Although the challenges
of being Asian American

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.665
in a white community and the
additional struggle of being

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:13.550
a minority in the arts have
made me feel different,

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.660
I believe that my race
does not define me.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.940
It is only a part of my identity
rather than the whole of it.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.740
I continue to engage
with my heritage,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.240
learning about
different Asian teas,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.180
and being proud to hear Taiwan
become the first Asian country

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.610
to legalize gay marriage.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.400
But through art, I am empowered
to push beyond stereotypes.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.140
It has helped me
create an identity

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.870
for myself not restricted
by the color of my skin

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.990
or the way my eyes
squint when I smile.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.910
My battle with depression
lasted seven years,

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.285
which transformed the way I
view the world and the people

00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:42.940
around me.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.750
Those seven years
took me down a road

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.320
where I thought the darkness
would never turn to light.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.790
But eventually,
those seven years

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.190
brought me to my
foremost passion.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.120
Through the struggle,
I found art.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.644
And in a very real and
literal sense, art saved me.

00:05:56.644 --> 00:05:58.060
Without it, I would
still be lost,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.310
trying to understand what
it means to be different

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.009
and what it means to be me."

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.799
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:07.757
Thank you.

00:06:11.907 --> 00:06:13.115
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much.

00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:15.094
That was an awesome reading.

00:06:15.094 --> 00:06:16.760
And we're going to
get to hear from Gary

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.550
about that piece in a bit.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.090
Perfect.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.090
All right.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.730
I'm excited to introduce
our panel here today.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.510
Just going to do some quick
bios so we have some context.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.805
Directly to my right--

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:36.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.560
--is our two founders,
Katerina and Krystie.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.350
Katerina is a product
strategist in the tech industry,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.900
and has worked from
companies actually

ranging from Yahoo to
early-stage Silicon Valley

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.950
startups.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.870
She's passionate about music,
about making topics like race

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.840
and identity easier to talk
about in our everyday lives,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.910
and has a bachelor's of arts in

that provides pro bono
consulting services

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.640
to women-led organizations.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.070
She is an avid storyteller

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.760
perform at The Moth, and holds
a dual degree in business

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.120
administration and public
health from UC Berkeley.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.330
Tessa is actually the
creative-- sorry, what was it?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.173
Marketing director?

00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:34.256
TESSA KU: Head of Digital.

00:07:34.256 --> 00:07:34.970
SPEAKER 1: Head of Digital.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.540
Yes.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.200
Sorry.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.950
Head of Digital.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.620
The person who knows what
Instagram photos are coming up

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.480
from this event, essentially.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.460
We planned that out earlier.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.430
She's spent the last
five years here at NYC,

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.140
putting her marketing
degree to use.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.240
We actually talked
at lunch about how

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.490
she's the only one of us who
actually uses her degree.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.166
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.440
And currently leads luxury
marketing for the ad sales

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.150
department at the
"Wall Street Journal,"

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.900
as well as heading up the
digital efforts at "Slant'd."

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.210
Also perfecting
challah making skills,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.220
which is pretty awesome.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.090
TESSA KU: I just married
my Jewish husband,

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.340
so I'm working on perfecting
my perfecting my challah.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:10.841
[LAUGH]

00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:11.506
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:08:11.506 --> 00:08:13.610
Well, I personally know
that Asian-Jewish pairing

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.360
is a strong one.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:14.950
So you know.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.300
And then Gary, who
we just heard from,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.510
is a Business Analyst for the
CIO at Fiserv Lending Solutions

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.954
and an aspiring art collector.

00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:29.120
As you heard from his piece,
you can also follow him

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.940
on Instagram at @artdrunk.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.340
So check that out
afterwards as well.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.470
But I think I wanted
to kick it off kind

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.380
of by hearing first of all
from our two founders here

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.030
about how you would define,
like, what Slant'd is,

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.077
and what inspired
you to found it.

00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:46.910
KATERINA JENG: Yeah.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.050
I can sort of tell
the origin story.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.530
So "Slant'd" is a
media company that

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.450
celebrates
Asian-American identity

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.430
through personal storytelling.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.470
And it came about
because Krystie

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.500
invited me to a Facebook group
called Project Boat, which

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.810
was just a place for
people, Asian Americans,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.960
to post about what's going on
in the news, ask for advice,

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.060
and just have a community
of like-minded people.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.090
And I saw all these
amazing stories happening,

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.381
but they were happening in
this private Facebook group.

00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.020
And I was like, this needs
to be out into the world.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.620
So I was like, hey, Krystie,
you want to start a zine?

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.420
And we had, like, a
humble spreadsheet

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.790
where people were just dropping
in ideas of what stories

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.226
they might want to contribute.

00:09:24.226 --> 00:09:26.600
And then from there, we launched
our Kickstarter campaign

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.220
in June, which got
such amazing support.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.370
And that funded the Issue
01, which is on sale today.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.700
And then for the launch
party for Issue 01,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.760
we really felt just such an
amazing sense of community.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.890
Like, we had a
sold-out launch party.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.196
The energy and the support
was just so incredible.

00:09:46.196 --> 00:09:47.570
And at that moment,
we were like,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.820
this is way bigger
than a magazine.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.310
So we've decided to
be a media company

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.229
and explore new forms
of media in 2018.

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:56.020
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.550
KRYSTIE MAK: And a big
part of that too is I

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.890
went to a book talk
with Eddie Huang

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.170
about six months before
"Slant'd" became something.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.270
And he said that if spaces
don't exist for you,

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.649
kick the door down
and create them.

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:10.190
And at that time,
we didn't even know

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.775
this was going to be a thing.

00:10:11.775 --> 00:10:13.400
And when Kat reached
out to me, it just

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.760
felt like the right opportunity.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.270
Because we didn't see ourselves
in media or in mainstream

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:17.857
media.

00:10:17.857 --> 00:10:19.940
We wanted a place where
we could share our stories

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.320
from everyday people.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.720
So one of the big things about
"Slant'd" is that it's not

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.980
celebrities who write for us.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.080
You know, it's not
published writers, per se.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.280
It's people like you, me,
your brother, your sister,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.414
your cousin who just
have a story to tell,

00:10:31.414 --> 00:10:33.080
and they just want a
place to share that

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.500
and to connect
with other people.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.000
So "Slant'd's" really supposed
to be a community building,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.657
creative outlet for all of us.

00:10:38.657 --> 00:10:40.490
All of us were friends
when we started this,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.800
so I think that's what
makes it extremely special.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.716
SPEAKER 1: Definitely.

00:10:43.716 --> 00:10:46.910
And so I mean, touching on that
point of the idea of building

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.189
a community, I mean,
I feel like one thing

00:10:49.189 --> 00:10:51.230
we talk about with the
Asian Google Network a lot

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.720
is that there is very
little consensus on what it

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.700
means to be Asian American.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.330
You know, that term
encompasses in theory, like,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.490
hundreds of different
ethnicities and languages.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.100
There's also the
question of citizens

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.620
and non-citizen
residents of the US

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.230
who are impacted by issues
that affect the community,

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.420
but may not have
been here as long,

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.460
or may not be here forever.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.520
How do you guys sort
of define that idea

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.830
of an Asian-American
identity for the purposes

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.102
of the magazine.

00:11:21.102 --> 00:11:22.560
KATERINA JENG: So
for the magazine,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.310
we define Asian American as
anyone who has come from Asia.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.590
So including East
Asian, Southeast Asian,

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.030
and South Asian.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.950
And there are a lot
of different groups.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.280
And our goal is not to
sort of lump everyone

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.900
into one category.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.550
It's more to celebrate
the differences

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.940
that we all have and the shared
experiences that we do have.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.580
I think one thing that the
Asian-American movement is

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.390
getting better at is being in
solidarity with each other.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.060
Because in the past we've been
very separated, just thinking

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.190
about our history in America.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.320
Coming to America,
no ethnic group

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.590
wanted to associate themselves
with another ethnic group that

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.970
had already come, because
they wanted to not face

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.680
the same discrimination.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.210
But now, like, I feel since the
'90s and coming into the 2000s,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.250
we're really starting
to come together.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.410
And we're realizing that
together, we are stronger

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.234
and we can make a difference
as one whole collective.

00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:18.900
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah,
and being this, like,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.900
hyphenated culture has been
an interesting thing for us

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.020
at "Slant'd," because when we
edit a lot of the pieces from

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.770
Issue 01, a very common theme
was straddling two worlds.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.230
So straddling what
it's like to be Asian,

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.506
what it's like to be American,
not fitting in either place.

00:12:34.506 --> 00:12:35.880
And that's something
that I think

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.430
we wrestle with individually
and collectively as a community.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.380
So when we look
for contributors,

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.560
we're looking for people who are
exploring this question of what

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.450
it means to be Asian American.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.040
It's not a 50/50 split.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.540
It's just an ongoing journey.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.950
And everyone on
this team is also

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.080
going through a sense of
self-discovery in the process.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.210
SPEAKER 1: So when
you were crafting

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.310
this first issue
of the magazine,

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.660
how did you go about
sourcing different voices

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.964
and different parts of the
Asian-American community?

00:13:03.964 --> 00:13:06.130
KATERINA JENG: So it was a
pretty grassroots effort.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.050
We had a Google
Form that we just

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.701
sent out to friends and family.

00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:11.200
Great way of
collecting information.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.380
And from there, we made sure
that every piece had a mission,

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.030
that the author had
something that they

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.830
wanted to say to the community.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.260
And the theme of our first
issue was beginnings.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.640
So whether that's a spiritual
beginning or a self-awakening

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.860
or the start of
something new, we

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.687
wanted to make sure that every
piece related to the theme.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:33.520
KRYSTIE MAK: Mm-hmm.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.150
And we purposely tried
to keep it very open.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.650
You know, it's very
interpretive for each person.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.220
And we looked to get people
from all over the country.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.670
So although we're in New York
City right now on this event,

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.350
our contributors come from
all across the country.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.770
We had 21 for this first
issue, and we actually only

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.067
knew seven of them beforehand.

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:54.400
We don't know how they found us.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.660
I think it was
through word of mouth,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.860
but that speaks to the
solidarity of our community,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.160
just looking for a place
to share their stories.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.600
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.420
Tessa, I know we
were talking earlier

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.180
about balancing the
fact that you guys have

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.930
put so much work into
launching this while also

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.591
having these amazing careers
in tech and in marketing,

00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:14.840
and all of these other things.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.020
So I'd like to hear from
all of you, I guess,

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.320
about what it's been like
balancing a passion project

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.050
and starting a new media
company with having

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.420
these full-time other jobs.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.045
TESSA KU: Yeah.

00:14:25.045 --> 00:14:26.530
I mean, it's a lot.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.659
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.950
Like, the journal was going
through a reorg at the time

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.150
that things were
really ramping up.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.690
And like, I was
planning my wedding

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.814
and we were launching this.

00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:35.050
And it was like--

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.490
there were times where I
was, like, very stressed out.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.810
But I think that this is a
situation in which the phrase

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:46.060
passion project is really
very applicable, because some

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.860
of my friends and I
have started projects

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.650
where we were really into
them, but they never really

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:51.370
went anywhere.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.220
Because you know, like,
if things came up,

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.420
it kind of took a backseat.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.990
But this is the kind of
project where for me, it

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.850
meant something very personal.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.990
So I was able to
kind of prioritize it

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.530
over certain other things,
because it meant so much to me,

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.141
and it meant so much to
everyone else who was doing it.

00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:14.390
KRYSTIE MAK: I was actually
talking to Gary about this

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.560
this morning.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.860
I feel very lucky that I hit
my quarter-life breakthrough

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.190
shortly before starting
"Slant'd" where up until then

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.440
I kept thinking my job
had to be my calling,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.140
had to be my passion,
had to be my everything.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.270
And then I realized that
it didn't have to be that.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.610
It didn't have to put so
much pressure on my job

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.560
being something bigger
than what it really was.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.980
And so I happened to land
a job, a 9:00 to 5:00,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.890
that truly was essentially
a 9:00 to 5:00.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.170
And I love what I do.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.200
I love doing branding.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.060
And the company is
really supportive

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.900
of me doing side
projects like this.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.586
And so the epiphany of having a
job that supports me in the way

00:15:49.586 --> 00:15:50.960
that it allows me
to do something

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.120
like "Slant'd" or
pursuing a passion project

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.380
is really pivotal.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.467
We joke that "Slant'd"
is like a second job,

00:15:56.467 --> 00:15:58.550
and I definitely would not
have been able to do it

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.680
if it wasn't for the support
of my current company.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.610
SPEAKER 1: That was
a good pivot there,

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.340
because I was like, uh-oh.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.110
She's going, oh, yeah.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.193
It's not a really a passion
of mine, 9:00 to 5:00.

00:16:05.193 --> 00:16:05.701
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:05.701 --> 00:16:06.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.450
KRYSTIE MAK: It definitely is.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.820
It's a 5:00 to 9:00 for sure,
but it's a very loving piece

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.852
of my 5:00 to 9:00.

00:16:11.852 --> 00:16:12.560
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.910
KRYSTIE MAK: I can't
imagine any other team

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.949
to do this with either.

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:16.490
I think the passion
that we all have,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.494
the personal drive is
a really big factor.

00:16:18.494 --> 00:16:19.910
SPEAKER 1: So what
kinds of things

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.490
have you done to sort of raise
awareness of the magazine,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.470
and go out and spread
the word that there

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.047
is this new voice
in the landscape?

00:16:27.047 --> 00:16:28.880
KATERINA JENG: I think
right now, most of it

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.880
has been word of mouth, which
just is a testament to how

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.820
strong the community is.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.280
Our biggest channel
right now is Instagram

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.700
I think us being millennials,
it was a natural outlet for us

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.930
to speak directly
to our audience.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.926
But in the new
year, in 2018, we're

00:16:44.926 --> 00:16:46.550
going to be looking
at events hopefully

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.880
across the country, more
marketing on social media

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.439
channels, and paid
advertising as well.

00:16:53.439 --> 00:16:55.730
KRYSTIE MAK: And also just
co-creation or collaborative

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.040
events, or even initiatives.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.790
So we've been very active about
going to other events, meeting

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.300
people.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.526
Not just Asian Americans, but
other communities of color

00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:07.609
to see what types of events
they're interested in,

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.637
what kind of dialogue
they want to be a part of,

00:17:09.637 --> 00:17:11.720
and how we can really raise
awareness in that way.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.180
Because something we
discovered at the launch party

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.400
was that this isn't just
for Asian Americans.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.079
Like, we are a
platform specifically

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.880
to elevate the
Asian-American narrative,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.967
but it's a broader
immigrant story.

00:17:22.967 --> 00:17:24.800
And in that sense, I
think we have the power

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.980
to really make a stronger impact
by collaborating with others.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.540
SPEAKER 1: So has
your idea of what

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.600
representation
looks like changed

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.070
as you formed the magazine?

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.750
Or what do you see yourselves
highlighting or really

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.367
elevating thematically
in the future?

00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:41.450
KATERINA JENG: I think so.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.060
So one thing that was
an interesting shift

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.680
is when we first
started "Slant'd," we

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.480
thought we would
create a community

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.010
to bring like-minded
people together.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.580
And then after the
election happened

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.815
and seeing the divisiveness
within our country,

00:17:55.815 --> 00:17:57.440
we realized that we
don't need to bring

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.580
similar people together.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.650
We need to bring
different people together,

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.570
and people with
different experiences,

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.820
cultural backgrounds,
and perspectives,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.670
and show that even
though you are different,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.090
you can still be friends.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.650
And in the end, we all share
the same fundamental stories

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.720
of being a human.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.720
TESSA KU: I think it's also
kind of like a cultural movement

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.760
that's happening that
we are just a part of.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.965
I think that you can
see that in Hollywood

00:18:23.965 --> 00:18:25.340
where the people
are speaking out

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.080
against the whitewashing
of Asian roles

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.610
and traditionally Asian movies,
or like the "Hawaii Five-0"

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.360
cast walking when they
weren't paid equally.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.309
Just all sorts of
things like that

00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:38.850
are really coming
to the surface now,

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.170
and I think that's what
makes our platform especially

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.674
relevant and especially needed.

00:18:45.674 --> 00:18:46.340
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.860
Has that been, like, a
big reaction from people

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.370
is that specifically, they talk
about Hollywood whitewashing

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.820
or representation in media
when they talk to you guys

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.247
about what they want to see?

00:18:58.247 --> 00:19:00.080
KATERINA JENG: We do
get a lot of questions,

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.800
like, any time we talk to
press about things going on

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.880
in the media.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.290
But it's interesting, because
it's not just about that.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.120
Like, the story
is so much larger,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.430
and we're just one
piece of the puzzle that

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.680
needs to happen in order to
push the movement forward.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.304
KRYSTIE MAK: I think
also because we're

00:19:17.304 --> 00:19:20.180
rooted in personal storytelling,
so the questions that we get

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.561
or the topics that we get fished
for are a little bit deeper

00:19:23.561 --> 00:19:24.060
than that.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.059
I mean, they definitely
cover our representation

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:27.974
in media or lawsuits per se.

00:19:27.974 --> 00:19:30.140
But one of the things that
really struck home for us

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.250
was a lot of reaching out
from families who adopt

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.590
Asian kids into their families.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.180
And that's a story
that personally I

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.530
haven't explored yet.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.360
I would love to explore
in future issues.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.180
But just these open questions
about, what do we do?

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.370
How do we talk about
race and identity

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.810
with our kids who grew up
looking different than us?

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.497
And so it's a very sensitive
piece to talk about,

00:19:52.497 --> 00:19:54.330
but I think that's
something that we can do.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.870
We can create a safe space for
that conversation to happen.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.370
SPEAKER 1: That's
really interesting

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.550
that that's kind of the audience
that's surfaced for you guys.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.714
Do you have-- do you feel like
you have a response for that?

00:20:04.714 --> 00:20:06.380
Or is there kind of
a sense of, well, we

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.465
can't define for you what your
child's Asian identity is?

00:20:09.465 --> 00:20:10.340
KATERINA JENG: Right.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.440
Obviously, that's a
very big role to fill.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.167
But I do think these
everyday stories can help.

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:17.000
Like, I'm thinking of
when I was growing up,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.416
did I have a
magazine that I could

00:20:18.416 --> 00:20:22.264
pick up and read about other
Asian-American experiences?

00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:23.930
I didn't really have
anything like that.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:24.910
So

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.220
"Slant'd" could be something
for that lone kid in Arkansas

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.130
who might not have a
community that looks like him

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.560
or goes through the same
experiences that he does.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.360
For him to pick it up
and say, wow, there

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.580
are other people that
can relate to what's

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.281
happening to my experience.

00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:41.030
KRYSTIE MAK: As well
as act as a resource.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.970
So like, we're definitely not
the authority on anything.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.950
Like, the Asian-American
narrative, per se.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.917
But every time we talk to
someone, they get so excited

00:20:48.917 --> 00:20:51.500
and want to connect us with five
more people in the community.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.620
So maybe we can't speak about
that story in particular,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.690
but maybe we can connect
them with someone

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.481
who can put them in
touch with someone else

00:20:58.481 --> 00:20:59.720
or share their own story.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.636
SPEAKER 1: Definitely.

00:21:00.636 --> 00:21:03.002
So in that sense, what has
been your vision of like--

00:21:03.002 --> 00:21:04.460
I know you were
saying you actually

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.769
decided to become a
more full-rounded media

00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:08.060
company rather than a magazine.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.780
Is that where the idea comes
from, is creating resources?

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.780
KRYSTIE MAK: Not necessarily
just for resources.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.414
I think it's to expand
the reach and realizing

00:21:17.414 --> 00:21:19.580
that stories come in many
different shapes and sizes

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.020
and forms.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.960
We've gotten so much
clamor about digital.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.940
I am a die-hard
paper fan, but I do

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.590
recognize that in
the 21st century,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.120
digital is really critical.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.000
TESSA KU: They can
both work together.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.770
KRYSTIE MAK: They
can work together.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:31.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.500
So figuring out how we
can create more platforms

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.710
for storytelling, because we
were created to fill a need,

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.261
and we can't just fill that
need with paper or with print.

00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:40.760
KATERINA JENG: Also
the fact that we

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.810
want to create a community
that has a two-way dialogue.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.210
So whereas putting out a
magazine and having someone

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.740
consume it is more of
a one-way conversation,

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.710
we really want to
create spaces where

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.330
people can interact
with the content

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.030
and interact with
each other, and start

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.550
to talk about these
issues that are

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.940
so complicated and nuanced
that really need discussion

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.834
around it in order to
move things forward.

00:22:03.834 --> 00:22:05.750
TESSA KU: Yeah, I think
that especially today,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.110
like, if we are trying to reach
that lone kid in Arkansas who

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.500
doesn't have any Asian
friends or an Asian community,

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.500
like, an online
presence that's robust

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.480
and really a community in
itself is so important.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.300
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.066
So it sounds like you guys
do an amazing job of kind

00:22:24.066 --> 00:22:26.440
of giving a voice to people
like that who don't feel they

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.610
have a community currently.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.410
But on the flip side, like,
I was talking to a friend

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.951
recently who mentioned
that he really

00:22:30.951 --> 00:22:33.910
thinks of himself more as Asian
rather than Asian American,

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.060
and that if he wanted to
see himself represented

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.130
in the media, he could
watch Chinese movies

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.670
and read Chinese books.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.790
Do you see a divide there
between the experiences

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.746
of more recent Asian
immigrants or maybe even

00:22:48.746 --> 00:22:53.880
non-permanent residents who
are in the States for now

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.910
versus sort of American-born
or American-raised Asian

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:58.890
Americans?

00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:59.390
Asians?

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.369
[LAUGH]

00:23:00.869 --> 00:23:02.201
KRYSTIE MAK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:03.700
GARY YEH: I think
there's actually--

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.790
from my experience, it's
been quite a difference

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.920
where going to a school
like Duke University,

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.670
there are a lot of
international students.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.127
And of course, some from
China, some from Korea,

00:23:12.127 --> 00:23:13.210
some from the Middle East.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.410
But I think the very nature
of being international and not

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.240
coming into a country
and having to find people

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.240
that are like you, they
sort of group themselves

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.030
off very quickly, and they
form their own communities.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.770
And so whereas for me,
like, being Asian American,

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.590
growing up in predominantly
white communities,

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.432
I was much more--

00:23:34.432 --> 00:23:36.140
not to say that they're
not open to that,

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.230
but I was already sort
of in those groups

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.720
and in those communities,
whereas there was definitely

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.140
that divide between the two.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.190
And I think for me
as an Asian American,

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:49.450
it's almost difficult to
connect with other Asians

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.360
actually from Asia
or born in Asia.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.106
TESSA KU: Yeah, I think to that
point an interesting-- like,

00:23:54.106 --> 00:23:56.230
not a trend, but a pattern
that's emerged, I think,

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.396
in our conversations and
in the stories that we hear

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:02.190
is that you have this
unique position where you're

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.950
kind of too Asian
to be American,

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.780
but you're too
American to really

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.690
be Asian to people
who live in Asia.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:14.250
So being Asian American is this
really interesting place to be.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.367
And like for me personally
when I was younger,

00:24:17.367 --> 00:24:19.200
I didn't want to have
anything to do with it

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.110
so I would ignore all
my Chinese homework

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.030
and I hated my Chinese
lessons, and now I

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.220
don't know how to speak
Mandarin, which I really

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.240
regret.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.540
So if I were looking for more
Asian representation in media,

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.540
like, I wouldn't be able
to watch Chinese movies

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.530
or read Chinese books.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:38.520
I would just-- I'm looking
for Asian representation

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.350
in American media.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.990
So I think it's a really
unique thing to you,

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:47.879
and how deep your connection
is to your Asian heritage.

00:24:47.879 --> 00:24:49.545
KRYSTIE MAK: I think
part of the divide,

00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:51.210
though, some of the
cause potentially

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.210
could be we gravitate
towards people who

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.960
give us a sense of belonging.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.387
And so as Asian
Americans, maybe we

00:24:58.387 --> 00:24:59.970
gravitate more towards
Asian Americans

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.480
because we get the traditions
that they're observing

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.996
or the food that they're eating.

00:25:03.996 --> 00:25:06.120
And people coming from
another country potentially,

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.770
they can't speak the
language, and they

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.020
feel a sense of belonging
within a specific group.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.478
And so it almost
feels like a sense

00:25:11.478 --> 00:25:14.066
of survival tactic in a way.

00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:15.690
I would love to break
down that divide.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.106
We've talked about
the hierarchies

00:25:17.106 --> 00:25:18.862
within Asian-American culture.

00:25:18.862 --> 00:25:20.820
That's something we
definitely want to explore.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.871
Because again, Asian American
isn't just East Asian.

00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:25.620
And so what does that
hierarchy look like,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.600
and how we can start
to break that down

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.980
and to really connect on a
more human level beyond race.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.230
KATERINA JENG: Yeah.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.070
And I think that would
be the ultimate goal,

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.210
is to break down that
barrier between Asian

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.400
Americans and Asians.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.980
Because if we're all
living in America,

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:43.150
then we can all benefit from
having a more solid community.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.650
SPEAKER 1: Do you
see any value then

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.590
in doing, like,
multilingual content

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.570
or having people from all these
different ethnic and language

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.910
groups who are
contributing doing

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.790
stuff that's maybe
translated in both languages,

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:58.900
or anything like that?

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.441
KATERINA JENG: That
would be amazing.

00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:00.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.444
Once we have the resources.

00:26:02.444 --> 00:26:03.360
KRYSTIE MAK: And yeah.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.102
And to Tessa's point,
like, I personally

00:26:05.102 --> 00:26:06.685
can't read Mandarin--
or read Chinese.

00:26:06.685 --> 00:26:08.100
I would love to be able to.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.930
Another regret also, going
to 10 years of Chinese school

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.755
and not studying hard.

00:26:12.755 --> 00:26:14.380
I would love to able
to translate that,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.005
because we've gotten
actually inquiries

00:26:16.005 --> 00:26:17.924
from folks who don't
live in the US.

00:26:17.924 --> 00:26:19.840
So we were trying to
figure out, as a startup,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.682
like, how do we ship
to another country?

00:26:21.682 --> 00:26:23.640
How do we translate things
in another language?

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.660
But that would be amazing
if we could do that.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.477
GARY YEH: I think
to that question,

00:26:27.477 --> 00:26:29.810
I don't know if any of you
guys saw the most recent show

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.580
at the Guggenheim.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.730
So it's a exhibition
on Chinese art.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.330
And I think as someone who
appreciates art and has

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.790
studied art in school,
I was really surprised

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.179
to find how different it was
to look at art that was-- you

00:26:43.179 --> 00:26:45.220
know, we see a lot of text
art, but text art that

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.980
was Chinese-based and based
off of Chinese characters.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.550
And that gave me really
a newfound appreciation

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.170
for what art could be.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.810
And if we did have
stories in different text,

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.520
obviously, different languages
have different nuances

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.336
to the actual word.

00:27:01.336 --> 00:27:02.710
Like, there are
a lot of words we

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.890
can't express in Chinese that
we do express in English,

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.130
and vice versa.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.520
And so if there are ways
to actually integrate that,

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.474
that would be great.

00:27:11.474 --> 00:27:12.140
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.510
No, that's really interesting.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.134
I mean, I definitely
see the challenge.

00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:16.956
I also don't speak any Chinese.

00:27:16.956 --> 00:27:17.456
[LAUGH]

00:27:17.456 --> 00:27:18.940
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah,
like, as the editors,

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.080
it's like, how would we edit
this in a different language?

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:21.788
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:27:21.788 --> 00:27:22.300
Yeah.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.716
Very big deal in my family
that I took Japanese in college

00:27:24.716 --> 00:27:25.330
instead.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.042
[LAUGH]

00:27:26.042 --> 00:27:27.115
KRYSTIE MAK: You're a bad Asian.

00:27:27.115 --> 00:27:27.615
[LAUGH]

00:27:27.615 --> 00:27:28.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.535
[LAUGH]

00:27:29.535 --> 00:27:31.410
SPEAKER 1: Don't you
have a hashtag for that?

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.940
KATERINA JENG: Yeah, #BadAsians.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.530
SPEAKER 1: #BadAsians.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:39.160
Gary, kind of speaking to your
art experience and stuff, like,

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.040
how did you actually first come
to get involved with "Slant'd?"

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.591
And how did you
choose that piece

00:27:44.591 --> 00:27:46.840
as what you wanted to
contribute for this first issue?

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.610
GARY YEH: Yeah.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.650
So my sister Lena, she's
actually involved with

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.180
the founding of "Slant'd."

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.024
I think she was the
partnership director.

00:27:54.024 --> 00:27:55.690
KRYSTIE MAK: She's
our hustler in chief.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.100
GARY YEH: OK.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.610
KRYSTIE MAK: She handled
a lot of the partnerships

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.050
that we had.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:58.330
GARY YEH: Yeah.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.180
And so she-- I guess when they
were looking for contributors,

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.500
naturally she just reached
out to me, and I signed on.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.010
That's the story for that.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.099
But in terms of
the actual piece,

00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:11.890
initially, I was going
to write about being

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.990
a minority in the
contemporary art world

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.040
where there honestly
aren't that many.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.060
Especially in scenes
like New York and London,

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:23.320
it's hard to find Asians who are
at the top of the gallery chain

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.519
or the top of being
good collectors.

00:28:26.519 --> 00:28:27.810
So that's what I thought about.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:31.990
But I mean, Kat and Krystie
can really attest to this,

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.360
where I really struggled
with that topic.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.300
And I spent two months writing
it, sending back drafts

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.367
and missing deadlines
here and there.

00:28:39.367 --> 00:28:40.069
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:40.069 --> 00:28:41.860
And eventually, I wanted
to write something

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.818
a little more personal.

00:28:42.818 --> 00:28:45.550
And this piece had always
been in the back of my mind

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.920
of accepting that I
had a mental illness.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.790
And I think writing
it down really

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.680
was that way of expressing,
you know, this is who I am.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.980
So be it.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.280
I want to share that
story, and really

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.529
try to just share it with other
people who might connect to it.

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:06.820
KATERINA JENG: And I thought
that was an amazing shift,

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.100
because it was actually a
completely different piece

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.070
than what we were
first working on.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.780
And mental illness is something
that really isn't spoken

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.500
about in Asian communities.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.110
So we have a couple pieces
on depression and overcoming

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:24.280
mental illness in a very
traditional household in Issue

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.204
01.

00:29:25.204 --> 00:29:25.870
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:26.810
I completely agree.

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.460
I mean, it's just not--

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.820
it's not considered
acceptable in a lot of ways.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.630
Yeah.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.640
So have you had any
specific reaction

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.440
from readers about those
pieces in particular?

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.690
KRYSTIE MAK: About the mental
health stuff, definitely

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.010
a few folks.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.439
One of my old roommates,
actually, she's

00:29:44.439 --> 00:29:46.480
very open about mental
health, and she's actually

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.667
thinking about going and
becoming a psychotherapist.

00:29:49.667 --> 00:29:51.250
And she read that
piece and was really

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.499
happy that she saw that piece.

00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:53.470
Like, saw Gary's piece.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.920
Because she is excited
about the prospect of people

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.600
coming to terms with that and
being able to openly share

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.950
that maybe they're not
done overcoming it yet,

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.372
and that they're
starting to seek help.

00:30:04.372 --> 00:30:06.580
And just seek a community
to have a conversation with

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.019
was really interesting.

00:30:08.019 --> 00:30:10.060
But there are other themes
within the first issue

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.400
that really resonated
with folks too.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.700
There's one in particular about
an Indian American woman who

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.685
renounced her Indian citizenship
to take on US citizenship.

00:30:18.685 --> 00:30:19.810
SPEAKER 1: Oh, interesting.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.190
KRYSTIE MAK: And she
talks about that struggle

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.230
all her life growing up,
wanting to be American,

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.480
wanting to go to prom
and driving a Range

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.402
Rover with her friends,
going to the mall.

00:30:27.402 --> 00:30:29.110
And then finally when
it comes down to it

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.020
and she has to renounce
her Indian citizenship,

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.120
she feels this overwhelming
sense of sadness

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.090
that she has let go of a part of
a culture or a part of herself

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.610
that for a long time
she was pushing aside.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.320
And it doesn't matter
what race you are.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.780
Like, being able to let go
of something from the past

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.488
to [INAUDIBLE] to
something in the future

00:30:45.488 --> 00:30:46.454
is really interesting.

00:30:46.454 --> 00:30:47.620
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, definitely.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.480
I mean, I already
want to read this,

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.300
because that's something my
family actually went through.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.920
My mom was originally Malaysian.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.577
And after my sister was
born, she was like, ugh,

00:30:56.577 --> 00:30:57.410
I guess I'm staying.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.940
But had to renounce
citizenship for that.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.950
So in terms of the more--

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.510
beyond community
building, I feel

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.030
like it's almost
like a political act

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.620
to create an
Asian-American magazine,

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.040
because there has
been so little media

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.100
attention around the
Asian-American community.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.404
Do you guys see yourself as a
political force in some way?

00:31:24.404 --> 00:31:26.320
KATERINA JENG: That's
an interesting question,

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.110
because when we first
founded it, I would say no.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.540
But now I would say
it's inevitable.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.730
And I personally,
and I know a lot

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.680
of the people on
the "Slant'd" team

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.970
has been really aware of
just the words that we use,

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.730
making sure that everything
we say is politically correct,

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.770
being educated, and
reading up as much

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.840
as we can on
Asian-American history

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.200
and what our people
have been through.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.330
It's just inevitably tied
to the political sphere.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.560
And so I think all of us are on
that journey to becoming more

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.355
politically aware and present.

00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:00.730
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah,
and everything

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.729
is political these days.

00:32:01.729 --> 00:32:03.274
So whether or not--

00:32:03.274 --> 00:32:05.440
as much as you say something
or don't say something,

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.820
it's political.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.380
And I think our
name is really bold,

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.620
and I think that's
important to recognize,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.729
because we're going
to be unapologetically

00:32:13.729 --> 00:32:14.770
bold about these stories.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.180
And I think in year
2, we're really

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.740
looking to do that
a little bit more.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.330
You know, finding
stories that really

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.870
push the conversation to be a
platform for Asian Americans,

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.921
not just about Asian Americans.

00:32:24.921 --> 00:32:25.420
So yeah.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.150
I would say that we could
be a political force,

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.840
but we need the community
behind us to do that.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.350
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.090
Do you find the community
sort of divided?

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.631
I mean, I think my impression
of the Asian-American community

00:32:33.631 --> 00:32:37.540
is like we have so
many different issues.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:42.400
Like, for instance, you know,
Asian members of the community

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.920
face very different issues
in terms of racial profiling

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.990
and stuff that an East Asian--

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:51.520
has it been hard to create a
unifying force or a unifying

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.354
voice in that sense?

00:32:52.354 --> 00:32:53.978
KATERINA JENG: I
think that's something

00:32:53.978 --> 00:32:56.880
that we're going to be working
on for years and years to come.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.020
Like, we're still not there.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.810
And it's about both celebrating
all these differences

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.880
and the different
maybe stereotypes

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.940
that each group might face,
the different experiences

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.010
that we all might go
through, and saying

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.860
that even though we have all
these different experiences,

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.790
we can still relate
to each other.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.790
SPEAKER 1: Can you talk
a little bit about-- you

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.950
mentioned the choice of
the name for the magazine.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:19.487
[LAUGH]

00:33:19.487 --> 00:33:20.320
KATERINA JENG: Yeah.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.420
It's funny because
we didn't think

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.180
it was so controversial until
we actually pushed it out there.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.505
And we get comments
about it all the time.

00:33:28.505 --> 00:33:30.920
But there's a couple
different meanings behind it.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.920
One that I love to talk
about is we really want

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.290
to shift people's perspectives.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.360
So putting a slant on something
or putting a tilt on something

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.090
and getting people to
see things in a new light

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:41.920
is really what the name
"Slant'd" is about.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.472
And the fact that it's
unapologetically bold,

00:33:44.472 --> 00:33:46.180
and we want to spark
those conversations.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.280
Our name is definitely
a conversation starter

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.334
and something that leads
to deeper conversations.

00:33:51.334 --> 00:33:52.750
KRYSTIE MAK: Another
thing you had

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.150
touched on earlier is the
nuance and the diversity

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.560
of the Asian-American community.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.340
So the term slanted is
often used as a blanket term

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.499
to characterize all
Asian Americans.

00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:04.540
But that's not fair,
because the origins actually

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.532
come from East Asian features.

00:34:06.532 --> 00:34:07.990
So what we wanted
to do was reclaim

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.835
this term and to
actually make it

00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:11.920
a term that we can celebrate.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.186
And so that's a little bit
about what we are about,

00:34:14.186 --> 00:34:16.060
which is celebrating
Asian-American diversity

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:16.810
and identity.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.819
So we wanted a name
to characterize that.

00:34:18.819 --> 00:34:20.860
And when we first started,
actually half the team

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.300
was not on board with this name.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:22.949
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:24.662
We had funny names.

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:25.870
We had a lot of cutesy names.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.230
KATERINA JENG: Mm-hmm.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.188
A lot of food-related--

00:34:27.188 --> 00:34:28.929
KRYSTIE MAK: Food-related ones.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.850
And now I don't even
think twice about it.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.770
Now I love that term
so much, I don't even

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.460
think about the
derogatory nature of it.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.001
And I think that
speaks a lot to what

00:34:36.001 --> 00:34:37.892
we're trying to accomplish.

00:34:37.892 --> 00:34:39.850
SPEAKER 1: Did you follow
at all that there was

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:41.330
a lawsuit related to this name?

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:41.830
Yeah.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:44.614
Does anyone want to explain
more context on that?

00:34:44.614 --> 00:34:46.989
TESSA KU: Essentially, there
was this Asian-American rock

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.840
band called The
Slants, and they were

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.310
trying to trademark their name.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:55.060
And the Patent and
Trademark Office

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.369
wouldn't allow it,
because they said it was

00:34:57.369 --> 00:35:00.019
discriminatory towards Asians.

00:35:00.019 --> 00:35:01.560
And they were like,
but we're Asian--

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:03.230
--and we want it.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.940
So isn't this a freedom
of speech situation?

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:11.360
And eventually-- and it weirdly
happened to be at the same time

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.610
of launch--

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.916
the Supreme Court
ruled in their favor,

00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:16.540
in the favor of The
Slants so that they

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:20.890
could have that name trademarked
and take back ownership the way

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:21.400
that we are.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.110
But it was so funny,
because everyone was like,

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:23.950
have you heard?

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.230
Is this from the same thing?

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.021
And we're like, no.

00:35:26.021 --> 00:35:27.550
It's like purely coincidental.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.240
But I think, you
know, it kind of--

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.950
it provides even
more support for it,

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:34.845
because it's just
like the universe is--

00:35:34.845 --> 00:35:36.220
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah,
the universe--

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:36.930
TESSA KU: --working
in that favor.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:37.580
[LAUGH]

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.530
KRYSTIE MAK: And
actually, it was funny,

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.060
because we want to say that
we're friends with them

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.790
now, because we
support each other.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.450
We talked about them
on our Instagram.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:44.982
They gave us a
shout-out as well.

00:35:44.982 --> 00:35:47.440
I think it's, again, speaking
to the power of the community

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.400
that when you find something
or people who understand what

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.670
you're going through
or they just get it,

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.360
there's an unspoken
relationship there

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.742
that I think keeps blossoming.

00:35:56.742 --> 00:35:57.450
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.280
Now was interesting.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.160
I remember thinking the case
itself was really interesting

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.070
as well, because there was
this freedom of speech idea of,

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.870
well, are you allowed
to reclaim this term?

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.080
But I did see someone
bring up alternatively

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.050
that because the Supreme Court
decided in favor of that band

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.056
that also the
Washington Redskins get

00:36:13.056 --> 00:36:14.180
to keep their name as well.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:14.470
[LAUGH]

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.260
TESSA KU: Yeah.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.639
Kind of of a double-edged sword.

00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:19.180
And it was interesting, because
I was re-watching this Trevor

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.886
Noah segment on it last
night, where the Patent

00:36:21.886 --> 00:36:23.260
Office basically
told The Slants,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.660
like, if you weren't
Asian, you would

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.770
be able to trademark this name.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:30.190
But because you're
Asian, it gives

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.596
the discriminatory context.

00:36:32.596 --> 00:36:34.220
And the guy who was
hosting the segment

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:40.845
was basically like, so in
saying that this is a--

00:36:40.845 --> 00:36:43.470
like, they're trying to protect
you from racial discrimination,

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:47.010
they discriminated
against you racially.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.214
How does that make sense?

00:36:49.214 --> 00:36:50.040
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.070
KRYSTIE MAK: The
world's a crazy place.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:51.778
SPEAKER 1: Right?

00:36:51.778 --> 00:36:53.194
[LAUGH]

00:36:53.194 --> 00:36:55.110
That's so funny.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.640
So what about transitioning
from the Redskins

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.990
away from horrible,
un-PC things too.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.400
Like, how do you
guys feel you've

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.190
been trying to reach across the
aisle to maybe other minority

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.594
groups and stuff as well?

00:37:10.594 --> 00:37:13.260
KATERINA JENG: So I think that's
where our partnerships come in.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.150
We've been going
to a lot of events

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.850
and meeting other people
of color in this space

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.890
and figuring out what
we can do next year

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.440
to create more
community spaces that

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.080
are inclusive of all races.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:25.830
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.725
Specifically, I was telling
the team over the weekend about

00:37:28.725 --> 00:37:31.650
a people of color in solidarity
storytelling event that I had

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.230
been to in Brooklyn--
of course Brooklyn--

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.082
two weeks ago.

00:37:35.082 --> 00:37:37.290
And it was interesting to
have a conversation of what

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.420
people of color really means.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.370
Traditionally, at least
personally, I never

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.730
felt like I fit into that
category of a person of color.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.290
And it was actually
hosted by folks

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:50.490
who have Latin American roots,
and they had a very interesting

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.300
take on this too.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.276
They were quiet for a
lot of the session, a lot

00:37:53.276 --> 00:37:54.750
of the storytelling session.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:58.170
And one of them came forward and
said, I'm sorry I'm so quiet.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.670
It's because for
the first time, I'm

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.695
realizing that I
wasn't including Asian

00:38:01.695 --> 00:38:03.474
Americans in this conversation.

00:38:03.474 --> 00:38:05.640
I wasn't including them in
this conversation of what

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.770
people of color really means.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.410
And I really appreciated that
honesty and that vulnerability,

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.090
and that's something
that we believe in too.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.006
And I think it's good
for us to keep ourselves

00:38:14.006 --> 00:38:15.174
accountable and honest.

00:38:15.174 --> 00:38:17.340
And when we say Asian
American, what does that mean?

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.707
And when we say immigrant
story, what does that mean?

00:38:19.707 --> 00:38:21.540
I think it's going to
be a constant learning

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.340
opportunity for
us and a great way

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.579
for us to stay honest
with ourselves.

00:38:25.579 --> 00:38:27.120
SPEAKER 1: Do you
see that separation

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.240
of the Asian-American community
from other people of color as,

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.090
like, imposed on
us by other groups,

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:36.210
or something we
impose on ourselves?

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.700
KRYSTIE MAK: I
imagine it's both.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.522
I think there's a
lot of stereotypes

00:38:40.522 --> 00:38:41.730
about Asian Americans, right?

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:44.370
That we're quiet, that we don't
like to speak up for things,

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:48.390
we stay in the foreground--
or the background.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.250
I'm seeing every day
that that's changing.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.800
And again, there's a piece in
our Issue 01 that talks about

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.830
the political uprising of Asian
Americans where a lot of times

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:58.070
folks in the government
ignore us as a voting group.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.150
They don't think that we like
to vote, that we have a voice,

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.720
and so they oversee
us or they neglect us.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.720
You know, so some of it
may be true a little bit

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.160
where we're not maybe speaking
up as much as we would like,

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.326
but I think that's changing.

00:39:10.326 --> 00:39:12.840
And I think given the
election and this fire that's

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.540
all been lit underneath us
to do something is really

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.860
changing that course.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.620
SPEAKER 1: Tell us
a little bit about--

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.470
you chose this theme of
beginnings for the first issue.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.930
I'd love to hear a little bit
about what that means to you,

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.570
and also what you kind of see
as being the next theme going

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.080
forward.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.370
KATERINA JENG: So beginnings
was a natural theme for us,

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.570
because it was Issue 01.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:34.950
So this was sort
of the beginning

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.110
of what "Slant'd" was.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.120
But I think for a
lot of the team,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.250
"Slant'd" was a
creative outlet for us

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:42.940
to explore our own identities.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.580
I know for me
personally I grew up

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.565
in a predominantly
white community,

00:39:46.565 --> 00:39:48.690
and I didn't start thinking
about my Asian-American

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.460
identity until
after college, which

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.280
is crazy, because all
of my formative years

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.430
have already passed.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.150
So for me, "Slant'd" has
been a personal awakening

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.970
of discovering who I am
and my cultural heritage.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.730
And I think a lot of the
team was along the same vein.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.100
They were discovering
something about themselves too.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:06.850
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.950
I mean, beginnings for
me was interesting too,

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.560
because I grew up in
the opposite situation

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.990
where my neighborhood
was predominantly Asian.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.540
My high school was
64% Asian growing up.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.040
So I never felt like a minority.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.977
I went to Berkeley, which
was also full of Asians.

00:40:20.977 --> 00:40:22.810
It wasn't actually until
I moved to New York

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:26.060
about three years ago
that I felt like an other,

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.860
or I felt like a minority.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.220
Which to, I guess, not New
Yorkers seems kind of crazy,

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.535
because it's a diverse place.

00:40:32.535 --> 00:40:33.910
But you know, the
conversations I

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.326
was having with friends, a lot
of whom are in the audience

00:40:36.326 --> 00:40:38.739
today, talking about our
different experiences

00:40:38.739 --> 00:40:40.780
really made me realize
that all of our beginnings

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.270
are so different, but we
share a lot of values.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.075
And I really wanted to explore
that with this project.

00:40:46.075 --> 00:40:46.700
TESSA KU: Yeah.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.670
I think also the
theme as you'll, like,

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.707
read the pieces in
the issue, a beginning

00:40:51.707 --> 00:40:53.290
means something
different to everyone.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:57.040
So it's not even necessarily
the beginning of you,

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.037
like, welcoming your heritage
or realizing that you do fit in

00:41:01.037 --> 00:41:01.870
or you don't fit in.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:05.410
It's like, beginning to
form a tight relationship

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.200
with your mother, or like the
beginning of when you first

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.670
immigrated to America.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.110
It means something
different for everyone.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.510
And I think to be
able to explore

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.470
that was really cool to see
how everyone interpreted it.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:21.072
SPEAKER 1: Have you ever had any
negative feedback from people?

00:41:21.072 --> 00:41:21.905
KATERINA JENG: Yeah.

00:41:21.905 --> 00:41:22.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.930
Definitely.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.560
As you said, like, whether
we intend for it or not,

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.180
everything is political.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.014
So we've gotten negative
feedback about our name--

00:41:33.014 --> 00:41:34.430
KRYSTIE MAK: Pushing
the envelope.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.500
But you know, it's
not as much negative

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.000
as it is constructive criticism.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.570
So we are very open to
feedback, and we definitely

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.220
ask people that we
talk to as mentors,

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.670
as advisors, as friends to
tell us how we can up our game.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.230
And so with a
content perspective,

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.344
people really liked
how relatable it was.

00:41:50.344 --> 00:41:52.010
But they were like,
well, given how bold

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.920
your name is, could you push the
content a little bit further?

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.050
Are there any other topics
that you could explore?

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.970
And I think that's great,
because we're so new

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.830
and we're so open to evolution.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.140
And just-- we've only been
around for less than a year,

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.670
so I can only
imagine what's going

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.177
to happen in years two to five.

00:42:06.177 --> 00:42:07.010
KATERINA JENG: Yeah.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.620
And that's another thing that
I would love for "Slant'd"

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.740
to work on is the
fact that we do

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.190
get constructive criticism
shouldn't stop anyone

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.540
from talking about race.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.400
Like, it is very scary
to talk about race.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.890
You always need to be
politically correct, you

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.260
need to be educated
about what's going on,

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.780
which oftentimes prevents
people from being

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.790
open about talking about it.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:30.290
But if we don't
talk about it, we're

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.373
not going to get anywhere.

00:42:31.373 --> 00:42:33.740
So we really need to make it
more accessible for people

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.290
to talk about these
really difficult things,

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:40.850
and just be confident in where
they are in their own journeys.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.200
SPEAKER 1: Definitely.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.127
Let's take a question
from over there.

00:42:44.127 --> 00:42:45.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys so much for coming.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.220
It's truly inspiring.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.386
I will 100% be purchasing
my first issue.

00:42:49.386 --> 00:42:51.260
I was just thinking,
this is the perfect gift

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.250
for my little sister.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.010
KRYSTIE MAK: Aw!

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.445
AUDIENCE: She's also half Asian.

00:42:54.445 --> 00:42:56.303
So like, similar to me.

00:42:56.303 --> 00:42:57.030
[LAUGH]

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.946
SPEAKER 1: No, really?

00:42:57.946 --> 00:43:00.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.330
AUDIENCE: But my
question is kind

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:05.330
of about this story
gathering piece,

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.000
and how you guys
actually get stories.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.910
Do you guys just wait
for them to come in?

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.727
Do you guys put
certain posts out?

00:43:11.727 --> 00:43:15.440
And on top of that,
how does choosing

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.660
the stories to go with
a certain theme, what

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.146
is that process like?

00:43:19.146 --> 00:43:20.562
KRYSTIE MAK: You
want me to start?

00:43:20.562 --> 00:43:21.550
KATERINA JENG: Sure.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.890
KRYSTIE MAK: So you know,
like Kat said, we love Google.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.810
We literally live and
die off of Google.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.800
So we used a Google Form
to collect story ideas.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.660
A lot of the stories
actually didn't end up

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.040
the way they started,
which we think

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.330
is a really beautiful
process, and we

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.746
want to do more
of that next year,

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.840
actually workshopping
the stories with people.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.527
But we asked for an idea.

00:43:39.527 --> 00:43:41.110
We ask again for
their objective, what

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.318
they want to achieve with it.

00:43:42.318 --> 00:43:44.020
What's the key message?

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.620
And to get the word out, it
was friends, family, and fools,

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.960
and posting it in community
groups on Facebook.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.050
So going into Asian-American
interest groups,

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.340
posting on there.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.400
Project Boat, which we initially
started as a support group.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.420
Alumni networks.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.180
Basically anyone that we
thought might be interested.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.100
The first two weeks
were very slow.

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.933
We were really worried
that we weren't going

00:44:05.933 --> 00:44:07.672
to get anyone to contribute.

00:44:07.672 --> 00:44:08.380
And I don't know.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.379
Something just happened.

00:44:09.379 --> 00:44:10.400
I think word of mouth.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.320
You know, it's a very
grassroots movement.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.470
And again, like, out
of the 21 contributors,

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.740
we only knew seven
of them beforehand.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.520
So we're hoping that next year
it's probably a little bit more

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.630
strategic in that sense.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:24.590
Hopefully, our name is
a little bit out there

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:26.500
and we can come out
to events like these

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.791
and meet more people who
would be interested in sharing

00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:29.500
their stories.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:29.980
AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:30.700
Thank you.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.283
SPEAKER 1: How should
people reach you

00:44:32.283 --> 00:44:35.050
if they see this talk, for
example, on our YouTube channel

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.917
and they want to
be a part of it?

00:44:36.917 --> 00:44:37.750
KATERINA JENG: Yeah.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.480
You can visit our
website at slantd.media.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.960
And we're opening the submission
window for Issue 02 in January.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.570
So you can either sign up to
our newsletter to get an update

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:48.370
or just find us on social media.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.320
We'll be very loud
when the window opens,

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.740
so you know to come
and submit your story.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.110
SPEAKER 1: Is it all, like,
sort of personal essay pieces?

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:59.469
Or are there, like, poems,
journalistic pieces,

00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:00.260
anything like that?

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.510
KATERINA JENG: It's a variety.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:02.919
So we have short stories.

00:45:02.919 --> 00:45:03.460
Just kidding.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.626
We don't have short stories.

00:45:04.626 --> 00:45:05.815
We have short pieces.

00:45:05.815 --> 00:45:09.930
We have poetry,
photography, art.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.239
It spans all genres.

00:45:12.239 --> 00:45:14.072
KRYSTIE MAK: Anything
that could be printed.

00:45:14.072 --> 00:45:14.863
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:45:14.863 --> 00:45:15.400
[LAUGH]

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.227
What about over here?

00:45:17.227 --> 00:45:19.060
AUDIENCE: I just want
to say thank you again

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.430
for sharing your piece, Gary.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.110
Like, I was very touched by it.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.480
I'm a Chinese psychologist,
so I feel very strongly

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.000
about raising awareness
for Asian Americans.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.780
So I was wondering if
you guys have any plans

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.430
or needing contributors or ways
to kind of bring the awareness

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:37.600
to the general community.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.510
Because I think we all know
that Asian Americans tend

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.105
to solve problems
in their own house,

00:45:43.105 --> 00:45:46.740
and I think needing to reach
them is still, like-- there's

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.230
still a huge gap.

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:50.700
So I was wondering if you
have any thoughts on that.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:50.900
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.441
I mean, I think
we're exploring that.

00:45:52.441 --> 00:45:54.500
But again, we're a
creative platform,

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.426
so how could we explore
the difficult topics

00:45:56.426 --> 00:45:58.300
of mental health from
a creative perspective?

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.690
So could we host writing
workshops or town hall

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:02.920
discussions about this?

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.530
I think we can't do it alone,
and we're definitely not

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:06.460
experts in this field.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.084
So we would love to
partner with people

00:46:08.084 --> 00:46:10.240
who have experience in
the mental health space

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.630
to help us create a place
that's safe, you know,

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.880
that's relevant and
meaningful for these people.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.260
GARY YEH: Yeah, I feel
like being so involved

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.110
with the arts, I've
realized there's

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:23.110
a lot of artists and a
lot of creative types

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:24.560
that have mental illness.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.980
And I don't know if
they go hand in hand.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.310
But when I first posted
my story on Instagram,

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:32.890
I was really surprised
by the outpour,

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.497
outpouring of
support and interest

00:46:35.497 --> 00:46:36.580
in these sorts of stories.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.650
And a lot of direct
messages just saying, hey.

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:43.420
This is-- thank you
for sharing this.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.890
I've dealt with
depression myself.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.510
My sister has dealt
with depression.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:48.635
Whatever it may be, they
all had their own stories.

00:46:48.635 --> 00:46:50.500
And again, I think this
is a great platform

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.060
to actually get the word out.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.320
And with peripheral topics
like mental illness,

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.440
this is, again, a good
grounding and foundation

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.570
for those discussions

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.720
I have a couple questions
about contributing.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.990
The first one is, I just visited
an Asian-American lit class

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:14.230
at a high school yesterday,
and they were all

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:15.610
really engaging writers.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:17.170
So I want to know
if there is an age

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.840
limit to being a contributor.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.990
KATERINA JENG: We have
not put an age limit.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:25.070
It's something we
could consider,

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:29.057
but right now, anybody
is open to submitting.

00:47:29.057 --> 00:47:30.640
AUDIENCE: And then
so along with that,

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.460
does that mean that you
have to identify as Asian

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.420
American to contribute?

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.489
That might be an obvious
question, but maybe not.

00:47:38.489 --> 00:47:40.780
KATERINA JENG: So all of our
Issue 01 contributors were

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:46.030
Asian American, but we would be
open to any race contributing

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.480
as long as it aligns with
our mission and aligns with

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.854
the theme of Issue 02.

00:47:50.854 --> 00:47:52.270
TESSA KU: Yeah, I
think it depends

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:53.050
on what the narrative is.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:53.800
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.040
KATERINA JENG: Yeah.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:55.690
KRYSTIE MAK: And
I think too, you

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.270
know, you bring up a good point
about talking to potentially

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.559
a younger audience.

00:47:59.559 --> 00:48:01.600
The team struggled too
with trying to figure out,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.830
who is our target audience?

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:05.006
You know, Asian
American is so big.

00:48:05.006 --> 00:48:06.880
So millennials were
obviously an easy target,

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.129
because we're all millennials.

00:48:08.129 --> 00:48:11.170
But there are so many
interesting stories coming out

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.905
from high schoolers
and even younger.

00:48:12.905 --> 00:48:15.280
And so how could we go into
universities and high schools

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.696
to have this kind
of conversation?

00:48:16.696 --> 00:48:19.100
So we would be really
interested in meeting people

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.860
in the younger
demographic to see what

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.090
issues they're dealing with.

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.789
And how could we give
them a space share that?

00:48:24.789 --> 00:48:25.330
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.240
Thanks for being here, and
good luck on all the work

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.080
you're going to be doing.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.250
So the topic about
translating submissions

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.320
reminded me a story
of-- my grandfather

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.140
started an academic journal
in Korea about, I guess,

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.710
nearly 50 years ago now.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:43.450
And when he started it, he
just simply wanted people

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:47.260
to submit articles written in
English so that people outside

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.420
of Korea, academics outside
of Korea could read it

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.790
and understand what's going on.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.050
So I guess it just brought
one thing is that there's

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.760
so many different
Asian, I guess,

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.260
American languages that English
just happens to be something

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.500
that is in common.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:08.050
So I guess sometimes things
get lost in translation.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.150
Maybe if the
submission is written

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:14.410
in the language they're
most comfortable with,

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.320
that might be ideal.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.770
But I guess for maybe
the majority of people,

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:20.590
it would be, I
guess, just English.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:23.260
And the second
question, do you guys

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.930
do anything with the
museums, like the Museum

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.517
of Chinese in America and
things like that in the city?

00:49:28.517 --> 00:49:29.350
KATERINA JENG: Yeah.

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.270
We actually had our launch
party at the Museum of Chinese

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.126
in America, and we're
stocked there as well.

00:49:33.126 --> 00:49:34.750
And we're definitely
looking to partner

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.856
with other museums and other
Asian-American organizations.

00:49:37.856 --> 00:49:38.606
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah.

00:49:38.606 --> 00:49:40.900
And [INAUDIBLE],, what
was your first question?

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.090
AUDIENCE: Oh, it wasn't
more of a question.

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:42.410
KRYSTIE MAK: Oh, just a comment?

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.868
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
about-- yeah.

00:49:43.868 --> 00:49:45.572
Just like similarly,
my grandfather

00:49:45.572 --> 00:49:47.530
also started I guess
something like a zine back

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:48.238
in the day also--

00:49:48.238 --> 00:49:49.210
[LAUGH]

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.645
--for political
science articles.

00:49:50.645 --> 00:49:52.020
It's called the
"Korea Observer."

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.020
KRYSTIE MAK: "Korea Observer."

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.186
AUDIENCE: And it's, like,
you know, all the articles

00:49:55.186 --> 00:49:56.560
in English so that his--

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.060
because he wanted
the audience to be

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.760
broader than just
people in Korea

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.170
just so everybody across
the world could read.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.480
TESSA KU: I think the
topic of translation

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.090
is really interesting and
obviously, something that we're

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:08.110
excited about exploring.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.810
But we want to be
able to do it right.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.060
You know, we want to be able
to do the pieces justice.

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.260
Because if it is lost
in translation, then

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.100
what's the point in doing it?

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.600
AUDIENCE: Good luck
with everything.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.102
GROUP: Thank you.

00:50:21.102 --> 00:50:24.230
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:28.490
I think we didn't actually touch
on thoughts for the next issue.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:29.690
KRYSTIE MAK: Oh.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.830
Yeah.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:33.740
Funny you ask, because we
just had our kick-off over

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.710
the weekend to start
thinking about Issue 02.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.430
We haven't narrowed
down a theme yet,

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.550
but our creative team did a
really great job in the prompt.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:44.040
So the prompt was
wishes and wonders.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.600
So thinking about
reflecting on this past year

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.876
or almost a year, what do
we wish we had covered?

00:50:49.876 --> 00:50:51.500
What are we wondering
about still today

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.640
about race and identity?

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.860
And there were a whole
swath of different options.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.460
We had stuff that was very
universal to like what

00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.907
they call the dark horse theme.

00:50:59.907 --> 00:51:00.990
KATERINA JENG: Very niche.

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:02.030
KRYSTIE MAK: Very niche.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:03.065
Very, very specific.

00:51:03.065 --> 00:51:05.770
A little bit controversial.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:06.450
I think-- huh?

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.200
TESSA KU: Ear wax.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:07.530
KRYSTIE MAK: Ear wax.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:08.164
[LAUGH]

00:51:08.164 --> 00:51:08.830
SPEAKER 1: What?

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:09.000
KRYSTIE MAK: Yeah.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.600
So it's a wide
range, and I think

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.433
we're going to land
somewhere in the middle.

00:51:13.433 --> 00:51:16.940
I think we want a theme that's
universal enough that people

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.950
can interpret on their
own and make it their own,

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:22.029
but we also want something
that's not generic.

00:51:22.029 --> 00:51:23.570
KATERINA JENG: And
I think two things

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.637
that we're looking for
in this next round is,

00:51:26.637 --> 00:51:28.970
as Krystie mentioned, pushing
the envelope a little bit.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.680
So because these are
everyday stories,

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.530
how can we elevate them and
make sure that they're worth

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:37.670
the buzz and worth sparking
those larger conversations?

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.440
And another thing is making
things a bit lighter.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:48.080
So Issue 01 leaned on the more
heavier side, which is normal,

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.280
because the experiences that
we face as Asian Americans are

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.210
on the heavier side.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.090
But how can we bring a
sense of fun and playfulness

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:59.570
back into talking about
these really heavy topics?

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:01.670
Will be interesting
for us to explore.

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:02.900
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, definitely.

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.980
We're almost at time.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.510
So my last question
is going to be,

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.820
we obviously want to sell some
of those magazines in the back,

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.320
you guys.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:14.139
How would you pitch the magazine
to a non-Asian audience?

00:52:14.139 --> 00:52:14.930
KATERINA JENG: Ooh.

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:15.929
That's a great question.

00:52:15.929 --> 00:52:16.640
[LAUGH]

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:23.890
TESSA KU: I mean, I feel like
part of the appeal is that

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:24.740
it's--

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:25.240
don't know.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.620
Like, I'm not
explaining myself right.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.040
But I think that--

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:33.430
so my in-laws are not Asian,
but they were just so excited

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:36.660
that I was doing something
like this with my friends

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.920
that they were, like,
telling all their friends,

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.570
and they were buying
all these books.

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:43.540
And I think that just
the fact that it's

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:47.950
part of a movement that has
pieces that everyone can relate

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:50.680
to, I think everyone can
relate to at some point

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.050
feeling like they
don't belong somewhere

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.880
or wishing that
they were different

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.950
or connecting to their heritage.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:01.390
I think that everyone has
some sort of connection

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:06.760
with what we're doing, which,
in a way, helps sell itself.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.290
KRYSTIE MAK: I think it's
anchored in human emotion.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:11.080
You know, there's
themes about sacrifice,

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.580
about love, about
realization, actualization.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.170
Like, these are themes
that transcend race.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:20.380
So I would say it's just a
fun, creative outlet for people

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.900
to read stories and learn
something about themselves

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.814
or learn something
about another culture.

00:53:24.814 --> 00:53:26.980
And who doesn't want to do
that in this day and age,

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:27.896
given what's going on?

00:53:27.896 --> 00:53:29.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:30.970
KATERINA JENG:
Thanks for having us.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:31.570
KRYSTIE MAK: Thank you.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:32.470
Thank you so much!

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.320
