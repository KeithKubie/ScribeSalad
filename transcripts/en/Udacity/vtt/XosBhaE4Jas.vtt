00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.785
This is actually pretty easy when you get down to it. First off we check

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:06.120
whether or not physics body exists for this object. If it does, we continue

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.242
forward by calling GetPosition object. And then caching it so that we can

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:13.190
render with it later. Note that the position object has an x and y parameters

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.132
to it. Which identically matches the x and y parameters in the vector given to

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:21.216
us from the collision system. Having these two match up, allows us to pass

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:24.480
positions and vectors back and forth between the physics engine and our game

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.530
code quite easily.
