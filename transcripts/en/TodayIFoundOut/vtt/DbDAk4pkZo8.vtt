00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:26.070
To

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.369
begin with, it should probably be noted that
the name “bulletproof vest” is a misnomer

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.870
with “bullet resistant vest” being more
apt.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.239
Or to quote John Geshay, marketing director
for body armor company Safariland, "...nothing

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.150
can be bulletproof, not even a manhole cover.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.580
In an extremely small percentage of cases,
a round can even go through a vest that it

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.189
is rated to stop.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.720
The round itself could have an extra serration
on it or something."

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.780
Furthermore, body armor designed to protect
the wearer from high caliber guns can still

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.250
be penetrated or compromised by smaller caliber
bullets.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.530
For example, armor designed to stop a round
from a .44 Magnum (the kind of round Dirty

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.820
Harry claims can blow a man’s head clean
off) could theoretically be pierced by a 9mm

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.990
round if the latter is fired with a high enough
muzzle velocity, with distance to the target

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.350
also playing a role.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.690
Or as Police Magazine notes, “There's a
tendency among gun enthusiasts to dismiss

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.400
the lethal potential of certain calibers of
handguns.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.400
Don't believe it.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.180
A small round traveling at high speed can
punch through body armor.”

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.130
Similarly, in part because shot from shotgun
shells have highly varying velocities, shotguns

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.720
are deemed very dangerous even to otherwise
extremely robust body armor.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.080
That's not to mention, of course, that even
should the vest do its job, the spread out

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.580
nature of the shot gives a higher probability
of unprotected areas being hit as well.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.780
With that preamble out of the way, let's discuss
the differing levels of protection offered

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.100
by various types of body armor and how many
times they can be shot before they stop offering

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.150
an acceptable level of defense.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.970
In the United States most all body armor is
ranked according to standards set by the National

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.190
Institute of Justice, or the NIJ, with their
ratings pretty much considered the gold standard

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.730
the world over in regards to levels of ballistic
protection offered by a given piece of armor.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.450
As for those ratings, the NIJ assigns a generalised
level rating between 1 and 4 to all kinds

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.450
of armor.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.160
In the most basic sense, the higher the level
of the armor, the more protection it provides.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.470
For example, a rating of anywhere from Level
1 through 3a will stop bullets fired from

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.900
the majority of handguns.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.170
For comfort's sake, body armor at these levels
are usually made from some sort of soft fiber

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.780
material, such as Kevlar, though at the higher
levels may use additional materials.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.340
On the extreme end, level 4 armor is the only
kind capable of potentially stopping armor

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.319
piercing rounds, and is usually made of some
hard material, sometimes with a soft material

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.260
like Kevlar reinforcing it.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.400
On that note, although all kinds of armor
are held to the same standards by the NIJ,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.300
a distinction is drawn between “hard”
and “soft” types.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.330
For anyone unfamiliar with the terms, “soft”
body armor is usually created by weaving ultra-strong

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.959
fibres together in a web-like pattern, with
the armor stopping bullets much in the same

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.819
way a net slows and stops some object like
a baseball, distributing the force over a

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.550
larger area in the process.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.599
“Hard” body armor on the other hand is
usually created by inserting solid plates

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.160
of either ceramic or special plastic into
a vest or other housing.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.430
Although hard armor generally provides more
protection than soft armor, it has its own

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.730
shortcomings that need to be considered.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.100
For example, ceramic armor plates are often
only designed to protect the area around the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.600
heart and lungs owing to the drawback of hindered
maneuverability if covering over other areas,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.900
as well as the fact that they are relatively
heavy, with a 10 by 12 inch plate typically

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.500
weighing about 7 or 8 pounds.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.030
So a combined front and back plate weight
of roughly 15 pounds or 7 kilograms even when

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.900
just protecting the heart and lung area.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.330
This all finally brings us around to how many
bullets a piece of body armor can absorb before

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.629
it is rendered useless.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.819
Well, as you might imagine given how many
different types of body armor there are out

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.769
there, this depends.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.269
For example, on the extreme end we found some
manufacturers who claimed their Level III

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.329
body armors were capable of taking literally
hundreds of rounds before failing.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.880
As for some general examples, we'll start
with soft armor.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.970
The moment these are hit by a bullet, the
fibers around the area of impact are compromised

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.330
and lose some of their ability to absorb and
dissipate the energy of a bullet.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.060
Thus, if another shot were to hit reasonably
close to where the first hit, the bullet has

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.910
a good chance of penetrating, even if the
vest would have normally been able to handle

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.910
it fine.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.440
Thus, while it is possible they can take multiple
hits in some cases, and even be rated for

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.780
such, depending on the caliber of bullet,
way the armor was made, etc. it's generally

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.890
deemed unsafe to rely on this.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.330
Moving on to ceramic plate armor, in most
cases these plates are designed to shatter

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.470
when hit by a bullet, dissipating the force
of the impact via breaking up the bullet so

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.800
that the smaller pieces can be absorbed by
some backing material like Kevlar or some

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.450
form of polymer or sometimes both.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.610
However, a side effect of this is that a large
portion of the plate is then completely useless

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.640
against a second shot similar to our previous
example with soft armor.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.630
That said, there are types of ceramic armor
that are designed to take multiple rounds,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.699
just, again, relying on this is generally
considered unwise in most cases.

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.580
And certainly with armor piercing rounds and
level IV ceramic armor, the NIJ only requires

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.419
it to work for one shot to receive that rating,
though manufacturers do their own testing

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.620
and we did find examples of companies that
claimed to exceed that with their level IV

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.970
ceramic armor, even with armor piercing rounds.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.080
This brings us to polyethylene armor plating.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.680
In this case the impact of the bullet actually
melts the plate which then re-hardens, trapping

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.889
the bullet within it.

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.070
Due to this, polyethylene armor can survive
being shot numerous times without losing its

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.389
ballistic integrity and we found examples
of manufacturers that claimed their polyethylene

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.949
armor could take hundreds of rounds before
failing.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.500
Polyethylene plates also have the advantage
of being roughly half the weight of ceramic

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.009
for the same level of protection.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.320
Hybrid body armor is also quite common at
the higher levels, meaning your mileage may

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.580
vary from a given piece of body armor to another,
with the NIJ's ratings giving a decent overview

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.169
of what it's capable of and often the manufacturer's
testing giving even more insight onto how

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.710
many rounds of a given type of bullet the
vest can take before failure.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.650
All this said, again, while a given piece
of body armor may pass the tests and even

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.150
be claimed by the manufacturer to protect
against much more, most manufacturers recommend

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.110
replacing body armor even after a single shot.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.250
And, beyond that, even in some cases if you
just drop your armor on the floor.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.530
This is because although body armor is designed
to stop bullets, some types are surprisingly

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.530
fragile.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.360
For example, ceramic plates can easily crack
if dropped, sometimes in ways that aren't

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.640
visible to the naked eye.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.350
Moving on to soft body armor, stretching or
deforming the fibers in some way, again in

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.880
ways that are sometimes not obvious to the
naked eye, also can compromise their integrity.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.300
Some manufacturers even advise replacing Kevlar-based
body armor if you just get it wet as this

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.030
potentially weakens the fibers.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.250
On that note, because daily, otherwise innocuous,
activities can sometimes compromise body armor,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.240
the standard in the body armor industry (set
by the NIJ) is also to replace a given vest

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.641
a maximum of every 5 years, even if it's never
been hit by a bullet.

00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:19.750
Bonus Fact:
• For the fashionably minded individual

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.720
who might need some protection from getting
shot, it turns out bulletproof suits are not

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:33.340
just a thing in the movies, but a real product
that makes military and police body armor

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:41.669
look like something made from an era when
hitching up your covered wagon to go to the

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:48.830
market was a thing.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:09:26.350
Perhaps the

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:32.199
most famous manufacturer of these is the Colombian
company Miguel Caballero, founded in 1992

00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:34.869
by, you guessed it, a guy named Miguel Caballero.

00:09:34.869 --> 00:09:39.600
What exact materials he uses to make his line
of bullet proof clothing isn't clear, though

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.420
he states it's a "hybrid between nylon and
polyester".

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.619
The advantage of his material is it is significantly
lighter and thinner than Kevlar at equivalent

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:49.619
protection levels.

00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:53.239
And, indeed, if you go check our their website,
their undershirt body armor looks pretty much

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:57.230
like any other undershirt unless you look
really closely.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.350
As for price tag, this isn't listed on the
website, but it would appear a basic suit

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:07.699
top made by the company will run you upwards
of about $20,000-$30,000, though you can get

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:11.610
other product, such as an undershirt for less,
apparently starting at around $4,000.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.540
Funny enough, one of Caballero's favorite
ways to advertise is in fact to put the clothing

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.759
on someone and then personally shoot them,
leading to the company's slogan, "I was shot

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:26.839
by Miguel Caballero" with apparently a few
hundred people shot by the man himself to

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:27.839
date.

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:31.449
They even have a youtube channel where you
can go and see him shoot his wife in the stomach.

00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:35.529
Not just stopping bullets, some of Caballero's
product are also rated to stop knives, be

00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:37.779
fireproof, waterproof, etc.

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:42.249
Essentially, think the type of snazzy and
robust clothing seen in most spy movies and

00:10:42.249 --> 00:10:59.729
that's pretty accurate in 
this case.
