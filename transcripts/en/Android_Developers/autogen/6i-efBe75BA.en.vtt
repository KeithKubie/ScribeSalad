00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:11.540
 RAMZI RIZK: The four of us who 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.335
 the company was founded, is essentially a photographer. 

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:15.780
 And when we met in 2010, 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.530
 was the first thing we did, 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.680
 to initiate a photography competition. 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.170
 This was the world's first mobile photography exhibition, 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.830
 and we realized we had something bite 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.910
 which is much bigger than we thought. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.880
 And it became clear that there 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.155
 potential was to build a company. 

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:34.010
 EyeEm is essentially a community. 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.050
 It's a photographer community. 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.352
 This is a way for you to take photos, process them, 

00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:41.327
 share them and get lots of feedback. 

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:41.910
 You can learn. 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.451
 You can become a better photographer. 

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:46.597
 It also has quite a wide range of discovery features 

00:00:46.597 --> 00:00:49.804
 which in one way or another lets you discover people and people 

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:52.345
 on the kind of photos you take and the kind of interests 

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:53.310
 what you have. 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.350
 It's about the beauty of photography. 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.850
 It's about photography in its purest form. 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.329
 MATIAS CASTELLO: Design is a big, big part of what we do. 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.870
 And the photos are not created by us. 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.340
 So what we are trying to build and design, 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.500
 is a canvas for any photo to look at its best. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.850
 We've made several changes to make our program easier, 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.200
 to simplify the experience. 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.080
 And it definitely adds to our interaction metric. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.180
 The most visible one is probably the menu. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170
 We have removed several items from the navigation 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.129
 to make it clearer what EyeEm is about. 

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:25.670
 Now you have access to the three main parts of the program, which 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.200
 our Discover stream is to discover new content 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.940
 and content published around you; 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.690
 your friends stream is where you are 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.023
 Find all the photos of your friends and the photographers you 

00:01:35.023 --> 00:01:37.860
 follow; and Missions are photo competitions where people 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.880
 post photos on a particular topic, and then win prizes, and 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.250
 published. 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.560
 They are now increasing between 50% and 80% more 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.570
 Friends and Discover in as before. 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.760
 And Missions saw an increase of more than 100% in access. 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.150
 We also saw an increase in people participating 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.130
 to Missions thanks to the way we restructured the data. 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.000
 One of the other additions we made to the Android app 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.020
 to make photographers' lives easier, 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.800
 is to improve the Camera button and interact with it. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.450
 You can tap on the Camera button. 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.120
 It will fetch your most recent pictures, 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.500
 No matter where they come from. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.170
 And you also have the option to use or access your camera 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.500
 to get to the whole gallery. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.580
 By doing all this a single act, 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.650
 We saw a 73% increase in people entering our camera. 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.910
 We also saw increments throughout people watching photos 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.737
 edit with EyeEm and also upload photos. 

00:02:27.737 --> 00:02:30.320
 To design different screen sizes and different resolutions 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.870
 is not as difficult as people usually pretend. 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.520
 The Android guidelines help you navigate through the different 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.810
 formats - whether it's phones or tablets, portrait 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.170
 or landscape - and definitely acts as a guide, 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.900
 and help you customize your design and the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.560
 feature sets that you have for different screen sizes. 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.820
 We think it's important to follow Android design guidelines, 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.280
 since that's what people expect when 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.720
 they are on the Android platform. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.282
 It is important to keep those patterns in mind 

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:58.990
 and also to put them first, because it is 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.520
 the easiest way for people to know how to use your program. 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.280
 RAMZI RIZK: What started out as a renovation, we basically have 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.795
 the whole program is stripped off. 

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:09.890
 And this has led to a much more photo-centric experience, 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.690
 a much more simplified experience, 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.892
 a much faster experience. 

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.720
 We've seen extensive interaction, and retention, 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.170
 and use throughout every single metric 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.070
 what we have. 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.120
