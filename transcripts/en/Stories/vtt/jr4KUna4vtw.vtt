LAURA LING: I'm in Dar
Es Salaam, Tanzania.

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:08.050
And everywhere we
go, we see people

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.740
carrying some crazy
things on their heads.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.402

it is very impressive.

things on their head.

LAURA LING: It's
part of the culture.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.449

Most people in this town
don't have electricity,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.510
so they come here
for entertainment.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.480
