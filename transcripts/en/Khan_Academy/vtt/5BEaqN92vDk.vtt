00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:09.250
All right, we're on problem
125 on page 288.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.290
If r and s are positive
integers, is r/s an integer?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.590
Is r/s an integer?

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.640
So that's really just another
way of saying, is s

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.010
divisible into r?

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.130
So let's see what the
statements are.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.990
Statement 1.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.290
Every factor of s is
also a factor of r.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.700
That answers our question.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:41.990
Every factor of s
is factor of r.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.780
Well, let me ask
you a question.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.700
What is the largest
factor of s?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.270
The largest factor of s is s.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.860
So this statement tells us that
since s is a factor of s,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.260
that s is also going to
be a factor of r.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.060
And something being a factor of
something means that it's

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.950
divisible into it.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.290
So that means that s is
divisible into r.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.459
So this means that r/s
is an integer.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.550
So it answers our question.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.480
So statement 1, alone,
is sufficient.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.410
Statement 2 tells us, every
prime factor of s is also a

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.460
prime factor of r.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.540
Every prime factor-- so let me
think of-- Immediately, I can

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.170
think of a case where that
doesn't hold up.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.520
Where I could have every prime
factor being a factor of r.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.132
So let's say s is equal to 4.

00:01:34.132 --> 00:01:38.300
And its prime factorization
is 2 times 2.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.570
And let's say that
R is equal to 6.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.030
And its prime factorization
is 2 times 3.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.820
So we have a case here where
every factor, every prime

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.790
factor of s, is a prime
factor of R.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.360
The only prime factor
of s is 2.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.170
And that's a prime
factor of R.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.770
But if we were to say R/s,
R/s would be 6/4,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.860
which is not an integer.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.180
So even though these satisfy
the second condition, this

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.080
isn't an integer.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.949
But then I could have-- instead
of making R equal to

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.820
6, I could've made
R equal to 4.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.140
Sorry, I could have made R is
equal to 8, which is equal to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.010
2 times 2 times 2.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040
And in this case, it would
have been an integer.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.340
R/s would be equal to 8/4,
which is equal to 2.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.950
So statement 2, really doesn't
give us information as to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.180
whether r/s is an integer.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.860
So statement 1, alone,
is sufficient.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.090
Next problem.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.410
Switch colors.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.750
126.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.090
If z to the n is equal to 1,
what is the value of z?

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.850
z equals what?

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.270
So statement 1 tells us,
n is a nonzero integer.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.642
n does not equal to 0.

00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:01.300
So let's think about this.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.160
For something to some power
to be equal to 1, what do

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.660
we know about it?

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.460
Well, if anything to the 0th
power is equal to 1, but they

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.750
just told us that
it's nonzero.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.240
So we can't use this
condition.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.630
So that actually does restrict
z a good bit.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.860
So if n is a nonzero number,
what can I raise to the power

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.390
to equal 1?

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.760
Well, clearly 1, right?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.290
1 to anything is going
to be equal to 1.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.240
But what other?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.990
Well, there's also the
possibility of negative

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.200
numbers, right?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.440
Negative 1 to the nth power is
equal to 1, if n is even.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.430
And I think these are the only
two, if we take imaginary

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.370
numbers out of the picture.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.420
And I think, on the GMAT, we
assume that we don't have any

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.800
imaginary numbers.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.760
So assuming that, the only--
If we know that n does not

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.190
equal 0 and z to the n is
equal to 1, the only

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.480
possibilities that this allows
for is that z is equal to 1 or

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.470
negative 1.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.330
And if it's negative 1,
then n would have

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.990
to be an even number.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.220
But they didn't restrict
that yet.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.230
So statement 1, by itself,
it helps us.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.330
But it doesn't actually give
us enough information.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.910
We can just narrow it down to
z being 1 or negative 1.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.019
Let's see what statement
2 tells us.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.210
Statement 2 tells us,
z is greater than 0.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.650
So that, by itself, is
useless information.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.140
Because if z is greater than
0 and n can be 0, right?

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.550
We're assuming we don't
have statement 1 yet.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.300
So if z is greater than 0 and
n could be 0, z could be a

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.090
hundred to the 0th power.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.000
z could be a hundred
and that equals 1.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.110
z could be 99 to the
0th power, and that

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.810
could be equal to 1.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.800
So z could be anything to the
0th power as long as it's

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.500
greater than 0.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.000
So this, by itself,
doesn't help us.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.300
But if we use statement 2 and
statement 1 in conjunction,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.570
then it's interesting.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.010
Because statement 1 essentially
told us that z has

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.670
to be 1 or negative 1.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.830
Statement 2 tells us, z has
to be greater than 0.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.450
So if you use both the
conditions combined, it forces

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.610
us to say, well, then z has
to be equal to positive 1.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.990
Because negative 1 is
not greater than 0.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.670
So both statements combined
are sufficient

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.080
to answer this question.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.690
Next problem.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.040
127.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.970
OK, so they've written
this thing.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:33.100
They write, s is equal
2/n, all of that

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.140
over 1/x plus 2/3x.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.930
And they say in the expression
above, if xn does not equal

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.170
0-- so essentially saying that
neither x nor n is 0.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.770
What is the value of s?

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.120
s is equal to what?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.400
So even before looking at the
statements, I just want to

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.160
simplify this.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.770
Just because it's too
complex right now.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.210
So let's see.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.580
This is equal to 2/n
over-- let's see.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.650
You have a common
denominator 3x.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.950
Let's see.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.050
This is 3 over 3x.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.040
That's the same thing as 1/x.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.370
Plus 2.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:18.130
So that equals 2/n over
5/3x, which is equal

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.900
to 2/n times 3x/5.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.190
Which is equal to 6x/5n.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.250
That's a much more pleasing
thing to look at and try to

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.440
get your brain around.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.680
So statement 1 tells us,
x is equal to 2n.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.580
So if x is equal to 2n, let's
just substitute that into this

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.330
statement for s.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.190
Then, s would be equal to 6
times x, which we know is

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.700
equal to 2n.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.940
Divided by 5n.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.710
n's cancel out.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.365
So it equals 12/5.

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:58.180
So statement 1, alone,
is sufficient

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.850
to answer this question.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.700
Statement 2 tells us that
n is equal to 1/2.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.670
Well, that's fairly useless.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.180
Because this is what we
simplified s down to.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.090
If we put 1/2 here, then
we get s is equal to 6x

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.150
over 5 times 1/2.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.930
so that's 5/2.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.050
I can simplify this more, but we
still don't know what x is.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.620
You can't cancel the x's
out or anything.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.050
This, alone, doesn't
help you at all.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.400
So the answer is statement
1, alone, is sufficient.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.850
And statement 2, by itself,
is fairly useless.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.670
Problem 128.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.640
If x is an integer, is x times--
I think that says the

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.150
absolute-- it's kind
of strange to

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.700
look at it like that.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.420
But they're saying, is x times
the absolute value

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.810
of x less than 2x?

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.770
And they tell us that
x is an integer.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.500
OK, statement 1 tells us
that x is less than 0.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.550
So how does that help us?

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:08.620
If x is less than 0, then this
on the right-hand side is

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.220
going to be less than 0.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.490
And this will also
be less than 0.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.720
Because you'll have
a negative number

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.620
times a positive number.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.870
They'll both be less than 0.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.450
If we make x is equal to
negative 1, then this would

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.620
not-- then this will
not be true.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.690
Because you'll have negative
1 times 1.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.659
So you'll have 1 is less
than negative 2.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.140
Sorry, you'd have negative 1
times 1, which is negative 1.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.179
Which is less than 2,
which is not true.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.140
It's not less than 2.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.830
Or, if x was less than negative
2, if x was negative

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.310
3, then you would have
negative 3 times 3.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.330
Because the absolute value
of negative 3.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.980
So you would have minus 9 is
less than minus 3 times 2.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.080
Minus 6.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.220
This is true.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.510
So just this condition, alone,
doesn't get us there.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.430
Because I can still pick an x
that meets this condition.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.380
And depending on whether I make
that x greater than or

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.100
less than negative 2, I can
make this true or not.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.520
So statement 1, by itself,
isn't enough.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.510
Statement 2 tells us, x
is equal to minus 10.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.400
Well, this is an easy one.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.540
We can just test it.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.240
So if we have minus 10 times
the absolute value of minus

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.550
10, and we're going to test
whether that's less than 2

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.910
times minus 10.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.960
So the absolute value of--
So this is minus 10 times

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.330
positive 10.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.120
So it's minus 100, which
is less than minus 20.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.380
Which is completely true.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.530
So statement 2, alone,
is sufficient

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.110
to answer this question.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.710
And I'm almost out of
time, so I'll see

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.530
you in the next video.
