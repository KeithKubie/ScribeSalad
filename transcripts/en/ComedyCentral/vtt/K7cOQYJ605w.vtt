00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.508

- Oh.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.876 align:start size:78% position:22%
- You'll like it, though.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.244 align:end position:100%
It's very cool and stressful
and cool.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.346 align:start position:0%
- You like murder?
Me too.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.515
- [laughs]

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.016
<i> - It's 1924.</i>

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:18.851
<i> Maurine Dallas Watkins,</i>

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.420
<i> she's just graduated
 from Yale,</i>

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.988
<i> and then she was like,
 "You know what?</i>

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.290
<i> [bleep] this.
 I want to tell the truth."</i>

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:26.926
<i> She moves to Chicago,
 this town of jazz...</i>

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:28.327
<i> - Jazz.
 - Drink.</i>

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.430
<i> - Drink.
 - Crime.</i>

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.598
<i> And she started working
 for the "Chicago Tribune."</i>

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.901
<i> And she was like, "Yeah."
 - [laughs]</i>

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.303
<i> - "I got a job
 at the 'Chicago Tribune,'</i>

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:42.341
<i> and I'm gonna investigate
 what I gotta investigate."</i>

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:45.111 align:end position:100%
- That's what she really
wanted to do.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.547
- Hell, yeah.
- Right?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.949
<i> - And then she comes upon
 this editor, who is a man.</i>

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:53.052
<i> The editor was like, "Maurine,
 I'm going to assign you</i>

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.422
<i> to the Cooks County Jail
 Murderous Row,</i>

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:59.926
<i> which is where they keep the
 women who are awaiting trial."</i>

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.727
<i> And he was like,
 "You're a woman.</i>

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.897
<i> "Nobody else wants to report
 on this shit.</i>

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.568
<i> "It's a little boring
 for our male reporters.</i>

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.437
<i> "I care about the goods.</i>

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.439
<i> So give me the goods, baby."</i>

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.508
<i> - And she was like,
 "I got you, bitch.</i>

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.610 line:0%
<i> I got you."</i>

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:20.413 line:0%
<i> She goes to Murderous Row
 in Cooks County Jail.</i>

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:24.217
<i> She meets Sabella Nitti,
 an Italian immigrant</i>

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.552
<i> who is accused
 of murdering her husband.</i>

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.287
<i> She says, "He hurt me.</i>

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.657
<i> I-I did kill him,
 but because he hurt me."</i>

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.993
<i> And Maurine is like,
 "This is it."</i>

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:36.329
<i> Maurine went to her editor
 and was like,</i>

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.831
<i> "I heard about Sabella Nitti."</i>

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:41.033
<i> And he was like, "No, bitch.</i>

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.870
<i> Like, I don't care
 about Sabella Nitti."</i>

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.939 align:end position:100%
The problem was, he wanted
something juicy, this editor.

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.841
- Loves juice.
- He said to her, "Look.

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:52.145
<i> "I need you to bring me
 something juicy as hell.</i>

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.347
<i> Really, like, get excited
 about Murderous Row."</i>

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.715 align:end position:100%
Like, you can say
some sexy shit.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.885 align:start size:69% position:31%
Like, you can, like...

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.219 size:84% position:58%
Yeah, you know what I mean?

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.755
- [laughs]
- [laughs]

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.891
<i> And then all of a sudden,</i>

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.626
<i> Belva Gaertner is arrested.</i>

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.629
<i> She was a cabaret dancer.</i>

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:14.066
<i> She was like, "Yes, my lover
 was found sprawled out,</i>

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.971
<i> dead, as hell, across
 the front seat of a car."</i>

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:21.507
<i> She was like, "Look,
 I'm just a woman,</i>

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.846
<i> and I was basically possessed
 by the devil, which is jazz."</i>

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.982
<i> Meanwhile, Maurine was like,
 "Oh, my God. Yes, yes, yes.</i>

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:32.852
<i> "This is exactly what I need
 to make my career.</i>

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.454
<i> "I love goss.
 I love juice.</i>

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.323
<i> My editor's gonna
 eat this up."</i>

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.725
<i> - Yeah. So that was
 her first big break.</i>

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:42.461
So then, within, like, I don't
even know how many minutes.

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.664
- Not many.
- Not many.

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:49.035 align:end position:100%
She gets this other lady,
Beulah Annan.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.671
<i> - Mm-hmm.
 - And Beulah Annan's arrested.</i>

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:55.274
<i> She has had a lover's spat.</i>

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:57.810
<i> - And they both reach
 for a pistol,</i>

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:01.347 align:start position:0%
and [bleep] our babe, Beulah,
was like, "Whew! Pow!"

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.015
<i> - [laughs]</i>

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:05.017
<i> - And while he was laying
 on the floor,</i>

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.153
<i> she played "Hula-Lu,"
 and she danced</i>

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.754
<i> around his grave, and she made</i>

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:11.424
<i> multiple cocktails,
 and she drank them.</i>

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:17.463
<i> Beulah said, "I was taken
 ahold of by drinking alcohol</i>

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:20.800
<i> and listening to jazz music,
 and like [bleep] me, I guess."</i>

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.301
<i> - It was just, like,
 a bunch of bullshit.</i>

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:24.737
<i> But Maurine is like,
 "Oh, my God,</i>

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.606
<i> I'm getting the juice
 that my editor</i>

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.507
<i> asked me for.</i>

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.376
<i> Hell, yes."</i>

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.411
<i> - The newspaper comes out,
 and these women realize</i>

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:34.614
<i> right away,
 "We have got to look good,</i>

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.583
<i> because that's what this shit
 is about, is looking good."</i>

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.619
<i> And they're like,
 "If I cut my hair</i>

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.755
<i> and I do my mascara right,"
 "And I do my eyeliner right,"</i>

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.257
<i> "And I move my hips right,"</i>

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.125
<i> "And I cry
 at the right moment,"</i>

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:50.596
<i> "They are not going to
 convict... [hiccups] ...me."</i>

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.765
<i> - So they start
 a beauty school</i>

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:54.533
<i> within Murderous Row.</i>

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.068
<i> - Did they call it anything?</i>

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:59.105
- They called it
MurderousRowBeautySchool.com.

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.606
<i> They were ahead of their time.</i>

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.508 align:start size:56% position:44%
And they're, like,
taking these women

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:04.377
<i> that are, like, "Ha-ha,
 I just [bleep] ripped</i>

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.678
<i> somebody's head off
 yesterday,"</i>

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.879
<i> and they're like, "I know,</i>

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:08.614
<i> but, like, sit down, sweetie."</i>

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.951
- These women are actually
incredibly intelligent,

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:14.654
<i> because they know
 how to work their angle</i>

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:17.590
and they're like...
[hiccups]

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:19.992
Um... I forget.

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:23.963
[laughs]

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:27.433
So, it's 1924 and Maurine goes
to Murderess Row

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:31.437
<i> and she interviews the girls
 before they go to trial.</i>

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.440
<i> - They were like, "I'm sorry,
 but we love jazz and drink."</i>

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:38.377
<i> "We love ourselves.
 We love to do the thing."</i>

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.179
<i> And they were like,
 "A woman would never</i>

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:42.181
<i> "kill a man,
 because a man would never</i>

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:44.884
<i> mean enough to a woman for her
 to just murder somebody."</i>

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.919
<i> - Obviously!</i>

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:49.522
<i> - And Maurine is like, "These
 women are obviously guilty.</i>

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.490
<i> "The evidence is laid out
 on the table.</i>

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:53.025
<i> These women are guilty."</i>

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:54.593
<i> But she didn't care
 about that.</i>

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:56.262
<i> So she's, like, writing
 these stories</i>

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:59.832
<i> that are, like,
 super tabloid-y, salacious.</i>

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:01.500
<i> Anything these women
 had to say</i>

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.836
<i> got spun into this
 big juicy circus.</i>

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.638
- Okay, so we're at the trial,

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:08.607
<i> after months of covering
 this story,</i>

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.544
and the girls have
their, like, sideways caps

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.946
<i> and their nice blue
 wide-set...</i>

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.649 align:start position:0%
[hiccups] ...eyes
and their skinny little noses.

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:20.152
<i> And their lawyer, etcetera,
 was like,</i>

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:22.822
<i> "My client is pregnant."</i>

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.290 align:start position:0%
They weren't pregnant,
but they were like,

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:25.925
<i> "I am pregnant.</i>

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.727
<i> My lawyer told me
 to say I'm pregnant."</i>

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.562
<i> And the reporters are like,
 "Oh, my God,</i>

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:30.896
<i> look at these girls
 and their haircuts</i>

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:32.431
<i> and their manicures.</i>

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:33.733
<i> Like, they could never
 commit a crime,</i>

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.101
<i> "and on top of that,</i>

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:37.536
<i> they might be carrying
 a baby."</i>

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.573
And Maurine is like...
[imitating keys clacking]

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.775 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Typing on the computer
that's not invented yet?

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:44.643
[both laugh]

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:47.313 align:start position:0%
- She's like,
"Sexy ladies do the thing

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:48.881
<i> that you think
 that they never could do."</i>

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:50.383
- I mean, Maurine
got caught up.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.952 align:start size:69% position:31%
Let's not mince words.

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:55.054
<i> Maurine got [bleep] caught up</i>

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:57.056
<i> in the sexiness
 of the whole thing.</i>

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.925
<i> - Like, her agenda wasn't
 necessarily to sensationalize,</i>

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.896
but the stories were so, like,
dramatic that she had to.

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:06.232
<i> - At the end of the trial,
 they were like,</i>

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:12.271
<i> "Look. I was very ill
 because someone named jazz.com</i>

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:15.908
<i> came to me
 and I feel concerned</i>

00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:19.078
<i> and I feel taken advantage of.</i>

00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:23.582
<i> I feel that I was someone
 who explored the realm</i>

00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:26.552
too heavily and I need help,"

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:30.890 align:end position:100%
and like, that woman was like,
"I can't, I... etcetera,

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.124
<i> "Altadena, etcetera.</i>

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:33.959
<i> Pasadena, etcetera."</i>

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:37.363
- [laughs]

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.698 align:start position:0%
- And the boys were like,
"You're right. You're right.

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:41.167
<i> "We don't care
 whether you did it.</i>

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.802
<i> "You're so hot.
 We want to [bleep] you.</i>

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:44.370
<i> We don't care."</i>

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:45.805
<i> - Which makes sense.</i>

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:48.240
<i> Juries back then, all male.</i>

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:49.742
<i> And the men
 were basically like,</i>

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:52.778
<i> "Okay, let me just
 tell you this.</i>

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.980
<i> "You have spent four months
 in the system.</i>

00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:56.615
<i> "Four months is too long.</i>

00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:58.417
<i> "Get the hell out of here!</i>

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.853
<i> You better go home
 and raise some babies.</i>

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:02.655
<i> You cuties."</i>

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.323
<i> - And they were like,
 "I can't wait to go!"</i>

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:06.425
<i> - And they were like,
 "I will go, mwah."</i>

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:08.360
<i> And they basically,
 these women got off</i>

00:07:08.393 --> 00:07:11.230
<i> after four months,
 after these [bleep] women</i>

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:14.767 align:end position:100%
murdered their lovers
in cold blood.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.570
<i> Maurine, after this happened,
 she took a step back,</i>

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:21.540
<i> and she said to herself,
 "I have been a part of freeing</i>

00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:24.410
<i> "these clearly guilty women
 who used</i>

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:28.180
<i> "their feminine wiles
 to get free.</i>

00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:30.216

- Meanwhile,
Sabella Nitti... got hanged.

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:39.859
- And it was the first time
that Maurine was like,

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:43.262
<i> "I'm sorry.
 I did the wrong thing.</i>

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:46.165
<i> This is [bleep] up.
 I [bleep] this situation up."</i>

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:51.136
<i> So, Maurine, women's groups,
 and Sabella Nitti's lawyers,</i>

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.572
<i> came together
 to change the laws,</i>

00:07:53.605 --> 00:07:58.043
<i> and they made it possible
 for women to be on juries.</i>

00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:01.647
<i> And then Maurine was like,
 "I gotta talk about this,</i>

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.682
<i> like, thing that happened
 to me,"</i>

00:08:03.715 --> 00:08:05.518
<i> and she wrote a play called...</i>

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.820
[both hiccup]
- You okay?

00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:09.722 align:end position:100%
- I can't wait to release
my hiccups.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.056
- You can let them out.

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:13.726 align:end position:100%
- Not yet. How am I ever--
not yet!

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.761
- [laughs]

00:08:15.794 --> 00:08:18.731
<i> - So she wrote a play...
 [hiccups]</i>

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:21.133
<i> It was called "The Brave
 Little Women," which...</i>

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:23.235
<i> [hiccups] It's hard
 to understand</i>

00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:26.272

 "Little Women," but it's not.</i>

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.143 line:0%
<i> So years and years and years
 after she died,</i>

00:08:31.176 --> 00:08:33.679
<i> Bob Fosse got the rights
 for her play</i>

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:35.681
<i> and then made it
 into "Chicago,"</i>

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:39.051
<i> which turned into
 the longest-running musical</i>

00:08:39.084 --> 00:08:41.287
<i> on Broadway of all time.</i>

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.756
- What is the moral
of the story?

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.824
- That's a very good question.

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.359
- [laughs]

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:50.796
<i> - Women can be villains</i>

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:54.333
<i> just as much
 as they can be heroes.</i>

00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:56.502
- However...
- However...

00:08:56.535 --> 00:09:00.439 align:start position:0%
- "Chicago" went to win
best picture

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:03.375 size:88% position:44%
at the mother[bleep] Oscars!

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:06.545 align:start position:0%
Okay? So sit down,
shut up,

00:09:06.578 --> 00:09:08.581 align:start position:0%
and appreciate that.
