00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.470
Recall how we determine the midpoint between two points. Our x coordinate is

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:11.095
found by adding the two x coordinates and diving by two, and the y coordinate is

00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:16.560
found by adding the two y coordinates and dividing by two. Once we plug in our

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:22.020
points, we obtain a midpoint of three halves and nine halves.
