00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.370
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.250
-We're now going to move
immediately to the third panel.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.270
And in order to
do that, I'm going

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.710
to introduce Shelley
Lowe, who's going to be

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.780
the moderator for that panel.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.470
It has been a privilege
to work with Shelley

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.090
for the past couple years,
and I'm looking forward

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.510
to many more years of
working with Shelley,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.380
both as part of Radcliffe and
as part of the Faculty of Arts

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.230
and Sciences.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.900
Shelley is the executive
director of the Harvard

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.140
University Native
American Program

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.380
and an enrolled
member of the Navajo

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.230
Nation from Ganado, Arizona.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.910
She, before coming to Harvard,
served as the Assistant Dean

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.510
for Native American Affairs in
the Yale College Dean's Office

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.200
and the Director of the Native
American Cultural Center

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.300
at Yale.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.620
She has also been
recently appointed

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.246
to the National
Council of Humanities.

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:06.800
This is a really major honor
for Harvard and for her.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.530
Appointed directly by
President Barack Obama.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.270
She is, I think, as many
people-- native students,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.110
alumni and the
community around here

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.920
would know-- the life blood
of our indigenous community

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.780
at Harvard.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.920
So for everything,
Shelley, thank you.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.100
And we're really looking
forward to this panel.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.600
Thank you.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:44.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.351
-Thank you, Dan.

00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:46.975
Good afternoon.

00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:57.430
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.980
So good afternoon, everybody.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.630
I have the distinct honor of
introducing our third panel

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.660
for the day, which
I'm going to borrow

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.220
some words from my fellow
moderator, Dr. Adrian King.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.390
This is a hella cool panel.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.690
And I know a lot of
you are here to see

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.040
this panel in particular.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.220
I do have some unfortunate
news to tell you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.820
that one of our panelists will
actually have to run out right

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.500
after this.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.180
And maybe I won't say who that
is yet so you guys can still

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.910
be super excited.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.770
These are rad natives right
here, both with the hashtag

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.360
and without the hashtag.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.640
So please, be
tweeting all you want

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.620
while we're going through this.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.340
Our first speaker is
Kristiana Kahakauwila.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.260
She is kanaka maoli.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.170
She's a writer,
the Lisa Goldberg

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.620
Fellow at the
Radcliffe Institute

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.680
for Advanced Study this year.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.630
We have Frank Waln, Sicangu
Lakota musician, rapper.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.230
Very popular, I know.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.860
I wanted to pause for lots
more applauses, but we'll wait.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.510
And Matika Wilbur, Swinomish
Tulalip photographer,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.030
creator of Project 562.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.250
I know her laughter
in a few minutes

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.300
is going to catch you as well.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.360
So without delay, Tiana, I'm
going to turn it over to you.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:27.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.950
I'd like to start with
gratitude for the thinking,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.260
the innovation,
the rabble-rousing,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.580
and the endurance represented
here, both by the speakers

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.530
and-- I was going to
say by the audience,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.330
and I didn't mean it like
how that was about to sound.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.515
I mean the endurance of
being native and being alive.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.240
I'm going to reorient
a little and start

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.600
with some creative work.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.740
The first pages of my book.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.800
This is Paradise, a collection
of short stories set

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.850
in and about
contemporary Hawai'i.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.530
And then I'm going
to reorient you again

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.905
in another way
with these slides.

00:04:10.932 --> 00:04:11.640
This is Paradise.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.140
Mid-morning, the lifeguards
fan across the beach and push

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.029
signposts into the sand.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.310
The same picture is on all of
them-- a stick figure, its arms

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.840
aloft, its circle head drowning
in a set of triangle waves.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.980
Caution, the sign reads.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.770
Dangerous undertow.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.320
We ignore it.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.650
We've gone out at Makaha
and Makapu'u before.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.070
We've felt yokes pull us under.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.470
We are not afraid of the beaches
and breaks here in Waikiki.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.350
We are careless,
in fact, brazen.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.780
So when we see her
studying the warning,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.920
chewing the right side
of her lip, we laugh.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.980
Just like the kind.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.180
Tourists, yeah?

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.080
The tourist girl is white.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.670
They're all white to us
unless they're black.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.170
She has light brown hair,
a pointed nose, eyebrows

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.920
neatly plucked into a firm line.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.910
She wears a white bikini with
red polka dots, triangle cut

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.000
top, ruffled bottom.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.150
We shake our heads at her.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.230
Our ehu hair, pulled
into pony tails,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.210
bounces against our necks.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.140
Our bikinis are
carefully cut pieces

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.110
with cross back straps
and lean bottoms.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.350
We surf in these, sista.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.760
We don't have time for
ruffles and ruching.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.060
But she does.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.630
Like every other tourist, her
blue and white striped hotel

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.630
towel labels for what she is.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.670
So why do we look
at her as we pass?

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.670
Why do we notice her out
of the hundreds of others?

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.540
Do we already know she's
marked, special in some way?

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.720
At the high tide line,
[? Cora ?] Jones and [? Kyla ?]

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.550
[? Ka'ava ?] pull on rash guards
to protect against the trade

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.240
winds which are
wailing this morning.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.300
The rest of us pretend we
don't have chicken skin.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.570
We strap our leashes
to our ankles,

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.820
careful to piece
the Velcro together,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.180
and then we jump on
our boards and feel

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.780
them skim across the
surface of the water.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.010
Arching our backs, our hips
pressed into hard fiberglass,

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.520
we dig the water with our hands.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.200
We raise one foot for balance.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.430
And because we know
we are silhouetted

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.200
against the horizon,
we hold our heads high.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.090
We point our toes.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.500
Our bodies curve upward like
smiles, beckoning those onshore

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.700
to follow.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.180
When we look back,
the tourist girl

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.760
is approaching the ocean's edge.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.170
She walks into the water,
the small waves lapping

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.730
at her feet, ankles,
knees, chest.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.710
We see her dip her shoulders
into the white wash.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.830
We don't tell her to stay
away from the retaining wall

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.770
in front of [? Baby ?] Queens
or that today the current is

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.890
moving [? Eva ?]
to Diamond Head.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.930
We paddle.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.705
And in a moment,
we've left her behind.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.780
That story is told by
three groups of women.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.800
The surfer girls,
who you just heard,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.890
hotel housekeepers from the
Federated States of Micronesia,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.890
and Hawaiian career women.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.580
Their voices weave
together, circle one

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.270
another, much like
a Greek chorus.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.960
My goal was, from the start,
to reorient the reader.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.740
To unsettle them, perhaps.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.700
But to force the reader to see
Waikiki, the ultimate tourist

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.225
Shangri-La, from a
native perspective.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.150
In school, the world
map that usually gets

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.620
taught is the one
you can see here.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.810
Centered on the Atlantic
Ocean, on the land masses

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.080
that surround it.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.490
In it, the Pacific is cut in
two, pushed to the periphery,

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.520
made to half, not whole.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.080
Here is a Pacific-centered
world in which

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.820
the great, really seafaring
nation of Oceania,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.649
takes center stage.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:46.010
Another map familiar to most
of you-- the United States.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.220
No tribal lands delineated.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.760
No Hawai'i or Alaska.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.130
This one's fun to
me because Hawai'i

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.360
is in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:09.040
And here I like to call it Boxed
Hawai'i overlaid on Mexico.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.190
And then in the
bottom, this second one

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.100
is what I like to call
Oddly Vertical Hawai'i.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.810
It's not even
oriented correctly.

00:09:19.671 --> 00:09:20.170
OK.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.350
Here we are back at Oceania.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.150
These maps and this
geography is how children

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.540
are taught about the US.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.260
And I don't need to press
too hard on this point,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.530
because I know
everyone here realizes

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.400
just what a falsity that is.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.690
What a lie it is.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:46.290
That these are the borders
that we teach to our children

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:46.920
is a problem.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.870
The Pacific writer,
anthropologist,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.550
wonderful thinker, Epeli
Hau'ofa in his paper

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.870
"Our Sea of Islands" says,
"There is a gulf of difference

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.530
between viewing the Pacific
as islands in a far sea

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.960
and as a sea of islands."

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.680
He goes on to argue for
the largesse of Oceania.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.880
He calls it, in fact, the
largest nation in the world.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.940
And he thinks of all the
people within Oceania

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.770
as a single seafaring nation.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.470
And so it's a
really powerful way

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.685
to think about what happens when
we bring our energies together.

00:10:40.002 --> 00:10:41.460
I'm going to give
you just two more

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.010
slides to think about as I
move into the rest of my talk.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.430
This first notes
some false dualities,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.390
ways of very often
indigenous people are taught.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:01.020
They are romantic or tragic,
scientific or traditional.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:07.660
It tends to be whites get
history, and we get culture.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.850
Our record is one that
is oral, but not written.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.700
And the final slide
I'll linger on

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.590
is a Hawaiian word-- mo'olelo.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.070
It encompasses a
lot, and it breaks up

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.400
those false dualities.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.890
It means story, history,
tradition, legend, yarn, a log.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.360
It means research, public
record, private journal.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.410
It also means the
succession of a talk.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.080
Because we're at
Harvard, I'm going

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.340
to tell you a little
bit about my education

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.890
and how I became a writer.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.720
And it relates
back to the slides

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.480
I showed you at the
beginning and how

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.670
we think about pedagogy.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.570
You know, when an
undergraduate here tells me

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.830
they go to school
in Cambridge, I

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.480
know they're really
talking about Harvard.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.680
So similarly, I went to
college in New Jersey.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.550
And at this New Jersey school,
I had a really mixed experience.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.030
It opened my world
in a lot of ways.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.590
It was like living
in a foreign country.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.390
There was a new language to
speak, a new fashion to wear,

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.930
and there was a different
way of even physically moving

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.720
through space.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.580
I read a ton in those years.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.760
I was assigned brilliant
work-- Russian novelists,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.920
French poets, good stuff.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.780
And at some point in
my sophomore year,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.140
I read Edward Sayyid's
"Orientalism", and the idea

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.660
of the gaze and of
reversing the gaze became

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.890
one of the first moments
where I felt like I

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.250
was glimpsing myself in a text.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.300
Perhaps I was already
offstage, but I knew

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.780
I had been there a moment ago.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.440
I majored in
comparative literature

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.990
with a focus on [INAUDIBLE]
and post-colonial French

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.040
literature, and I minored
in creative writing.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.290
Four years at the number one
university in the nation,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.280
and not once did I read
an indigenous writer.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.160
Not once did I
even hear the names

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.500
Leslie Marmon Silko, N
Scott Momaday, Thomas King.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.330
And in creative
writing courses, we

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.630
focused on American literature
and the American short story.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.720
There was gender balance.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.120
There was not racial balance.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.580
Fast forward five years, and I'm
at the University of Michigan

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.875
studying in their Master's
of Fine Arts program

00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.630
in creative writing.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.410
I got word that there was
a Pacific Studies program.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.600
Granted, it was housed in the
American Studies Department,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.250
which is a little weird
for all of Oceania

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.070
to be under the American
Studies umbrella.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.050
But it did exist.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.020
I enrolled in Canoe
Cultures with Vicente Diaz.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.060
And for the first
time in my study

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.650
of post-colonial
literature and history,

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.560
the course started with
an indigenous perspective.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.360
It started with a
chant, a seafaring song

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.360
from the island of Pohnpei
in the Federated States

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.970
of Micronesia-- Vince's home.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.440
For the first time, I
was in a classroom that

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.440
wasn't post-colonial
but de-colonial,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.840
where the professor
looked like me,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.560
knew what it was like to be
me, both outsider and insider

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.860
to the university
and academic complex.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:48.300
He oriented himself to the
ocean instead of to land.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.630
He grounded himself and
his teaching in Oceania.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.490
He and others introduced me
to the Great Pacific writers--

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.980
Maori writer Patricia
Grace, Epeli Hau'ofa,

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.470
Hawaiian professor and
historian John Osorio.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:09.320
I also read Silko, Momaday,
King, met Phil Deloria,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.730
read Vine Deloria Jr,
Sherman Alexie, Joy Harjo.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.880
I can go on.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.910
It changed my life, and
it changed my writing.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.220
I threw out everything I had
written before that class,

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.470
and I started for the first
time in my life writing

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.410
about Hawaii.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.005
Writing about what it meant
to be Kanaka Maoli but born

00:15:31.005 --> 00:15:32.430
in California.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.110
To have split my childhood
between continent and island.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.070
To try and understand why my
dad decided to leave Hawaii.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.190
And why my uncles
and aunties stayed.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.410
And what that means
for their children--

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.040
for me and my cousins.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.680
Writing, for me, is
always about a question,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.550
about what I don't understand.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.040
I didn't understand, really,
what it meant to be Kanaka.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.580
I knew what it felt like.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.740
And what it felt like was
that I was never enough.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.730
A feeling that had been
emphasized at Princeton.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.830
I moved to Hawaii after I
graduated from Michigan.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.570
I lived in Honolulu.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.270
I flew over to Maui to visit
the family often and see

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.020
my grandmother, who was ill.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.930
She died a year
after I moved here.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.160
I was in Ohio at
a friend's wedding

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.460
when I got the call
that she had passed.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.060
My family held off the
funeral until my dad

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.670
and I could fly home to them.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.130
In writing my first
book, This is Paradise,

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.200
I was trying to understand what
it meant to be loved that much.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.530
What it meant to
love myself, all

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.440
myself-- my indigenous
self, my hapa self.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.730
I was trying to
understand how, no matter

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:57.130
how far my dad or I got from
that land, that island, somehow

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.340
it was always waiting for
us, forgiving us, loving us,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.200
and wanting us back.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.990
And no matter how
often we went back,

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.569
no matter how long I lived
in Honolulu, how I'd always

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.900
be looking over the ocean at
the continent wondering what

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.310
I was missing out on over there.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.800
Like many indigenous, I realized
I live in a liminal space.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.800
You see the world from
a liminal position.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.630
A world not filled
with dualities,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.120
as many classes on indigenous
peoples will posit.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.115
But one in which, as a
contemporary indigenous person,

00:17:37.115 --> 00:17:40.000
I up-end the framework.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.520
And I can have all of it--
science, culture, tradition,

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.980
technology, past, present,
oral, written, myth, research,

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.780
legend, fact,
story, story, story.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.510
All of it at the same time.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.172
For me, storytelling--
mo'olelo-- holds all that.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.100
To close, I'd like to read
just a couple more paragraphs

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.990
from the story
"This is Paradise".

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.260
The excerpt is from
the perspective

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.770
of native Hawaiian
career women, and I'd

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.630
like to dedicate
this to Matika here.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.810
It's hard work to be a leader.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.940
It's hard, important,
and beautiful work.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.200
In this passage, there's an
honest moment of exhaustion

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.350
from the narrators.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.410
But I hope you also get a
sense of their strength,

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.090
their vibrance, and their
unapologetic aliveness.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.980
Despite our tendency
toward culinary laziness,

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.450
our exhaustion is not allowed
to overtake us this evening.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.630
Tonight, we are celebrating.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.390
Laura just submitted
her proposal

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.020
for a LEED certified
resort on Maui,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.810
and we hear her firm
will win the bid.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.950
Kiana Naone was promoted to
Politics Editor at the Honolulu

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.480
Advertiser.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.520
And Esther will take the
lead on a high-profile murder

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.900
case that all but promises
her making partner in a year.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.200
After years of part-time
jobs, and student loans,

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.900
and late nights with the
desk lamp's yellow light

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.350
on our books, we've made it.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.320
Or we are making it.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:38.320
Or we're close to
saying, We will make it.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.360
It doesn't hurt
that were from here.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.460
We are considered
by our peers to be

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.410
local women who've done well.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.280
Left but come back.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.860
Dedicated their education
and mainland skills

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.090
to putting this island right.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.470
We speak at civic club
gatherings and native rights

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.430
events.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.040
We are becoming pillars
of the island community.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.440
We are growing into who
we've always dreamt of being.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.980
But sometimes, late at night and
alone beneath the hand-stitched

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.950
Hawaiian quilts we can
finally afford to purchase,

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.470
we wished we had followed
our law and grad school

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.890
boyfriends to DC or Chicago.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.640
We could have foregone
being pillars.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.730
We could have been
regular women.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.614
I'll leave you there.

00:20:26.614 --> 00:20:37.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:45.540
-[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.770
-Hello, relatives.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.260
My Lakota name is Walks
with Young People.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.550
That was given to me by
my elders a few years ago.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.310
I also go by Frank Waln.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:00.320
I am a Sicangu Lakota hip-hop
artist and storyteller

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.410
from the Rosebud
Reservation in South Dakota.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.650
And I am the product of
amazing Lakota women.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.280
I was raised by my mother,
Mary Waln, my grandmother,

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.030
Marie Waln, and my aunties in a
small community on the Rosebud

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.200
Reservation in
South Dakota called

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.930
the [? Hidow ?] community.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:18.830
It's pretty rural.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.925
It's pretty small,
twenty houses.

00:21:20.925 --> 00:21:24.060
I was born and
raised on a ranch.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.870
And I have a story to tell you
guys before we get started.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.490
So I'm a hip-hop
artist, but I think

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.720
like my fellow amazing
panelists here,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.450
we're all just storytellers
in our own rights

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:35.780
and our own ways.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.870
Indigenous people have been the
best storytellers in this world

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.030
for thousands and
thousands of years.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.720
That's how we're here.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.280
That's how we survived.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.250
That's how we passed on
knowledge-- storytelling.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.670
So we're just continuing that
tradition through our art

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.879
and what we do.

00:21:51.879 --> 00:21:53.170
So I have a story to start off.

00:21:55.952 --> 00:21:58.990
I was very privileged that
my mother stressed education

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.220
in all forms, learning in
and outside the classroom

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.770
from the time I was little.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.330
So when I graduated
high school, I

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.220
was the first person
at my high school

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.011
to receive the Gates
Millenium scholarship.

00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:10.160
I was valedictorian, and
I had the opportunity

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.327
to go to college.

00:22:11.327 --> 00:22:13.660
Not a lot of people where I'm
from get that opportunity.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.410
The biggest high school
on our reservation

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.280
has a 75% dropout rate.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.530
Our entire reservation has
an 80% unemployment rate.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.040
We live in one of the poorest
counties in the country.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.470
You know, that poverty keeps
us trapped for a reason.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.620
But I had this opportunity.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.420
And I first used it to go
study premed at Creighton

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.870
University in Omaha, Nebraska.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.960
I did that for two years.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.379
I always knew I wanted to help,
always knew I wanted to heal.

00:22:38.379 --> 00:22:40.670
And the way I saw the world
when I was 18, the only way

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.755
I thought I could do
that was to be a doctor.

00:22:42.755 --> 00:22:44.380
So I did that for
two years, and then I

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.980
decided to follow
my passion of music.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.604
I love music.

00:22:47.604 --> 00:22:49.270
I've been playing
piano since I was six.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.504
I've been writing, producing,
recording music since I was 15.

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.170
And so I decided to
follow that passion,

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.260
and that took me
to an art school

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.591
in Chicago-- Columbia College--
where I graduated from.

00:22:57.591 --> 00:22:59.340
And the first week I
was there in Chicago,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.490
something happened
that changed my life.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.689
And I think a lot of
the indigenous students

00:23:03.689 --> 00:23:05.730
in this room could probably
relate to this story.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.530
So I get on the elevator
of the dorm I'm living in,

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.430
and this non-native girl
gets on the elevator with me.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.222
And I'm living in
downtown Chicago,

00:23:13.222 --> 00:23:15.430
and I'd never even seen a
skyscraper until this point

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.180
in my life.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.109
Our reservation's the
size of Rhode Island,

00:23:18.109 --> 00:23:19.900
and we have one stoplight
on our whole rez.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.980
[LAUGHTER] So I'm just in shock.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.420
All types of cultural shock.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.050
I could relate to
what Tiana was saying.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.480
It's like you're in
a different place.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.360
Even how you move is different.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.700
You have to learn how
to move in that space.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.097
So I'm on this elevator.

00:23:35.097 --> 00:23:37.680
This girl gets on, and she says,
"You have really pretty hair.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.263
What are you?"

00:23:38.263 --> 00:23:42.550
[LAUGHTER] I said, "Thank you.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.930
I'm Lakota.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.840
I'm Native American."

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.090
And she looked at me confused.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.300
And she said, "You
guys still exist?"

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.520
You know, we laugh,
but there are too

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.730
many college students in
this country that think

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.680
Native Americans are extinct.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.254
College educated adults
think we don't exist.

00:24:01.254 --> 00:24:02.670
Imagine what that
does to you when

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.620
you're trying to
relearn, remember,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.770
reconnect to an identity
that the government has

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.730
tried to kill, as we've
been hearing all day.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:17.154
It's all sort of confusion,
frustration, anger, pain.

00:24:17.154 --> 00:24:18.820
Also being proud of
where you come from,

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.650
being proud of that culture.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.510
So I started writing
songs about that.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.180
And I'll speak a
little bit on why

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.060
I think hip-hop resonates
with so many indigenous youth.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.770
You know, hip-hop
is a black culture,

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.656
It was born in New York City
out of a time-- the Bronx,

00:24:33.656 --> 00:24:35.280
they were building
the Bronx Expressway

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.238
through this community.

00:24:36.238 --> 00:24:37.460
They were displacing people.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.626
It was violent displacement.

00:24:38.626 --> 00:24:41.130
It was colonialism, basically.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.410
It was genocide.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.160
And out of it came
this beautiful culture

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.670
of hip-hop-- dance, graffiti,
music, the way they dressed.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.980
And when we were going
up on the reservation,

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.280
we were-- I grew up
disconnected from my culture.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.120
I grew up with my hair short.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.190
I grew up not going to ceremony
because my great grandparents

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.800
were the last
people in my family

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.890
to be fluent in our language
and to participate in ceremony.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.650
And where I'm from,
it was illegal.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.600
Jesuits would patrol
our reservation,

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.180
and if they caught us going into
sweat lodges, singing songs,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:15.900
they would call the police.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.790
We would get persecuted, thrown
in insane asylums for Indians.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.500
They said we were
worshipping the devil.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.760
So out of that history,
there was a lot of shame

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.536
with being Lakota where
I was from growing up.

00:25:26.536 --> 00:25:28.660
There was a lot of shame
with men having long hair.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.486
There was a lot of shame
about men wearing earrings.

00:25:31.486 --> 00:25:33.860
There was a lot of shame about
being proud of who you are

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.859
and where you come from.

00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:38.030
And I understand where that's
coming from from my elders.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.767
I understand what
they went through.

00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:41.850
Even though I may never
know what that feels like,

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.030
I understand where
that shame comes from.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.695
And hip-hop gave me a safe
space to reclaim my indigineity.

00:25:47.695 --> 00:25:49.820
Because the thing about
hip-hop as a culture is you

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.310
can be whoever you want
to be in that space.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.040
You bring to it who you are.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.360
And so it gave me a space
to look at my own identity.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.767
And around the same
time I was 18, 19,

00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:02.100
I started reconnecting to my
culture, and my ceremonies,

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.220
and language.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.710
My mother, my aunties--
they were doing the same.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.620
We were all doing that
around the same time.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:15.170
And also within hip-hop there's
the tradition of storytelling.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.700
And that culture was kind
of born out of colonization,

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.050
and so I think it resonated
with a lot of native youth

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.590
all across this country.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.570
I'm one of many native
hip-hop artists.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.850
There's tons of
brilliant artists.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.380
And so I want to talk a
little bit about how art,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.950
how performance gives me
that space to almost rupture,

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.730
and rage, and let some of
that pain, and that energy,

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.280
and those emotions-- the
love, the joy-- everything

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.360
that I'm experiencing
out in a healthy way.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.340
Because to tell indigenous
people to not be angry,

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.000
to not feel, to
not be frustrated,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.590
is to tell us to
not be human beings.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.150
How could we not be angry
about 500 years of colonization

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.189
and genocide?

00:26:55.189 --> 00:26:56.480
How could we not be frustrated?

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.840
How could we not feel pain?

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.048
And it's not just history
that results in the traumas

00:27:00.048 --> 00:27:02.240
that we face.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.980
The traumas of people that we
love, the own traumas that we

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.660
experience as people.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.060
So I think I needed
a healthy outlet,

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.320
and this art form have
me that healthy outlet.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.600
So right now, I'm really
interested in exploring healing

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.800
and love through my music.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.470
And Tiana even spoke about that.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.080
Right now I'm on
artist residency

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.660
at the University of Delaware.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.860
I'm visiting music classes.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.050
But I'm also going into
Nemours Children's Hospital,

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.920
which is hospital for children
who are terminally ill.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.890
And I'm doing music
therapy with kids.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.990
And we've been having
a lot of discussions

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:41.040
about what gets them through
the situation they're in.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.450
And one of the most profound
statements and ideas that's

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.430
come out that for me
is the concept of love,

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.410
and that love is the strongest
force in the universe.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.810
This one girl told me
if you don't have love,

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.580
you don't have anything.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.080
And I think that all the
indigenous people in this room,

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.110
we are a testament to
the love and strength

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.600
that our ancestors had.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.760
The fact that we're
even alive in this room

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.980
in a place like Harvard is
a testament to that I love.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:06.712
They loved us.

00:28:06.712 --> 00:28:07.670
They loved the culture.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:08.503
They loved the land.

00:28:08.503 --> 00:28:10.300
They loved the water.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.130
And that's why we're here.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.780
So I think about that
when I write these songs.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.110
Learning to love myself,
learning to love my community.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.611
It's a task.

00:28:20.611 --> 00:28:22.610
I'm probably one of the
youngest panelists here.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.290
I'm 26, and I'm
going through it.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.520
Even though I'm here in Harvard,
and I get a travel the world

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.890
and do what I love,
the people I love--

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.150
we're still connected to them.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.580
My mom is still at home
suffering from poverty.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.760
I have cousins addicted in meth.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.540
This is real.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.380
This isn't just history for us.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.884
This pain is real.

00:28:40.884 --> 00:28:42.300
And I've found
that when I've been

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.560
able to express this
and write this in songs,

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.390
my outlet has become an inlet
for a lot of other indigenous

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.040
people.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.540
And I never expected
that to happen,

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.940
but it's a really
beautiful thing.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:57.790
So I just want to comment on
that concept of love as well

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.470
and say that my grandfather,
Robert [? Sonny ?] Waln,

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.380
he passed away when I was three.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.010
He only had an eighth
grade education.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:10.070
He had to drop out
of school at 16

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.970
and lie about his age
to join the military

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.260
to provide for his family.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.968
Because I come from
a place where there's

00:29:14.968 --> 00:29:16.220
little to no opportunities.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.000
And that's what he
had to do to survive.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.400
And he went off to the
Korean War for four years.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.390
Came back, married
my grandmother,

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.560
raised a family of 11 with
an eighth grade education.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.860
And now his grandson's
standing here getting paid

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.640
to speak at Harvard University.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.203
Where are a testament
to that love.

00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:37.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.600
-So I'm going to be
honest with you guys.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.740
My audience is not Harvard.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.540
It's not it's not white people.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.235
I'm making songs for those kids
on the reservation, those kids

00:29:48.235 --> 00:29:49.360
who are going through this.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.270
Because they don't have the
privilege to come to the space.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.220
So I'm a performer.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.720
I'm going to do a
song for you guys.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.144
I want to finish with a song.

00:29:57.144 --> 00:29:59.560
And I would like to encourage
all the young native people,

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.670
or any people of
color in this room who

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.170
are going to go on to be the
leaders of our communities,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.370
to remember those kids.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.210
Remember the land and
water that we live on

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.495
and that we live off of.

00:30:10.495 --> 00:30:13.040
And remember those elders
whose shoulders we stand on

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.980
to get to where we are today.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.270
Because we wouldn't be
here without that love.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:18.780
And I think we
all need to embark

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.830
on that process of
healing, because we're

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.790
coming from communities with so
much trauma and so much pain.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:29.130
And you need to acknowledge
that pain to heal.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.780
And so I'm going to do
a song-- a new song.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.330
It's called "Wild West."

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.490
And it's, I think, a good
example of the things we

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:38.664
experience at home.

00:30:38.664 --> 00:30:40.580
I was having a conversation
with a good friend

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.320
of mine, a young lady.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.486
Her name's Cody [? Denouier. ?]
She lives back home.

00:30:43.486 --> 00:30:46.360
She's an incredible
singer, incredible artist.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.700
And we were talking about
home and just all the stuff

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.950
our relatives are going
through, and we both concluded

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.480
that there's things where
I'm from that will kill you,

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.804
and there's things that
will save our lives.

00:30:55.804 --> 00:30:57.970
There's things that are
killing people I love there,

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.870
but there's things
there that I can't

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.860
get anywhere else in the world.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.030
And we wrestle with that.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.380
And so I think this song
is an example of that.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.300
It's called "Wild West".

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.837
And this song is about my home.

00:31:09.837 --> 00:31:11.670
I come from place they
called the Wild West.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.410
Cowboys and Indians, they said.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.820
And it's still the Wild West.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.220
We're still fighting
that battle.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.240
It just has a different face.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.840
And the Wild West was always
told from the cowboy's

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.120
perspective, so I guess
this is a perspective

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.330
of a young indigenous person--
in the contemporary Wild West.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:34.720
[RAPPING]

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.400
I got five hundred years
to get off the dome.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.820
My momma was my strength.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.720
Pops was a rolling stone.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.950
So let me in my zone.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.260
Throw this dog a bone.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.100
Because I spit bars for
those native kids at home

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.700
who got wounds and scars,
whose dreams go far.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.890
You've got a jump shot.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.550
You're a red superstar.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.210
Take a cruise in the
car, disregard the law.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.030
We don't know no better
when adults withdraw.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.770
Bumpin first of the month
on the first of the month,

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.500
from the womb to the hearse,
that ensures what I want.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.005
Selling food stamps, I
could give you 40 for 20.

00:32:05.005 --> 00:32:07.990
All these damn hand-outs but
ain't no way to make money.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:11.270
This whack 80% unemployment
rate ain't no way

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.260
to make sure my
family's straight.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.680
My cousin did a crime,
feds investigate.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.540
We still face genocide
in this colonial state.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.780
Our ceremonies were banned.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.170
They cut our grandpa's braids.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:24.020
Took 'em to that boarding
school where my grandpa stayed.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.650
Cut them off from the ways
that their grandpas prayed.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.040
They're trying to build a
pipeline over my grandpa's

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.820
grave.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.870
There ain't no stopping this
rez life from blinding us.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.920
Ain't no stopping these
problems from finding us.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.810
Still I run with nowhere to go,
a rosebud with nowhere to grow.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:44.000
In the Wild, Wild West,
y'all, the Wild West.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.270
Living that rez life,
so stressed in the Wild,

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.510
Wild West, y'all, the Wild West.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.760
We're living that rez life.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.489
Birth of a rebel, I revel
while other's living in peril

00:32:54.489 --> 00:32:55.280
with several flows.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.290
I'm arm wrestling with your
devil, disheveled but never

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:58.874
settle.

00:32:58.874 --> 00:33:00.040
Y'all can't get on my level.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.460
Gimme bass, gimme treble.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.750
I'm trouble but never tremble.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.840
Rekindle the seven council
fires, keeper of the flame,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.430
land of the burnt thigh.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:08.880
It's even in my name.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.880
I'm a symbol, Sicangu
is how I rumble.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.889
I may stumble, but my
people are warriors,

00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:13.805
so I'll never crumble.

00:33:13.805 --> 00:33:16.570
Survivors of genocide
residing in the trap.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.440
I used to keep this inside
until I decide to rap.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.230
My ancestors ain't die
for me to lie on my back.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.540
Can't take it sitting down.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.020
Instead I'm fighting back.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.880
Buck your system,
buck your capitalism.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.560
You took the land, made us
sick, and gave us alcoholism.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.000
You took away our wisdom.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.330
You took away our health.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.220
We're going to get it back, and
we're going to honor ourselves.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.340
In the Wild, Wild West,
y'all, the Wild West.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.220
Living that rez life, so
blessed in the Wild, Wild West,

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.820
y'all, the Wild West.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.162
We're living that rez life.

00:33:46.162 --> 00:33:49.290
You forced our culture
underground, underground,

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.300
but you ain't stopping
no one now, no one now.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.201
We're stronger and we know
it now, we know it now.

00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:56.700
-Thank you.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:05.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.744
-Thank you very much.

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.720
Thank you.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.696
Thank you.

00:34:10.696 --> 00:34:12.672
Thank you.

00:34:12.672 --> 00:34:15.636
Thank you.

00:34:15.636 --> 00:34:16.624
Thank you.

00:34:16.624 --> 00:34:18.106
Thank you.

00:34:18.106 --> 00:34:19.094
Thank you very much.

00:34:19.094 --> 00:34:20.576
Thank you.

00:34:20.576 --> 00:34:21.564
Thank you.

00:34:26.504 --> 00:34:28.974
-Oh man, I gotta follow that?

00:34:28.974 --> 00:34:30.456
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:30.456 --> 00:34:31.425
-Oh man, yeah.

00:34:31.425 --> 00:34:32.008
Let's do that.

00:34:32.008 --> 00:34:34.348
Thank you so much, yeah.

00:34:34.348 --> 00:34:38.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.834
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:40.930
-Oh, man.

00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:42.170
I'm all crying.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.750
Good afternoon, dear
ones, relatives.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.162
Good afternoon.

00:34:54.162 --> 00:34:54.870
My name's Matika.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.940
I'm from the Swinomish
and Tulalip tribe,

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.040
and I'm super,
super honored to be

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.830
amongst such special, talented,
intelligent, beautiful people.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:09.040
I'd like to acknowledge
the ancestors of this land.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.840
The Massachusett, Nipmuc,
and Wampanoag people.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.915
We raise our hands to you.

00:35:14.915 --> 00:35:15.790
-[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:19.180
-Thank you for allowing us
to be here on your land.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.460
And I raise my hands to Miss
Shelley, and Jason, and all

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.790
of the organizers of this
event, and especially

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.800
our young native
students here at Harvard.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.770
We respect you.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:30.369
We love you.

00:35:30.369 --> 00:35:31.410
We want you to stay here.

00:35:35.324 --> 00:35:43.370
I'm here to ask you if we can
learn to see as human beings.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:47.480
Does the image actually
affect our lives and the lives

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.090
of those around us?

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.830
And as citizens of
the world, can we

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:57.740
use images to encourage
and inspire one another?

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.190
How can we, my friends,
shape our perceptions

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.160
to change the world?

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.820
Currently, there is
not one single source--

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.730
be it publication,
website, or exhibition--

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.480
accessible to the
public that provides

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.010
visual representation of every
tribe in the United States.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.700
Project 562 aims to change that.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.150
Why am I doing this?

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.300
I taught visual
arts for five years

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.600
at the tribal school on my rez.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.570
Our children needed effective
curriculums and stories

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:37.330
that could transmit light,
love, beauty, truth.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:38.296
But there wasn't.

00:36:38.296 --> 00:36:40.680
There were none.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:46.790
We still teach our children that
Columbus discovered America.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.080
The American
imagination produces

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.890
leathered and feathered,
savagery, less than.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.570
The toll of addiction,
abuse, and unnatural deaths

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.970
of my students overwhelmed me.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.635
I buried 19 students
in four years.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.870
And after so much
loss of potential,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:16.230
I'd sit in lodges with
my fellow teachers,

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.970
and we'd be sitting there
praying for our babies,

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:24.810
begging the Creator to help
us, feeling a hopelessness

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:29.710
and despair that I can
barely speak about.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:33.090
These are the images
that we seen when were

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.960
represented in massive media.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:42.230
This is the experience that our
children are having every day.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:46.460
Native American stereotypes
are ingrained in the fabric

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:51.260
of our country, as historical
people, as tribal and inferior.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.970
Most contemporary depictions
of Native Americans

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:58.210
include noble savage, redskins,
leathered and feathered,

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.690
spiritual being as
fit for mascots.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.570
And such portrayals degrade
popular understanding.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.130
This is what happens when
you Google search Native

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.300
American this morning.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.570
This algorithm represents
the image people are seeking,

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:19.880
and the image that
people are clicking on.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.810
This is what you expect when
you search Native American.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.300
My mentor, Stephanie
[? Freiberg ?]--

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.766
She doesn't know
she's my mentor.

00:38:30.766 --> 00:38:33.140
I call her that because I've
read everything she's wrote,

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.056
she's from my tribe, and
I secretly stalk her.

00:38:35.056 --> 00:38:38.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.471
She did this incredible study.

00:38:39.471 --> 00:38:41.470
She went to all these
tribes around the country.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.570
She showed kids pictures
of Native American,

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.350
African American,
Asian American.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.010
And every time they were shown
an image of a native person,

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:53.080
their self-esteem
went down by 60%.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.510
Shockingly, when the
image of an Indian

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.420
is shown to the
white counterpart,

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.000
their self-esteem is raised.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.470
For centuries, our people have
called for authentic indigenous

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.310
images and stories
of our resiliency,

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:12.710
of the sacredness of
land, of the meaning

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:15.610
and value of our knowledge.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.120
These are the stories
and so many more

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.030
that live within Project 562.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:27.880
And they're the voices that can
now be heard if we seek them.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.040
Like this one.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.440
This is Uncle John
[? Kakeana'ana. ?]

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.650
He's Kanaka Maoli from the
Independent Nation of Hawai'i.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.560
John is pictured on
the west side of Kuai'i

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.130
at his kalo farm that
has been in his family

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.690
for several generations.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.960
To John and other
kanaka maolis, kalo

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:51.230
is of supreme importance--
defined in the Kumulipo,

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:55.750
or Hawaiian creation chant, as
the plant from which Hawaiians

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.130
were formed.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:59.840
In 2002, into the
University of Hawaii

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.620
genetically modified kalo and
patented their hybridized taro,

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.180
charging farmers for
the new type of seed.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:13.720
John was a part of a strong
indigenous opposition

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.480
and coalitions and
peaceful protests

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:22.870
to protect the
natural, ancestral kalo

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:26.260
And through his activism
and many others,

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.000
in 2008 the state of
Hawaii designated kalo

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.640
as a state plant in a bill to
ban genetically modified taro

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.885
and coffee in the
islands of Hawaii.

00:40:38.885 --> 00:40:44.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.680
Over and over, and over
again, people ask me,

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.876
What is the greatest lesson
that you've learned, Matika?

00:40:50.876 --> 00:40:52.750
What have you learned
from being on the road?

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.290
And I often respond by
saying, The only thing

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.860
I've fully come to understand
is that our people's identities

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.870
are inextricably
connected to the land.

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.730
We are the people of
the blue green water,

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:11.000
the people of the tide, the
people of the tall pine trees,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.880
the people that
live within the four

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.740
sacred mountains, the people
of the streaming tide.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.890
We're the rabbit eaters,
the cattails eaters.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.810
We're the people
of the longhouse.

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:24.390
There is an indigenous
people of this place as well.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:28.920
And what we see overwhelmingly
is that our communities

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.310
are always fighting
for the right

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:37.650
to maintain access to the
very thing that defines us.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.980
Such as this fellow
this is Raymond Matts.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.054
He's one of my heroes.

00:41:43.054 --> 00:41:44.720
And you see, he's not
smiling because he

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.070
has all gold busted teeth
because the cops punched them

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.660
all out while he
was being arrested

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.120
19 times for fishing on the
Klamath River in California.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.950
He belongs to the Yurok tribe,
and he was one of the first

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:02.230
to challenge the US government
for tribal fishing rights.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.930
He brought his case all the
way to the Supreme Court,

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.930
and he recalls the turning
point in that case,

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:11.810
as maybe some of you do as well.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:15.730
He says, we'd laid
out our set nets.

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.550
And from this rock
here, where their people

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.910
have been fishing for thousands
of generations, and the feds

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:24.450
were there with
big, enormous guns

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.180
waiting for them to
go pick their net.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.290
And they were kind of
a little apprehensive.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:29.150
They didn't know what to do.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.233
They knew that if they
went out to pick their net,

00:42:31.233 --> 00:42:32.950
they'd be forcefully
arrested again.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:37.580
And for Mr. Matts, that would
be his last time being arrested.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.750
And so there's a lot of
commotion on the shores.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.840
And finally, after a three-day
standoff, and reporters

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.110
there as well, his 89-year-old
grandma said, Enough of this.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.720
I'll do it.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.730
And so she got in
her little canoe,

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:59.500
and she started paddling out
there, and picking the net.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:05.440
And of course, cops came
and by gunpoint demand

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.570
that she stop poaching.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.660
They took pictures, went on
the cover of Time magazine.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.470
They won their court case, which
set precedence for the Judge

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.800
Bolt decision which gave
tribes half the fish,

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.602
and game, and wildlife, and
co-management of our resources.

00:43:26.602 --> 00:43:28.685
And you see, my momma is
a commercial fisherwoman.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:36.080
And I was super, super honored
to have the opportunity

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.230
to thank Raymond
for his bravery,

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:42.860
for being brave enough to stand
for what matters to us most.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.770
This is miss Jenny Parker.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.600
She was a teacher for 25
years in her tribal school

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.750
in northern Cheyenne
until one day,

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.150
federal officials came to
her at the school and said,

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:04.390
We'd like you to come
down and identify a body.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.610
It was her daughter's.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.911
She'd been forcefully
raped and left for dead

00:44:08.911 --> 00:44:09.910
on the side of the road.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.900
And afterwards, Jenny
had a heart attack.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.560
She felt as though she was
dying of a broken heart.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.910
And her granddaughter
came and said, Grandmama,

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:25.907
I'll take care of you.

00:44:25.907 --> 00:44:28.240
Slowly, they started walking
to the end of the driveway,

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.198
to the end of the road.

00:44:29.198 --> 00:44:32.190
And Jenny says, It's
the love that helped

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.990
her to survive such things.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:37.970
It's knowing that her
granddaughter would need her.

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:39.520
And I asked Jenny,
What would you

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.420
like me to tell the people
when I show your photograph?

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:48.650
And she said, Ask them
if they'll stand with us.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:52.470
Ask them if it matters to them.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:57.110
Remind them that
we're still here.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.090
I want to stand up
here and tell you

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:02.150
transcendent stories of
light, and love, and beauty.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.970
But as my friends say,
If you want our beauty,

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:09.460
you must also take our struggle.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:14.790
The truth is, I have heard far
too many stories like Jenny's.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.370
Stories about forced
sterilization,

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:21.650
stories of rape and horror
that at times make me

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:26.160
feel like I'm suffocating
and like there

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.140
is no hope in Indian country.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:34.070
And these experiences articulate
our current socioeconomic

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.390
situation.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:39.350
Native American women are the
most victimized in the country.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.130
Three out of four
have experienced

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:45.600
sexual assault or domestic
violence in their lifetimes.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:50.610
And that's my sisters,
my aunties, my cousins,

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:53.420
the native women in this room.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.170
It's real.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:04.381
And for most native women, it is
not a question of if but when.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:09.560
Across the border
in Canada, there

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:14.300
are an estimated
1,181 stolen sisters--

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.590
women from age two to 78
disappeared and never found,

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.210
missing and likely murdered.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.600
There is no question we
are in a very critical time

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.150
of a longstanding epidemic
of abuse and misuse

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:26.780
of our Native
women and children.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:30.040
And while our women tell me
stories about race, and caste,

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.000
and how their bodies are
used to perpetuate both,

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.990
high caste women are sexually
restricted-- reserved,

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:41.980
if you will-- while women at the
bottom are sexually exploited.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.980
Native people are
the only people

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.100
in the country that need
prove their pedigree.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.320
Still today, we faced
extermination policies

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.220
put in place to eradicate
the American Indian.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.760
Which means that
as a native woman,

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.980
we are faced with the complicity
of choosing a mate when

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.050
race's policies determine our
future children's opportunity

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.390
for citizenship and inclusion.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.556
We're forced in courts
to define ourselves.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.740
It's time we take back the
right to make decisions

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.860
about ourselves.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.630
A lesson I've learned from a
well-known leader in my own

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.565
could tribal community,
Miss Deborah Parker.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.560
Part of Miss Deborah Parker.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:30.806
-That was about to be
so smooth, though, huh?

00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:34.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:38.040
-If you go to the
gallery, you could see it.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.460
Who advocated on behalf of
native women during the right

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.460
to reauthorize the
Violence Against Women Act,

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.140
and while also running a
program in our community

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:49.070
to help our victimized
and abused people.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:51.380
When I ask her where
she finds strength,

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:57.520
she said, When you are
asked to protect someone,

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:02.110
when you are asked to protect
your nation, it's what you do.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.000
You armor up.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.340
You warrior up, and you protect
the women in your nation.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:11.400
And it's a great honor to do so.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:16.250
All I can do is pray that
I am able to speak justice

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.150
toward our missing and
murdered indigenous woman,

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.140
to those who are
still here struggling

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.290
to find out what kind of
justice they will receive.

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:27.260
To me, it will be a
lifetime of this work.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:31.250
It will never stop, because
every man and woman is worth

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.090
protecting.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.700
Every person deserves justice.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.550
We can do that
through education.

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.540
This is Dr. Mary
Evelyn Belgarde.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.830
She's from the Pueblo of
Isleta and Ohkay Owingeh.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.540
She's a retired Professor of
Education for the University

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.140
of New Mexico.

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.620
She's worked tirelessly
to open tribal schools

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.880
with native curriculums.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.560
She's raised funds to support
thousands of native students.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.850
And she's lovely.

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:04.610
She's charming.

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:08.040
She feeds you green chili.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.160
And then she want to
talk about systematically

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.630
engineered systems of
education to eradicate us.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:14.830
And she says,
Matika, when are we

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.360
going to stop asking
our children to choose

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.650
between cultural education
and Western education?

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:23.180
I think we're ready to stop
the assimilation process.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.540
The time to change is now.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.922
This is-- this is not.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.000
Oh.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.270
Dr. Adrian King, could
you stand up please?

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:40.200
Everybody look back here.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.120
This is Dr. Adrian King.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.850
-I have a beautiful
photo of her.

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:53.600
And let me tell you, she is my
favorite Cherokee of all time.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.540
And she's a dear friend
of mine, and you'll

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.020
be hearing from her
later this afternoon.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.740
You don't have to
keep standing, Adrian.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:05.120
But I would like to acknowledge
that Adrian is one of the few

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.674
that holds a doctorate in
education from Harvard.

00:50:08.674 --> 00:50:11.850
And she's currently
teaching at Brown,

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:14.670
and focuses on college
access for native students.

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:16.620
Her blog, Native
Appropriations, has

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.080
a national and
international audience.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.920
As a voice on contemporary
indigenous issues,

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.310
she writes about the
collectivism of native students

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:26.510
in higher education.

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:29.270
And she says, I want
to take a moment

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:33.160
to talk to your family, your
professors, your community,

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.900
your school administrators.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:40.320
We have a responsibility
to our native students.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.840
It is not enough to push
students to enroll in college

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.180
and expect them to
conform to the norms

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:52.860
and expectations of spaces
that are not meant for them

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:56.630
and then forge
their own path home.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:00.220
We need to embody the
Cherokee concept of gadugi,

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.940
working together toward
a common goal that

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.690
benefits the entire community.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:09.440
This is Miss Helen.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.210
She's blind.

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:13.250
She's the last Lovelock
Paiute speaker.

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:16.640
I just recently went
to meet with her.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.890
All around Indian country,
our indigenous languages

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.000
are at risk of being lost.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.430
I can't tell you how many
women I've met like Miss Helen.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.700
Man, I had this dream.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.670
I was on a subway
in Seattle, which

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:36.020
is how I knew I was dreaming.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.750
And there was people to
my left arguing in Lakota

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:42.260
about Trump and Barack Obama.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.330
And there was people to my
right eating fast food--

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:49.330
wild Anishinaabe rice--
speaking in Anishinaabe

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:51.790
about changing the
local downtown scene.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:53.930
And there was people
talking in the Dene

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.180
about changing our education
system so that everybody

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.950
would speak Dene.

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:03.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:12.150
And you know, I
woke up in tears.

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:15.286
Because I thought to myself,
It's never going to happen.

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:24.920
And then I had to like
smudge myself off and realize

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.450
that if I don't
believe that it's

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:28.830
possible for our white
brothers and sisters

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:31.410
to learn our languages,
for our own people

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:34.930
to establish systems where
we can relearn our languages,

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.640
for us to actually
acknowledge that there

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.870
is an indigenous land,
history, intelligence that

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:46.170
is here and among us that
is worth saving, protecting,

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:48.240
and learning.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.180
If I don't believe
that, then who will?

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.739
Three years ago-- I'm
almost done, I promise.

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:56.530
I'm sorry, Shelley.

00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:57.290
One minute.

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:59.430
Three years ago, I left
my job, family, and home

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:01.360
to begin traveling
for Project 562,

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.640
a multi-year creative
expedition dedicated

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.140
to photographing over 562
federally recognized tribes

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.250
in the Unite States.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:12.970
To date, I have traveled to
over 250 tribes in 47 states,

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:15.250
taking nearly 800
portraits and collecting

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:18.700
each person's history.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.770
I realize, to some, that
this is very radical.

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:25.710
And rad young folks
of Harvard, before I

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:28.150
say anything else about the
purpose of today's lecture,

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:29.440
let me say this.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.730
I hope that the stories that
I've shared with you will

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:34.720
you inspire you to
go on an adventure.

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.380
Especially for you young ladies.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.560
I read something of
Gloria Steinem's newest

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.230
novel that rocked my world.

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:44.740
She said, Thanks to
molecular archeology, which

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.380
includes the study
of ancient DNA

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.130
to trace human
movement over time,

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:52.640
we now know that men have
been the stay-at-homes,

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.060
and women have
been the travelers.

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.260
The rate of intercontinental
migration for women

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.820
is about eight
times that for men.

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:00.270
However, these
journeys have often

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.990
been unchosen, one-way
trips in cultures that were

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:05.090
patriarchal and patrilocal.

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:07.010
That is, women were
under male control

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:11.420
and also went to live in
their husbands households.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:15.550
In the face of all the dire
and often accurate warnings

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:18.520
of danger on the
road for women, it

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.760
took modern feminism to ask
the rock-bottom question,

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.074
Compared to what?

00:54:25.074 --> 00:54:28.430
Whether it be by dowry
murders in India,

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:32.510
honor killings in Egypt,
domestic violence in United

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:35.360
States, records
show that women are

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.170
most likely to be
beaten or killed

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.900
at home and by men they know.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:45.040
Statistically speaking, home
is an even more dangerous place

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.120
for women than on the road.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.580
Perhaps the most
revolutionary act for women

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.510
will be a self-willed
journey and then

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:58.420
be welcomed when she comes home.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.470
Nothing can sum my
experience better.

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:03.790
We need to see one another.

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:07.530
We need to hear from one
another with an open heart

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:09.120
and an open mind.

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.260
We need to learn
from one another.

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:17.490
Someone says, You can't
survive the storm.

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:23.580
And you turn and say,
Baby, I am the storm.

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.110
Thank you.

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:35.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:38.500
-Special thanks
to our panelists.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.720
I think there are a few things
that really strengthen me

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.060
in the work that I do, besides
my own family, my children,

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.420
very supportive and loving
elders, but very powerful

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.380
youth.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.660
And I want everyone to give
a very, very special, again,

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.940
round of applause to Frank.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:58.850
Because he's a
healer, and as much

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:02.370
as we'd like to keep him here,
he's got to go someplace else

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:05.760
and heal some other native youth
who are probably desperately

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.870
waiting for him to arrive.

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:09.525
Frank, thank you so
much for sharing.

00:56:09.525 --> 00:56:27.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.840
-And now, as you are
not bombarding him

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.940
as he has to leave, he actually
does have to go catch a fight,

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.152
we will open to a few
minutes of questions.

00:56:35.152 --> 00:56:37.610
So if you have a question, the
microphone is in the middle.

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:39.700
Please come forward.

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.320
-Shauna Manning
from UMass Boston.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.190
I wanted to ask Kristiana, when
is your new book coming out?

00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:51.860
-Thank you for that question.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:54.920
-I wasn't planted here.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.570
-I'm not sure.

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:56.840
I'm not finished with it yet.

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.110
This year at Radcliffe has
been an incredible year

00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:01.320
of working on it.

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:07.581
So I'm hoping in a few
years it'll be done.

00:57:07.581 --> 00:57:09.330
I'm hoping soon.

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:09.960
-Soon?

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.300
You mean like years, though?

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:11.800
-Yeah.

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.600
Yeah, I know.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.240
So, it takes about
two years to get

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:20.250
a book published from the moment
your editor gets what you think

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.780
is the final manuscript,
and then the edits,

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.760
and then the everything else.

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.726
So I'd love to be done
with it a year from now.

00:57:27.726 --> 00:57:29.100
And then that's
another two years

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:34.290
till it's on your local
indie bookstore's bookshelf.

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:34.810
Thank you.

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:35.960
-OK.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:36.594
Thank you, all.

00:57:36.594 --> 00:57:38.385
I really enjoyed all
of your presentations.

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:41.840
-Hi.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.310
My name is Shelby [? Anelwni ?].

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:44.560
I'm Kanaka Maoli.

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.880
I'm born and raised
from California,

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.770
so that really
resonated with me.

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:53.860
I just graduated from
Wellesley College last year.

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:59.550
My question is more so for
native students, I guess

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:01.310
and for me speaking,
being Kanaka Maoli

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:07.240
and going to a college where
there is no native presence.

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.240
But coming in as Kanaka, and
how hard that was for me to like

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:11.780
integrate.

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:15.080
Because I feel like that
story is really removed.

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.940
And I really appreciate
you taking photos.

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:20.580
I'm really curious on
your creative process

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.190
when you were going through
undergrad and even grad school,

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:27.110
how writing or whatever
that was that helped

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:29.298
you get through all
those painful times

00:58:29.298 --> 00:58:30.423
or feeling like an outcast.

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:34.170
-Yeah.

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:34.890
That's a lot.

00:58:40.461 --> 00:58:40.960
First of--

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.280
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.550
--on your graduation.

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:51.610
And second of all, at
Princeton I wasn't myself.

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:56.730
I mean, I was myself, but
I didn't know who I was.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:02.070
And so those years--
what that was about to me

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:04.480
was getting a lot
of inputs and trying

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.670
on a lot of different selves.

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:09.060
And none of them fit.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:13.110
And it was really uncomfortable,
and it was really hard.

00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:16.480
I am very grateful to
my parents and my family

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.832
for sending me there.

00:59:18.832 --> 00:59:20.290
Because you learn
a lot when you're

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.110
uncomfortable for so long.

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:25.350
I'm also really
grateful for going

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:31.380
to Michigan, where I finally
found people who knew really

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:35.260
how to teach me to be me
and not be afraid of that.

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:38.120
I think that's something
with Matika's images,

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.490
with Frank's songs.

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.880
I'm really jealous.

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.720
I am actually like the
oldest of the three of us.

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.470
I'm never the oldest
in a group of people.

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:49.303
I'm always the baby.

00:59:49.303 --> 00:59:51.090
But today I'm the oldest.

00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:53.200
And I bring that up
because I think I'm really,

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.440
in some ways, jealous.

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.710
But that's really
a deep admiration

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:01.270
for them knowing themselves
sooner than I did.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:03.350
And so Michigan,
again, was the place

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.210
again that I found teachers.

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:08.610
I found teachers who
were going to teach me

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:12.390
how to be me in this big world
and who were going to support

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:16.260
me, and they still do, to be
an indigenous person, a Kanaka

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:16.970
Maoli.

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:20.880
Wherever I was, even
if I wasn't on island.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.410
-Thank you.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:21.910
-Thank you.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.990
-Hi my name is [? Yvonne ?]
[? Yi. ?] I'm a graduate

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:32.020
student here, and I study
Korean and Native American oral

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.810
traditions and literature.

01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:35.740
Thank you so much,
Tiana, and Matika,

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:39.110
for your beautiful and
very moving presentations.

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:42.100
This question is
actually for Matika.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.910
I was just so amazed that
you have undergone this epic

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:52.100
journey to 562
plus, now, nations.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.680
And I wanted to ask
how important is it

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.790
for you to physically travel
to each of these places

01:00:58.790 --> 01:00:59.570
to do your work?

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:08.750
-I think it's really important
that we meet people in spaces

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.980
where they feel comfortable.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.100
And for me, the reason for
going to people's places

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.890
because I am trying
really hard to practice

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:19.120
indigenous photography methods.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.600
Which is, as a
photographer, we don't

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.670
ask how I can advance my own
career with somebody else's

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:29.400
image, or how I can sell
somebody else's agenda.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.200
But rather, how can I make
myself useful to the people

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.160
that I'm photographing?

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.220
And when I arrive
in a new place,

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.720
the reason I go to their place
is because it's their place,

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.970
and I get to be the guest.

01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:44.220
And I ask them, How would
you like to be photographed?

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.930
And where would you
like to be photographed?

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:47.388
Where do you feel
most comfortable?

01:01:47.388 --> 01:01:49.160
What best tells your story?

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.240
Yesterday, we talked about it.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.965
Where would you have
your portrait made?

01:01:57.290 --> 01:01:58.750
And I think for
our people, that's

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:01.690
within our indigenous homelands,
our indigenous territories.

01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:06.940
And it's important that I make
myself available in that way.

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.530
Yeah.

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.350
-Thank you.

01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:14.150
-Hello my name is
Elaine Breslow,

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:16.880
and I am just blown away.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:23.540
I feel such hope, such
gratitude, such emotion

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:30.120
to find the next
generation doing something,

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.720
moving our conversation
closer to change.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.490
Not just in legislation, which
we heard a lot about today,

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:40.540
but in human contact
and conversation.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.060
And there is a lot out
there through culture,

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:47.630
through art, I think, that moves
us one step closer in a way

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.690
that all the other
avenues do not.

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:52.260
And you've clearly
demonstrated that.

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.440
I hope that Frank
and each of you

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.890
reach out to the Upstander
Project and Dawnland,

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:02.820
two films that are in
post-production now,

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.447
for your voices to
chime in on that.

01:03:05.447 --> 01:03:07.030
And just hope that
everyone here knows

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.320
that there's something
each and every one of us

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.050
can do just by attending
things like this

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.210
and listening to your work.

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.751
So thank you.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.590
-Thank you, everybody.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.800
I want to remind everyone
here that Matika Wilbur has

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.390
an exhibition going on
right now in Byerly Hall.

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.020
It's two buildings over.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.540
If you have not yet had
a chance to look at it,

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.800
we encourage you to do so.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.310
It is open today, and it
be open until May 28th.

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:39.470
We are-- guess what?--
almost back on time.

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:42.180
So we're going to
take a 10 minute break

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.870
and come back for our last
and final panel, which

01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:46.941
is all, again, hella cool.

01:03:46.941 --> 01:03:47.440
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.990
