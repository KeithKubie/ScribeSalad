MICHEL DEGRAFF: So,
yes, this course is--

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.810
the core of it is discussions.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.140
And in order for the
course to be successful,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.200
we have to be able to discuss
very delicate, personal issues

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.960
in a very safe way
and to be honest.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.720
It cannot be that students
are afraid to reveal

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.020
their positions on various
topics including race,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.780
language, identity.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.830
And one way to do
it is to, given

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.130
that I had at the very
beginning of the course,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.280
I had the questionnaires
about where they came from,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.980
what languages they
spoke, where they grew up,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.400
I was able to use that
to trigger discussions.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.035
So if we read a text about
authenticity, for example,

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:55.565
if you are an African, can
you be an authentic writer

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:57.160
if you write in
English, for example?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.260
Then I knew that
some of the students

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.550
had dealt with this issue.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.690
For example, we
had a student who,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.440
although she was
Black and Hispanic,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.540
but she wasn't very
fluent in Spanish.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.685
And she wasn't clear whether
her not being fluent in Spanish

00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:14.790
made her any less Hispanic.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.450
You see, so I could--

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.900
I was able to use that in order
to trigger a discussion around

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.830
this notion that we had read
in the famous debate between

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.690
Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa
Thiong'o about African writers.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.140
Can an African-- can a writer
be authentically African

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.460
if they write in English
or French for that matter?

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.280
So that was one way to
trigger rich discussion,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.290
by taking a text that
connected to these issues

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.790
and making it personal.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.830
So the motto there
was rich discussions

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.680
are best arrived at if they
stem from a personal basis

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.420
where students are
invested in trying

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.410
to find an answer
that can work for them

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.410
in their personal lives.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.826
Or in the lives
of their families,

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:03.540
their communities,
their countries, etc.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.550
So that was the
one key technique.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.610
And then, there was
another condition for it,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.750
to have these discussions.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.070
It's to have mutual
respect and trust.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.460
Because, in these questions,
there cannot be a right

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.880
and wrong answer.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.035
So it is based on your own level
of comfort, what, you know,

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.660
choices you've made
your personal life,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.580
for your identity.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.910
And we have to be able to
accept different opinions.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.650
But sometimes,
that was not easy.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.230
Because they were,
like in the class,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.620
there was another student
who spoke Spanish fluently

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.037
and will view
himself as Hispanic.

00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:41.411
And there was
another student who

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.840
didn't speak
Spanish so fluently,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.720
who also view
herself as Hispanic.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.560
So right there, there
was a potential for who

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.380
was more Hispanic, you see.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.700
But yet, they are both Hispanic
in their own ways, you see.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.780
And this is where the debate
gets very interesting.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.410
How do you define
being Hispanic?

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.920
And then we are back to
that very core question.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.569
Who belongs?

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.360
Who doesn't belong?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.810
And this is where, again,
language and identity

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.640
become tools for either
inclusion or exclusion.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.940
And since the course is
eventually about inclusion,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.530
then how can we use these
different identities to create

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.250
a space where one can
have a sum that's much

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.672
larger than the parts, you see.
