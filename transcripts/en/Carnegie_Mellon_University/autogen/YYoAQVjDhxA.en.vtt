for charging what's not kept up as much

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:34.870
for charging what's not kept up as much
 

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.510
for charging what's not kept up as much
as the infrastructure in that and that's

as the infrastructure in that and that's
 

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.270
as the infrastructure in that and that's
because there's a tough ROI on on

consider charging infrastructure as an
extension of the grid I think would be a

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:01.810
extension of the grid I think would be a
 

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.220
extension of the grid I think would be a
lot better you know we were looking at

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:05.230
lot better you know we were looking at
 

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.030

hi-hi-hi power charging I think this

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200
hi-hi-hi power charging I think this
 

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.420
hi-hi-hi power charging I think this
changes and probably around 2025 so when

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:15.430
changes and probably around 2025 so when
 

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:19.380
changes and probably around 2025 so when
you look at the the what it costs to

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:19.390
you look at the the what it costs to
 

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.300
you look at the the what it costs to
drive a gas vehicle what you just

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:21.310
drive a gas vehicle what you just
 

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.690
drive a gas vehicle what you just
mentioned that has continued to go up as

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:24.700

regulations get gets stronger the cost

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:27.630
regulations get gets stronger the cost
 

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.540
regulations get gets stronger the cost
to buy an electric vehicle continues to

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:30.550
to buy an electric vehicle continues to
 

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.270
to buy an electric vehicle continues to
go down and I think around 2025 those

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280
go down and I think around 2025 those
 

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.150
go down and I think around 2025 those
lines meet and at that point it's just

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:36.160
lines meet and at that point it's just
 

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.770
lines meet and at that point it's just
cheaper to buy an electric vehicle than

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:37.780
cheaper to buy an electric vehicle than
 

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.280
cheaper to buy an electric vehicle than
a gas vehicle even without considering

a gas vehicle even without considering
 

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.680
a gas vehicle even without considering
the savings in fuel costs the savings

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:43.690
the savings in fuel costs the savings
 

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.800
the savings in fuel costs the savings
and maintenance so I think 2025 is kind

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:46.810
and maintenance so I think 2025 is kind
 

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.600
and maintenance so I think 2025 is kind
of the date we have we have pegged I

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:48.610
of the date we have we have pegged I
 

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:49.740
of the date we have we have pegged I
think it's um what was some of the

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:49.750
think it's um what was some of the
 

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.320
think it's um what was some of the
automakers have pegged as when the

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.330
automakers have pegged as when the
 

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.720
automakers have pegged as when the
parity cost parity is reached with gas

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:54.730

dollars in this space and I think you
 

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.280
dollars in this space and I think you
know I've always kind of went by the old

hindering people's accessibility and
 

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.660
hindering people's accessibility and
ability to move but how do we do it in

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:39.670
ability to move but how do we do it in
 

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.520
ability to move but how do we do it in

think strictly of electric vehicles and
I just want people to be thinking about

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:09.850
I just want people to be thinking about
 

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.500
I just want people to be thinking about
how much bigger it is than that it's not

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:13.510
how much bigger it is than that it's not
 

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.710
how much bigger it is than that it's not
just EVs it's about doing all of our

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720
just EVs it's about doing all of our
 

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.750
just EVs it's about doing all of our
mobility in the most efficient way

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760
mobility in the most efficient way
 

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.669
mobility in the most efficient way
possible and so what the energy

00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679
possible and so what the energy
 

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:22.770
possible and so what the energy
efficient mobility assistance program is

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:22.780

data the massive amounts of data that we

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840
data the massive amounts of data that we
 

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.320
data the massive amounts of data that we
have access to in our mobility systems

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:34.330
have access to in our mobility systems
 

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.900
have access to in our mobility systems
and use that to increase the efficiency

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:36.910
and use that to increase the efficiency
 

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.330
and use that to increase the efficiency
of those systems and so working with

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.340
of those systems and so working with
 

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.049
of those systems and so working with

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.849
infrastructure what about the generation
assets and and how we might continue to

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:17.859
assets and and how we might continue to
 

00:35:17.859 --> 00:35:20.309
assets and and how we might continue to
see generation assets play into this

00:35:20.309 --> 00:35:20.319
see generation assets play into this
 

00:35:20.319 --> 00:35:22.710
see generation assets play into this
into this space will there be a lot of

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720
into this space will there be a lot of
 

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.109

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:40.030
no I think where we're seeing more and
 

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.440
no I think where we're seeing more and
more interest in from a customer

on distributed generation I do think

00:35:47.549 --> 00:35:47.559
on distributed generation I do think
 

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:50.339
on distributed generation I do think
that you're going to see an uptick or

00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:50.349
that you're going to see an uptick or
 

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:51.690
that you're going to see an uptick or
you know a greater prevalence of

you know a greater prevalence of
 

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.640
you know a greater prevalence of
distributed generation you know the

Central Station facilities I think that

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:02.710
Central Station facilities I think that
 

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.490
Central Station facilities I think that
those are indicative of the time that

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:05.500
those are indicative of the time that
 

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.250
those are indicative of the time that

distributed and energy resources and I

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:28.180
distributed and energy resources and I
 

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.140
distributed and energy resources and I
think it was mentioned earlier as well

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:30.150
think it was mentioned earlier as well
 

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.519

vehicles could could be a distributive
 

00:36:32.529 --> 00:36:33.900
vehicles could could be a distributive
energy resource in the future and I

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:33.910
energy resource in the future and I
 

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:36.960
energy resource in the future and I
think that as we see increased adoption

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:36.970
think that as we see increased adoption
 

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.120
think that as we see increased adoption
of electric vehicles that that's just

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.130
of electric vehicles that that's just
 

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.279
of electric vehicles that that's just
another asset that we're going to have

00:36:41.279 --> 00:36:41.289
another asset that we're going to have
 

00:36:41.289 --> 00:36:42.750
another asset that we're going to have
to manage and then we're gonna have to

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760
to manage and then we're gonna have to
 

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.599
to manage and then we're gonna have to
create a grid that is a platform to

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:45.609
create a grid that is a platform to
 

00:36:45.609 --> 00:36:47.130
create a grid that is a platform to
manage all of these distributed energy

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.140
manage all of these distributed energy
 

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.859
manage all of these distributed energy
resources so we're investing those

00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:49.869
resources so we're investing those
 

00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:51.660
resources so we're investing those
dollars today with an eye towards the

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:51.670
dollars today with an eye towards the
 

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.630
dollars today with an eye towards the
future that it will be an environment

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640
future that it will be an environment
 

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.370
future that it will be an environment
with with greater distributed generation

00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380
 
 

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.529
 
so we're testing that right now we have

00:37:00.529 --> 00:37:00.539
so we're testing that right now we have
 

00:37:00.539 --> 00:37:03.529
so we're testing that right now we have
two smart neighborhoods one in Georgia

00:37:03.529 --> 00:37:03.539
two smart neighborhoods one in Georgia
 

00:37:03.539 --> 00:37:06.230
two smart neighborhoods one in Georgia
and one in Alabama that are the one in

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240
and one in Alabama that are the one in
 

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.000
and one in Alabama that are the one in
Georgia we have rooftop solar all the

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.010
Georgia we have rooftop solar all the
 

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.960
Georgia we have rooftop solar all the
appliances in the house will be

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:11.970
appliances in the house will be
 

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.880
appliances in the house will be
connected and smart and we want to test

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:13.890
connected and smart and we want to test
 

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.880
connected and smart and we want to test
how people interact with a smart home

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:16.890
how people interact with a smart home
 

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:20.630
how people interact with a smart home
and study how generation works off the

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640
and study how generation works off the
 

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.410
and study how generation works off the
rooftop solar and that will also inform

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420
rooftop solar and that will also inform
 

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.029
rooftop solar and that will also inform
our R&amp;D also unfortunately the future of

00:37:26.029 --> 00:37:26.039
our R&amp;D also unfortunately the future of
 

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:27.380
our R&amp;D also unfortunately the future of
home building so we want to learn that

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:27.390
home building so we want to learn that
 

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.670
home building so we want to learn that
the one in Alabama is a little bit

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680
the one in Alabama is a little bit
 

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.010
the one in Alabama is a little bit
different it has all the the whiz-bang

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020
different it has all the the whiz-bang
 

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.390
different it has all the the whiz-bang
devices in the house but the

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400
devices in the house but the
 

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.400
devices in the house but the
neighborhood it's going to be powered by

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:34.410
neighborhood it's going to be powered by
 

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.309
neighborhood it's going to be powered by
a micro grid so a different technology

00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.319
a micro grid so a different technology
 

00:37:37.319 --> 00:37:39.079
a micro grid so a different technology
and again we want to study that it does

00:37:39.079 --> 00:37:39.089
and again we want to study that it does
 

00:37:39.089 --> 00:37:40.670
and again we want to study that it does
that make sense for future home building

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680
that make sense for future home building
 

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.160
that make sense for future home building
so in both cases we partnered with the

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:43.170
so in both cases we partnered with the
 

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.690
so in both cases we partnered with the
home builder and we're all learning a

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700
home builder and we're all learning a
 

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.970
home builder and we're all learning a
lot about the future of homes and it's

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980
lot about the future of homes and it's
 

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.579
lot about the future of homes and it's
distributed generation the answer we're

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:49.589
distributed generation the answer we're
 

00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:53.029
distributed generation the answer we're
also doing a pilot in Atlanta smart

00:37:53.029 --> 00:37:53.039
also doing a pilot in Atlanta smart
 

00:37:53.039 --> 00:37:54.380
also doing a pilot in Atlanta smart
cities pilot so we own a lot of light

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:54.390
cities pilot so we own a lot of light
 

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.559
cities pilot so we own a lot of light
poles in the in the southeast and we put

00:37:57.559 --> 00:37:57.569
poles in the in the southeast and we put
 

00:37:57.569 --> 00:38:00.740
poles in the in the southeast and we put
200 notes on light poles in Atlanta and

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:00.750
200 notes on light poles in Atlanta and
 

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.960
200 notes on light poles in Atlanta and
this will help us measure it has video

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:02.970
this will help us measure it has video
 

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.970
this will help us measure it has video
capabilities but help measure help the

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980
capabilities but help measure help the
 

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.450
capabilities but help measure help the
city measure a traffic flow help people

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460
city measure a traffic flow help people
 

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.029
city measure a traffic flow help people

00:38:15.809 --> 00:38:17.480
their sound is made so we're learning
about all this now we have a little bit

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:17.490
about all this now we have a little bit
 

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:19.670
about all this now we have a little bit
more time in the southeast our rates are

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680
more time in the southeast our rates are

learn and we want to know what the
 

00:38:26.849 --> 00:38:28.069
learn and we want to know what the
future looks like and that's what we're

00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079
future looks like and that's what we're
 

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:28.700

working on
great well I want to shift gears though

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:30.990
great well I want to shift gears though
 

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.120
great well I want to shift gears though
because I got a question starting

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:32.130
because I got a question starting
 

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.200
because I got a question starting
getting questions from the audience and

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:33.210
getting questions from the audience and
 

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:37.870
getting questions from the audience and
one of them is for sherry and you know I

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880
one of them is for sherry and you know I
 

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.190
one of them is for sherry and you know I
hesitate to ask this because it's about

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200
hesitate to ask this because it's about
 

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.640
hesitate to ask this because it's about
a flying car and so the question is what

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:43.650
a flying car and so the question is what
 

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:46.309
a flying car and so the question is what
role do you see uber elevate to play in

00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319
role do you see uber elevate to play in
 

00:38:46.319 --> 00:38:48.680
role do you see uber elevate to play in
in the future in the smart suit so is

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:48.690
in the future in the smart suit so is
 

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:49.730
in the future in the smart suit so is
this for real though I mean you're gonna

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740
this for real though I mean you're gonna
 

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.529
this for real though I mean you're gonna
tell us we're just between us is it is

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:51.539
tell us we're just between us is it is
 

00:38:51.539 --> 00:38:53.329
tell us we're just between us is it is
it really happening though I will tell

00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339
it really happening though I will tell
 

00:38:53.339 --> 00:38:58.210
it really happening though I will tell
you so what what elevate is is a

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:58.220
you so what what elevate is is a
 

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.180
you so what what elevate is is a
commercialization of virtual takeoff a

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:02.190
commercialization of virtual takeoff a
 

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:06.609
commercialization of virtual takeoff a
vertical takeoff and landing

00:39:06.609 --> 00:39:06.619
vertical takeoff and landing
 

00:39:06.619 --> 00:39:11.710
vertical takeoff and landing
aircraft more easily understood as

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720
aircraft more easily understood as
 

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.099
aircraft more easily understood as
drones for human transportation and the

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:16.109
drones for human transportation and the
 

00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:18.890
drones for human transportation and the
answer is yes they are coming they're

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900
answer is yes they are coming they're
 

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.789
answer is yes they are coming they're
coming sooner than you think we have a

00:39:22.789 --> 00:39:22.799
coming sooner than you think we have a
 

00:39:22.799 --> 00:39:26.599
coming sooner than you think we have a
group in Dallas and a partnership with

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:26.609
group in Dallas and a partnership with
 

00:39:26.609 --> 00:39:29.599
group in Dallas and a partnership with
Bell Helicopter and a number of the

00:39:29.609 --> 00:39:35.420
Bell Helicopter and a number of the
other aviation companies to see how that

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:35.430
other aviation companies to see how that
 

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:40.039
other aviation companies to see how that
can be part of the multimodal fleet do

00:39:40.039 --> 00:39:40.049
can be part of the multimodal fleet do
 

00:39:40.049 --> 00:39:40.969
can be part of the multimodal fleet do
you think it's gonna be

00:39:40.969 --> 00:39:40.979
you think it's gonna be
 

00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:43.759
you think it's gonna be
intercity or intra-city how are these

00:39:43.759 --> 00:39:43.769
intercity or intra-city how are these
 

00:39:43.769 --> 00:39:46.670
intercity or intra-city how are these
gonna work to be honest with you I don't

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680
gonna work to be honest with you I don't
 

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.999
gonna work to be honest with you I don't
know down to that level of detail but

00:39:49.999 --> 00:39:50.009
know down to that level of detail but
 

00:39:50.009 --> 00:39:53.569
know down to that level of detail but
here's what I do think I think that when

00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579
here's what I do think I think that when
 

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:56.319
here's what I do think I think that when
you start to talk about automated

00:39:56.319 --> 00:39:56.329
you start to talk about automated
 

00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:59.259
you start to talk about automated
transportation we need to think beyond

00:39:59.259 --> 00:39:59.269
transportation we need to think beyond
 

00:39:59.269 --> 00:40:03.380
transportation we need to think beyond
what the near future the autonomous

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:03.390
what the near future the autonomous
 

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.960
what the near future the autonomous
vehicles the electric vehicles and into

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:05.970
vehicles the electric vehicles and into
 

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.999
vehicles the electric vehicles and into
what the far future might be and what I

00:40:07.999 --> 00:40:08.009
what the far future might be and what I
 

00:40:08.009 --> 00:40:10.039
what the far future might be and what I
love about coming here to Carnegie

00:40:10.039 --> 00:40:10.049
love about coming here to Carnegie
 

00:40:10.049 --> 00:40:12.109
love about coming here to Carnegie
Mellon is that so many of the people

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119
Mellon is that so many of the people
 

00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:14.630
Mellon is that so many of the people
here are taking a look and researching

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640
here are taking a look and researching
 

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.099
here are taking a look and researching
and thinking about what that far future

00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:16.109
and thinking about what that far future
 

00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:18.049
and thinking about what that far future
is well one of the things we have to

00:40:18.049 --> 00:40:18.059
is well one of the things we have to
 

00:40:18.059 --> 00:40:20.299
is well one of the things we have to
worry about in the far future inside of

00:40:20.299 --> 00:40:20.309
worry about in the far future inside of
 

00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:22.729
worry about in the far future inside of
a smart city is new new threats and new

00:40:22.729 --> 00:40:22.739
a smart city is new new threats and new
 

00:40:22.739 --> 00:40:26.209
a smart city is new new threats and new
extreme events and maybe I want to tie

00:40:26.209 --> 00:40:26.219
extreme events and maybe I want to tie
 

00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:28.130
extreme events and maybe I want to tie
in resilience to this conversation a

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140
in resilience to this conversation a
 

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.620
in resilience to this conversation a
little bit and how does like maybe we

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:30.630
little bit and how does like maybe we
 

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.739
little bit and how does like maybe we
start with Carina like what why does the

00:40:33.739 --> 00:40:33.749
start with Carina like what why does the
 

00:40:33.749 --> 00:40:36.229
start with Carina like what why does the
city even need to be resilient and how

00:40:36.229 --> 00:40:36.239
city even need to be resilient and how
 

00:40:36.239 --> 00:40:39.739
city even need to be resilient and how
can some of this technology enhance the

00:40:39.739 --> 00:40:39.749
can some of this technology enhance the
 

00:40:39.749 --> 00:40:41.569
can some of this technology enhance the
ability to cope with extreme events in

00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579
ability to cope with extreme events in
 

00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:44.630
ability to cope with extreme events in
in a city so resilience means a lot of

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640
in a city so resilience means a lot of
 

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.190
in a city so resilience means a lot of
different things and I think that that

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200
different things and I think that that
 

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.870
different things and I think that that
is one of the things we maybe need to

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880
is one of the things we maybe need to
 

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.900
is one of the things we maybe need to
talk about first it's not just about you

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:50.910
talk about first it's not just about you
 

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.339
talk about first it's not just about you
know that we can withstand

00:40:54.339 --> 00:40:54.349
 
 

00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:58.509
 
record-setting rains as we recently or

00:40:58.509 --> 00:40:58.519
record-setting rains as we recently or
 

00:40:58.519 --> 00:41:01.719
record-setting rains as we recently or
extreme temperatures or other kinds of

00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:01.729
extreme temperatures or other kinds of
 

00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:03.620
extreme temperatures or other kinds of
natural events like that there's also

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:03.630
natural events like that there's also
 

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.709
natural events like that there's also
social resiliency that's necessary and I

00:41:06.709 --> 00:41:06.719
social resiliency that's necessary and I
 

00:41:06.719 --> 00:41:08.180
social resiliency that's necessary and I
think that it's something that really we

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:08.190
think that it's something that really we
 

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.269
think that it's something that really we
do have to think about in the era of

00:41:10.269 --> 00:41:10.279
do have to think about in the era of
 

00:41:10.279 --> 00:41:12.559
do have to think about in the era of
autonomous mobility increased

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:12.569
autonomous mobility increased
 

00:41:12.569 --> 00:41:15.739
autonomous mobility increased
privatization of mobility what happens

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:15.749
privatization of mobility what happens
 

00:41:15.749 --> 00:41:18.049
privatization of mobility what happens
to our social cohesion to those those

00:41:18.049 --> 00:41:18.059
to our social cohesion to those those
 

00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:19.770
to our social cohesion to those those
those ties that bind us

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:19.780
those ties that bind us
 

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.810
those ties that bind us
to one another and build that sort of

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:21.820
to one another and build that sort of
 

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.720
to one another and build that sort of
social relationship that keeps us as a

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:24.730
social relationship that keeps us as a
 

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.280
social relationship that keeps us as a
strong community this is something that

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:26.290
strong community this is something that
 

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.560
strong community this is something that
we talk a lot about the the pressures

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:28.570
we talk a lot about the the pressures
 

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:31.830
we talk a lot about the the pressures
and stressors that lie on a city not

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:31.840
and stressors that lie on a city not
 

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.750
and stressors that lie on a city not
just from the environment but also from

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760
just from the environment but also from
 

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.810
just from the environment but also from
the social aspects of the city and so we

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:36.820
the social aspects of the city and so we
 

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.900
the social aspects of the city and so we
do think about that and I already lost

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:39.910
do think about that and I already lost
 

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.790
do think about that and I already lost
the Train of no that's exactly where

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800
the Train of no that's exactly where
 

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.430
the Train of no that's exactly where
trying to understand how some of these

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440
trying to understand how some of these
 

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.520
trying to understand how some of these
technologies help us improve resilience

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:47.530
technologies help us improve resilience
 

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:51.780
technologies help us improve resilience
in in in a future city and maybe we

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:51.790
in in in a future city and maybe we
 

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.770
in in in a future city and maybe we
would ask Joe as a electricity provider

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780
would ask Joe as a electricity provider
 

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.380
would ask Joe as a electricity provider
will the lights stay on more our lights

00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:58.390
will the lights stay on more our lights
 

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.670
will the lights stay on more our lights
are pretty reliable in Pittsburgh right

00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680
are pretty reliable in Pittsburgh right
 

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.560
are pretty reliable in Pittsburgh right
now think they are I appreciate that but

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:01.570
now think they are I appreciate that but
 

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.080
now think they are I appreciate that but
it you know as we connect more things to

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:04.090
it you know as we connect more things to
 

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.960
it you know as we connect more things to
the Internet do you think that that will

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:06.970
the Internet do you think that that will
 

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.910
the Internet do you think that that will
still be the case and then how do we

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:08.920
still be the case and then how do we
 

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.830
still be the case and then how do we
make sure ensure we protect that yeah

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:10.840
make sure ensure we protect that yeah
 

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.710
make sure ensure we protect that yeah
you know I guess we're taking measures

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720
you know I guess we're taking measures
 

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.690
you know I guess we're taking measures
every day to make sure that we have a

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:15.700
every day to make sure that we have a
 

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.270
every day to make sure that we have a
reliable resilient grid as you said we

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.280
reliable resilient grid as you said we
 

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.340
reliable resilient grid as you said we
do currently have one but it's always

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:20.350
do currently have one but it's always
 

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.320
do currently have one but it's always

keeping I am keeping an eye on the
future right so we're investing hundreds

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:25.360
future right so we're investing hundreds
 

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.660
future right so we're investing hundreds
of millions of dollars in a long-term

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:27.670
of millions of dollars in a long-term

infrastructure improvement plan to to
better that and then also kind of along

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:33.250
better that and then also kind of along

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:40.360
micro grid at our Operations Center
 

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.240
micro grid at our Operations Center
campus on the north side of the city

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.250
campus on the north side of the city
 

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:45.660
campus on the north side of the city
where our our primary Operations Center

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:45.670
where our our primary Operations Center
 

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.430
where our our primary Operations Center
is so whenever there is extreme weather

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440
is so whenever there is extreme weather
 

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.370
is so whenever there is extreme weather
events we're going to essentially hard

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:50.380
events we're going to essentially hard
 

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.840
events we're going to essentially hard
in the electrical infrastructure there

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:51.850
in the electrical infrastructure there
 

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:55.200
in the electrical infrastructure there
we're going to potentially pilot some

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:55.210
we're going to potentially pilot some
 

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.910
we're going to potentially pilot some
generation technologies there as well

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920
generation technologies there as well
 

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.510
generation technologies there as well
but basically hardening and improving

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520
but basically hardening and improving
 

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.160
but basically hardening and improving
the resiliency and the reliability of

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:02.170
the resiliency and the reliability of
 

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:04.950
the resiliency and the reliability of
that campus which is critical to making

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960
that campus which is critical to making
 

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.270
that campus which is critical to making
sure the lights stay on for all of our

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280
sure the lights stay on for all of our
 

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:10.290
sure the lights stay on for all of our
customers so I'd say that you know who

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:10.300
customers so I'd say that you know who
 

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.790
customers so I'd say that you know who
knows what the future holds but we are

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800
knows what the future holds but we are
 

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.920
knows what the future holds but we are
at this point you know we're investing

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:13.930
at this point you know we're investing
 

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:15.840
at this point you know we're investing
significant dollars into preparing

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:15.850
significant dollars into preparing
 

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.780
significant dollars into preparing
ourselves for for that future there's a

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:18.790
ourselves for for that future there's a
 

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:20.760
ourselves for for that future there's a
lot of questions about the connection

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:20.770
lot of questions about the connection
 

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:22.830
lot of questions about the connection
between distributed generation and Evi

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:22.840
between distributed generation and Evi
 

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:27.600
between distributed generation and Evi
charging and so do you think that new

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:27.610
charging and so do you think that new
 

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:29.790
charging and so do you think that new
distributed generation assets would be

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800
distributed generation assets would be
 

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.920
distributed generation assets would be
coupled with EB charging have you seen

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:31.930
coupled with EB charging have you seen
 

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:33.420
coupled with EB charging have you seen
examples where that work

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:33.430
examples where that work
 

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.549
examples where that work
and will it happen here in Pittsburgh or

00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559
and will it happen here in Pittsburgh or
 

00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:38.910
and will it happen here in Pittsburgh or
in southern territories yeah I think

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920
in southern territories yeah I think
 

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.789
in southern territories yeah I think
it's a conversation have so like I said

00:43:41.789 --> 00:43:41.799
it's a conversation have so like I said
 

00:43:41.799 --> 00:43:43.589
it's a conversation have so like I said
the future Vivi charging if you're gonna

00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599
the future Vivi charging if you're gonna
 

00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:45.509
the future Vivi charging if you're gonna
try to simulate the gas station

00:43:45.509 --> 00:43:45.519
try to simulate the gas station
 

00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:47.069
try to simulate the gas station
experience and be done in five minutes

00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079
experience and be done in five minutes
 

00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:49.019
experience and be done in five minutes
is what I mentioned earlier the 350

00:43:49.019 --> 00:43:49.029
is what I mentioned earlier the 350
 

00:43:49.029 --> 00:43:50.970
is what I mentioned earlier the 350
kilowatt hour charging that is a lot of

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:50.980
kilowatt hour charging that is a lot of
 

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.539
kilowatt hour charging that is a lot of
power that is when you look from a load

00:43:54.539 --> 00:43:54.549
power that is when you look from a load
 

00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:56.849
power that is when you look from a load
shape if you're thinking of us you know

00:43:56.849 --> 00:43:56.859
shape if you're thinking of us you know
 

00:43:56.859 --> 00:44:00.150
shape if you're thinking of us you know
in the rural setting on a corridor off

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160
in the rural setting on a corridor off
 

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.740
in the rural setting on a corridor off
the side of an interstate one of those

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:01.750
the side of an interstate one of those
 

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:03.809

chargers I mean the spikes would be

00:44:03.809 --> 00:44:03.819
chargers I mean the spikes would be
 

00:44:03.819 --> 00:44:05.249
chargers I mean the spikes would be
unbelievable

00:44:05.249 --> 00:44:05.259
unbelievable
 

00:44:05.259 --> 00:44:07.099
unbelievable
so I think you have to think about

00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:07.109
so I think you have to think about
 

00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:10.109
so I think you have to think about
pairing with battery storage or micro

00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:10.119
pairing with battery storage or micro
 

00:44:10.119 --> 00:44:13.859
pairing with battery storage or micro
grid fuel cell I think you have to have

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:13.869
grid fuel cell I think you have to have
 

00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:16.499
grid fuel cell I think you have to have
those conversations because that that is

00:44:16.499 --> 00:44:16.509
those conversations because that that is
 

00:44:16.509 --> 00:44:17.700
those conversations because that that is
what's going to move the electric

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:17.710
what's going to move the electric
 

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.440
what's going to move the electric
transportation market I think that right

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:19.450
transportation market I think that right
 

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.539
transportation market I think that right
now fast charging 50 kilowatt hour

00:44:21.539 --> 00:44:21.549
now fast charging 50 kilowatt hour
 

00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:24.329
now fast charging 50 kilowatt hour
charging it takes about 30 minutes if

00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:24.339
charging it takes about 30 minutes if
 

00:44:24.339 --> 00:44:25.620
charging it takes about 30 minutes if
someone's in front of you you could be

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:25.630
someone's in front of you you could be
 

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.299
someone's in front of you you could be
there for an hour we've read about

00:44:27.299 --> 00:44:27.309
there for an hour we've read about
 

00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:29.970
there for an hour we've read about
fights at charging stations because

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:29.980
fights at charging stations because
 

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.799
fights at charging stations because
people are getting impatient please

00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:31.809
people are getting impatient please
 

00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:33.180
people are getting impatient please
don't fight people at charging stations

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:33.190
don't fight people at charging stations
 

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.609
don't fight people at charging stations
by the way but 350 kilowatt hour

00:44:35.609 --> 00:44:35.619
by the way but 350 kilowatt hour
 

00:44:35.619 --> 00:44:36.990
by the way but 350 kilowatt hour
charging sort of solves that and you

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000
charging sort of solves that and you
 

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.089
charging sort of solves that and you
would need banks of those chargers so I

00:44:39.089 --> 00:44:39.099
would need banks of those chargers so I
 

00:44:39.099 --> 00:44:41.730
would need banks of those chargers so I
think that is while it's not something

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:41.740
think that is while it's not something
 

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.609
think that is while it's not something
we've seen yet I think that is that is

00:44:44.609 --> 00:44:44.619
we've seen yet I think that is that is
 

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:46.259
we've seen yet I think that is that is
the future is pairing that with

00:44:46.259 --> 00:44:46.269
the future is pairing that with
 

00:44:46.269 --> 00:44:48.960
the future is pairing that with
distributed energy let me just chime in

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:48.970
distributed energy let me just chime in
 

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.160
distributed energy let me just chime in
there first thing in cost I think this

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.170
there first thing in cost I think this
 

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.620
there first thing in cost I think this
is an important point is that we don't

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:52.630
is an important point is that we don't
 

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:54.029
is an important point is that we don't
know what this future looks like all

00:44:54.029 --> 00:44:54.039
know what this future looks like all
 

00:44:54.039 --> 00:44:55.529
know what this future looks like all
that we know is that there's going to be

00:44:55.529 --> 00:44:55.539
that we know is that there's going to be
 

00:44:55.539 --> 00:44:57.210
that we know is that there's going to be
an increased penetration in EVs and

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:57.220
an increased penetration in EVs and
 

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.650
an increased penetration in EVs and
there's going to be in here at least I

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:58.660
there's going to be in here at least I
 

00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.759
there's going to be in here at least I
believe there's going to be an increased

00:44:59.759 --> 00:44:59.769
believe there's going to be an increased
 

00:44:59.769 --> 00:45:01.650
believe there's going to be an increased
penetration of distributed generation so

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:01.660
penetration of distributed generation so
 

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.930
penetration of distributed generation so
this is a critical time for us to be

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:03.940
this is a critical time for us to be
 

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.880
this is a critical time for us to be
piloting things like southern like

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:05.890
piloting things like southern like
 

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:07.920
piloting things like southern like
Darren and southern are doing that

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:07.930
Darren and southern are doing that
 

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.140
Darren and southern are doing that
Duquesne Light is you know is just

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.150
Duquesne Light is you know is just
 

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.269
Duquesne Light is you know is just
really getting off the ground as I said

00:45:12.269 --> 00:45:12.279
really getting off the ground as I said
 

00:45:12.279 --> 00:45:13.710
really getting off the ground as I said
because we're at a relatively early

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720
because we're at a relatively early
 

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.109
because we're at a relatively early
stage in terms of market maturity here

00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119
stage in terms of market maturity here
 

00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:18.690
stage in terms of market maturity here
but it's critical for the utility I

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:18.700
but it's critical for the utility I
 

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.859
but it's critical for the utility I
think to be piloting technologies now to

00:45:21.859 --> 00:45:21.869
think to be piloting technologies now to
 

00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:24.299
think to be piloting technologies now to
understand how this is going to impact

00:45:24.299 --> 00:45:24.309
understand how this is going to impact
 

00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:26.130
understand how this is going to impact
our system to impact the community that

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:26.140
our system to impact the community that
 

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.650
our system to impact the community that
we serve so just a you know plug there

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:28.660
we serve so just a you know plug there
 

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.529
we serve so just a you know plug there
that we we need to be piloting

00:45:30.529 --> 00:45:30.539
that we we need to be piloting
 

00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:33.120
that we we need to be piloting
technologies now to better inform us for

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:33.130
technologies now to better inform us for
 

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.430
technologies now to better inform us for
the future I think we might have time

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440
the future I think we might have time
 

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.870
the future I think we might have time
for one more question is that is that

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880
for one more question is that is that
 

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:42.140
for one more question is that is that
okay okay so we're in the midst of a

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:42.150
okay okay so we're in the midst of a
 

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.760
okay okay so we're in the midst of a
technological revolution

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:43.770
technological revolution
 

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.620
technological revolution
in the transportation sector but the

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:45.630
in the transportation sector but the
 

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.410
in the transportation sector but the
transportation sector is now the largest

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:47.420
transportation sector is now the largest
 

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.790
transportation sector is now the largest
emitter of greenhouse gas emissions and

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800
emitter of greenhouse gas emissions and
 

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.320
emitter of greenhouse gas emissions and
so Sarah we can start with you and

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:51.330
so Sarah we can start with you and
 

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.870
so Sarah we can start with you and
anybody can chime in what's it going to

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880
anybody can chime in what's it going to
 

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.340
anybody can chime in what's it going to
take to deeply decarbonize the

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:55.350
take to deeply decarbonize the
 

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.400
take to deeply decarbonize the
transportation sector and when what are

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:58.410
transportation sector and when what are
 

00:45:58.410 --> 00:45:59.930
transportation sector and when what are
the what a time lines look like what are

00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940
the what a time lines look like what are
 

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.560
the what a time lines look like what are
the levers that need to be pulled I

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:02.570
the levers that need to be pulled I
 

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:08.120
the levers that need to be pulled I
