&gt;&gt;At the World Economic Forum in Davos every
year, YouTube sets up a

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.860
production base and invites the presidents,
dignitaries, and foreign

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.250
leaders in attendance to stop by and respond
via video to your question

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.520
and ideas about the world's most pressing
challenges.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.840
