00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.530
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Hello everyone.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.040
How are you?

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
Alright.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.290
Yeah, I saw a fist pump out there.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.290
Awesome.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.030
Well welcome everybody and thank you so much
for coming to join today's at Google Authors

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.150
Talk.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.040
Today we are in for a very special treat.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.890
We have Ariane de Bonvoisin, who has joined
us from New York, and she's gonna talk about

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.980
her latest book, it's called The First 30
Days and like I mentioned, they're for sale

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.360
in the back for the bargain price of $5.00.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.130
Thank you Google.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.039
And what she's gonna cover in the book is
really addressing the question, is there a

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.649
way to make change easier?

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.300
I'm sure we're all pondering that and have
pondered that, whether your change or things

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.749
that are going on happen to be about career,
relationships, health, finance, pretty much

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.710
any big life issue.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.519
So Ariane is gonna talk about her nine principles
of change and how that can help anyone out

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.449
in any change that they're going through.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.990
Ariane's written many books and in her past,
previous career before, before being an author,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.850
she actually was in management consulting,
so she comes from a good business background

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.960
and has applied a lot of that to her writing.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.350
She's also ventured into other areas lately,
like developing iphone apps, so you may even

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.490
know that she's coming out with an app called
Mindful365 and you may even be beta testing

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.910
that, if anyone is doing that Ariane is trying
to apply some of these principles into a mobile

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.409
app, which is awesome.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.619
So if you're interested in that you can also
let her know at the end.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.820
And, and what else?

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.960
Ariane is a great avid traveler, she's been
to 60 countries and part of that was a two-year

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.390
hiatus that she took and recently returned
from and had a incredible journey which actually,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.479
little, little spoiler alert here, we're actually
gonna be talking about some of her travel

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.840
later today where she appears in a documentary
film about traveling the Himalayas on a motorcycle,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.569
and it's called The Highest Pass.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.840
So lots going on today with Ariane.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.349
We're very excited to have her.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.709
Please welcome Ariane de Bonvoisin.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.260
[applause]

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.980
&gt;&gt;Ariane: Rachel, thank you.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.040
She does those big acknowledgments.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.760
I know that she's brought a lot of amazing
people here.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.430
And she's hosting me and she, she goes way
and beyond just taking care of authors and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.640
other people, so really thank you, it's a,
it's a blessing.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.260
So we have probably I think about an hour
together.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.700
What I was gonna do is just tell you a little
bit about my story.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.650
Why I'm here and what I'm doing with my life
these days, which is very different, it's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.409
been a big change to what I used to be doing,
and then I'm gonna take you through the nine

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.550
principles of change as quick as I can.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.610
I usually take like three hours or a whole
day to do them, so I'm gonna like speed through

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.439
them and then I'm gonna stick around and take
as many questions as you guys have time for.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.950
And then as I said the film is gonna be screening
I think at 3:30 in the same room.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.670
So if you guys can take an entire day off
work, I'll be [audience laughter] totally

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.299
here for you.

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.299
So with that said you can hear obviously I
have an accent.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.640
It's usually the first question I get asked.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.380
I usually ask people do they any sense of
sort of where I'm from or what the accent

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.380
is?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.380
Anyone wants to guess?

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.989
There's a free book in the back for the guess.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:26.989
No?

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:27.989
Yes.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:28.989
&gt;&gt;male #1: New Zealand.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.299
&gt;&gt;Ariane: New Zealand.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.299
Not.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.170
Anyway I'll make it quick.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.290
I was born in the U.S., believe it or not,
so I'm actually American by birth.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.930
I have a French mother and a Belgian father
and I grew up in six different countries,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.110
so I don't really know where my accent's from.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.790
And depending on who I'm with I sort of the
accent sort of tends to change, but I grew

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.350
up in the U.S., I grew up in Paris, in Brussels,
London, Hong Kong and also in China.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.680
So I think without knowing it my parents were
sort of getting me ready for this lifetime

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.540
career of change, although I just didn't know
it at the time.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.569
But you get exposed to very different schools
and religious environments and cultures and

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.290
food and you name it, you sort of get given
this sort of big trip into change.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.440
And even despite all the change that I've
been given what happened was that I tended

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.910
to do what I would consider the safe route.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.130
So I went to college, I went to the London
School of Economics, graduated first in my

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.400
class, did what I thought was expected of
me.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.960
So I had this sort of big should program on
me.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.210
I should study hard.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.900
I should go to college.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.770
I should go to certain companies.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.370
So the next should was to go into management
consulting.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.560
I studied economics and it felt like it was
just the right next thing to do.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.290
So I joined The Boston Consulting Group and
did a couple years with them.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.660
They sent me all around the world, which made
that experience a little bit easier for me.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.380
But I always kind of had an inkling that something
wasn't quite right.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.930
I kind of knew that it wasn't really what
I was here to be doing.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.650
I sort of shut that voice down for a little
while longer, then I came out here and I went

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.650
to business school.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.690
So I went to Stanford and you know that was
sort of an amazing experience, but I kept

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.960
on sort of saying you know what should I do
with my life?

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.120
That was sort of the big lingering question
in the background.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.750
And I traipsed off to New York City after
that and I spent ten years in the media world.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.310
And I worked at Bertelsmann, I worked at Sony,
I worked at Time/Warner.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.620
And as you can tell I was jumping around a
lot and I kept on trying to sort of figure

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.610
out what is, what is actually right, what,
what am I meant to be doing with my life?

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.970
And I landed at Time/Warner at the age of
28/29 in charge of a $500 million venture

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.240
capital fund.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.880
And I was managing director of this fund and
I was you know supposedly had climbed this

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.350
very high ladder, but I had the sense that
it was the wrong ladder and it was definitely

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.480
leaning up against the wrong wall.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.060
And even though I had this semblance of a
very perfect sort of external life, what started

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.590
happening was that inner microphone that you
all have started going off pretty loudly.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.630
And the inner microphone sounds like this,
"Ariane, you're in the wrong job."

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.280
That was the first inner microphone.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.910
The second inner microphone was, "Ariane,
you're sleeping with the wrong guy."

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.949
[audience laughter] That was the second one.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.410
And I thought, how is it possible that I've
set up this perfect life and none of it's

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.710
right and all of it needs to now change.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.229
So I was about 30/31 and it's a long story,
but I eventually had the courage to leave

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:24.860
that job.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.630
And I actually had no idea what was gonna
come next.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.009
I was sort of in that void and in between
careers and couldn't quite see what, what

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.229
was coming.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.259
And so what I did was I started getting really
honest with myself.

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.650
What was the number one thing that was missing
for me?

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.930
And it was the sense that I wasn't really
making a difference.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.240
I wasn't really adding value, I wasn't really
contributing.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.530
And it's interesting.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.759
If you look at like all the research now going
on in the U.S., the number one reason people

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:55.349
are unhappy at work and people in general
have this sense of slight depression, you

00:06:55.349 --> 00:07:00.069
know Gallup Poll did a poll recently where
more than two-thirds of employees are unhappy

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:01.069
in their work.

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.000
And the number one reason is because people
don't feel that they're actually adding value.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.229
So I was feeling that big time.

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.370
And so I did what I knew best, which is I
went off and I went traveling.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.890
And I started asking myself very different
questions.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.000
So instead of creating this externally perfect
life, I sort of turned my entire focus inwards

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.780
and I started asking very internal questions.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.740
What's worth doing with this life?

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.620
What does Ariane want to do?

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.380
Not my parents, not what was expected of me,
not, not sort of all this external conditioning,

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.380
what I call the tribe.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.690
Where the tribe has sort of told you what
is expected of you.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.099
And it was while I was traveling I sort of
had this one question to life.

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:40.190
Show me the way.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.190
Show me the way.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.190
Show me what's next.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.330
Show me what I'm meant to be doing.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.669
And I sort of walked around a few different
countries with sort of antenna on my head.

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:52.870
And I was just looking for signs and synchronicities
and things that could give me a clue.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:58.400
And what I realized was that every single
person I was meeting was in one of three categories

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.630
and all of you are in this as well.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.780
They were either going through some sort of
a change.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.400
They were either thinking about making a change,
but had some sort of excuse or something going

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.639
on in the way.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:11.520
Or they were helping someone with a change.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.889
So it was a spouse or a friend or a partner
or a child or a colleague.

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:19.390
And then I found out later through I was giving
a speech somewhere else and someone said,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.390
no, there's a fourth category.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.699
And I was like, bring it on.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:26.240
And the fourth category, which some of us
are all guilty of, is we're waiting for someone

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.169
else to change, not us.

00:08:28.169 --> 00:08:31.240
[audience laughter] We're waiting for someone
else to change, it has nothing to do with

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.240
us.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.260
But it was interesting that this change thing
was all around me.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.170
And I met people who were, had gotten divorced.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.130
And I met people who had just you know lost
a parent.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.580
And I met people who had just found out their
child was autistic.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.020
And I met people who were getting through
depression.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.270
And I met people who had just lost their job.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.780
But it was like this change thing was all
around me and I thought, isn't it interesting

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.940
that change is the number one guarantee in
life.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.930
JFK said it's the law of life, and yet no
one knows how to go through it.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.320
And I thought there must be ways to make change
easier.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.580
Like we, we're all going through it.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.830
I personally believe it's the most important
life skill to get good at.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.650
As parents we protect our kids from change.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.840
We definitely do not throw them into change.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.910
The less change, the more stable.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.310
The more calm the more you think you're doing
your kids a favor, which is not the case.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.910
And as adults we walk into the world and we're
thrown with so much change and we actually

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.470
don't have the skills to sort of navigate
it.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.940
So what I sort of started thinking was what
happens if I interviewed people and just sort

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.600
of started listening to why is it that you're
good at change and someone else has a really

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.710
hard time?

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.540
Why is it that some of you are thinking about
a change and others of you have actually gone

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.540
on and done that?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.160
And it was fascinating to me that some of
us were naturally good at change and others

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160
weren't.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.390
Were men better at change than women?

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.770
So it sort of, it sort of descended on me
it's like just go research this.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.670
It wasn't sort of, this is your next job or
this is what you're gonna be meant to be doing

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.850
with your life.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.320
And so I started interviewing people and I
found, in effect, that there were ways to

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.210
make change easier.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:09.210
So what I wanted to do is, I'm gonna take
you through these nine principles.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:15.750
What I did eventually was I did write a book
about it, right over here, The First 30 Days.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.790
I called it The First 30 Days because I wanted
people to get a sense that it just it takes

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:27.010
more than just sort of the action plan or
the three things to do or you know here is

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.980
how you start a business, here is how you
leave a job you don't like.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.850
There's actually sort of emotions that you
need to actually go through when you go through

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.850
change.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.560
I started a website as well that goes with
it first30days.com.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.840
But what I wanted to say before I take you
through the nine principles, three things.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.220
Most of us when we think about change we think
about external changes.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.140
When we're gonna meet the soul mate.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.140
When we're gonna get married.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.140
When we're gonna have kids.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.250
When we're gonna have the big promotion.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.810
The most effective and the most important
changes you will ever make in your life are

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.070
internal changes.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.640
Changes about how you see yourself.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.770
Changes about your identity.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.670
Changes about who you decide to forgive.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.670
Changes about who you decide to get honest
with.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.621
Internal changes, the identity of who you
are and who you see yourself to be, those

00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:18.960
are the changes that change everything.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.640
It's not when the external changes happen.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.600
You're gonna see that through the nine principles
that came out very, very strongly.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.030
The second thing is change is all about getting
comfortable with the unknown.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:35.160
It's not about clinging to here's how it's
gonna be or here's how someone else's experience

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.820
was and that's what it's gonna be.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.180
It's all about getting comfortable with that
void of actually not knowing how it's gonna

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.200
be.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.060
And the third thing is the very best of who
you are comes out during times of change.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.160
It does not come out when everything is really
certain and perfect.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.220
The very, your core essence is actually to
go through changes.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.680
When you're comfortable, that's when life
feels quite dull.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.750
When you're actually going through things,
that's when like there's life force, there's

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.710
juice that's actually coming through you.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.590
So the invitation is to sort of you know give
you a sense of well, where are you on the

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.060
change spectrum?

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.210
So to do that I'm just gonna throw out a few
questions whether you wanna ask them in your

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:19.830
head or write them down is sort of up to you,
but, and I do this with all the groups I talk

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:20.880
to.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.910
The first question is, naturally, do you think
you are good at change?

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.690
Yes or no?

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:27.690
What comes up?

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.050
Are you, are you a change optimist?

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.930
Do you move towards change or you're like
I'm so not a change person?

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.900
If things never change I'd be much happier
the way it is.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:43.390
Second question, do you feel you are better
at making changes or at facing changes that

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.550
come your way?

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.910
Are you one that naturally goes after a new
change or are you actually really good when

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.290
life just goes handle it, deal with it?

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.000
Because it's two very different types of people.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.940
You know most people can kind of go I'm really
good at change and they're really good in

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.000
the crisis.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.040
But if you actually asked them what are changes
they'd love to make, they don't go close to

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.040
them.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.690
That's the second question.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.560
Third question, just to give you a sense of
what I call your change history.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.540
You know, the core of who you are, are all
the changes you've ever made, been through,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.880
faced, witnessed other people going through.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880
That's it.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.000
You know you, you are a walking combination
of all the changes you've had the courage

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.680
to make and get through.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.560
What is the very best change you've ever made?

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.010
It could have been to get married.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.690
It could have been to finally get divorced.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.980
It could have been to have children.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.550
It could have been to come and work here.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.760
It could have been to finally listen to that
inner microphone and go, you know what, I

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.820
hate this job, it's killing my soul, I can't
do this anymore.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.250
It could have been to quit smoking.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.460
It could have been to lose weight.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.100
It could have been to take care of an elderly
parent.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.180
What's the very best change, when you've,
you see the consequences of what happened?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:58.750
It might have been super hard at the time,
but what was the best change?

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.390
Next one, you can guess which one's coming
now.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.010
What is the hardest change you've ever been
through?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.890
Hardest change you've ever been through?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.250
Seeing a parent be depressed.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.630
Losing a loved one.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.580
Something going on with a child.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.610
Being fired.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.700
You know there's so many, you know being wrongly
accused about something.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.830
The hardest change you've ever been through?

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.690
And then the final question is what is a change
that you, you've been thinking about making?

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.690
You'd love to make?

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.050
There, there's something where you'd like
you know I'd love to take time off.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.160
I'd love to start my own business.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.600
I'd love to ask someone to marry me.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.610
I'd love to have a child.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.650
And then ask yourself what is, what's in the
way of you making that change?

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.060
Because having interviewed maybe a couple
of thousand people by now about change, there's

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.570
only a certain amount of excuses that I've
heard of.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.040
So I'm gonna run a few of them through and
if you guys have new excuses you can throw

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.250
them at me.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.700
Excuses why people don't make changes.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.920
One, I don't have time.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.160
Another one I hear all the time is, it's gonna
cost money.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.560
Another one is I'm too old.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.260
On the flip side, I'm too young.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.450
Another one which I hear a lot is, it's not
my nature, I'm not the sort of guy that does

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.630
this or I'm not the sort of girl that does
this.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.390
That's the identity change, right?

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.980
The hardest change you'll ever make is an
identity change of how you see yourself.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.860
You go from being a business person, myself,
to being more of a creative person.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.220
That's an incredibly difficult change to eventually
make.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.340
But it's not my nature.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.240
Another one is, someone's gonna disapprove.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.810
Very big excuse.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.500
Someone's gonna be upset with me.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.280
Someone's gonna be disappointed.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.020
Someone's gonna think I'm crazy.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.020
It could be a parent.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.020
It could be a partner.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.890
But someone is really gonna get in the way
and sort of go, no, you can't do that, 'cause

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.320
it's gonna threaten them as well.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.850
But someone's gonna disapprove.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.640
Another one that I, I hear a lot is that you
know it's just not worth it.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.780
I'm comfortable.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.780
I'm in a safe place.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.780
I'm in a safe environment.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.800
I'm in a safe job.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.940
I'm in a safe marriage.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.470
There's this safety thing that again people
are not really willing.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.260
So whatever the excuse is for you, just keep
it in mind.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.940
You know a lot of this is just bringing out
of your blind spot things that are actually

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.010
running the change show that you've probably
never really considered.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:24.420
So having said that I'm gonna just jump in
and, and dive right into these nine principles.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.990
So these came from as I said about 2,000 interviews,
people all around the world, every country

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.320
I would go to, I'd sit next to someone on
a plane or I'd sit, you know, and actually

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.790
have a proper formal interview and tape them.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:40.140
And I would ask them, you know, a selection
of questions and just try and elicit what

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.830
made change easier.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.950
So what you're gonna hear in these nine principles
is some of them are incredibly obvious.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.490
Some of them are very basic and very simple.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.670
And it is always the simple things that we
don't do.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.950
We're much better doing complicated things.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.160
We're really not very good at doing the obvious,
simple things.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.760
So as you hear some of these, just ask yourself,
is this one of the principles I'm actually

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.450
pretty good at or should I take a note and
actually work a little bit?

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.370
Some of them you're gonna be already great
at.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:10.280
So the first principle of change, people who
successfully navigate change have positive

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.280
beliefs.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.920
That's it.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.050
If I had to build a house in front of you
here and I had to lay the bricks of the foundation

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.660
of how and why people go through change, your
beliefs are the number one thing that are

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.000
gonna either make this easier or more difficult.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.370
What do I mean about beliefs?

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:27.990
Beliefs about three different things.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:33.880
Beliefs about yourself, beliefs about life,
and beliefs about the specific change that

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.280
you're either making or going to be facing.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.190
Let's throw out beliefs about yourself.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.680
Most of us have terrible beliefs about ourselves.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.510
Most of all, most of us are in poor me.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.500
Or you know you're living small.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.950
Or you're playing the victim.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.810
Or you're blaming someone else.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:57.040
The average person disapproves of themselves
between 50 and 65 times a day.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.500
A day.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.660
That's how bad the mental dialog is, you know?

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.570
So just being aware of what are the worst
things that I keep telling myself?

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.170
Because you're not even aware of them.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.700
I usually invite people to do what I call
a 24-hour disapproval challenge, which is

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.950
for the next 24 hours, just catch yourself
every time you disapprove.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.070
What you said, what you did, what you ate,
what you didn't eat, what you should have

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:24.720
said in a meeting, what you sent as an e-mail,
what you wore, what, whatever it is.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.100
How long you slept.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.660
The wrong route that you choose in traffic.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.410
What, just be aware of the level of mental
chatter that is going on.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.520
But the beliefs that you have about yourself,
you're either giving yourself a green light

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.730
to walk or you're actually consistently holding
yourself back.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:44.620
But the disapproval is probably one of the
biggest fundamental stumbling blocks when

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.590
people are going through change.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.590
Beliefs about life.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.850
This is one of the juiciest ones that I really
like.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.750
When I was interviewing people, I could always
notice that when people where talking about

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.470
change, somehow they believed that life was
on their side.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:04.040
So Einstein said it much better than I did,
the most important decision you'll ever make

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.450
in your life is to decide whether you live
in a friendly universe or an unfriendly universe.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.450
That's it.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.490
The most important decision you'll ever make
in your life, is life on your side, is life

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.360
against you?

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.770
Are you lucky, are you unlucky?

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.550
Is life pissing you off, one more obstacle,
one more challenge?

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:28.150
Or is life actually giving you challenges
because it's moving you in the right direction?

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.150
That is it.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.970
Whichever way you go you will have two very
different lives.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:38.510
You know people who have a very optimistic
view of even though life tragedies, really

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.730
tough stuff has happened, positive things
have sort of come on from those people.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.800
I don't know which one you guys are.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.080
But if there's one thing to look at, is, is
life your partner, is life against you?

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.760
Because life will be very different.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.760
And then the third one is looking at well
what's the specific change that's actually

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.760
happening for you?

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.190
You know you have beliefs about changing jobs.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.020
You have beliefs about getting divorced.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.930
You have beliefs about losing weight.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.790
Actually looking at where are those beliefs
from?

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.450
Who's told you those things?

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.540
You need to consciously choose what it is
that those beliefs are about.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:17.290
The one thing that you'll see in, in, in this
first principle is that when people are good

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:22.100
at change, they are very committed to one
thing, which is they're committed to finding

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.220
inside what the lesson is when they're going
through change.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.410
External change happens.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.410
What do we do?

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.420
We try and run and fix the outside.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.070
It's a very external thing.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.700
It's never about what to do on the outside.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.390
It's about checking in what's going on on
the inside.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.840
What's my lesson here?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.390
Why is this happening?

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.340
How am I self responsible?

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.870
Which is not something we like looking at.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.450
It's always, you know, the energy goes out.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.260
People who are gonna change are very inwardly
focused.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.090
It's a very sort of what I call a deep looking
experiment.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.180
If you're going through a change right now
or you're looking at making a change, make

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.800
it from the inside out.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.120
It's not about figuring out how to move the
pieces on the outside.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.280
Ok.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.280
Principle number two.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.590
Another one of my favorites.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.060
Principle number two is what I call the change
guarantee.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:19.670
The change guarantee states this: From this
situation, from this change, something good

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.920
will come.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.660
That's it.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.310
I have it written all over my office.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.000
I've given it to all our employees.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.080
I have it in my car.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.830
I have it in my bathroom so that when that
change happens, when the e-mail comes in and

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.470
something starts changing, when the phone
call comes in, when the person comes in and

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:40.560
says something to you and you go into your
normal change emotions, which we're gonna

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.940
talk about, if the first thing you can go
to is, from this change something good will

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.200
come, you start moving in that direction of
what the blessing is.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.250
If you go into, you know, bad things are happening,
this is really challenging, you're actually

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.520
gonna get more of that.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.510
I teach this principle to kids and somehow
adults really complicate this.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.000
Kids get this immediately.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.940
Something's changing and they can immediately
go to well something not necessarily better

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.370
but something good is gonna come from this.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.590
Why is change so hard?

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.220
Because we cling to our plans.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.260
We are obsessed with our plans.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.670
We're addicted, if you have one addiction,
it's to the way you think your life needs

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:22.850
to be going.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.760
I'm gonna be married by this age, I'm gonna
have this job and this money and this house

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.810
and life goes, uh-uh, and then we all go into
suffering.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:37.400
It's not about life moving the pieces, it's
about clinging and being so attached to life

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.440
going in the my way direction.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.520
If you can just sort of relax into life and
just go you know what, life maybe has my best

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.690
interest at heart.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.600
Life somehow has always guided me in the right
way.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.690
But unloosening from the gripping and the
clinging, that's the thing that makes you

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.780
suffer through change.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.350
It's not actually the change itself.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.060
The change guarantee, you know, when, when
we go through change the first question we

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.050
go to is why?

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.760
Why did this happen?

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.420
Why did this happen to me?

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.110
You know, why do I now need to have the courage
to do this?

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.710
The question is never about why.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.360
The question is always about how to be.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360
How to be.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.960
How, what in me needs to shift?

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.700
What in me needs to change?

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.720
Not external changes.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720
Change guarantee.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.590
If you can write it down, as I said you know
you get what you focus on.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:31.990
So the more focused you are on actually finding
the positive, the more your mind is actually

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.550
gonna go looking for that.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.980
You move into that direction.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.980
Something good will come.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.980
Change guarantee.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.530
Third principle.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:44.309
Third principle is what I've affectionately
called the change muscle.

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:50.680
People who are good at change are, they have
the sense that no matter what, they're strong,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.559
they're resilient, they're capable, they can
get through anything, despite what they've

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.690
been told.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.360
Despite what their parents told them.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.330
Despite what society tells them.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:04.240
Despite what people tell them they should
be doing at their particular age or in a particular

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.240
way.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.400
There's this sense of, you know what, I know
that I'm gonna get through it, no matter what

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.020
it is that life throws my way.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:16.930
And I can tell you every single one of you
in this room has gone through dozens and dozens

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.610
of life changes.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:19.610
Here's the difference.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.520
Most of you have never acknowledged yourself
for any of them.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.620
Because when you were in them, you were so
busy trying to get through them that you never

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.200
sort of looked back and kind of go, hey, I'm
the girl that changed jobs.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.200
You know?

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.200
Good old me.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.340
Or hey, I'm the girl that lost a ton of weight.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.730
Or I'm the guy that finally had the courage
to get divorced and go be with the woman that

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:40.730
I love.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.730
Whatever it is.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.420
But you have never acknowledged yourself for
all the changes you've already made.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:53.090
But your body has the sense of knowing how
to change.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.900
Your body has a sense of knowing already how
to change.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.270
So even though the change you're thinking
about making or the change that might be in

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:04.170
front of you now looks like a new change,
the body goes, oh a new change, new change,

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.750
I've no idea what to do with this new change,
and that's not true.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:12.600
You have a tool box already in place of how
to go through change.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.100
If you could, you know, when I have more time
with people, I take people through what I

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.840
call their change resume, which is much more
effective and important than your professional

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.030
resume that we spend our whole life putting
together.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:29.500
Your change resume are all the changes you've
made, all the changes life has thrown at you,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.970
all the changes you've had to help other people
with and there are ways that you get through

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:34.970
change.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.890
They're different for every one of you.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:42.390
Most of you have a rock solid belief that
helps you no matter what go through change.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.930
And knowing what that is is super valuable.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:52.490
So it could be this too shall pass, it's just
if I give this enough time, time heals all

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:53.490
things.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.210
Or I know someone can help me with this change.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:57.510
Or you pray more.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.640
You know a lot of people go to their spiritual
path when they're going through a life change.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.390
But there is a core belief that you go through
no matter what when you're going through a

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.740
life change.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.040
Bring that out of your blind spot.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.210
Think about the difficult changes you've made
in the past and what is actually the things

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.490
that you took with you?

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.190
Because getting in touch with what is, what
activates your change muscle.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.280
But we, we play so small.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.030
We keep thinking we're not as strong, not
as powerful, not as effective.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.360
We, you know we shrink at the first sight
of fear.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.500
But just getting a sense like the people I
interviewed.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.950
I interviewed people who had gone through
real traumatic things in Africa and you name

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:37.950
it.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:44.010
And there was this sense of not education,
not money, not what their parents had told

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.800
them, there was this core fundamental inner
strength that just radiated out of them and

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.400
we're all born with it.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.690
And it's not a, it's not a matter of like
going to find it.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.690
It's a matter of uncovering what's blocking
it.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.690
Right?

00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:59.690
We've all been given it.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.920
It's just the light that needs to sort of
come though what is in the way, what's in

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.920
the way?

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.920
Maybe it's a belief.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.860
Maybe it's a wound or a past change that you
still sort of are trying to get through.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.380
But just realizing you know that the level
of your change muscle, your body is born to

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.380
change.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.860
Your body is on your side when you go through
change.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.940
Your body is changing every second of every
day.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.429
It has to change, right, to keep, to survive.

00:27:23.429 --> 00:27:24.429
Principle number four.

00:27:24.429 --> 00:27:26.540
Gotta have a swig of water.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:32.270
Principle number four is a juicy one, very
juicy.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.610
It's what I call your change demons.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:40.120
Your change demons are all the emotions that
are guaranteed to show up when you are going

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.590
through a life change.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.270
So they're gonna walk themselves in the door
and if I tell you what they are you can be

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:50.210
a little bit more prepared when they sort
of walk in for the party.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:55.800
What I would invite you to do is invite them
in, but don't feed them, and do not entertain

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.250
them, and do not welcome their friends in
even more, because when we feel one emotion

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.870
as human beings we tend to stack three more.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.150
Like we're really good stackers.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.170
Oh, I'm feeling a bit anxious.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.390
Oh, and I'm gonna feel, you know, three more
negative things on top of that.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.059
Somehow we do that as human beings.

00:28:13.059 --> 00:28:17.170
Here's what I've found before I tell you what
these change demons were, which is the most

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.059
core important message of this principle.

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:22.929
People who are good at change are very emotional.

00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:25.020
They are not practical.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.970
They don't go in their to do list.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.200
And here are the three ways to get divorced.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.190
They feel their emotions much more deeply
than people who don't get through the change.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:39.890
People who eat the emotions away, or work
the emotions away or TV or Facebook the emotions

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:40.900
away.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.360
People who are good at change are much more
emotional.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.400
So if you are emotional, you actually can
give yourself a gold star right now.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.140
For once it's actually not a bad thing.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.929
People who are good at change have a humanity
about them.

00:28:52.929 --> 00:28:54.570
They allow themselves to be human.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:59.250
They allow themselves to sort of go, you know
what, I didn't get the manual on how to deal

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.950
with you know my child being sick.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.840
I didn't get the manual on how to deal with
my mother being depressed.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.290
But there is a permission to be human.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.120
If you are helping anyone going through a
change, this is probably the most important

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.120
principle.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.690
Allow people to feel their emotions.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.950
Don't change them.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.380
Don't offer them drinks.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.380
Just allow, be a refuge for people who are
going through change.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.380
That was very interesting, because my sense
when I was looking for the principles was

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.620
ok there's things that people are doing that
are making them better at change.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.740
And it wasn’t, there are things that people
are feeling that make them much better at

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.740
change.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.390
They're feeling the fear.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:42.870
Because eventually every emotion you feel
is actually gonna leave the body.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.860
If you don't want to feel it, guess what,
it's kind of there all the time.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:51.810
If you wake up in the morning, you feel one
of these emotions and you eat it away, I guarantee

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.020
you at 4:00 you're still eating it away.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:59.770
I always ask this question, because it's interesting
to find out, there is an emotion in every

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.080
one of us that we do everything to avoid having
to feel.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.080
Everything.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.380
And we think we're not feeling it.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.050
And the reality is that is the emotion that
is ruling your life.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:14.570
It's the emotion that's constantly going on.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.720
Why you do what you do.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.770
Who you date.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.770
What you eat.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:23.260
Where you work is constantly being decided
by this one emotion you don't wanna feel.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.480
Humiliation, embarrassment, not getting it
right, not getting not being perfect.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.400
Whatever it is for you, but there's one emotion
that is holding you back in every area of

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.400
your life.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.050
It's actually not allowing you to move forward
in any way, so get in touch with what is,

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.180
what's the one thing that I think I've kinda
got under control.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.789
And the way to do it is to actually just allow
it up.

00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:44.789
Speak to it.

00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:45.789
What's the message?

00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:46.910
Why is it actually here?

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:52.040
So you've been super patient, so here are
the six change demons in no particular order.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.910
These can sort of show up in different ways
for different people and you know there is

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.320
a lot of pages in the book about particular
change demons.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.670
The first one is obviously fear.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.470
Fear of the unknown.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.920
Fear of the change being permanent.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.920
Big one.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.790
Fear of taking it personally.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.540
I'm responsible for this change.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.710
This happened to me.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.840
This change says something negative about
me.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.640
But fear, there's so many different fears
that can sort of get involved.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.140
For every change demon, what I did with people
is I said ok, so you're in the fear, what

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.750
actually moved you through the fear?

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.870
So there was what I called this antidote that
had to be bigger than the fear which eventually

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.010
they would go to.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.260
The antidote to fear is faith.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.260
Faith in yourself.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.990
Faith in your change muscle.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.631
Faith in someone else being able to help you.

00:31:35.631 --> 00:31:37.670
Faith in time.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.690
Faith in something greater.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.980
But there's this level of what can be bigger
than the fear?

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.330
I'm still gonna allow the fear to show up,
but what's gonna be bigger than the fear?

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.560
The next change demon was doubt.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.800
Closely related friend or twin, but the next
change demon was doubt.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.710
Doubt of what's gonna happen now.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.730
Doubt around money.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.110
Doubt around ever finding another lover.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.170
Doubt around you know when to have children.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.429
Doubt, whatever it was.

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:04.000
Doubt around getting better and healing.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.830
I interviewed a lot of people who had health
diagnoses.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.620
The antidote to doubt is always surrender.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:16.260
Because trying to make plans and certainty
with your mind is exhausting.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.260
It's exhausting.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.770
And it's never gonna work out the way your
perfectly beautiful mind thinks it's gonna

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:21.770
work out.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.260
It's tiring.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:28.900
The mind chatter of planning and strategizing
and how's it gonna be and how's it gonna work?

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.880
If you can just let go and kind of go again,
life's gonna work this out.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.080
I'm gonna take action, but I'm gonna take
action with a still mind, not a really, really

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.860
busy hectic mind.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.590
That's when people get through change.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.280
It's not that you're stuck in paralysis and
just going surrender, you know, life can kind

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.630
of do it all for me.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.710
You're still taking action, but from a still
surrendered place.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.400
You're taking it from a humble place.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.250
I actually don't know how it's gonna turn
out.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:59.410
You know actually being able to own it and
sort of go actually I don't know.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.990
It's a very powerful statement.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.679
Much more so than you know most of us educated
have ever been told that we should be able

00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:07.090
to say that.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:11.990
The antidote to, the antidote, I've just done
that so doubt and surrender.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.340
The next one is blame.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:19.200
When change happens there is always one person
that we blame.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.350
And it could be your boss and it could be
your colleague and it could be your child

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:26.740
and it could be your spouse and it could be
yourself, but there's always someone that

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:31.670
takes the blame, because it's really hard
to get into self responsibility when you're

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.059
in the middle of change.

00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:35.490
How could this possibly be my thing?

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:39.820
What do you mean, like I'm responsible for
this thing that happened to me?

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:44.330
I can guarantee you, if you wanna get through
a life change, the quicker you go into self

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:50.170
responsibility, it doesn't mean other people
don't have their share of self responsibility,

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:55.790
but if there's one overarching theme, this
deep looking, this self responsibility, if

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.090
you want to get through change quicker, that's
what you need to go to.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:03.050
So the antidote to blame is always self responsibility.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:06.460
There's something in there for you and it's
gonna be a beautiful lesson when you give

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.619
it and once the ego kind of takes a little
bit of a break.

00:34:10.619 --> 00:34:13.679
And the next change demon is impatience.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:18.389
When we go through change time wrecks havoc
with us.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.810
The change seems to last forever.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.679
Time, you know, seems to not be moving.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.860
You want to speed it up.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.220
You do, you make bad decisions to speed up
the change.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:33.119
You send e-mails way too quickly to send speed
up the change because the uncomfortableness

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:37.359
of staying in the middle of the change is
not something we want to be in.

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:43.240
Sometimes just waiting five minutes will actually
have some different things show up in the

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.610
change puzzle, whatever it is.

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:48.050
But we're very impulsive, so we're very impatient.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.250
We're not willing to see what's in the gap.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:55.280
We're not willing to see what new people are
gonna walk into our life, what new opportunities,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.510
what new ideas are gonna show up.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.820
But allowing yourself to be in that sort of
zone.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:04.010
The antidote to impatience, believe it or
not, is not patience.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.800
The antidote to impatience is endurance.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.800
It's actually just having the courage to keep
going.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.359
The sort of determination will always get
you through.

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:14.520
Having the courage to keep going.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.680
It's not this sort of like, oh like I'm gonna
be super patient with life here.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.040
No, do what you need to do, what's on your
plate.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.220
The next two change demons.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.600
One, the, one of them is guilt.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.100
And this applies a lot more to women than
men.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.570
Somehow men tend to not have the guilt gene.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.310
But guilt is women's middle name for some
reason.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.050
You feel guilty that you were fired.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.670
You feel guilty that you messed up the presentation.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.200
You feel guilty that you're sick.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.840
You feel guilty that you're overweight.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.310
You feel guilty that you can't stop smoking.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.320
You feel guilty that your child isn't doing
well at school.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.320
Whatever it is.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.720
But somehow there's this sense of like, it's
my fault, which is very different than self

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.190
responsibility.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.810
Self responsibility is this is my piece and
this is your piece.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:01.750
It's not it's now all on me and by the way
you're gonna take the last 10, 20, 30 years

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.330
of your life and still kind of hold it with
you.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.190
The antidote to guilt is always forgiveness.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.970
It goes back to this, people are gonna change,
they're human.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.210
You need to let it go.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:17.470
It's this sense of the more I'm carrying from
the past, the less change is now available

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.930
for me coming forward in the future.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:23.930
But this, this sense of what do I need to
let go of?

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.210
We all have our list what do we need to let
go of.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.880
Who do I need to forgive?

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.910
It's such a big question.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:33.740
What in me do I need to forgive?

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.300
Huge question.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.350
We don't really want to go there.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:41.020
We're sort of like busy and doing and we don't
kind of want to see that that's one of the

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.300
things that's really kind of holding us back.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.869
And the last one is very closely related,
which is shame.

00:36:46.869 --> 00:36:51.740
When people go through change, this level
of shame comes through them.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:57.570
And it's very basic and it's very core emotion
and people don't talk about it very much.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:01.400
But we feel ashamed that we don't have as
much money as we'd like.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.570
Or that we aren't in the best of health.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:07.460
Or that we aren't the greatest parent.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:11.030
But there's this level of shame that no one
really wants to look at.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:15.250
Or we're ashamed that we had breast cancer
or prostate cancer or that you know we're

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.580
not as effective as we thought we should.

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.630
The antidote to shame is always honor.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:25.330
It's sort of stepping into that place and
go I am the person that got fired.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.720
I'm the person that is sick.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:33.030
But just owning it in a place of being powerful
about it actually moves you through the change.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:37.650
The ignoring of it, the hoping no one ever
sees it and no one ever addresses it actually

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.950
just keeps the change constantly running the
show in the background.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:41.970
So that's change demons.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.080
I could say a lot more, but I'm gonna have
to move on.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.570
Principle number five is what I call the principle
of acceptance.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:56.740
So people who are good at change have no resistance
to the actual change that's going on.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.990
When if you're in the midst of a change, the
thing that's making the change painful is

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.520
the amount of saying no to the change.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520
Any change.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520
Small change.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.520
Big change.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.840
The level of pushing the change away is what
makes the change so difficult.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.030
So if you're, if you're in a work change and
something's happening, the quicker you can

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:22.580
get to I accept this change, which is very
different than I like this change, right?

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.750
I'm not saying you need to like the change.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:29.000
But being able to step in and kind of go,
I accept it, allows you to be able to move

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
forward.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.359
This is another favorite quote of mine is
by a woman called Byron Katie and she said

00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:43.180
you know when you when you argue with reality
you lose, but only 100% of the time.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.460
And we argue with reality every single day
in so many ways.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.510
We argue with reality with people.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.920
We constantly want people to be different.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.490
Have you noticed that?

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:54.490
Constantly.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.620
We're waiting for someone else to change.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.980
You're waiting for your mother to change.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.250
You're waiting for your parents to change.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.970
You're waiting for your colleagues or your
boss to change.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:06.170
There's this constant arguing with reality
of who you know people to be.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:07.480
No more.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.990
There's an arguing of reality of what's going
on in the external environment.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:15.680
Do you know the energy it takes to argue with
reality all the time?

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.480
It's like being in a flowing river, where
you know life is taking you exactly on the

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.710
journey you're supposed to be on.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:29.380
And when you, when life changes, or when you
know reality drops in, you do one of two things.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:33.800
You're in the flowing river, you hang on to
the first rock or boulder, right?

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.210
I'm not gonna go forward.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.090
I don't like what this relationship's now
gonna look at.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.840
I don't like what this work is now gonna possibly
be.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.270
So you're kind of holding, you're resisting
where life is actually already gonna take

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.560
you.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.340
Or you might be in another category.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.800
You start rowing back upstream.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.240
I want the body back.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.750
I want the relationship back.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.870
I want the money back that I lost in the stock
market.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.900
So there's a sense of like going backwards.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.470
But when you're not in a place of sort of
I'm accepting the way it is, you're either

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.720
stuck in the paralysis or you're living in
the past.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.230
It's one of those two things.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:13.210
But it's never you know it's not the actual
change that's hard, again it's the energy

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.970
that you had invested in, my life is gonna
look/be a certain way.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:23.710
So you know I always ask the question, what
is the one change or the one thing in your

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.060
life that you still have not accepted?

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.680
Because that also has tremendous power over
you.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.060
You know is it something someone said?

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.590
Is it something someone did?

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.540
What's that one thing that you really need
to accept?

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.620
Something about yourself?

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.720
Something you still feel you know, I should
be different.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.210
We all, we have such a should program on us.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:45.750
We have a should program.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.810
We have a comparison program.

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.950
We have a competition program on us.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.960
We're, we're covered in programs.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:57.190
And one of those programs is basically holding
you very hostage of you not being able to

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.220
move forward when a change happens.

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.340
[sound of drinking water]

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:08.570
Just so you know, the three most dominant
programs you have as human beings, this comes

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.830
from years of research, are three things.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.480
The first one is love and approval.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.770
The second one is control.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.130
And the third one is safety.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:24.400
Everything you do is to meet one of these
three programs.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.869
Why you work here.

00:41:25.869 --> 00:41:28.560
Who you're married to or why you're single.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.530
Why you eat or take care of your health the
way you do is to meet one of these three programs.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.740
You, you can see it in your colleagues and
your friends.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.890
What is their dominant program?

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.710
Are they love and approval seekers?

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:45.650
Are they control people or I call them freaks?

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.410
Are they safety people?

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.410
Safe.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:49.410
Safe.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:50.410
Safe.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.410
Right?

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.410
Everything needs to be safe.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.040
If you can just see what is the dominant program
even in the people you work with and the people

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.599
you live with, you can meet them much more
at what is their dominant program.

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:02.010
They're wired this way.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:08.170
And the thing you need to remember is once
you know what your own program is, most people,

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:13.350
for example if they are in love and approval,
they will do anything to get love and approval.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:19.000
And the paradox with life is, the more you
move towards it, the more it moves away.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.490
So the more I want love and approval, the
more it walks out the door.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:26.300
The more I don't really need love and approval,
the more life kind of gives you it in bucket

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.300
loads.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:31.470
The more you try and control life, you try
and control people, your environment, the

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:35.380
project, the work, the more control moves
away from you.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.010
So being aware of what is your dominant program.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:42.650
Because when life changes, it hits one of
these three programs.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:47.990
Either love and approval's been chopped by
someone or something, your control's gone

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:53.400
out the door and you don't feel safe, but
one of them is most obvious.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.430
And being able to rest in and remember, the
more I try and get safe, the more I'm gonna

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.970
feel unsafe.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.609
That's all just on that particular point,
just remember.

00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:06.869
And start noticing in other people, oh that
behavior is really about you know control

00:43:06.869 --> 00:43:11.369
or it's really about safety, leading me right
into the next one.

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:16.660
Principle number six are the things you can
control when you're going through a life change.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:20.690
So when things change everything feels very
out of control.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.530
And as I said earlier, we do one thing.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:26.090
We try and sort of change things on the outside.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.930
The only thing you can control is your inner
world.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.340
What do I mean by that specifically?

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.360
Your language and words.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.540
The questions you ask yourself.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.830
The stories you tell yourself and other people.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.540
That's what I got from the people that I interviewed.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.040
So I'll give you an example.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.070
I interviewed people who had lost their jobs.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.580
The language that they used.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.310
The words that they used.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.940
Of people that got through the change and
people who didn't.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:03.040
People who are good at change do not use words
like disaster, nightmare, worst day ever,

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.030
crazy, horrific week.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.800
They don't have that language.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.780
They have a very different vocabulary.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.660
So one of the things I'd invite you to look
at, whether you're going through a change

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.780
or you're not at this point, are what are
your go-to words?

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.630
Like where are you sloppy with your words?

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:24.470
Where are you sort of just quite casual about
throwing out very negatively charged emotional

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:25.859
words?

00:44:25.859 --> 00:44:28.820
In work, in your personal environment, towards
yourself.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.270
Because again, having the awareness of and
if you don't I can guarantee your friends

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:36.430
and colleagues can tell you because you use
these words all the time, you're not even

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:37.450
aware of them.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:42.920
But where, where's just be very, have a finesse
about what the words are.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.040
People who are good at change use words like
opportunity, lesson, this is a challenge,

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.380
you know I'm really being asked to step up
and look at something differently, but they

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.090
don't have this negative tirade of words.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:55.880
Same thing with questions.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.480
You know if you ask your mind a question,
it's gonna answer it.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.850
So if you go why did this happen to me?

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:02.990
Why am I so unlucky?

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.450
Why is this guy such a jerk?

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.240
Why is this a woman such a whatever?

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.810
Your mind's gonna answer that and you're gonna
kind of feel ok well that must be the truth

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.180
because my mind answered it.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.380
People who are good at change have a very
different level of questions.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.730
How can this be a good thing?

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:21.570
How can I find some humor in this, this is
so crazy?

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.400
Who can help me?

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.340
Great question to ask yourself when you're
going through a change, which is not your

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.310
typical normal question.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:31.250
You do have control over the questions that
you keep asking yourself.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:38.070
And the final thing you can control, which
is so powerful, are the stories you tell yourself.

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:41.090
We are a walking library of stories.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:46.800
You have a story about yourself, your weight
or why you can't lose it, how you are at work,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:51.161
about men, about women, about your parents,
about why they're together, about why they

00:45:51.161 --> 00:45:55.690
got divorced, about religion, about, you have
a story about everything.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.590
You actually are a walking library of stories.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.880
Your stories are not the facts.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.609
Your stories are a story about what happened.

00:46:03.609 --> 00:46:08.020
But there's again an addiction to sort of
holding on to here is the library of my life

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.430
and no one's gonna touch it.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.150
If you want a new story of any kind.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:14.570
If you want a new change.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:18.660
If you want a, if you're going through a change
and you want to look at it differently, you

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:23.730
need to take one of these stories and actually
create some space in your library for a new

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.210
story, not hold the story.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:31.570
If you don't know what your stories are, again
I guarantee you, just ask your friends or

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.910
people you work with.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:35.300
You have a story about why you're single.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.500
You have a story about why you can't lose
weight.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:42.390
And I promise you, your friends are bored
with your story.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.880
And I know this from very personal experience.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.240
I used to have stories about being single.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.550
Men in New York.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:49.550
My parents.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.090
Like I was a walking library of stories.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.330
Until some pretty good friends kind of go,
you know what?

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.350
I'm really bored with the story about men
in New York.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:46:59.350
And so you know what?

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:00.350
I had a choice.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:03.980
I could fight the friend, who she was happily
married, of course, right?

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.470
I could fight the friend or I could actually
take it on and kind of go you know what, you're

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.470
right.

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:11.330
I have a really big story about that particular
issue.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:15.440
And it's funny and I bring it up, but I promise
you, you have a story that you are also holding

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.840
onto for dear life because you think it's
the truth.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840
It's not the truth.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.450
It's your story about it.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:27.670
So when you're going through change, you know
there's a sense of again controlling the outside.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:28.670
Turn it in.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:33.240
You control yourself, watch how quickly your
external environment changes.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.510
It's fascinating.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.380
It's not anything we've been told.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.970
We're told that you know, you move around
things on the outside and then you get to

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.970
feel better.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.350
No, no, no, no, no.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:46.310
You get to feel better and the outside tends
to sort of shift around.

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:47.310
Put it to the test.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:50.620
I'm just, I'm inviting you to actually look
at the effect of that.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.000
Principle number seven.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.770
Principle number seven is what I call your
spiritual side.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:01.609
Every person I interviewed going through change
that had found their courage and had found

00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:07.270
their strength and had found their inspiration
referred to something to do with their spirituality

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.770
or religion.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.450
They definitely didn't all agree on what they
called it.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:16.800
Some called it grace, some called it presence,
some called it God, some called it Buddha,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.290
some called it life, the universe, but they
all agreed in one thing.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.359
Something bigger is going on here.

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.420
I don't know why I'm in this change.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.460
It's crazy.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.460
It's difficult.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.460
It's amazing.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:29.460
I'm overwhelmed.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.810
Whatever it is, you know?

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:35.690
We all have sort of the, the, the change is
a particular way story going on.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:40.000
But they had a sense of, I don't know what
it is but I feel like something bigger is

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.349
happening here.

00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:46.770
And so trusting in the, the something bigger,
whatever that is for you.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:52.070
But change is always an invitation to sort
of get connected with that part which very

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:56.849
often when life is all rosy and happy, we
tend to forget about that part.

00:48:56.849 --> 00:49:01.839
We tend to step into it as an invitation where,
oh I actually need to connect a little bit

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:03.510
more with that.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.630
Again you name it what you want.

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:10.420
One of the number one ways I would suggest
people to do it is just to find stillness.

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:14.119
Find silence of any kind at any time.

00:49:14.119 --> 00:49:15.630
Five minutes, ten minutes, twenty minutes.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:19.720
And I can tell you, if you do not have 20
minutes in your day to be still, there's something

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.220
wrong with your day.

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:26.890
There's gotta, you've gotta find it, ten,
fifteen minutes of just stillness.

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:28.150
No distractions.

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:29.410
No busyness.

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.820
Because if you can't, I would invite you to
sort of say, well what is it that you don't

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.369
wanna hear?

00:49:34.369 --> 00:49:35.960
What is it that you don't wanna listen?

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.130
Why, why is silence so scary?

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:43.990
Like I, I make it what I call a non-negotiable
and I would invite you all to look at your

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.109
non-negotiables and pick a couple.

00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:50.480
What are the things that you don't negotiate
for anything?

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:54.609
Not your kids, not your boss, not your parents,
not anyone?

00:49:54.609 --> 00:49:55.609
What are you non-negotiables?

00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:59.600
My non-negotiables are my spiritual path and
my health.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.109
No one touches those.

00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:02.109
And guess what?

00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:06.960
When you create a bit of a sacred space around
whatever those non-negotiables are, life tends

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:12.849
to keep you away from them, it's fine, because
you've actually taken a stand for them.

00:50:12.849 --> 00:50:18.160
But find that you know when everything in
your life is changing, you have to find something

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.609
that doesn't change.

00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:20.740
You have to.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.170
And a lot of the times when you're going through
one change, life does a really funny thing.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.211
It brings two or three more changes with it.

00:50:27.211 --> 00:50:28.211
Right?

00:50:28.211 --> 00:50:29.211
It's natural.

00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:32.490
Your job changes and now your relationships
also change.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:36.660
Your money's changing and now you know your
home something is changing as well.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.330
So life tends to bring with it more than one
change at a time.

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:45.160
It's my number one thing I would say, when
you're in a change, you need to find a place

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.960
that is what I call the silent witness.

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:53.670
The silent observer that can kind of see but
not be part of the change.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:57.100
And the it the biggest way to get in touch
with that is to meditate.

00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:01.710
And if meditation's a scary word, it's just
to sit in silence and just to sort of watch,

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:02.710
watch your thoughts.

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:03.710
You don't even need to get involved.

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:08.180
You don't need to entertain them, but there's
a real invitation to do, you know, if it's

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.270
not meditation, go into nature.

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:13.400
If it's not nature, start journaling.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.820
But there's plenty of ways to sort of get
in touch with that more spiritual core.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.690
Ok.

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:21.720
Principle number eight.

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:26.151
So much more I could have said on spirituality,
but-- Principle number eight is what I call

00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:29.740
your change support team.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.589
People who are good at change are not alone.

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:35.010
I'd say it's our biggest flaw as human beings.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.390
We keep thinking we're alone.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:39.840
I'm the only one going through this change.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.170
No one has ever felt this bad.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.660
No one has ever eaten this much ice cream.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.089
No one has ever cried so much on the couch.

00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:49.530
No one has ever been so heart broken for so
long.

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:51.700
Like, we, we do this all the time.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.700
No one has ever messed up as much as I have.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.580
No one has ever, you know, it's like the list
continues.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.330
But we have the sense that we're alone.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:00.710
I'm the only one.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:02.029
And what does that do?

00:52:02.029 --> 00:52:05.210
That separates us once again from life.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:06.970
It separates us from people.

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.030
It separates us from people who could be helping.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:13.770
So just ask yourself, are you, are you a bit
of a I'm alone person?

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:18.030
Because if you are you're gonna make your
life really difficult because life is a combination

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:19.859
of changes.

00:52:19.859 --> 00:52:20.859
Here's what's interesting.

00:52:20.859 --> 00:52:26.950
When you do go through change, your change
support team are not necessarily the people

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:30.260
you would naturally go to.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.830
You know, when you go through change I don't
necessarily recommend calling your mother.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.349
Not a good idea.

00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:42.500
She loves you, she's on your love team, but
she's not necessarily on your change team.

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.150
She's gonna be worried and she's gonna ask
you a million questions and five days later

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:50.460
when you're kind of better, she's still worrying
about your change.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:56.190
So when you're going through a change, be
very mindful of who you're gonna call.

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:58.839
Who actually can help you?

00:52:58.839 --> 00:53:00.210
Who's on your change team?

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:03.330
They're not your closest friends, partners,
husbands, wives.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.980
They are gonna be quite shaken by your change.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.119
The most beautiful thing is when you go through
change new people tend to show up in your

00:53:10.119 --> 00:53:12.859
life who have no idea who you are.

00:53:12.859 --> 00:53:17.640
They don't have this fixed identity of you
know Mike is this or Ann is that.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.359
There's sort of a freedom about who and what
you are.

00:53:20.359 --> 00:53:24.050
They don't know how many times you've tried
to lose weight or how many tries you've tried

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:28.710
to stop smoking or how many times you've messed
up doing a particular thing.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:30.290
There's a neutrality about them.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:36.020
But be very careful, you know I always say
look at the five people that you spend the

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.109
most amount of time with.

00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:43.780
Five people you spend the most amount of time
with have a massive influence on your life.

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.780
Massive.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.900
In every regard.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.290
Who are your five people?

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:52.690
Because we're very casual about who influences
us when we're going through change.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:54.710
And you don't get good advice.

00:53:54.710 --> 00:54:01.070
You get their beliefs and their opinions and
their fears and their conditioning.

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.690
That's not advice.

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:05.710
That's their stuff that they need to go work
through.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:10.330
There's two types of people that I would say
you, you find when you go through change.

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:12.700
People that get in the hole with you, right?

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.300
You're in the hole, they go in the hole with
you.

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.800
He's such a jerk.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.830
Absolutely she should never have done that.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:20.620
I can't believe he did that to you.

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:21.620
Right?

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.080
There's people that agree with you.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.390
And they kind of casually somewhat make you
feel better for about half a second.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.662
And they're very often the people that drag
you for a drink.

00:54:29.662 --> 00:54:32.950
Let's drink it away or let's eat it away.

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:35.359
Because they actually don't know quite how
to deal with it, right?

00:54:35.359 --> 00:54:36.930
But they're not comfortable.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:41.020
And some of you might be these kind of people,
which is sort of like, oooh my girl, my friend,

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:46.089
my partner's going through a change, I'm gonna
try and you know distract them in some way.

00:54:46.089 --> 00:54:50.120
But some people walk right in the hole with
you and they don't, they're not very helpful.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:54.640
So don't surround yourself with those people,
who all they do is agree with you.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.590
You want people who are what I call ladder
people.

00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:02.850
They see you in a hole, they hand you a ladder
and somehow they get you up the ladder.

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:06.589
And you resist those people because it's much
more comfortable being in the hole.

00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:09.070
You get attention.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.070
You get compassion.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:11.460
You get, you know, validation.

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.240
But get people who are actually gonna walk
you up the ladder.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.090
Those are the most important things.

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:17.700
So that's change support team.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:23.910
Be, just be mindful of who's on your team,
you know, if you're thinking about making

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:27.050
a change, who has made that change before
you?

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:29.170
That would be a great person to go to.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:33.890
Most people if they've been through a cancer
diagnosis, they want to help.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:36.770
If someone has started a business, they want
to help.

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:39.410
If someone's lost weight, they want to help.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:41.300
Who needs to be on your change team?

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.800
Always a very powerful question to ask.

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:48.970
The final principle of change is what I call
the action principle.

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:51.770
And there's a reason why this principle is
at the end of the book as opposed to right

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:52.990
at the beginning.

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:58.080
Because if you haven't figured it out by now,
all change is emotional.

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.240
Change is not about taking actions.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.840
The actions to get divorced are actually very
easy.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.410
The actions to quit smoking are really easy.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:08.200
The actions to lose weight are very easy.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.839
The actions to you know start a business are
pretty easy.

00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:13.670
It's the emotions that get in the way.

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:16.670
It's all the things we've been talking about
up 'til now.

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:21.160
With that said I would say no change happens
without some action.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:25.349
Once the emotions are in a place where you're
mindful about them, you actually need to get

00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:26.349
on the court.

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:29.650
You can't just be on the stands talking about
the change all the time.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:31.200
You need to get on the court.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:35.450
So whatever change is happening ask yourself,
have I actually picked up a racket or do I

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:37.280
just keep on talking about it?

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:41.619
The most interesting part that I found in
the action principle with people that I interviewed

00:56:41.619 --> 00:56:43.160
was this.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:47.580
The most important action people took when
they go through change was to take care of

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.170
their health.

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:53.380
I mean that was incredibly interesting to
me because to me I thought, ok, they're gonna

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.910
be doing a particular thing.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:55.910
No, no, no, no.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:57:01.320
When you're going through change, health is
the number one thing that walks out the door.

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.950
You sleep less, or you sleep more.

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:07.230
You start drinking a lot more coffee, alcohol.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:11.589
You've no time for exercise, 'cause now this
change has happened and it's like, I have

00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:12.589
no time.

00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:16.960
And usually you're eating a lot worse, comfort,
comfort, just to fill up the uncertainty because

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.980
there's so much.

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:21.290
So the number one thing that walks out the
door is your health.

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:24.290
So I'd interview people and I'd be like, ok,
what really helped you?

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:25.290
And they said one thing.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:26.890
He goes I took care of myself.

00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:27.920
That's it.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.820
So again sounds very simple, but the more
you take care of yourself the higher your

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:36.270
self esteem is, the more you start you know
even just exercise.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:40.760
I say to a lot of people who come see me,
I've done a lot of one on one coaching.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.420
They go I'm so depressed or I'm stuck or I'm
paralyzed.

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:49.240
They're not moving or they're dehydrated.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.380
Of course they're depressed.

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:51.970
Nothing's moving through the body.

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:53.410
They haven't had a proper meal.

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:55.119
They haven't had some sleep.

00:57:55.119 --> 00:57:59.890
So it's not necessarily the emotions are whacking
you, you're not actually doing things to take

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:03.820
care of it, so I, I came up with just a very
simple acronym, it's what I call the seed

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.160
of change, S-E-E-D.

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:09.230
This is as basic as it gets and most of you,
none of us are doing this.

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:10.760
S is for sleep.

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.130
E is for exercise.

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:13.930
E is for eating well.

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:16.270
And D is for drinking water.

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:20.630
Just those things will have a massive influence
on how you go through change.

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:25.589
The actions of change, my final point, actions
of change are small actions.

00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:30.440
People who go through change do not jump to
the top of the mountain as a metaphor for

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.940
the film that's coming.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.150
It's a step at a time.

00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:34.730
It's like a woodpecker.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:35.730
What is the action?

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:37.190
What's the one thing I've got to do now?

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:38.660
What can I do today?

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:39.660
What can I do tomorrow?

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:41.920
Who can help me with this action tomorrow?

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.440
But what are you actually doing because you
never know when that tree's gonna fall.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:51.810
But the actions of actually getting sort of
in the flow, that's where, where things really

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:52.810
start happening.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:57.150
So again a lot more stuff to say about action,
but are you in action or are you actually

00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:58.880
in inaction?

00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.210
So those are the nine principles.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:06.450
Again what I would say is just you know look
at them as a global, your beliefs, the change

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:12.810
guarantee, the change muscle, the change demons,
your emotions that get in the way, the power

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:14.300
of acceptance.

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.800
Are you an accepting person when it comes
to change?

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.540
The things you can control.

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:23.800
Are you an external control person or more
of an inwardly focused person?

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:28.260
Your spiritual side, you know, is that something
that has gotten your attention lately or not?

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:33.890
Because a change is always an invitation to
look at the inner world, not the outer world.

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:35.431
Your change team, who's on it?

00:59:35.431 --> 00:59:37.820
And taking action.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:41.810
So with that I'm just gonna wrap up and just
give you a sense you know the last couple

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:48.060
of years I did take time off from the writing
and I did take time off from the speaking

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:52.250
and I decided to just focus on what my next
book is gonna be, so I'll give you a sneak

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:53.369
one minute about what that is.

00:59:53.369 --> 00:59:56.330
I'm writing a book called A Foot In Both Worlds.

00:59:56.330 --> 01:00:01.910
And A Foot In Both Worlds is about walking
a spiritual path or a mindful path or a conscious

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:05.840
path, whatever you want to call it and fully
being in the world.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.420
So it's not an either/or, which a lot of the
times people kind of go, well it's either

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.579
gonna be this or it's gonna be that.

01:00:11.579 --> 01:00:14.770
Either I'm gonna be spiritual or I'm gonna
make a lot of money.

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:18.010
Either I'm gonna be in a relationship having
sex or I'm gonna be meditating every day on

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.010
a cushion.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:23.630
Like people have funny ideas about the either/or
of this concept, so I wanted to see both for

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:30.170
myself how it was possible to live in New
York City in a fully mindful way, in a fully

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:35.590
conscious way, in a relationship, eating well,
you know in, in doing work that mattered,

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.060
making money, whatever it was.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:41.190
And interviewing people who really do have
a foot in both worlds.

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:47.560
And then as Rachel said as well I wanted to
just get on you know more of the app bandwidth

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.780
and sort of turn this into an iPhone app.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.250
So Mindful365 we're testing it right now and
it'll be out probably in September and we're

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.420
hoping to do an android version soon, believe
me.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.839
And what we've also done is we're doing it
as a daily e-mail for people who don't have

01:01:01.839 --> 01:01:03.119
smart phones.

01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:07.990
But it's just a paragraph or two of the similar
type of content I've been speaking about,

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:13.360
looking at 20 years of research in personal
development in life skills, where we'll send

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.630
you a question to focus on for the day and
you know and it could be about looking at

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:23.780
your disapproval or looking at how impatient
you are today or looking at, you know, your

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.710
relationship to your body in a particular
way.

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:30.040
But I invite you all to look at that, it's
gonna be at Mindful365.com and then on obviously

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.140
on the iTunes store as well.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.140
And then the film is this afternoon.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:37.300
I don't know if you guys have the time to
come, but that was an extraordinary, extraordinary

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.300
experience.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.470
But I want to take some questions if you guys
have any.

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:43.140
Thank you very much.

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.480
[audience applause]

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:51.150
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So you talk about people being,
people being positive.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:54.040
Have you encountered the other end of the
spectrum?

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:59.349
Naivete, you know, this is gonna work in some
really unrealistic way as being another way

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:00.349
that people

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:01.349
&gt;&gt;Ariane: Yeah.

01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:02.349
Absolutely.

01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:03.349
&gt;&gt;Male #2: fail at making change?

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:04.349
&gt;&gt;Ariane: Did everyone hear that?

01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:10.010
So he was saying one of the things I noticed
is when people are positive, no matter what,

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:11.250
somehow they find a way through change.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:15.589
And his question was, have you found the other
side of the spectrum, is people who have a

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:19.599
degree of naivete and actually don't know
somehow things work out?

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:26.000
There is something very positive in actually
not knowing and not knowing and not having

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.910
a plan and not having any idea how to go through
it, but actually also pulls you through.

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:34.940
One of the, the hardest things to get through
when you're going through change is the sense

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.440
of I know.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:42.050
Is the sense of I'm educated, I was told,
I've been through this before, other people

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:47.210
have told me and so there there's a there's
a clinging to a particular way of having it

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:48.210
being.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:49.310
But I'll give you an example.

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:54.400
I've never built an app before, and I think
there's an advantage of being a bit naive

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.590
about not having built an app so I'm not trying
to be the perfect app builder, right?

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:04.690
I'm just going ahead and giving what I can
and doing the content I can and figuring it

01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:06.450
out along the way.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.380
And I'm being quite positive about it.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:12.290
Where I just know that it's gonna be helpful,
it's gonna make a difference.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:14.130
That's the part very often that pulls you
through.

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:18.010
I think when you go through change, I didn't
mention this, but when you go through change

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:22.640
one of the big differences is, if you know
why you are going through the change, if you

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.359
know why you are making the change, the why
is the fuel that pulls you through.

01:03:27.359 --> 01:03:32.160
Me trying to figure out app developers and
coding and everything is not what pulls me

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.160
through.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.690
The why of wanting to make a difference, right?

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:40.250
The why of knowing that it's gonna be helpful
for people who are gonna find this, that's

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.700
what makes the difference.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.780
So you can be very naive about a change that
you're in, but if you know why you're going

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.253
through it, that's usually the thing that
pulls you through.

01:03:49.253 --> 01:03:54.400
So the question was any tips on helping an
introvert going through change?

01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.339
The number one thing I would say is, is stop
labeling yourself and stop labeling anyone

01:04:00.339 --> 01:04:02.210
who is a particular way.

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:08.770
Because the labeling has basically put a box
over how you should be, how you should act,

01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:13.550
how much you should talk, how you should interact
with others, so whether you are or you're

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:16.450
not, I'm not arguing with the reality of the
thing.

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:22.460
I'm arguing with the label of the thing, which
stops you from naturally doing what it is

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:24.670
that the expression might come through.

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:28.770
Beyond the labeling, and I would invite you
know most people to stop labeling anyone in

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:34.060
any way, I would say, get in touch with the
intuition, you know.

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.349
We all have that inner microphone.

01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:40.420
We all, you don't need to be extroverted or
introverted, it goes off really loudly at

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.839
particular times.

01:04:41.839 --> 01:04:46.200
And what we do is we're experts at turning
the microphone down.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.860
But the good thing about life is, life never
lets you turn it off.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.170
It's never at a zero.

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:55.460
It's kind of at this latent, you can kind
of always hear it and you're always trying

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.180
to make it quieter.

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:02.750
But as an introvert, extrovert, I would say
turn the inner microphone on, give it a voice

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:06.990
and sort of listen to what it's saying about
a particular area of your life, about something

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:10.930
that's going on for you personally, professionally,
financially.

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:14.330
You know, I'd say turning on, turning on the
intuition.

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:18.060
And for people you know I often get the flip
question, which is, well, well, I don't even

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.160
know what my intuition is.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:23.099
Which is a great question, 'cause a lot of
people it's like, there's intuition and then

01:05:23.099 --> 01:05:25.810
there's also your conditioning, right?

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:29.230
There's like my conditioning is telling me
definitely don't do this.

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.240
No, no, no.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.990
That's not your intuition.

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.240
If you're confused about the two, here's where
you go.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.630
You always go to your body.

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:39.420
Your body never lies.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:41.300
Are you feeling tight?

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.420
Are you not sleeping?

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.750
Are you nervous?

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:45.910
Are you sweating?

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:48.480
Are you eating or drinking more than usual?

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:51.119
If you're about to do a deal, are you really
contracted?

01:05:51.119 --> 01:05:57.400
So for people who, you know the mind is busy,
or whatever is going on, you always go to

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.400
the body.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.839
How is the body feeling?

01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:02.970
If you're invited to do something, what does
the heart want?

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:05.730
Do I get a yes or do I get a no?

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:11.560
And we ignore it all the time and so life
throws another change at us, and another change,

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:16.359
and another change until we actually start
listening to what's the inner intuition?

01:06:16.359 --> 01:06:19.570
What's the microphone actually wanting to
have you say yes to?

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:24.270
And it's hard sometimes because you've gotta
say no to things that people want you to say

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.550
yes to.

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:29.020
And you've gotta say no to things that you've
always been expected to do, right?

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.970
And so there's a sense of like wanting to
please when you're going through change and

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:36.829
yet also wanting to honor what's going on
inside.

01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:39.090
So I'd say always turning on the heart.

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:41.040
Turning on the intuition.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.599
Listening more.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:45.820
Getting away from the noise and the busyness
of other people who are trying to, trying

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.310
to influence you.

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:51.440
I wouldn't say it was people who didn't make
it through change, it's people who struggled

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.240
a lot through change.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:58.320
So when they were going through change, instead
of actually moving you know at the pace that

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.920
they would have maybe liked to move, they
were stuck for the change for years and years

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920
and years.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.819
So I interviewed people who'd lost a loved
one and I could tell people who had, who had

01:07:08.819 --> 01:07:15.839
made it something beautiful and they had started
a foundation or they had done something positive

01:07:15.839 --> 01:07:21.819
or they had started celebrating that person's
passing as opposed to doing it in a very different

01:07:21.819 --> 01:07:22.819
sort of way.

01:07:22.819 --> 01:07:25.630
So life, you're gonna make it no matter what.

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:26.680
That's a done deal.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.100
Life's gonna take care of every single one
of us.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:34.710
It's just a matter of how much suffering are
you gonna take on when life gives you a change

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:35.710
to look at?

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:39.910
I wanted to see well why is it some people
have an easier time through change?

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.350
Why are they less stressed?

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.370
Why are they less sad?

01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:44.619
Why are they more excited?

01:07:44.619 --> 01:07:49.360
Because you know one of the things we didn't
talk about is good changes are actually just

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.360
as hard as the difficult changes, you know.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.360
People getting married.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.560
People having children.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.150
People getting promoted.

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:59.599
People who've you know gone on and started
businesses, been very successful.

01:07:59.599 --> 01:08:05.540
The good changes bring up a lot of these same
issues, because something's changed.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:06.540
Right?

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:10.060
It's just not what they thought and they don't
quite know how to deal with it.

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.700
So it's not only the difficult challenging
ones.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.540
When I interviewed people, I interviewed people
who had gone through the greatest things,

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.789
winning the lottery, I interviewed a few of
those people, and just how difficult it was

01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:23.819
for them to be with a positive change as well.

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:26.219
So it wasn't make it or not make it and I
apologize if I said that.

01:08:26.219 --> 01:08:31.259
It was more, it was more the ease with which
they transitioned through change.

01:08:31.259 --> 01:08:32.519
Good question.

01:08:32.519 --> 01:08:37.319
So is it possible to help someone through
a change if they're not really willing to

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:39.750
accept what's going on?

01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:44.809
I would say yes and the best way to help someone
through change is to be a refuge for them.

01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:51.689
And by refuge I mean they can stay in whatever
feeling they're at, place they're at, it doesn't

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:53.679
make you feel uncomfortable.

01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:59.579
You basically allow them to be, because what
they need is love and what they need is acceptance.

01:08:59.579 --> 01:09:01.929
They don't need tips, they don't need advice.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:05.959
If they ask for guidance, you give it, if
not you're encroaching, right?

01:09:05.959 --> 01:09:09.469
And I've, I'm, I've been guilty of that too
as someone who likes to help people through

01:09:09.469 --> 01:09:11.710
change it's very easy to want to change.

01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:16.400
But the one place to go to is just go, what
does this person most need?

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.889
That's the question.

01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:20.089
Does this person need, you know, some affection?

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:22.489
Does this person need me to check in with
them?

01:09:22.489 --> 01:09:25.059
Does this person need a referral to someone?

01:09:25.059 --> 01:09:29.309
But it's not what you think they need, it's
really tuning in and counting on what does

01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:30.549
this person need.

01:09:30.549 --> 01:09:38.069
But it's, it's a radical acceptance of who
they are and it's also a seeing of who they're

01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:39.670
gonna be on the other end of this.

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:45.569
So if you can already hold a vision for how
they're gonna be when they get through this,

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:48.089
they start feeling that when they're around
you.

01:09:48.089 --> 01:09:49.789
They don't feel stuck around you.

01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:52.159
You've already seen them move through the
challenge.

01:09:52.159 --> 01:09:53.359
You've already seen them healthy.

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:57.270
You've already seen them in a relationship
or whatever it is that they're looking to

01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:58.270
be in.

01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:59.389
Thank you very much.

01:09:59.389 --> 01:10:00.090
