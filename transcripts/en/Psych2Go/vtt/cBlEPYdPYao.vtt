Hello, everybody. My name is Chris

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.350
and I'm here on Psych2Go to talk to you guys about multitasking and why you really shouldn't do it.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.420
I'm going to tell you straight out, you

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.420
can't multitask. At all. your brain cannot handle it and it has to do with your short-term memory.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.899
Your short-term memory, also known as your working memory

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.260
stores visual and verbal information

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.200
for a short period of time anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds with a limited capacity.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.529
The working theory on our working memory is

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.429
7 plus or minus 2. In other words,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.379
our short-term memory can hold anywhere from 5 items to 9 items at any given time. And when you're multitasking you're definitely

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.889
putting in more than 5 or 9 items into your short-term memory, thus overloading your brain with Data. And

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.600
when your brain is overloaded with data, some of that data doesn't make it into your short-term memory,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.369
and if it doesn't make it into a short-term memory, it's not going to make it into your long-term memory,

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.379
and you're not going to remember it.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.700
In other words, multitasking doesn't make you more efficient or a

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.829
time-saver. In fact it makes you less efficient and waste more time.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.600
