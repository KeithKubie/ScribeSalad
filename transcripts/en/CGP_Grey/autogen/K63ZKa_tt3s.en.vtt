00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
Hello Internet!

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.260
I asked for questions, and boy, did you deliver

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.960
with more than 7,000, so, let's get started.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.980
:Question

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.820
Immortality!

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.120
Aging is a degenerative fatal disease of the genes in the same way Parkinson's is.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.580
We're trying to cure Parkinson's with gene therapy along with Leukemia, Multiple Melanoma and others.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.840
Why not aging?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.280
Well, because most people think of getting old and dying as a beautiful part of the life cycle.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.020
IT ISN'T

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.180
With 30 years of genius, we could grasp control of our genetics, and gain eternity.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.680
Question:

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.040
I'm not sold on overpopulation as a problem.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.940
Birth rates have been going nothing but down

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.520
and until we build that "Dyson Sphere" we aren't anywhere near the carrying capacity of the Solar System

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.580
and, immortality is exactly the sort of thing that makes crazy, long-term sustainability projects possible.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.600
:Question

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.400
Scary experiences increase the probability of bonding. This explains horror movies.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.240
If you want the date to go well, do them. If you don't, don't.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.460
:Question

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.640
I'm sure I've answered this before, but everyone keeps asking, so here's the whole story in one place:

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.020
I grew up in the Empire State, starting in the suburbs.... which I didn't like that much

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.300
then went to college in the wilds of upstate, which I liked better. But, it wasn't "for me" forever so next stop, big city.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.420
New York was the obvious choice, but, because I was raised in its shadow, New York felt a bit like a step backward in life.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.940
I discovered around this time I had Irish dual citizenship through a series of random events, which opened up the EU, and her largest city, London.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.480
I knew if I didn't live abroad while still free of life's anchors, I never would, which made it all the more reason to go.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.780
I applied to an Economics Masters program in London, was accepted, and went and stayed for more than a decade.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.960
It turned out great! When you're leaving school, try the adventurous path! You can always fall back on the known later.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.000
Question:

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.480
Sounds like we're in a dangerous place, sounds like I need to keep that antivenim..while I go...get help *laughs*

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.940
Question:

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.180
So, I *do* have two podcasts that I'm putting on the screen now that you should totally click and go listen to.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.920
YouTube is how I spend most of my work energy, despite what you might think from the CGP Grey Reddit posts but,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.280
podcasts allow me to, with fewer of my hours, make *lots* of hours of stuff for other people to enjoy.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:14.580
Ostensibly, I'm doing this Q&amp;A because I hit two million subscribers, but I'm way more impressed that these short videos, according to Youtube, have engaged more than a millennia of human attention.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.280
At least, I was impressed until I did some back of the envelope calculations and realized that the podcast has eaten up 3 millenia of human attention,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.880
Which makes the time-return on my time for podcasting, astounding.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.240
So the bottom line is that these projects are rewarding in different ways

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.120
Have you clicked yet?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.620
Go Click.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.640
Seriously, do it right now.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.320
I'd love to see this number get even bigger.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.740
Question:

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.480
Of course.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.680
Question:

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.740
Standardized tests measure how good you are at school.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.680
Same with your report card.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.700
They don't measure your understanding

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.920
and once you accept that they're easier to deal with.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.740
Question:

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.320
Modem sounds. *beep boop beep tchhhhhhkkk* [Grey makes modem sounds]

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.820
Question:

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.820
4, 5, 6, 7

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.420
Question:

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.060
I measure success by what percent of my time I have control over.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.280
Reaching 100% isn't possible, but on average I've been getting closer.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.800
If this is your goal too: beware the money trap.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.860
I've always preferred jobs that earned less if they gave me more time -- which didn't pay off in the short term, but did in the long term.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.320
The holidays are like 80% of the reason I went into teaching.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.680
Question:

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.920
Watch the Dog Whisperer.  I am deadly serious about this.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.380
It's also my advice for new parents.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.080
Question:

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.460
Last Q&amp;A video I mentioned opinions and how to change them.  The hardest changes are the ones where you're invested in the idea.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.220
And I've been a techno-optimist 100% all of my life.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.080
But this book put a real asterisk on that in a way that I didn't want.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.640
And now Artifical Intelligence is on my near-term threat list in a deeply unwelcome way.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.820
But it would be self-delusional to ignore a convincing argument because I don't want it to be true.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.780
There's much more discussion on Hello Internet if you click here. Technoptimistis beware.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.760
Question:

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.520
In my ideal life I would live in many different places for a year or two at a time, but that's not really practical now.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.340
If I had to pick a new city at this very moment it would be Amsterdam.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.780
Question:

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.120
Answered your own question there.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.520
Question:

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.240
I don't know. The kind of automation I worry about is the same kind that creates Star Trek abundance.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.720
The transition from here to there worries me and solutions that would work in this world might not work in the in between.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.120
Also, I am open to the idea that I may be wrong about automation and many have good arguments as to why.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.080
Technology decreasing jobs goes against all the data from all the history of all the world's economies.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.540
But I think we'll find out sooner than most people expect.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.220
Teslas are quasi-automated already -- and automation of transport is my prediction for the biggest, most visible impact on employment.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.600
Even pizza companies are getting into the auto business!

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.140
Question:

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.140
Way too much Factorio.  *Way* too much.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.140
Also, Rimworld.  And, much to my own surprise, American Truck Simulator: so relaxing.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.940
I cannot wait for them to add the rest of the states, and Canada.  Please?

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.080
Question:

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.520
It used to look like this...

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.680
But, I've just set up a brand new one and it looks like this.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.320
Question:

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.000
::sigh:: Yeah, maybe.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.540
Devil's in the details though. At one extreme end, if you want to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to persue a degree in something that ends in 'studies',...

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.240
...you'd be better off taking that money and starting a restaurant.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.960
Don't get me wrong, starting a restaurant is a *terrible* idea but it's a *better* terrible idea.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.560
On the other end if you live in a country that pays for college and you're getting a degree in a high-paying field, that's easy to recommend.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.840
But between those extremes is where difficult decisions lie.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.440
Personally, I went to college and took out  a loan and got a degree close to this end of the spectrum...

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.080
...but I only felt comfortable doing that because I was also getting a degree on this end of the spectrum.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.540
Shock surprise: this one paid my bills and this one was a nice hobby.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.220
Question:

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.020
Your life is in your hands alone now - this is the best and worst thing about adulthood.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.740
Question:

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.620
Jesus Christ man, have you ever seen eye surgery?

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.400
You're *awake*, it's *your eyes*.  I'll consider eye surgery only when I can replace them fully.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.380
Question:

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.960
No, obviously not.  Uh… Maybe?

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.980
Question:

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.180
It doesn't matter.  Only agreement matters.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.920
Question:

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.760
To live abroad is to be constantly reminded of outsider status.  So I don't feel remotely British.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:29.280
But having lived in the UK for the whole of my adult life, however, now when I go back to America it feels like Canada -- familiar yet foreign.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.700
So I'm a bit homeless but it doesn't matter because people over-value national identities anyway.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.880
In the end I feel like someone who grew up in America and is just a person in the world.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.780
Question:

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.780
Here's a super fast way to iron you're clothes:

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.520
Don't bother: buy clothes that don't need ironing. I've just saved you hundreds of hours of your life. You're welcome.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.600
Question:

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.440
I think New Year's resolutions are dumb and designed to fail.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.800
I mean, how many of you have already totally abandoned your New Year's resolutions?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.080
But I do like themes for the year.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:10.540
This is my Year Of Less -- you'll need to go to Cortex for a full explanation -- because it's a bit complicated and not what it sounds like and I'm still kinda working on it.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.500
Question:

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.660
Messy and, to the surprise of many, cursive.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.780
Question:

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.200
Poorly.  My stress management technique is to remove the source.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.060
I'd rather eliminate the problem than get better at dealing with it.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.160
Question:

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.040
It's hard to separate my thoughts on national flags from the countries themselves.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.560
Scrolling through the list I find myself drawn to the Canadian Flag, the U.K., Germany and Nordic flags...

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.180
...but it's because I *like* those places.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.220
That said, I'm also always a sucker for a strong design in the center: like Barbados &amp; Kenya.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:42.180
And most national flags are pretty good, if a little safe -- they're no abomination like the state flags.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.020
It's harder to pick the top out of bunch of mostly good designs as opposed to picking the best out of a pile of poo.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.560
Question:

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.020
I didn't read as many as I would have liked but I'm going to pick "So You've Been Publically Shamed" as my book of the year.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.140
If I designed a school curriculum, it would be required reading for the 'Living on The Internet' module.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.000
Question:

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.500
I divide my working time into units, each unit is 40 minutes long and I spent 5 units over a couple of days looking at the most upvoted questions...

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.620
...and all the questions in random order and selecting the ones that interested me ...

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.880
...then many, many more units writing various drafts.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.860
This script started at a 5,000 boring messy words and got cut to 2,000 hopefully more interesting words.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:27.220
And thank you to everyone who submitted questions.  I'm aware that I only got to half a percent of them, so we'll have to do this again sometime.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.580
Oh, and of course:

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.960
Question:

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.280
