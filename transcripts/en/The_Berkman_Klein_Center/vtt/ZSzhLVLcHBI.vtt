My name is Keith Porcaro and I'm a fellow
at the Berkman Klein Center. The big part

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.059
of my work focuses on how legal
norms form and digitizing society and so

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.519
that sounds sort of high pie-in-the-sky
type, so the narrower question that I'm

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.100
working on here is, how can communities
take control and make decisions

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.820
about the data that they're creating and
the data that's being created about them?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.310
So the research question that I'm
working on within that is how can we use

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.510
existing vehicles, like trusts, as a way
to first give communities power to be

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.480
able to make these decisions and be able
to sort of protect it against uses that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.809
they don't want, but then the other side
of that is once you've given communities

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.770
that power, how do you help them
understand sort of what the surface area

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.440
of those decisions are and how to
understand what the ramifications of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
some of their decisions might be. I kind
of think of it as two sides of a coin so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.250
on the one side of the coin, it's how can we use law to deal with new

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.900
technology, to deal with the fact that
increasingly more of our lives are

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.140
digital or online, and then the other
side of that is, how can you use

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.490
technology to understand how complicated
systems work like law or like anything

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.780
else and especially for people who don't
have the time to sort of think about

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.150
this professionally. So for somebody who
is you know just facing a legal issue

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.810
for the first time, or just finding
out that somebody is doing a census in

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.850
their neighborhood, the
expectation that we should have is not

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.950
that they should become a lawyer, they
should go to law school, they should

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.570
learn about how databases work, but it
should be what can we use,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.390
and what interfaces, what explanations,
what structures can we use to help

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.670
people understand enough of the system
to be able to make an informed decision

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.270
about how it should work.
