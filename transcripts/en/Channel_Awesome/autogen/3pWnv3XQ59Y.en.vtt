00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:50.779 align:start position:0%
missing is cuz we know they're gonna get
 

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:52.180 align:start position:0%
missing is cuz we know they're gonna get
there<00:13:50.959><c> on</c><00:13:51.050><c> time</c><00:13:51.080><c> we</c><00:13:51.350><c> know</c><00:13:51.470><c> they</c><00:13:51.620><c> do</c><00:13:51.680><c> get</c><00:13:52.040><c> there</c>

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.190 align:start position:0%
on time they don't know that but I think
 

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
on time they don't know that but I think
it's<00:13:55.339><c> being</c><00:13:55.520><c> implied</c><00:13:55.820><c> that</c><00:13:56.089><c> sock</c><00:13:56.360><c> has</c><00:13:56.570><c> a</c><00:13:56.600><c> bit</c>

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:28.610 align:start position:0%
do well I mean what you've learn now is
 

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.550 align:start position:0%
do well I mean what you've learn now is
when<00:14:28.970><c> you</c><00:14:29.000><c> calculate</c><00:14:29.330><c> things</c><00:14:29.810><c> you</c><00:14:29.990><c> always</c><00:14:30.140><c> add</c>

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
when you calculate things you always add
 

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.740 align:start position:0%
when you calculate things you always add
like<00:14:30.890><c> two</c><00:14:31.160><c> hours</c><00:14:31.490><c> yeah</c><00:14:31.640><c> now</c><00:14:31.820><c> I</c><00:14:31.850><c> double</c><00:14:32.360><c> my</c><00:14:32.480><c> time</c>

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:32.750 align:start position:0%
like two hours yeah now I double my time
 

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.170 align:start position:0%
like two hours yeah now I double my time
he's<00:14:33.470><c> probably</c><00:14:33.800><c> doing</c><00:14:34.250><c> that</c><00:14:34.400><c> right</c><00:14:34.730><c> now</c><00:14:34.940><c> is</c>

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:35.180 align:start position:0%
he's probably doing that right now is
 

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
he's probably doing that right now is
what<00:14:35.510><c> I'm</c><00:14:35.630><c> guessing</c><00:14:35.959><c> but</c><00:14:36.589><c> um</c><00:14:37.839><c> it's</c><00:14:38.839><c> these</c><00:14:39.110><c> two</c>

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.410 align:start position:0%
what I'm guessing but um it's these two
 

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.850 align:start position:0%
what I'm guessing but um it's these two
competing<00:14:39.860><c> philosophies</c><00:14:40.190><c> going</c><00:14:41.029><c> on</c><00:14:41.180><c> and</c><00:14:41.510><c> in</c>

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:41.860 align:start position:0%
competing philosophies going on and in
 

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
competing philosophies going on and in
and<00:14:41.980><c> what</c><00:14:42.160><c> they</c><00:14:42.250><c> end</c><00:14:42.370><c> up</c><00:14:42.430><c> doing</c><00:14:42.490><c> is</c><00:14:42.820><c> just</c><00:14:43.000><c> both</c>

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:43.209 align:start position:0%
and what they end up doing is just both
 

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
and what they end up doing is just both
of<00:14:43.240><c> them</c><00:14:43.570><c> simultaneously</c><00:14:44.440><c> and</c><00:14:45.480><c> that's</c><00:14:46.480><c> why</c><00:14:46.570><c> I</c>

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:46.630 align:start position:0%
of them simultaneously and that's why I
 

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.030 align:start position:0%
of them simultaneously and that's why I

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%

you going to the battle strategies of
this<00:16:52.490><c> I</c><00:16:52.610><c> think</c><00:16:52.670><c> he's</c><00:16:52.880><c> over</c><00:16:53.150><c> calculating</c><00:16:53.780><c> it</c><00:16:53.900><c> so</c>

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:54.170 align:start position:0%
this I think he's over calculating it so
 

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.940 align:start position:0%
this I think he's over calculating it so
um<00:16:54.580><c> but</c><00:16:55.580><c> I</c><00:16:56.090><c> think</c><00:16:56.360><c> it</c><00:16:56.750><c> balances</c><00:16:56.900><c> out</c><00:16:57.410><c> I</c><00:16:57.680><c> mean</c>

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:57.950 align:start position:0%
um but I think it balances out I mean
 

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.540 align:start position:0%
um but I think it balances out I mean
like<00:16:58.130><c> I</c><00:16:58.160><c> said</c><00:16:58.460><c> it's</c><00:16:58.670><c> not</c><00:16:58.850><c> just</c><00:16:59.260><c> one</c><00:17:00.370><c> likes</c><00:17:01.370><c> it</c>
