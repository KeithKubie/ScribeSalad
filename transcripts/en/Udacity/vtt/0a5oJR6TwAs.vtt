00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.000
I just mentioned that the rules of grammar enforce certain constraints on

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.780
written and spoken language.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.880
Later in the lesson, we will get into a similar set of rules for

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.500
visualizations and charts called the Grammar of Graphics.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.560
But for now, I simply want to show you a few of the most common chart types.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.150
I mentioned that there are a finite amount of possible charts.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.080
But even so finite can still be quite a large number as you can see here and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.350
there are even more charts that are not included.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.500
This is a flow chart created by Andrew Abela to

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.310
help navigate the somewhat overwhelming amount of different chart types.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.600
Which in and of it's self, is quite effective.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.810
You can find a larger PDF of this graph on extremepresentation.com.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.040
Which is Andrew Abela's site.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.490
And all the choices of possible chart types, I've seen very great.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.110
You always have to consider how familiar an audience is with a given chart type

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.790
and how long a graphic takes to digest.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.380
When I say digest here, I really mean understand and interpret.
