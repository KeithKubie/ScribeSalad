police for driving just a little bit too

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530
police for driving just a little bit too
 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.860

fast and I've never had a ticket in this

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870
fast and I've never had a ticket in this
 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.010
fast and I've never had a ticket in this
country never had a ticket because I

officers but I haven't actually been
 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.830
officers but I haven't actually been
given a ticket so all of a sudden if

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840
given a ticket so all of a sudden if
 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.740
given a ticket so all of a sudden if
you're not careful this feeling comes

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750
you're not careful this feeling comes
 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.600
you're not careful this feeling comes
over you that you are a bit omnipotent

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610
over you that you are a bit omnipotent
 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.660
over you that you are a bit omnipotent
you can do anything and this is a really

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670
you can do anything and this is a really
 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.460
you can do anything and this is a really
dangerous combination once the adulation

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470
dangerous combination once the adulation
 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.440
dangerous combination once the adulation
stops it's really dangerous paired with

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
stops it's really dangerous paired with
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.480
stops it's really dangerous paired with
that and I think maybe it even more

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490
that and I think maybe it even more
 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.870
that and I think maybe it even more
important is the fact that when I play

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880
important is the fact that when I play
 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.430
important is the fact that when I play
basketball I never thought I was a

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440
basketball I never thought I was a
 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.310
basketball I never thought I was a
basketball player I played basketball I

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320
basketball player I played basketball I
 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.020
basketball player I played basketball I
was a man who played basketball and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030
was a man who played basketball and
 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.670
was a man who played basketball and
after I played basketball and before I

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680
after I played basketball and before I
 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.320
after I played basketball and before I
play basketball I was going to be a

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330
play basketball I was going to be a
 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.870
play basketball I was going to be a
psychologist whereas most people who

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880
psychologist whereas most people who
 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.810
psychologist whereas most people who
play their occupation is their

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820
play their occupation is their
 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.099
play their occupation is their
definition and then when they stop doing

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.109
definition and then when they stop doing
 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.300
definition and then when they stop doing
who they are they become nothing

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310
who they are they become nothing
 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.120
who they are they become nothing
and that's what you see so many of these

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130
and that's what you see so many of these
 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.800
and that's what you see so many of these
problems with their desperate to try and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810
problems with their desperate to try and
 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.490
problems with their desperate to try and
find a new way to be relevant even to

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500
find a new way to be relevant even to
 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.300
find a new way to be relevant even to
themselves so this combination of

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
themselves so this combination of
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.460
themselves so this combination of
entitlement and then the fact that when

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470
entitlement and then the fact that when
 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.000
entitlement and then the fact that when
your career is over you stop being

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010
your career is over you stop being
 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.530
your career is over you stop being
relevant even to yourself is just deadly

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540
relevant even to yourself is just deadly
 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.360
relevant even to yourself is just deadly

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.660
in the pros with great programs that
need to be implemented but in college

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670
need to be implemented but in college
 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.920
need to be implemented but in college
and in high school and even before
