00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We've seen how acceleration scales with force--they're proportional--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but what about mass?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
How does mass affect acceleration?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The experiment I want to do now is slightly different.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Instead of changing the force, we're going to change the mass and leave the force the same

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
through all the trials of our experiment.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Can you look at this data, keeping in mind that, of course, the force is staying the same,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
calculate the accelerations, and then tell me how does the acceleration scale with m

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or how does it depend on the mass.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Which of these best describes how acceleration scales with m?

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And you may need this equation to help you out.
