00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.540
Let's say that we want to
solve the inequality x squared

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.030
plus 3x is greater than 10.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.200
We want to figure out
all of the x's that

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.214
would satisfy this inequality.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.880
I encourage you to
pause this video now.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.100
And I'll give you a hint.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.600
Try to manipulate the
way that you would have

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.150
if this was a
quadratic equation.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.910
But then as you
get to the end, try

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.520
to reason through it, because
the reasoning might departure

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.730
a little bit from
what you are used to.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.689
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.230
So the first thing
that we might want

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.938
to do, just to get
into a form that we're

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:38.790
more comfortable with, is
subtract 10 from both sides.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.236
If we subtract 10
from both sides,

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:41.610
then on the left
hand side, we're

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.430
going to have x squared
plus 3x minus 10 is still

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.750
going to be greater than.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930
If we add or subtract the
same thing to both sides,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.790
it won't change the inequality.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.740
But it's now going
to be greater than 0.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.097
10 minus 10 is 0.

00:00:57.097 --> 00:00:59.180
Now, this gets us into a
form that we're more used

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.680
to seeing quadratic
expressions in.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.430
If this was an equal
sign right over here,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.721
we'd want to factor this thing.

00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:08.644
So let's just try to factor
here too and see what happens.

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:09.810
So we're going to factor it.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.430
We're going to
think of two numbers

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.630
whose product is negative 10
and whose sum is positive 3.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.840
And we've had a lot of
practice doing this.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.540
If you think about the factors
of 10, it's 1, 2, 5, and 10.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.660
2 and 5 seem tempting,
because their difference is 3.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.380
So if you have positive
5 and negative 2,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.670
that seems to work out.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.950
Positive 5 and negative 2.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.175
Their product is negative
10, their sum is positive 3.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.122
We could rewrite
this as x plus 5.

00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:45.580
Let me do that in
that yellow color

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.520
so you see where this
5 is coming from.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:59.270
X plus 5 times x minus 2 is
going to be greater than 0.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.990
Now, if this was
an equality here,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620
we would say well, how
do we get this equals 0?

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.100
If either of these
things were equal to 0,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.460
then this entire expression
would be equal to 0,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.140
because 0 times anything is 0.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.690
But we don't have
an equality here.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.180
We have a greater than symbol.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.430
So let's think about how we
could reason through this.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.430
And I'll do a little
bit of an aside here.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.060
If I were to tell you
that numbers a and b,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.370
and if I were take
the product a times b,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.610
and if someone were to tell you
that product is greater than 0,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.610
what do we know about a and b?

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.302
Well, we know that they
have to have the same sign.

00:02:39.302 --> 00:02:41.260
They're either both
positive-- a positive times

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.200
a positive is going
to be a positive--

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.060
or they're both going to be
negative-- a negative times

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.050
a negative is a positive.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.450
It's going to be greater than 0.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.185
So we know the same thing here.

00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:55.060
Let me write it down.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:07.760
So we know either a is greater
than 0 and b is greater

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.700
than zero-- so either
both of them are positive

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.330
or both of them
are negative-- or a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.650
is less than zero and
b is less than zero.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.030
So we apply that
same logic here.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.220
You could view
this x plus 5 is a,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.140
you could view this x minus
2 as our b of the product

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.930
of two things.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.210
The product is greater than 0.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.090
That means that either both of
these expressions are positive

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.879
or they're both negative.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:41.920
So let's write that down.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.620
I'll write it this way.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.260
So either both of these
expressions are positive.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.010
So either x plus 5 is
greater than 0 and x minus 2

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:12.800
is greater than 0-- let
me write it this way--

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.720
or they're both negative.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:23.550
x plus 5 is less than 0 and
x minus 2 is less than 0.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.547
So now let's think about
all of these inequalities

00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:31.130
independently.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.904
But let's maintain this logic
here of the and and the or.

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:34.820
So let's look at this.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.540
Either they're both positive,
so if both of these expressions

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.870
are positive, what
do we know about x?

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.770
Well, if you subtract 5 from
both sides of this inequality,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.010
you get x is greater
than negative 5.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.840
And if you add 2 to this
inequality, both sides

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.950
of that inequality, you're going
to get x is greater than 2.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.380
So if x is greater than negative
5 and x is greater than 2,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.930
what do we know about x?

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.720
Well, any x that's
greater than two

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.840
is going to be greater
than negative 5.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.830
So we could just simplify
this right over here

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.030
to say that x is greater than 2.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.000
So all of this, this
is equivalent to saying

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.360
x is greater than 2,
because clearly anything

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.710
that is greater than
2 will satisfy that.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.890
And both of these
things have to be true.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.940
For example, x
equal negative 4, it

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.160
would satisfy this
inequality but not this one.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.670
And so the and would break down.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.710
And negative 4 does not
satisfy both of these.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.350
In order to satisfy
both of these,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.680
you essentially have
to satisfy that one.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.030
So this expression
simplified to that.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.460
Now what about this?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.120
What about this statement
right over here?

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.100
Well, x plus 5 less than 0,
subtract 5 from both sides.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.950
That is, x is less
than negative 5.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.350
And add 2 to both sides
of that inequality,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.720
you get x is less than 2.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.430
Now if x is less than negative
5 and x is less than two,

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.230
what do we know about x?

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.815
Well, that just means that x
has to be less than negative 5.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.010
If it's less than
negative 5, it's

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.430
definitely going
to be less than 2.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.300
And we got to remind ourselves
that we have this or here.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.790
And that's essentially
describing the solution

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.290
set for this quadratic
inequality here.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.790
x is going to be
greater than 2 or x

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.050
is going to be less
than negative 5.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.730
And we could actually plot this
solution set on a number line.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.130
So if this is our number line
right over here, and let's

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.560
say that this is 0.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.350
Let's say that's 1.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.500
2 right over here.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.400
This is negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, negative 4,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.090
negative 5.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.100
So x could be greater than 2,
not greater than or equal to,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.380
so I'm going to put
an open circle here.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.680
So it could be greater than 2.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.360
Or it could be less
than negative 5,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.920
not less than or
equal to, so I'm

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.090
going to put an
open circle here.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.200
And so it could
be less than that.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.190
So x could be any number.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.460
It could be negative 6,
negative 6 would satisfy this.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.850
You could verify that.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:23.800
Negative 6 squared is
36 plus negative 18,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.280
which is going to be 18,
which is greater than 10.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.310
Or you could have, say,
a positive 3 would work.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.290
3 squared is 9 plus
another 9 is going

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.927
to be 18, which once again,
it is greater than 10.
