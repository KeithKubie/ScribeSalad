00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.210
Yo.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.910
It’s me.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.690
DDP, Diamond Dallas Page.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.030
I didn’t become a professional wrestler
until I was 35 years old.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.059
My career did not take off until I was 40.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:21.029
That was in 1996 when wrestling blew through
the rafters in the cable industry.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.599
Monday Night Wars were a huge part of that.

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.849
Pro Wrestling Illustrated rated Stone Cold
Steve Austin as number one and DDP as number

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.210
four both years which was really crazy coming
from obscurity like that.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.739
And then I blew my back out.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.660
And I blew my back out so badly that three
different back specialists said my career

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.660
was over.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.430
I’d actually ruptured my L4 and L5 and it
was really bad.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.230
Just signed a multimillion dollar three year
deal.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.390
I mean I finally got paid so, you know, this
was the time I worked so hard to get to and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.609
now it was all gone.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.170
Around that time I was married and my wife
at the time was like, why don’t you try

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.110
doing yoga to heal your body.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.000
I was like, yoga.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.270
I wouldn’t be caught dead doing yoga.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.140
That was the way I felt about it.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.390
And long story short, it’s all I really
could do.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.000
I was still doing rehab because I had rehabbed
back both shoulder surgeries, both knee surgeries

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.320
and the ruptured L4 and L5, I was trying to
nurse that back but it was just so tender

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.920
and so immovable.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.310
I started to do the yoga and in the first
three weeks I started to feel a significant

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.310
difference.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.539
It was mind blowing to me.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.330
I was very frustrated though because the tapes
I was watching, everybody was a stick figure.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.520
Everybody could twist themselves up into a
pretzel.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.719
No one was modifying any position.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.850
So I had to figure that out.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.929
And then about three weeks in like I said
I was feeling pretty good so before I crashed

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.009
out I decided I want to do some of these yoga
positions and I wouldn’t call them poses

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.010
or postures because, you know, I’m a guy
who wouldn’t be caught dead doing yoga.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.470
But I started to mix them with the rehabilitation
moves and then I was like wow, this sort of

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.420
flows pretty good.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.000
And then over a period of time, next couple
of weeks I threw in old school calisthenics,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.650
you know, pushups, squats, crunches done with
a slow burn movement.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.110
And what I figured out – like if you’re
lifting weights you’re just jacking weight,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.300
you get your heart rate jacked up.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.220
But if you lift weights slow and control the
weight you’re going to utilize more muscles.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.640
And every time you flex or engage a muscle
like when you’re doing a slow burn push-up,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.840
your heart’s got to beat faster to get the
blood to the muscle.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.980
Again, I’m figuring this out because of
boredom but again completely by accident.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:06.070
And over a period of three months what would
become DDP yoga becomes a kick ass cardiovascular

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.740
workout that could dramatically increase my
flexibility and strengthen my core like never

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.800
before.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.760
But here was the key.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.530
Minimal joint impact.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.440
In less than three months I was back in the
ring.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.860
At 42 years old they said my wrestling career
was over.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.690
At 43 I was the heavyweight champ of the world.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.110
So I decided I’m going to keep doing this
what I used to call back then yoga for normal

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.960
people.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.710
And then it just sort of took on a life of
its own building its way up to DDP yoga.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.630
I was on Shark Tank.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:54.130
They were like the big question is how have
you succeeded in a world that is so competitive?

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.470
How have you succeeded and made all this money
in this business?

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.980
How did you do that?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.200
Me and my business partner, Steve Yu, we just
looked at them and said we inspire people.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.270
No, but really, how did you get the people
to be brought in?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.139
I go we inspire people.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.599
They’re like no but – and you ever saw
that – this stuff got cut from Shark Tank

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.909
because they didn’t get it.

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.580
I think the first person that had to be inspired
was me.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.460
Again you’re talking about the guy, you
know.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.349
Underneath DDP yoga this says it ain’t your
mama’s yoga, you know.

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.650
And I respect all types of yogis.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.430
I always say yogis – most yogis very Namaste.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.569
DDP yoga – we’re more T&amp;A, you know.

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.110
Tone and attitude.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.129
And we have fun with it.

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:56.419
The whole tone and attitude that makes DDP
yoga its own animal has to do with dynamic

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.939
resistance.

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.849
All I want you to do is go back to this.

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.509
Remember this from wresting?

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.469
Now it’s in DDP yoga and I cannot believe
it’s the centerpiece again.

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:12.759
Completely by accident or by design, however
you choose to look at it.

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.629
So what I’m going to do is I’m going to
take my thumb and index fingers – do this

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:17.629
with me at home.

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.389
I’m not talking to myself.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.150
I can get away with that.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.590
I was a wrestler.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.050
Okay so put your thumb and index fingers together.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.069
Now push really hard.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.810
Now when you push really hard look at the
muscles on my body.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.349
Look at my hand, forearm, bicep and pec.

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.370
They all have to engage.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.100
Now straighten your arms out in front.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.629
Take your left hand – it will be my right.

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:50.259
I want you to pull your pinky away from your
thumb like really stretch it.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.319
Look what happens to my arm.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.919
You can see my tricep.

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.479
You can see my forearm.

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:01.379
But when you take them like this and you push
your thumb and your index fingers away and

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:08.349
you pull your pinkies away, look what happens
to my hand, my forearm, my tricep, my deltoid

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:09.939
and my trap.

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.749
They all have to engage.

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:13.629
Now do this with me.

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:14.960
Have some fun.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.539
Keep pushing your thumb and your index fingers
together.

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:18.710
Pull your pinkies away.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.710
[INHALE SOUND].

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.080
Now as you inhale create resistance as you’re
moving.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.310
Lean back in your chair, nice stretch.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.870
Now bring your arms out to a T. Clench your
fists tight.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.650
Bring your fists together, your biceps together,
your pecs together and hulk it up brother.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.770
That’s right.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.990
Squeeze it tight, tight, tight.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.990
Attention.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.060
Shoulders back, chest out.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.490
[EXHALE SOUND].

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.919
At ease.

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.310
You can see me starting to perspire.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.039
That’s called dynamic resistance.

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.969
So whatever you’re trying to do, you need
to remember that there will always be better

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.430
than, less than and different than.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:07.270
That means whoever’s the best - in professional
wrestling you might say Hulk Hogan.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:16.699
Everybody under him, less than except for
the person or company that’s different than.

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.819
That’s what DDP yoga is.

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:22.180
That’s what Diamond Dallas Page the wrestler
was.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.689
And that’s why I never even let anybody
call DDP yoga, yoga.

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:29.400
People come up to me all the time.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.840
Autograph signings or personal appearances
I’m doing, all excited.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.969
DDP, oh my God, I’ve lost 50 pounds.

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:38.210
I love your yoga.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.639
A big group of people around.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.100
I go what’d you call it?

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.990
They go oh, I lost 50 pounds.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.930
I lost 50 pounds doing your yoga.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:47.930
I love it.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.800
I go what did you call it?

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.509
I go what did you call it?

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:55.900
They go DDP yoga.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.020
It becomes a funny bit.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.249
And again you can get away with that but a
wrestler.

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:01.380
No other yogi’s doing that.
