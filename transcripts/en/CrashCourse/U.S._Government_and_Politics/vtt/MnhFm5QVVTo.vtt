Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics and today I'm gonna talk about

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.480
a topic in American politics that tends to
drive people crazy! Ahhh! No it's not partisanship,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.750
or horse race journalism, or the state of
political punditry, although we could easily

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.029
do episodes on all three of those, and we
might. Nope, today we're gonna look at the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.800
election districts and how they shape electoral
outcomes, and that means - you guessed it

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.289
- we're gonna talk about Gerrymandering.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.929
Clone: Thank goodness, Gerrymandering is a
blight on our American election system. It

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.219
completely thwarts the will of the majority, and it's
responsible for our lopsided house of representatives.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.770
Second Clone: Not so fast my left-wing sore
loser friend! Gerrymandering is not nearly

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.560
as responsible for the 2014 republican congress
as the fact that people like you self-segregated

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.360
the urban enclaves of socialism.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.480
Craig: All right calm down, clones. Gerrymandering
is a little more nuanced than that. Let's talk it out.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.500
[Theme Music]

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.960
Congressional Apportionment - how many representatives each state gets - is super exciting!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.840
Even though it only changes every 10 years. Since
the number of representatives each state gets

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.640
is based on population, it's important to
know how many people are in each state. That's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.159
one reason, at least in the constitution,
that we have a census every 10 years. The

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.500
most populous state, California, has the largest
number of representatives - 53 - and the least

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.490
populous states have only one. Sorry Alaska,
Delaware, the Dakotas, Vermont, and Wyoming,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.380
and Montana, and the state of loneliness.
One is the loneliest number.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.020
In those sparsely populated states, figuring
out the election district, which geographic

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.939
area is represented by a congressman, is easy
because there's only one district. This makes

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.130
elections in these states effectively at large
elections, like a state's choice for senator.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.490
Even though there are two senators from each
state, they represent the entire state at

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.899
large rather than only a part of it like representatives
are supposed to do. The electoral college,

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.770
the system through which Americans choose
their president, are also a type of at large election.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.320
The rest of the states are divided into what
are called single member districts. This means

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.880
that each election district chooses one representative.
Now you might think it would be simple to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.120
divide a state into as many pieces as it has
representatives, but why would you think that?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.360
Nothing is simple!

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.580
Districts are required to be equal - or almost
equal - in population and in most states populations

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.470
are not evenly distributed across the entire
region. The notion that election districts

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.000
must encompass equal population is the essence
of the idea of one person, one vote - a principle

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.600
that was cast into law by the 1962 supreme
court decision in Baker vs Carr. It means

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.020
that a person's vote counts equally no matter
where they live, at least as far as the house

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.390
of representatives goes. In the senate it
doesn't actually work out because the resident

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.890
of a small state like Delaware has the same
number of senators - 2 - as a resident of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.430
California. To put it another way, in 2014
two senators represented 897,934 Delawareans

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.640
and the same number of senators represented
the approximately 38 million Californians.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.660
In the house, each representative is responsible
for about seven to eight hundred thousand people,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.860
which is still a lot but much better than one senator for nineteen million Californians or thirteen million Texans.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.700
The idea that people should be equally represented
in congress shouldn't be controversial, and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.610
for the most part it's not. What is controversial
is the way that minority groups are represented.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.100
One of the problems with single member districts
is that they can make it easier to cut minority

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.390
groups out of the political landscape. After
all, if in a given state only 15% of the residents

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.890
are minorities, it'll be more difficult for
them to elect a member of their own group.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.950
Even under a plurality rule, unless that person
can appeal to a large number of non-minority

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.350
people. Congress and the supreme court have
tried to remedy this problem by mandating

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.180
that there be majority-minority districts,
which is a confusing way of saying districts

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.000
where the majority of voters are members of
a minority group. This is a little like affirmative

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.990
action in the realm of voting, and as you
might have guessed, there is a fair amount

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.850
of disagreement among people who think a lot about it.
Although, I'd bet that number itself is a pretty small...minority.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.620
This idea of majority-minority districts leads
us into a really fun aspect of congressional

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.800
districting - the way that the districts themselves
are drawn, a process known as Gerrymandering

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.550
after the 19th century political cartoon that
depicted one particular Massachusetts district

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.570
that looked like a reptile. Oh! There it is.
Looks like a dragon or something. And we all

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.310
know dragons are reptiles. The man responsible
for this twisted district - the name of my

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.600
band in high school - was Elbridge Gerry,
hence the name Gerrymander. So districts have

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.170
to be drawn in a way that they contain roughly
equal populations, so why does it matter if

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.600
they look convoluted or even somewhat ridiculous
like this? Well, states don't just draw districts

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.560
to make them look equal in population, they
draw them to capture certain population characteristics

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.980
so that one party has a greater chance of
electing a member from a particular district.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.900
In the district pictured here, the Illinois
4th, Chicago has been carved up to capture

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.060
a certain population - me. That's the district
I live in. Usually district are drawn so that

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.200
they can capture my vote, or a significant
majority of one party or the other, virtually

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.780
ensuring that a particular district will elect
only a democrat or republican as the case may be.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.180
You might have noticed that thin strip in
the Illinois 4th's western edge connecting

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.120
the upper half and the lower half. Look carefully
and you'll see that it runs along the interstate,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.440
which I'm sure means that it has a
huge population. Why do we do this? Because

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.760
one of the requirements according to federal
election law is that districts not only be

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.090
roughly the same size in terms of population,
but also they be contiguous, meaning that

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.280
they can't be divided completely by other districts. This
requirement results in some pretty weird configurations.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.400
So who draws these cockamamie districts anyway?
Well, they're done by state legislatures.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.240
Well, not legislatures themselves, but by
people working at the behest of legislatures.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.320
If one party has a majority of the state legislature,
say the democrats, they usually want to draw

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.710
the districts so that Democrats have a better
chance of winning, republicans do the same

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.570
thing. This is why state legislature elections
matter so much in census years. Whoever wins

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.460
that year gets to re-draw the districts.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.220
A couple of things to note here. First, there's
no rule saying that states can't re-draw their

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.030
districts whenever they want. Texas tried
to do this in 2003 - not a census year - prompting

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.630
its democrats to run away to Oklahoma for
a spell. Second, it's possible for a state

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.690
to hand the task over to a less biased expert
district drawing person, or group, that might

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.750
make districts more fair. Hand it over to
me! I'll make 'em all look like little bunnies.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.940
But wait, you might ask yourself, what's wrong
with this system and why do people think it's

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.440
unfair? Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.450
So imagine a state that's 60% republican and
40% democrat, and has 5 electoral districts

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.110
like this one. Let's call it Clonesylvania.
You could draw districts so that there were

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.330
3 republican districts and 2 democratic ones,
accurately reflecting the state's population,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.750
like this. Or you could re-draw it so there
were 3 democratic districts and 2 republican

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.889
districts, which would be an inaccurate reflection
of the party composition of the state's population.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.880
Or you could simply draw the districts so
you had 5 republican districts and zero democratic

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.620
ones, like this. So you can see, especially
in the second and third examples how Gerrymandering

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.720
can result in districts that don't actually
reflect the political makeup of a state at all.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.540
By now you might be fuming at the injustice
of state legislature's re-drawing districts

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.000
to make sure that the opposing party has no
chance of winning national congressional elections,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.370
and you may have read a number of articles
blaming Gerrymandering for the composition

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.360
of the current congress and for making congressional
elections generally less competitive. There

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.270
are a lot of people who feel the same way.
But there's a counter argument that it's not

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.130
the state legislatures that result in solidly
republican or solidly democratic districts,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.700
but the fact that democratic voters tend to
cluster in cities where they often outnumber

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.270
republicans by a lot. So that states like
Ohio, even though the number of democrats

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.870
and republicans are pretty even with a slight
edge going to democrats perhaps, they all

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.350
tend to concentrate in urban areas around
Cleveland and Columbus so that the overwhelming

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.930
majority of the state's districts are won
by republicans. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.360
Congressional districting is fascinating and
really really important for determining the

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.460
composition of congress, but is also quite
complicated, which as with most things, makes

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.100
it difficult to understand. But unlike some
other complicated issues concerning policy,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.840
Gerrymandering is one that's easy to criticize
because the visual results are so striking

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.610
and because it can result in numbers that
just look unfair. This is probably why, come

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.030
election time, you'll hear a lot about it.
Now at least you'll have a better idea what

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.090
those pundits are talking about and you'll
be better equipped to making your own decision

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.360
about the issue. Luckily for you, there's
more and more data about this stuff every

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.530
election and always more to learn. Thanks
for watching, I'll see you next time.
