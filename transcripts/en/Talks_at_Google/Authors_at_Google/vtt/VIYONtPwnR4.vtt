MARIS: But anyway,
it's my great pleasure

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.170
to have Steve here at Google.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.930

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.860
and is available on Amazon.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.050
Steve speaks about the science
of influence and persuasion

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.160
and its application to a
wide variety of business,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.560
government, and nonprofit
organizations around the world.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.340
As well as an extensive
list of corporate clients,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.880
Steve has worked

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.430
So please, a round of
applause, and join me

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.780
in welcoming Steve to Google.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.532
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:34.490
STEVE: Well, thank you
very much indeed, Maris.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.350
It's an absolute delight.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.316
I'm just so happy to be
here and talk to a full room

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:43.190
here at Google this
afternoon about a subject

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.520
which I hope you'll find not
only super interesting but also

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.744
relevant to your roles.

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:52.160
One of the things I'd like to
be able to do this afternoon

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.950
is not just talk about the
theory of persuasion science

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.100
but talk about the practice
of influence and persuasion

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.920
as well, and specifically
how sometimes just making

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.690
very small changes to the
way that you make a case

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.930
or present a proposal
or request of someone

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.000
can oftentimes lead to
very big differences

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.510
in your persuasive success.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.200
And so I'd like to talk a little
bit about that, and clearly

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.351
key to our new book,
"The Small Big."

00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:22.850
But I thought I'd
start out actually

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.460
by telling you a story.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.000
I love this story.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.950
It concerns the late Lord Grade
of Elstree, a British peer,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.820
who tells the story,
or used to tell

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.110
the story of a young man
who came to his office

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.395
one day seeking employment.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.900
The story goes that Lord Lew
would be sitting at his desk,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.080
smoking his fifth
Havana of the day.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.170
It was, after all, around
7:30 in the morning.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.410
And he, for a few
moments, stared menacingly

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.570
at this young man,
who was sitting

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.910
at the opposite
side of the desk,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.580
before standing up and placing
on the desk between them

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.760
a large jug of water.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.050
And then he looked at this
young man and he said,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.095
young man, I've been told
you're quite the persuader.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.430
So sell me this jug of water.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.196
Undaunted, this
young man got up.

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:23.570
He went to the
corner of the room

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.760
where there was a waste paper
basket full to brimming.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.200
He picked it up and
brought it back to the desk

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.200
and placed it next to the jug
of water and then lit a match,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.030
dropped it into the
waste paper basket

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.390
and waited for a few moments
until the flames had reached

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.100
an impressive and perhaps
rather anxiety inducing level,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.630
and then turned around
and said to the peer,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.450
is his Lordship interested
in buying a jug of water?

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.300
Now the story's
entertaining, but I

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.830
think it's also instructive
when we think about influence

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.670
and persuasion, because
there are many approaches

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.770
that that young man
could have taken

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.820
to convince his counterpart.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.210
He could have, for
example, provided

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.040
some information, or try
to sell this jug of water

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.269
by considering the
features and the benefits

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.720
of the jug of water.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.310
He could have used
an economic argument,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.070
and thought about how we might
provide some monetary incentive

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.850
or motivation in order
to persuade his audience.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.180
But instead what he did
was pull on another lever

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.730
of the influence process, not
the informational motivation,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.010
not the economic motivation,
but a change in context,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.540
an environmental motivation.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.080
That small shift,
which, incidentally,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.020
if you think about
it, did nothing

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.200
to change what was on offer.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.140
He simply made that small
shift in environment

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.536
that led to that
change in behavior.

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:03.910
And that's the
case that I'd like

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.040
to make when it comes to
influence and persuasion--

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.440
particularly successful
influence and persuasion.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.380
Increasingly in this
information overloaded world

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.390
that we actually live in,
what we're finding now,

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.410
particularly these last two
decades of persuasion science,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:26.440
is that contexts will
frequently trump cognitions

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.920
when it comes to successful
influence and persuasion.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.880
And sometimes all
that requires you

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:39.450
to do as a communicator is to
make very small, often subtle

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.100
changes to the way that you
make a proposition or proposal

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.710
that link to deep
seated motivations

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.030
inherent in all of us.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.500
In fact, one of the things that
this body of research suggests

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.830
is something rather surprising.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.280
It's this idea that whilst
there may be many tens

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.890
of thousands of different ways
in which we can successfully

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.930
influence and persuade others
through the use of tactics

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.080
or changes, the vast majority
of most successful influence

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.430
and persuasion
can be categorized

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.800
in terms of just three
core motivations.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.150
Those core motivations are
that, in this increasingly

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.500
information overloaded
world, we want

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.810
to make quick and
efficient decisions.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.340
We want to also make decisions
in ways that affiliate us

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.190
with others and gain
the approval of others.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.520
And finally, we want to
make decisions and behave

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.050
in ways that allow us
to be seen in the best

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.750
possible and positive light.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.750
So the claim that I
have here, and the claim

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.650
that we make in this book, is
by thinking about influence

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.100
in the context of these
three core motivations

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.820
and aligning your
request, or your strategy,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.640
or your proposal or
proposition to one or more

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.590
of these can significantly
enhance your success.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.510
So I want to give you
a few examples and then

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.850
after we've done that, we'll
talk a little bit about how

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.710
we can apply these, and
maybe take a few questions.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.040
So let's talk about the first.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.900
This inherent motivation we
have to make accurate decisions

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.879
as efficiently and as
quickly as we possibly can.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:19.420
What's kind of
interesting about this

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.530
is that oftentimes we
won't even consider

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.100
what is on offer in
order to do that.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.700
Instead, what we do is
consider something--

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.556
an alternative, a comparison.

00:07:31.556 --> 00:07:32.680
Let me give you an example.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.130
How many of you like a glass
of wine maybe in the evenings

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.100
or weekends?

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.700
There's a fair
few number of you.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.580
OK.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.610
So consider the
humble wine list.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.720
Typically when a
restaurant or a hotel bar

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.432
presents its wines
to its customers,

00:07:48.432 --> 00:07:49.390
it does so in this way.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.110
It starts with the house wine
at the top, and as you see,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.565
as you look down the list
the wine increases in price.

00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:56.910
This is familiar to you.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.240
And typically what we find is
that when people are presented

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.270
with offers in this
way, they typically

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.490
pick those items
towards the top.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.340
Not the cheapest, no one wants
to be a cheapskate after all.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.420
So they'll take the second
or third ones on the list.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.480
There's a small change that
any one bar, any hotel,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.330
any restaurant could
make that significantly

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.690
alters the choices
that people make.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.840
And it doesn't require
them to delete options.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.990
It doesn't require them to
investing costly resources

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.390
or incentives these choices.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.610
It simply requires them to
turn the list upside down.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.570
And in that instance, these
now become more popular.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.169
This is a really good
example I think of not only

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.659
a small change that
leads to a big difference

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.400
in this instance, but
also this idea of how

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.660
we use one stimulus,
one proposition

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.410
to make an accurate and
efficient decision about what

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.210
that right course
of action is next.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.250
Now it turns out there's a
restaurant chain in Europe that

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.330
are taking this
one stage further.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.930
And what they found
is that sometimes you

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.730
don't have to make what you
compare something to the same.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.080
What's interesting about
the Carluccio's restaurant,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.480
down here on the
bottom, left hand side.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.310
The first thing when you open
a Carluccio's menu that you see

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.060
is a moterscooter.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.580
You'll see it's priced
here at 2,771 pounds.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.660
That's about $3 and
a half thousand.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.510
There it is there.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.780
Why would a restaurant
sell a moterscooter,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.990
or attempt to sell a
moterscooter on its menu?

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.290
Well, it turns out
that it sure as hell

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.760
makes their salads and
sandwiches appear cheaper.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.280
And that's the point
that we're making here.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.560
Oftentimes you can change
people's perception

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.720
of the proposition you make,
change people's reaction

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.000
to your proposal,
not by doing anything

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.740
to change your proposal
at all, but instead,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.490
by thinking carefully about
how you might compare something

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.680
less favorable first.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.750
A different option, knowing
that in this information

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.750
overloaded world
where we seek to make

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.090
quick and efficient decisions.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.870
That's a small
change you can make

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.320
that leads to a big difference.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.900
But here's a mistake
we often make.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.530
When we're presenting proposals.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.550
When we're thinking about
how we might craft our case,

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.710
we'll come up with lots
of different options

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.390
that we're about to
present, and then

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.065
discard those that are
perhaps not the optimum

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.760
And we'll focus
on just one option

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.650
and throw away those options
that perhaps aren't optimal.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.166
And it turns out that
can be a mistake.

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:46.620
In the same way as
when you were at school

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.660
you'd get extra marks for
showing not only how you've

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.870
got to the math answer, but
how you actually-- not just the

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.210
answer itself, but how you
actually got to the answer.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.310
The same is true of
influence and persuasion.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.110
Anything you could do
in the early stages

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.290
of your proposition,
your proposals,

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:06.110
to point out options that
you all going to discard

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.560
increases the salience and
the attractiveness of the very

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.250
next thing that you
actually present.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.770
It works in negotiations too.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.000
I've a wonderful
set of studies here

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.250
that simply show that going
first in a negotiation

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.160
tends to be the
optimum thing to do.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.620
We have lots of
questions sometimes

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.230
from people that
say, well, if I'm

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.130
going to go into a
negotiation, is it better

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.160
for me to sit back and
wait for that opponent

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.870
to make their first
offer, or is it better

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.230
actually if I make the
first offer myself?

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.580
And the answer is,
clearly, the latter.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.710
In these studies, for example,
negotiators purchasing

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.240
quite a large scale
industrial units here,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.880
we find that those
buyers that presented

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.060
their option, their price
first, typically came away

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.900
with about $5 million
increased value

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.381
compared to those that actually
waited for the opponents

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.380
to make the first offer.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.400
So there's a key thing here--
the key theme rather here

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.950
about this idea of
what you present

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.100
first matters an
awful lot when it

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.499
comes to influence
and persuasion.

00:12:07.499 --> 00:12:09.540
Let's talk about the second
of these motivations.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.150
Our desire to
affiliate with others.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.780
To make decisions
and behave in ways

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.170
that gain the
approval of others.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.769
Before we talk about
some of the examples

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:25.310
from persuasion science, I think
it's important at this point

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.830
to mention a dark side,
a downside to this idea

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.520
of affiliating and behaving
in the way that others do.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.770
One of the things we know
from extensive research

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.460
on this idea of social
norms, that people follow

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.310
what many others are doing, is
that it doesn't discriminate

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.250
between desirable and
undesirable behaviors.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.930
If we see that many
people are behaving

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.850
in ways that are
undesirable, are less

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.640
productive to the organization,
we could often join them,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.335
and we can often find that those
unwanted behaviors increase

00:12:58.335 --> 00:12:59.220
further.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.040
There's a really good example
from here in the United States.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.630
In 2007 the Inland
Revenue Services

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.970
doubled the fine for the
late submission of taxes

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.790
from $100 to $200.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.590
And the reason that the IRS gave
for that doubling of the fine

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.030
was because the previous year,
so many American citizens

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.310
had failed to submit
their tax returns on time.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.960
So in an attempt to motivate
people to submit their tax

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.070
returns on time, they
doubled the fine.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.835
The next year there was a 22%
increase in late submissions.

00:13:36.741 --> 00:13:38.240
It's almost as if
people are saying,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.790
well, if everyone
else is doing it,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.830
then maybe I should do it too.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.050
And this is an
important consideration

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.290
when you think about trying to
change behaviors, particularly

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.110
less desirable behaviors in
organizations and in societies.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.380
Often leaders will make the
mistake of drawing attention

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.560
to regrettably, frequent,
undesirable behaviors,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.440
and in doing so actually serve
to increase their frequency.

00:14:05.854 --> 00:14:07.145
AUDIENCE: Just say no to drugs.

00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:11.030
STEVE: One of my
favorite examples

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.972
concerns the National Petrified
Forest Park in Arizona

00:14:14.972 --> 00:14:16.055
here in the United States.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.800
Visitors would come up to the
gate and they would see a sign.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.910
Designed to reduce the
theft of petrified wood

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.700
in crystals from
the forest floor

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.915
that they were losing
some 14 tons of per year.

00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:35.260
And the sign would say, "Your
heritage is being lost."

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.980
Vandalized if you
like, by the theft

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.770
of small pieces of crystal
and petrified wood.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.789
Last year we lost 14 tons.

00:14:42.789 --> 00:14:45.080
People were coming up to the
gate, looking at the sign,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.280
and thinking, we better
get ours quick, then.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.035
It wasn't a crime
prevention strategy.

00:14:51.035 --> 00:14:52.750
It was a crime
promotion strategy.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.880
So so much better if you want
to influence and persuade

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.690
effectively using this
core motivation to point

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.825
to behaviors that are
desirable in a given situation.

00:15:04.825 --> 00:15:08.710
Now my two co-authors, Noah
Goldstein and Robert Cialdini,

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.740
gained some notoriety a few
years ago for a set of studies

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.780
concerning these small
cards that you'll often

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.870
find in hotel bathrooms.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.890
Have you seen these?

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.300
This card here, this
is one from the hotel

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.020
that we're staying
at this weekend.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.470
"Help us save the planet.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.270
It's time for us to take part
in helping the environment.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.530
Please re-use your towels
by hanging them on the rack

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.090
as a signal that
you want to play

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.280
your part for the environment."

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.020
Turns out there's a much,
much more effective way

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.950
of getting people to reuse
there towels and linens, which

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.104
concerns changing the
words on this card

00:15:42.104 --> 00:15:43.520
to instead of
saying, please do it

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.880
for the sake of the
environment, to instead say,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.310
did you know that
significant numbers of people

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.050
who stay in our hotel do
reuse their towels and linens?

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.710
That simple message of
affiliating and aligning

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.440
the message to gain
the approval of others

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.960
typically increases
towel reuse by about 26%.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.730
That's a pretty big difference
for such a small change.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.620
Now consider this
for a few moments.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.030
If you want to
check into a hotel,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.170
and see one of those little
cards to the bathroom

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.090
and it says the
following message,

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.960
just consider for a few moments
what your first reaction would

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.060
be if when you
picked up the card

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.000
you read a message
that said, dear guest,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.970
did you know that the person
that stayed in this room

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.020
before you reused their
towels and linens.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.936
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:34.097 --> 00:16:36.180
STEVE: Yeah, the first
thing you're going to think

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.650
is, I hope they're
not the same towels.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.140
No one wants to know what the
person who stayed in that hotel

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.380
room before you
got up to or did.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.450
As far as we're concerned,
we're the first person

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.600
to have ever stayed
in that room.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.860
And so interestingly,
people will typically

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.640
dismiss that message,
that persuasive appeal

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.020
as having no relevance at all.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.690
It will have no effect.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.660
But interestingly, in
Noah and Bob's studies,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.430
when they changed
that message to say,

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.829
dear guest, the
majority of people

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:15.319
that stayed in this room, 107,
416, 921, reused their towel,

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.400
it was the single
most effective message

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.490
of all, which demonstrates
a really interesting quirk

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.880
in terms of persuasion science.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.160
This idea that
we're oftentimes not

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.760
that good at actually
recognizing what

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.410
does influence and persuade us.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.920
And to give a demonstration,
those towels studies

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.610
spawned a subsequent
set of research

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.100
that we were engaged in when
it came to persuading people

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.027
to pay their taxes on time.

00:17:46.027 --> 00:17:46.860
Take a look at this.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.650
The UK government typically
would send out letters saying,

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.520
please, submit your tax
return by this date.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.040
Pay this amount.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.050
If you fail to do so by the
schedule dates on this letter

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.530
there will be a fine.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.740
The fine is 100 pounds.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.780
It's about $160.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.250
And they typically would
get a response rate at here,

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.060
you can see about 68%,
within a given time.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.500
We made one small
change to that letter

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.300
by placing a sentence across
the top that simply said,

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.750
truthfully, that the
majority of people

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.380
do pay their taxes on time.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.540
And when we did
that we registered

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.580
a pretty impressive
increase in response rates.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:30.920
OK.

00:18:32.356 --> 00:18:33.230
We didn't stop there.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.900
We went one stage
further and said,

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.594
well, if people are more likely
to reuse their towels if they

00:18:37.594 --> 00:18:39.260
know that the person
to stay in the room

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.920
before them reused that towels,
would people be even more

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.970
likely to respond to the
request to submit their tax

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.070
returns on time if they're told
what the majority of people

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.350
in the UK doing, but the
majority of people in their zip

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.961
code, in that postal code.

00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:55.960
And the answer was, yes.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.680
A further impressive increase.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.940
And when we add the name of
the town, Mountain View, San

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:10.370
Francisco, Tempe, Arizona, and
key into that social identity

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.540
we get a huge increase.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.770
That's an 83% response rate.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.790
If you needed anymore
convincing of the power

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.930
of these small changes linked to
these deep seated motivations,

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.920
this is the set
of data to provide

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:35.000
that clarity, that evidence.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.620
Because the Inland Revenue
Services in the United Kingdom

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.680
have collected literally
hundreds of millions

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.780
of additional dollars
in tax revenues

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.286
by simply aligning
their message,

00:19:50.286 --> 00:19:52.285
their persuasive appeal
to this core motivation.

00:19:54.309 --> 00:19:55.350
Talk about the final one.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.850
This idea that we
want to act in ways

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.470
that allow us to see
ourselves in a positive light.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.110
That's why the
majority of people

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.050
think that they're an
above average driver.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.890
It's also the reason why after
our sports team has perhaps

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.160
played particularly
badly one weekend

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.070
we'll talk about how
badly they played,

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.680
but after an
impressive win we'll

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.450
talk about how
brilliantly we played.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.680
This idea of how we
want to act in ways

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:30.220
that allow us to feel that we
are seen positively by others.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.809
This idea of a self commitment.

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:33.350
Let me give you a
couple of examples.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.150
Adam Grate, who's a
professor here a Wharton,

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.020
published an interesting set of
studies just a couple of years

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.520
ago.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.750
How do you arrange and
persuade doctors, physicians

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.290
to sanitize their hands, to
wash their hands each time

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.390
that they go onto a
hospital ward, or each time

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.390
they go into a treatment
room, or each time they

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.320
treat an individual patient.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.320
They tested three
different messages.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.620
The first was a simple,
gel in, wash out.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.340
An information appeal.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.620
Had no effect
whatsoever at increasing

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.750
this practice of
hand sanitization.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.840
So they tried to second message.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.825
And it was to say,
it's important

00:21:18.825 --> 00:21:23.230
that you wash your hands
because it keeps you sanitized.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.440
It keeps you healthy.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.150
You do it for the
benefit of you.

00:21:27.696 --> 00:21:28.570
No effect whatsoever.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.750
It was the first
message, the message

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.940
that said, please,
wash your hands.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.350
Please, sanitize your hands
for the sake of your patients.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.220
It was this idea
that they were almost

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.880
being reminded of the
commitment that they

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.550
had made when they qualified
as medical practitioners.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.170
So what small
changes could we key

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.330
into there that might
lead to big differences?

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.650
Well, take a look at this.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.950
Is a really interesting
set of research

00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:00.050
that looks at the simple act of
including someone's photograph

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.946
on their x-rays
and their CT scans.

00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:04.570
Now imagine you're
a diagnosing doctor.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.270
You see lots of plates, lots
of CT scans, lots of x-rays.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.910
And your job is to diagnose
them and make a recommendation.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.120
The small change here
was to simply include

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.520
a photograph of that
patient on their x-ray plate

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.250
to humanize the situation in the
context, and in that instance

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.840
a significant increase in the
amount of treatment options

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:37.980
and rated caring that those
physicians employed and applied

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.730
to those x-ray plates.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.796
So one way that we can
increase people's likelihood

00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:44.170
to be seen in a
positive light is

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.534
to do things that
humanize interactions

00:22:46.534 --> 00:22:48.075
and remind them of
their commitments.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.421
Here's another.

00:22:50.421 --> 00:22:52.170
You'll probably recognize
from the accent,

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.520
I'm not from these parts.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.060
I'm from the United Kingdom.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.400
The UK National Health Service
has a significant problem

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.220
with the number of people
that will make appointments

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.960
to go to see a physician, a
physiotherapist, a dentist,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.450
and fail to show up.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.330
We have a system that is free at
the point of delivery as well.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.690
So there are no
penalties or costs

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.710
incurred if patients
fail to turn up.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:24.150
All the expense, all the cost,
all those wasted resources

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.300
is borne by the
National Health System.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.940
It costs literally
hundreds of millions

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.110
of pounds each and every year.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.230
800 million pounds
at the last estimate.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.570
How might we use one of
these core motivations

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.720
to change the way that an
interaction takes place that

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.260
increases the likelihood
that people will show up?

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.200
Well, here's one change
that we actually made.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.809
When people phoned for an
appointment, rather than

00:23:49.809 --> 00:23:52.350
the receptionist simply put the
phone down after that patient

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.880
to be given the time, and
day of their appointment,

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.900
they will pause and ask
simply that individual

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.110
to repeat back verbally the
time and day of the appointment.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.900
"Your requirement is at
Tuesday next at 2:30.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.060
Could you just confirm
that for me please?"

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.820
Wait for the patient
to confirm it,

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.945
and we registered a modest, but
still significant reduction.

00:24:12.945 --> 00:24:17.310
A 3 1/2% reduction, but a 3
1/2% reduction of an 800 hundred

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.890
million pound problem. that's
like a $1.3 billion problem is

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:22.640
still significant.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.440
We then actually
tested another insight,

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.370
which made to the
commitment even more active.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.210
How many of you when you've
been given an appointment

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.350
at a doctor's, or dentist's,
or a physiotherapist have ever

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.780
been given a little
card with the time

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.840
and day the appointment?

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.770
Most of you in the room
is being given that.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.270
OK.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.440
Who writes the
details on the card?

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.700
AUDIENCE: The receptionist.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.220
STEVE: Yeah, yes,
the receptionist.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.410
It's the health
clerk, the person

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.070
who is make an
appointment for you.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.280
Turns out that there
is very good evidence

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.550
that that is the wrong person.

00:24:57.311 --> 00:24:57.810
OK?

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.550
When we simply rearranged for
the blank card and the pen

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.590
to be given to the
individual, we now

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.830
register a very
impressive reduction close

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.310
to 18% reduction in no shows.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:12.890
Now an 18% reduction in
a $1.3 billion problem.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:18.335
That's a huge impact
for such a small change.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.145
So what I sought to have
done this afternoon,

00:25:22.145 --> 00:25:27.630
in our short time together, is
to offer you an additional way

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.890
to think about
influence and persuasion

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:34.060
beyond the traditional
information, education,

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.560
and economic levers
that we typically

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.970
rely on to persuade others.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.700
And that's to align your
request to just a set

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:49.730
of very small, but deeply rooted
motivations that we all have,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.030
and that we all
deem as important.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.230
The importance
and the motivation

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.760
to make rapid,
efficient decisions

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.440
in a crazy information
overloaded world.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.330
The motivation to
make those decisions

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.930
in a way that align,
and affiliate,

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.090
and gain the approval of others.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.290
And to make those
decisions in a way that

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.400
allow us to be seen publicly
in a positive light.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.870
And notice a couple of things
about these small changes.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:25.380
First, that they often required
just a change in context,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.110
not necessary a
change in cognition.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:34.819
Or a shift in the fundamental
strategy or persuasion

00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:36.360
appeal that you're
making of someone.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.230
We're not necessarily
asking you to change

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.710
what you have, change
what you offer,

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.180
change what you're proposing.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.050
Just change the context
in which it's seen.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.330
That's the first.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.810
The second, notice how
small these changes are.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.220
Rarely, this is a
surprising aspects

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.820
of this recent and growing
body of persuasion research

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.620
is that rarely do they require
costly investments in time,

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.280
in money, in
additional resources.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.160
And finally notice that
rarely do these insights

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.610
come about by an
investigation of the best

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.022
practices within
an organization.

00:27:12.022 --> 00:27:13.730
And the best evidence
I can give for that

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.315
is the data from
the tax offices.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.870
Tax officials have
been collecting

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.520
your money, our
money, for centuries.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.690
You would have thought that
they would have figured

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.900
out the most effective
ways to do it.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.420
They figured out
the best practices.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.300
And I'm a big fan of
sharing best practice,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.310
but remember also that best
practices do have a limitation.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:40.380
And the limitation being that
they'll typically only uncover

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.160
those best practices
that are, and insights

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.590
that are already known.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.950
It took a team of persuasion
scientists to figure out

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.919
there was a more
effective way as well.

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:53.460
So I wonder how
we're doing for time.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.010
We just got maybe a
couple of moments.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.551
So I just did want
to just finish off

00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:59.610
with this, this question here.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.900
This idea of will these
effects work in combination?

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.920
And will they work
in any context,

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.440
or are there
limitations to them?

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.450
And I think that there
are limitations to them.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.080
So I don't want to
present a panacea here

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.750
that this is the way to
influence and persuade people

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.980
every time, but
rather just offer

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.700
a set of universal
principles and rules

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.529
that will guide you to a
more effective outcome.

00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:27.320
But let me just talk
briefly about a couple

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.180
of these some recent studies
that we sight in the book.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.660
The first is a good
friend of mine,

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.680
Paul Dolan, who is a behavioral
economist at the London

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.760
School of Economics, ran
a really interesting set

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.000
of experiments recently.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.940
He found that if you send a
letter to homeowners telling

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.850
them that they
are consuming more

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.892
energy than their
neighbors with a request

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:49.350
to reduce their
energy consumption,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.430
that's a pretty effective way
of actually getting people

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.070
to reduce their
energy consumption.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.480
You use that peer pressure.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.020
And in Paul's
studies, he typically

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.080
found that there was about a 6%
reduction in energy consumption

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.420
the following month.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.790
He also found,
interestingly, that if you

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.584
send a letter to
people and say, please

00:29:04.584 --> 00:29:06.500
reduce your energy
consumption, and if you do,

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:10.430
we'll give you $150, that that
was pretty effective as well,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.220
typically reducing
energy consumption

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.430
by about the same amount.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.120
So the question,
of course, is, what

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.054
if we combine those two things?

00:29:18.054 --> 00:29:19.470
What if we send a
letter to people

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.330
that says, please reduce
your energy consumption

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.870
and fall in line with your
neighbors, and if you do,

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.800
we'll pay you $150?

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.560
It turns out that when Paul
did that in his studies,

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.820
people had a heating party.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.770
Now in mathematics,
1 plus 1 equals 2.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.410
In persuasion science,
that's not always the case.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:45.920
So I can't report that simply
adding more persuasion tactics

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.010
to an appeal would actually
lead to be more effective.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.500
Oftentimes, it doesn't.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.170
It actually reduces its
effects, much in the same way

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.500
as if you pour all of the
spice from your spice racks

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.450
into the chicken, no one
is going to want eat it.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.105
I think it's the same when it
comes to persuasion as well.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.750
Here's another example.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.760
Back to our friend Adam
Grant from Wharton,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.430
a series of studies looking
at charitable fund raising

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:09.660
appeals.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.600
He found that, again, a similar
approach, when people were sent

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.150
a letter saying, please
donate to this charity,

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:22.040
and there was an appeal that
targeted their ego, think

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:27.350
about what others will be saying
about you if you do donate,

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.920
that was a pretty
effective appeal.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.980
They raised donations
as a result.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.690
A second group got
a different letter,

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.160
a more altruistic approach.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.564
Think the benefit you'll
do to others by donating.

00:30:39.564 --> 00:30:40.980
That was pretty
effective as well.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.646
And he found the same thing when
he combined the two approaches.

00:30:43.646 --> 00:30:46.710
Put that egotistical and
altruistic effects together,

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.090
and it canceled out the effect.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:56.150
So the key message here is to
use these insights sparingly.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.650
They are small.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.470
They fly under the radar.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.010
And what we're
finding is that if we

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:06.405
try to incorporate too many,
we do build resistance.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.220
One final one, and I think
this speaks to the environment

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.160
that we're here in in Google
as well, is this idea of, well,

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.680
do they work equally effectively
in different contexts,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.515
for example, online?

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.250
This is a series of studies that
we conducted with our friends

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.670
at Blue State Digital--
again, fund raising.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.190
We send out emails
to people asking

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.970
to donate to a
particular charity

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.520
and test different messages.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.620
And one of the messages
we wanted to test

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.120
was this idea of to
gain the approval

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.320
and to affiliate with
others, so pointing out

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.007
how previous people like them
had donated to the appeal.

00:31:41.007 --> 00:31:42.673
And we sent those out
by email and found

00:31:42.673 --> 00:31:47.700
it had no effect whatsoever,
no effect at all.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.800
And we think what's
going on here

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:56.530
is that oftentimes that more
bloodless communication,

00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:01.731
that email wasn't surveying to
humanize that communication as

00:32:01.731 --> 00:32:02.230
much.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.960
It turned out that the best
message in an email environment

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.300
was to simply tell people
how easy it was to donate.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.820
It only takes a minute.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.440
And that seems to
be the best message

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.534
for that context for that
communication channel.

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:17.950
And that's where we get this
significant increase as well.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.870
So leave you with
the thought that

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.470
oftentimes these
small changes, we also

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:27.920
need to think about the
appropriate context in which

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.050
they could be used as well.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:34.545
But the fact of the matter
is that they are all small.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.610
And it turns out
that when it comes

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.630
to influencing and
persuading others,

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:43.830
I think we're gathering more
and more evidence that small

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.020
can very much be the new big.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.020
Thank you.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.080
MARIS: Tell a
little story there.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.260
I know people here are
with PG&amp;E. We are at home

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.660
and we get these
letters that say

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.957
how our neighbors are doing.

00:33:03.957 --> 00:33:06.290
And certainly, that was like,
almost like a game for us,

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.810
and we were way
over our neighbors.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.784
And so, I felt really bad,
and so then we adjusted.

00:33:12.784 --> 00:33:14.200
STEVE: Yeah, I
think it's the case

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:20.140
that the US, through
the Opower Organization,

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.910
have made great
strides in that field,

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.780
those home energy reports.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.440
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious if
you could hazard a guess as

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.575
to a couple generations
down the road.

00:33:29.575 --> 00:33:31.950
We learn a couple of, sort
of, small changes we can make.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:33.574
Do you think as
generations progressed,

00:33:33.574 --> 00:33:36.310
we become as a group, become
more immune to things?

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.310
So then these kind of things
will have to be repeated?

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.900
Or is it intrinsic in
our nature some how?

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.620
STEVE: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.210
AUDIENCE: The
desensitization as a--

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.900
STEVE: Yeah, as we learn more
about the influence process

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.880
and learn more about the
strategies that do effectively

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.810
influence and
persuade others, do

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:59.931
we become less affected by
them, and perhaps desensitized

00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:00.430
to them?

00:34:02.686 --> 00:34:04.310
So I want to say two
things about that.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.490
I think the first
thing to recognize

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:10.139
is that it's not just our
knowledge of the influence

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:14.900
and persuasion process that
extends and grows over time.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:19.600
Our knowledge of all information
extends and grows as well.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:25.540
So it's not that we are
growing in our insights

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.940
about one particular field
to the expense of others.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.630
So we are constantly
being overloaded.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:34.670
So our need to have quick and
efficient mechanisms for making

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.156
decisions won't
wane, if anything,

00:34:37.156 --> 00:34:38.239
it will actually increase.

00:34:39.304 --> 00:34:40.679
But I think there
is a case to be

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.860
made when it comes to
the particular tactic

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.098
or individual strategy
that someone uses.

00:34:46.098 --> 00:34:47.139
I'll give you an example.

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:50.420
So it turns out
that if you've ever

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.600
been given a mint or
a chocolate at the end

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.239
if your meal when the
food server brings

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.340
the receipt and the
bill along for you,

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.240
despite people saying that they
are immune to such effects,

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.350
it does-- there's one.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.810
It does influence
tipping behavior.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.265
So if a food server puts
down one mint for each person

00:35:12.265 --> 00:35:14.080
at the table along
with the bill,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.070
tips typically increase
in these studies

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.440
that David Strohmetz
conducted, by around about 3%.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.930
Interesting, if they put
two mints down on the table,

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:22.690
they don't double.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:23.731
They actually quadrupole.

00:35:23.731 --> 00:35:25.355
You get about a 14% increase.

00:35:26.487 --> 00:35:28.070
So there's a really
good example of us

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.860
responding to an obligation.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.795
Someone's given
that to us first.

00:35:32.795 --> 00:35:37.190
Now if every single
restaurant did that,

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.960
we would very,
very quickly become

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.940
desensitized to that
particular tactic.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.300
And therefore, I
think you would wane.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.070
It would decrease in
effectiveness pretty rapidly.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.760
But the fundamental
motive that drives

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.960
that behavior, our
desire to give back

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.360
to others what has been given
to us first and to live up

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.420
or obligations, that
doesn't wane at all.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.510
So I think the answer
to your question

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.130
is that the
individual strategies

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.890
and tactics themselves
could become less effective

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.190
over time, but the
fundamental set

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:18.890
of principles that shape and
guide influence and persuasion

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.310
will increase in value as
we become more information

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.370
overloaded, more stimulus
saturated, and require

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.820
these shortcuts
to good decisions.

00:36:29.981 --> 00:36:31.480
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned that context

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.880
is more powerful
than information

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.430
or economic reasons, and then
delivering this message to us

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:42.590
or persuade with us, could
you use context in addition

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:46.210
to all the information you
give out as an example to us?

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.730
STEVE: Well, that's
exactly right.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:53.010
Now I'm not saying that
information, and education,

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.580
and incentives aren't important.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.540
They are very, very important.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.390
But consider them--
consider them like this.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.420
Consider them like
two legs of a stool.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:06.600
Two legged stools
are often wobbly.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.270
What this set of research
presents and offers

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:13.250
is a third stabilizing
leg, a third lever.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.920
and this thing
about information.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.000
It's great that we have access
to just so much information,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.500
easily accessible at
the click of a button,

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.120
the swipe of a screen.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.862
You are, as an organization,
the world's curators

00:37:29.862 --> 00:37:31.320
when it comes to
information, and I

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.530
think that's an actual
wonderful thing.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.862
But remember too
that we are just

00:37:35.862 --> 00:37:37.070
overwhelmed with information.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:43.320
Just simply pouring more
information into an appeal

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.230
is much like pouring more
water into an already full pail

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.880
of water.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.379
It'll just spill
out over the sides.

00:37:49.379 --> 00:37:53.270
And so it's not information
the influences us.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.460
Its information in
the right context

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.340
that aligns to one of
these core motivations.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.430
That, I think, is the key
to successful persuasion.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:07.542
It provides that additional
set of tools in that regard.

00:38:07.542 --> 00:38:09.210
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any more examples

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.860
of some interesting
situations where

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.030
like AB testing
might be effective.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.430
Specifically in our marketing
and our advertising at Google

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.860
where an AB test,
the presentation

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.690
might make the difference
between the sale

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:27.920
of-- the purchase of
an ad space versus not,

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.130
or something like that?

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:30.150
STEVE: Yeah, I do.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.300
And do you know I think you're
just in a wonderful position

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.380
to be able to do that with the
facilities you actually have.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.940
To craft an appeal, and just
make a small, subtle change

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.740
to maybe the position of
an image on a website,

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.530
or the inclusion of a
social proof appeal,

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.836
or the change in words.

00:38:49.836 --> 00:38:51.210
I mean that's
essentially what we

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.950
did with those
charitable studies.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:00.040
We randomize three
different audiences

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.340
to receive a different message.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.400
Took 10% of the
total audience that

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.145
were going to
receive these emails.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.180
Figured out which one
was the most effective,

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.759
so that we can then load all
the ballast onto the 90% that

00:39:13.759 --> 00:39:15.050
haven't yet received the email.

00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:19.069
I'm a huge fan of this
idea of test and learn.

00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:21.360
And one of the things that
new technologies give us now

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.234
is the ability do that
very quickly, very simply,

00:39:24.234 --> 00:39:25.275
often very, very cheaply.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.370
AUDIENCE: Electronics is cheap.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:29.960
STEVE: Sorry?

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.030
AUDIENCE: Electronics is cheep.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.703
It isn't paper.

00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.360
It doesn't live forever.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.347
STEVE: Yeah.

00:39:34.347 --> 00:39:35.930
Yeah, we're in this
position now where

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.815
we can test and learn
a lot more effectively.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.264
Do so on a small scale,
but a big enough scale

00:39:41.264 --> 00:39:43.430
to recognize there are some
robustness to what we're

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.330
actually doing, and
then we could, as I say,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.920
load our resources on that
message or that appeal

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.320
that we know is tested the best.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.385
AUDIENCE: You provided a number
of examples about big things

00:39:54.385 --> 00:39:55.010
that were done.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.310
Affecting a lot of people.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.070
Taxpayers, guests in hotels.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.820
Do you have examples
of things that you've

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.970
done for one on one
interactions with other people

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.010
where this comes into play?

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:08.900
STEVE: Yeah.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.880
Yeah, let me give you a couple
of those, because, yeah, I

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:15.220
think when we're talking
about these big data sets,

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.990
large numbers of
homogeneous transactions

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.364
allow us to be able to present
a compelling case in terms

00:40:19.364 --> 00:40:21.040
of the robustness.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.170
But oftentimes our
influence appeals

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.470
are simply down to a
one to one interaction

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.190
with a colleague or a manager.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.530
So let me give you a couple.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.230
There's one that actually
we talk about in the book.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:38.800
A series of studies conducted
by Terri Kurtzberg from Rutgers

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.866
University over
in New Jersey, who

00:40:40.866 --> 00:40:42.490
finds that when we
are looking to build

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.840
a relationship with
someone who is remote

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.720
to us, a colleague perhaps
in a different city

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.280
or even in a different region
of the world, something

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.980
we can do very, very early
on in our email exchanges

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.900
to humanize that
interaction is to place

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.780
an attachment, such
a small cartoon.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.740
So she conducted this with
one to one negotiations

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:11.010
in organizations and found that
when the individual concerned

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:15.510
reached out to a negotiating
partner in their organization--

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.230
and in this instance, actually
attached a Dilbert cartoon,

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:21.220
where Dilbert actually screws
up a negotiation-- that

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.570
was the kind of ice breaker.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:28.750
So in an increasingly electronic
world we actually live in,

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.680
these small steps that just
humanize an interaction

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:37.826
could be important things that
make the difference to everyone

00:41:37.826 --> 00:41:39.950
else that's doing the quick,
efficient email thing.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.680
So there is an immediate
example in a one to one

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.300
situation reaching
out to colleagues.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.591
AUDIENCE: So that's an example
of changing the context.

00:41:47.282 --> 00:41:48.240
STEVE: Yes, I think so.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:48.880
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:54.910
It gives a sense of there's
someone on the other side,

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.140
not just perhaps a
faceless email address.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.630
It humanizes that interaction.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.710
AUDIENCE: How can you guard
against these techniques being

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:03.370
used on you?

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.200
Because sometimes I
mean, these techniques

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.200
can be used in a good way
and also in a bad way.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.310
So is it like just by knowing
these techniques it-selves,

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.590
is it enough to
guard against them?

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.760
STEVE: Yeah, I mean
that's a great question.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.240
In fact, there's an inherent
message underneath that

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.580
as well, which is that
some of these effects

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.920
can be used to exploit, to
manipulate, to get people

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.900
perhaps to make decisions
that they wouldn't ordinarily

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.502
make if they had all the
facts or all the information

00:42:34.502 --> 00:42:35.210
to actually have.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.130
So there's a very important
ethical message here.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.560
That one would hope that you'd
only use these in a morally,

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.990
responsible, and ethical way.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.190
I think that understanding
these biases,

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:52.380
understanding how they do affect
and influence us can help.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.100
So one could make the argument
that any book about influence

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.990
and persuasion, or any set of
information about the influence

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:04.320
and persuasion process is
not only a set of tools

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.860
to influence and
persuade others,

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.790
but arguably could be used as
a defense strategy as well.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.360
I'm not entirely convinced
that knowing these effects

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.330
is going to be enough.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.890
And the primary reason
for that is that we just

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:25.210
don't have oftentimes
the space to think about

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:26.970
whether they are
being used on us.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:30.510
And I'm particularly
these small changes

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.250
that are so small they
often fly under the radar.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:38.284
There is very good evidence
from the persuasion sciences

00:43:38.284 --> 00:43:39.950
and behavioral sciences,
more generally,

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.670
that people aren't that
good at recognizing

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.100
what it is in a context that
does influence and persuade

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.600
them.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.950
There's a really
great set of studies

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.575
that were conducted
here in California.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.200
When researchers
went door to door

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.690
asking homeowners which
message would most

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.100
motivate them to reduce
their energy consumption.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.270
Perhaps be a little bit more
environmentally friendly.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:07.310
They rated information about how
if they change their behavior

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.350
it would be
beneficial to society

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:12.390
as the biggest
motivation, followed

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:15.390
by the impact of having
future generations,

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.730
followed by the savings
they'd actually make.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:20.060
They dismissed the idea
that because their neighbors

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.080
were increasingly
making these changes

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.080
that it would have
any influence.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.170
But then, in the tests,
when those messages

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:30.090
were distributed across the
neighbors, the neighborhoods

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.934
rather, that message
of social proof

00:44:32.934 --> 00:44:34.600
was the only message
that had an effect.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.250
So it's a really good
demonstration of much

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.240
as it might not be
comforting to learn,

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.980
we often aren't that
good at recognizing

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.480
what does influence
and persuade us.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.520
So I'm not entirely
convinced that

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.820
just learning about
them will be enough.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.352
But I think it's a good step.

00:44:51.352 --> 00:44:53.060
AUDIENCE: More and
more I think about it,

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.680
my takeaway is that
you don't really

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.190
know what is actually
going to work.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:02.150
And it depends on the context,
depends on the people.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:06.060
The same message may not
work in a different crowd.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:11.260
So if you just had one chance,
then almost, you could try,

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.750
but you don't know what
the effect is going to be.

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:16.630
But if you were able
to do some testing,

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:19.370
and so on, and try
different options then

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:22.510
you have a possibility
like the AB testing

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:26.190
where you could do 1%, 2%, and
then go for a larger message.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.270
But like the presentations
and so on, you have one shot.

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.690
Where you're talking to a VP and
saying, hey, here's the thing.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.170
You could deploy the strategy
which you talked about,

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.900
hey, use two of these.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.750
You don't really
know what the effect

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.010
is going to be ultimately.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.250
STEVE: Well, I do except
that to a certain point.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.720
However, I do
think that there is

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.860
a huge advantage
to understanding

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.922
the fundamental principles
compared to perhaps just going

00:45:51.922 --> 00:45:52.630
with gut feeling.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.350
Yeah?

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:59.170
And if we know that
we can increase

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:03.270
the appeal, the effectiveness
of our proposition,

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:07.480
by aligning it to one or more
of these core motivations,

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.390
and that we will be
in a better position

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:16.390
than not, that alone has
got to be of huge value

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:21.630
compared to sitting at our desks
with the spreadsheet in front

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.720
of us, the slideshow,
whatever it may be,

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.670
thinking about, well, what do
I think will influence this VP?

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:32.850
There's a set of tools
grounded in good evidence that

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:36.100
will increase potentially
the likelihood that we

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.010
will be successful.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:41.660
I'm never going to say, and any
person that comes into Google

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.990
and says that they found the
way to persuade 100% of people

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:47.340
100% of the time, you want
to kick them out the door.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.750
Because it doesn't exist.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:52.250
But we can, by making
these small changes,

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.230
measure bigger affects in
our persuasive success.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:56.601
There's no doubt about that.

00:46:56.601 --> 00:46:59.100
AUDIENCE: Got a question on
just more personal as far as you

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.340
writing this book.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.850
What was your
process involved in

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:03.850
like finding time for
yourself to get this done?

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.696
STEVE: Yeah.

00:47:06.696 --> 00:47:08.570
And there's three of
us, by the way, as well.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.674
It's not just my book.

00:47:10.674 --> 00:47:12.090
Noah Goldstein and
Robert Cialdini

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:13.750
have also contributed equally.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:21.380
So one thing that has
helped is the fact

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.670
that we've structured this
book slightly differently

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:26.780
to a traditional book,
which would have maybe

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.360
a core idea and then
eight or nine chapters

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.590
that it expands on.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:35.010
This book is made up of
actually 53 chapters,

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:40.070
and each chapter is no
more than 1,500 words long.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:44.150
So it presents an insight
from persuasion science,

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:46.880
it gives you enough of
the underlying mechanism

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.400
to get in touch with
what's actually going on,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.430
and then it rapidly
moves to a, here's

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:54.740
what it means to you
at work, at home,

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.990
whatever the situation may be.

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:02.330
And so writing them
in that way, I think,

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:04.670
was a good exercise,
because we could write them

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.720
as perhaps blog
posts to begin with.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.200
500 or 600 word blog posts.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:15.560
Scan the latest research, read
the abstracts in the journals,

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:20.599
pick those that we think have
a good basis of application,

00:48:20.599 --> 00:48:21.890
and then extend those chapters.

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:25.260
So we could write them
at different times.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.630
And we don't necessarily have
to write them sequentially,

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:29.520
one after the other.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:34.879
We could write them as the
data becomes available,

00:48:34.879 --> 00:48:36.420
and then think about
the application.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.620
So that's one of the
approaches we actually made,

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.250
and that made the
job a lot easier.

00:48:42.161 --> 00:48:43.910
Of course, the challenge
then is just when

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:45.460
you've got lots
and lots of content

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.890
is how you actually organize it.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.690
And that's where this idea of
these three core motivations

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:51.190
came in.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.060
That we could generally
categorized them.

00:48:54.002 --> 00:48:55.710
And that's the approach
we actually took.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.890
I think the final
thing which was useful,

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.990
was the fact that-- so I'm
not an academic by training.

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:03.930
My two colleagues clearly are.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:09.380
And so to have that balance of
scientifically and academically

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.340
informed insights, but
then a reality check

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.730
that said, OK, well, that's
all very well in theory,

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:16.190
but how do you
apply in practice?

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:20.670
What does that mean to people in
Google, people in organizations

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.610
that need to interact
each and every day?

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:24.240
How do we operationalize this?

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.150
I think that was also
an important aspect

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:29.030
of the creation process too.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:31.250
Well, thank you
very much indeed.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:34.600
