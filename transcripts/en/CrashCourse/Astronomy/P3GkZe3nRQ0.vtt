00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.019
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.
As you might expect, that makes it pretty hot. 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.459
But also, it’s pretty cool.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.500
There are seven naked-eye solar system objects
in the sky: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.580
Saturn, the Sun, and the Moon. Seven. Each
of them was associated with a god in ancient

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.800
times. Mercury was the Roman messenger of
the gods, fleet of foot—literally, he had

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.220
wings on his shoes—and a rapid traveler.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.500
To anyone who’s seen Mercury in the sky,
this affiliation with the swift god is no

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.300
surprise. Mercury the planet moves pretty
quickly, visibly changing its position relative

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.870
to the background stars even after a single
night.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.300
Despite its speed, the planet never gets very
far from the Sun. At best, it can reach a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.060
separation of about 28°. That’s about three times the
apparent size of your fist held at arms length.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.560
In 1639 the Italian astronomer Giovanni Zupi
used a telescope to observe Mercury, and he

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.210
discovered it undergoes a complete cycle of
phases over time, just like the Moon does.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.780
The only way that can happen is if Mercury orbits the
Sun, and not the Earth — another checkmark in the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.760
column for heliocentrism, which was starting
to look better and better all the time.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.820
And of course that’s the way things really
are. Mercury is the innermost of the planets

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.010
in the solar system. It orbits the Sun at
an average distance of about 58 million kilometers,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.450
roughly a third the distance of the Earth
from the Sun. That’s why we never see it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.020
stray far from the Sun. From our viewpoint, its
smaller orbit keeps it huddled closer to our star.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.580
That’s why we see it move so rapidly, too;
it’s closer to the Sun, so the gravity it

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.659
feels from the Sun is stronger, and therefore
its orbital velocity is faster than Earth’s.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.060
It orbits the Sun once every 88 days.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.290
And that’s also why we see undergo phases.
When it’s between us and the Sun we’re

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.560
looking at its dark side, and when it’s
on the other side of the Sun we’re looking

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.470
at its fully illuminated half. In between
it goes through the same phases as the Moon:

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.850
crescent, half full, gibbous, and so on.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.640
Not that this is such an easy observation
to make. Because it never gets far from the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.120
Sun, it’s always low to the horizon after
sunset or before sunrise. When we observe

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.750
it we’re looking through all the muck and
turbulence in our air, so it’s usually pretty

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.180
fuzzy. Making matters worse, it’s a dinky
planet, only about 4900 kilometers in diameter,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.680
about a third the Earth’s width.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.940
One upside to all this is that because it’s
close to the Sun, it’s illuminated fiercely,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.600
and can be pretty bright even near the horizon.
If you ever get a chance to see it, you really

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.160
should. It’s pretty cool.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.620
Mercury’s orbit is weird. It has the most
elliptical orbit of any planet, ranging from

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.480
46 to nearly 70 million kilometers from the
Sun. When it’s closest to the Sun it receives

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.150
more than twice as much light and heat as
when it’s furthest!

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.459
Mercury is too small and difficult to observe
to see surface features on it, which for a

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.069
long time made it impossible to figure out
how long its day is. Astronomers assumed that

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.160
the tides from the Sun had locked Mercury’s
spin so that its day was equal to its year,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.240
just like our Moon spins once for every time
it goes around the Earth. However, in 1965,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.020
astronomers used Doppler radar to observe
Mercury and directly measure its spin and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.099
they got a surprise: Its day was only 59 Earth
days long, not 88.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.750
But that’s a significant number as well.
To be more exact, the actual length of Mercury’s

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.410
year is 87.97 days, and the actual length
of its day is 58.65 Earth days. If you divide

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.010
those two numbers, you see their ratio is
almost exactly 2/3!

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.110
It turns out there’s more than one way to
tidally lock the rotation of a planet to its

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.080
orbit. Remember earlier, when I said Mercury’s
orbit is highly elliptical? The tides from

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.810
the Sun are far stronger on Mercury when it’s
at perihelion, the closest point in its orbit

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.190
to the Sun, than when it’s at aphelion,
the farthest point in its orbit. After Mercury

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.920
first formed, tides from the Sun slowed its
rotation just like the Earth’s tides on

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.650
the Moon slowed the Moon down as well.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.180
But at some point, Mercury’s spin slowed
to where it was 2/3 of its orbital period.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.049
So, at one perihelion pass, one side of Mercury
faces the Sun. Then, 88 or so days later,

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.000
it approaches perihelion again. But it’s
spun 1.5 times, and this means the exact opposite

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.769
side of Mercury faces the Sun at this closest
approach. 88 days later, Mercury has spun

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.049
1.5 times again, and the whole thing repeats.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.509
It turns out that’s a perfectly legitimate
stable configuration, just like the one-to-one

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.419
spin/orbit setup. The way the physics works
out, tides like simple multiples. Once the

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.930
day became 2/3 the period of the year, forced
by Mercury’s elliptical orbit, the tides

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.860
stopped slowing it, and things have been that
way ever since.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.580
Mercury’s elliptical orbit, together with
the 2:3 spin to orbit ratio, make for a very,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.249
very weird day on Mercury. If you stay in
one spot, it takes the Sun two Mercury years,

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:49.139
176 days, for the Sun to go around the sky
once! That’s because if you’re on the

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.180
side of Mercury facing the Sun at one perihelion,
the other side will face it one year later.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.849
It’ll only be after the second year ends
that you’re facing the Sun again.

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.159
But it gets weirder. Mercury’s spin is constant;
it doesn’t speed up or slow down. However,

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:08.430
its motion around the Sun is faster at perihelion
than aphelion. At aphelion, Mercury’s spin

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.899
is a bit faster than its orbital speed, so
the Sun moves rapidly westward across the

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:17.289
sky. But at perihelion Mercury’s motion
around the Sun actually more than compensates

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.199
for its spin, so the Sun appears to stop in
the sky and actually move backwards for a

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.999
few days! Then, as Mercury pulls away from
the Sun, its orbital velocity slows down,

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.979
and the Sun starts to move west once again
as the planet’s rotation dominates.

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.159
If you’re at just the right spot on the
planet’s surface, this means you could actually

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.579
watch the Sun rise, slow, stop, set again,
then rise again!

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.580
And you think time zones on the Earth are
a pain.

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.629
Mercury’s hard to observe from Earth, and
much of what we know about it is due to observations

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:51.860
from space probes sent there. Mariner 10 made
three flybys of Mercury in the 1970s, and

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.599
mapped about half the surface. We learned
that it had almost no atmosphere, and was

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.129
therefore unsurprisingly covered in craters.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.679
In 2011, the MESSENGER probe entered orbit
around Mercury after making a series of close

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:07.899
flybys. The pictures it returned were breathtaking,
and revealed a world that has seen a lot of

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:13.199
pummeling over the eons. It’s covered in craters,
pole to pole, some hundreds of kilometers in diameter.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.960
The largest is called Caloris Basin, a whopping
huge impact feature 1600 kilometers across.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.490
There are some smoother plains on the planet’s
surface too, which appear to be older than

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.619
the cratered regions. These plains are covered
in cracks called rupes. These are compression

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:30.979
folds, like wrinkles on a fruit rind that’s
dried out. Apparently, as Mercury’s interior

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.179
cooled after it formed, the planet shrank, and
the crust cracked as it tried to shrink as well.

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:39.999
Several of the craters have extensive ray
systems. Like on our Moon, these are formed

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:44.339
when impacts fling out long plumes of material
that then settle down on the surface.

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:48.990
One of my favorite things of all about Mercury:
Craters are named after artists. Musicians,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:55.919
writers, painters, and more, so we have craters
like Botticelli, Chekov, Debussy, Degas, Okyo,

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.550
Sibelius, Vivaldi, and Zola. There’s even
one named Tolkien!

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.099
Dipping below the surface, we can only infer
what Mercury’s internal structure is like.

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.159
But the planet’s dense, nearly as dense
as Earth. We know the surface is rocky, so

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:12.919
to be as dense as it is it must have a large
iron core, far larger in proportion to the

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.599
planet than Earth’s. Mercury’s core may
reach ¾ of the way to the planet’s surface!

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.399
Why does it have such a high proportion of
iron? Mercury may have formed as a larger

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.740
planet, then got blasted in a huge grazing
impact that blew away the lighter materials

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.559
that had risen to the surface, leaving behind
the denser part. Or maybe the heat of the

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:33.099
still-forming Sun vaporized the lighter materials
off its surface.

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:39.110
Mercury has a measurable magnetic field, which
is a bit surprising since it rotates so slowly—rotation

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.879
plays a big part in the Sun’s and Earth’s
magnetic fields. But that fits with so much

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:48.399
of its interior being molten iron; the bigger core
may allow for a stronger field despite its slow spin.

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:52.199
It doesn’t have much of an atmosphere, but
there is a trace of one, mostly due to its

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:56.330
magnetic field trapping the solar wind, and
to material flung up from the surface after

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.259
violent impacts from comets and asteroids.
A lot of this material blown off the surface

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:04.649
escapes the planet and gets blown away by
the solar wind and pressure from sunlight.

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:09.319
It forms a long comet-like tail that is tens
of millions of kilometers long. This tail

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:14.019
is comprised of elements like sodium, calcium,
and magnesium, material that’s known to

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.380
be abundant on the surface.

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:20.669
Speaking of which, here’s a fun fact: pound
for pound, impacts on Mercury are more violent

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:24.929
than they are on Earth. Mercury has weaker
gravity, so it doesn’t pull in impactors

00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:29.989
as hard as the Earth does, but it orbits the
Sun far faster than Earth does, so asteroids

00:08:29.989 --> 00:08:35.070
and comets tend to hit at higher velocity.
That makes the explosive energy higher, making

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.190
craters bigger.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.729
And there’s one more surprise Mercury has,
and it’s really surprising: Despite being

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:47.589
so close to the Sun, and having a surface
temperature that can reach 430°C — 800°

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:51.720
Fahrenheit — astronomers have found water
ice on Mercury!

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.980
It exists in the bottoms of deep craters near
Mercury’s poles, where sunlight never reaches.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.839
These are called “cold traps,” and temperatures
there don’t get above -170° C. It’s not

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:07.220
known for sure where the water comes from,
but it’s likely to be from comets and asteroids

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.269
that impacted the planet, scattering the water
across the surface. Of course, in the harsh

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:16.240
heat that water just goes Fffffft and goes
away. But in those deep craters it can persist,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.879
accumulating over the eons. There may be billions
of tons of it there!

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:23.870
It’s bizarre to think that in one of the
hottest places in the solar system there can

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.910
be conditions so cold ice can exist, but one
thing we’ve learned about nature over and

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.350
again: It has a lot more imagination than
we do.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.680
Today you learned that Mercury is the closest
planet to the Sun. It’s airless and dense,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.509
and is covered with craters. Its rotation
is locked to its orbit in a 2 to 3 ratio,

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:46.129
and together with its elliptical orbit makes
a day on Mercury very long and very weird.

00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:50.389
And despite being very hot, there’s actually
water ice in deep craters at its poles.
