00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.450
Let's say I've got some
type of a book over here.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.790
So there is my book.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.535
I'll write it down, book.

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:10.210
Let me draw the entire book.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.750
So this is my entire
book, just like that.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.780
And then I have a
mirror over here.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.620
So this is a mirror.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.619
We're just looking at the
mirror from the side--

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.585
I can do a better job
of a straight line

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:24.290
than that-- so that is a mirror.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.520
Now, what I want to do
is pick, and I'm really

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.970
picking an arbitrary
point on this book.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.920
And we know that
there's light that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.169
is coming on this book--
maybe I haven't told us

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:39.960
about the light source--
but we're assuming

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.050
that the book will reflect
the light diffusely,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.960
like most books do.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.590
It is not a shiny book.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.030
And so any point on this book,
and we could pick any arbitrary

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.740
point on this book, is
going to be emitting light

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.130
in a whole bunch of directions.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.310
So what I'm just going to
do is pick two light rays

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.220
that are being emitted from
this point on the book.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.920
It'll be more than
two, but this will

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.755
help us understand
what's going on here.

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:01.130
So let me pick
one light ray that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.260
goes like this-- it's obviously
not curving like that-- so it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.050
goes like this, and
hits the mirror.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.510
Incident angle is equal
to reflected angle,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.560
so it'll reflect off at the
same angle just like that.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.190
And let me pick another point
that is coming out radially

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.650
from that same, or another ray
that is coming out radially

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.110
from that same point, so
it'll come out like that.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.650
It has a larger
incident angle, so it'll

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.100
have a larger reflected
angle, just like that.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.100
And now let's think
about what an observer,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.650
someone who has their
eyeball right over here--

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.880
so let's say someone has
their eyeball right over here.

00:01:45.307 --> 00:01:46.890
Let me draw their
eyebrows so that you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.100
get the general idea-- let's
think about what this person

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.820
right over here
will actually see.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.480
And remember all of
reality is really

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.330
just a big simulation
going on in our brains.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.000
Now, this person's eye is going
to see these two light rays

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060
diverging from
some common point.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.120
If you were to look
straight at the book-- let

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.520
me just do another
example-- if someone

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.367
were to just look at
any arbitrary object,

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.200
let's say that's an
orange right over there.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.950
And just ignore all
the stuff on the left.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.230
If I were to look at an
orange, no mirror, nothing,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.020
no reflections,
or anything, if I

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.340
were to look at a certain
point on the orange,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.915
light from that point would
be diverging out radially.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.900
And if my eye were
right over there,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.530
my brain says, OK, I
have these light rays

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.390
diverging from a single point.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.850
It will simulate,
or it will show

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.140
me that point of an
orange in my brain.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.300
Now, The same thing is
going to happen here,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.890
even though these
two rays actually

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.940
aren't diverging from
a point out here.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.770
Your brain will say, OK, I got
two things that are coming out

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.440
from what looks like
a point over here.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.490
It'll really just extrapolate
these lines backwards.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.190
So it'll take that
green ray and it'll

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.580
say, OK, it must be coming
from a point out there.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.970
And it'll take that
magenta ray and it'll say,

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.710
it must be coming from
a point out there.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.700
Your eye is just seeing
these two light rays,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.501
it doesn't know what's
going on over here.

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:20.750
It just says OK, they're
just converging from a point.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.820
And so in this person's
reality, or in my reality,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.870
I think that there
is an orange there.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.940
Likewise, I see
these two light rays

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.050
diverging from
some common point.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.610
I will extrapolate
to figure out--

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.326
or my brain will try to think
about-- where that point is

00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:36.450
in three dimensional space.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.410
It says, look,
these two rays look

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.160
like they're coming from
a point back over here.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.960
Now, the reality is, there
is no back over here.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.180
There is nothing behind the
mirror, but to this observer,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.622
it looks like the light is being
emitted behind the observer.

00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:56.330
And so what the person
would actually see

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.510
is something like this.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.439
And this is probably
not too foreign to any

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.230
of our experiences.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.760
We've all looked in
mirrors-- and remember,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.220
this is the left side of
this book-- oh, sorry.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.780
This is the right
side of the book.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.390
It's the side that has
the curvy part of the B

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.579
so it'll look like this.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.530
So what this observer sees is
an image that looks like this.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.180
It is what people
call the mirror image.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.640
It is flipped.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.050
The left and the
right is flipped

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.150
and you can think
about why that is.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.340
I could just draw another ray
right here to make it clear.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.340
If this ray is coming like this.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.090
Now, it will reflect and
come out back like this

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.870
to this observer it came from
that point right over there.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.579
So he sees a flipped
version of the book.

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:51.078
Now the whole reason why I did
this is one, just to make you

00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:53.210
feel a little comfortable
with these reflecting

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.290
lines and all of that.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.800
But one, I guess
more importantly

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.610
to get you more comfortable with
the idea of a virtual image.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.730
This right here
is a virtual image

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.821
and we're going to compare
it with a real image

00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:04.570
in the next video.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.028
And to some degree,
a virtual image

00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:08.550
is more intuitive because we
have so much experience with it

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.840
when we think about mirrors
or reflective surfaces.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.350
So it's a virtual image.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.970
And we call it a virtual
image because the book really

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.630
isn't there.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.710
It's virtually there.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.360
There is no actual
physical space,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.890
or we don't know if
there's any physical space

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:20.690
behind the image.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.310
Our brain just uses
these diverging lights

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.470
and creates a model
inside of our brain

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.470
to say, OK, that
book exists there,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.769
even though the source of
the light is over here.

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:33.560
Now I'm just going to
draw another diagram,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.190
and you normally won't
have the diagrams that

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.250
have this type of
perspective, but just

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.337
to give you a sense
of the same thing.

00:05:40.337 --> 00:05:42.670
And just to get you familiar
with some of these diagrams

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.540
that we're going to do when
we study mirrors and lenses,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.850
is we could imagine
that this is the ground,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.040
let's say that this is a mirror.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.360
And let's say that
this is actually

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.290
could be somebody standing
in front of a mirror.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.310
Although usually people
will draw an arrow here

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.643
to just say an arbitrary object,

00:06:01.643 --> 00:06:04.690
Well, let's just say we have an
arrow in front of the mirror,

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.360
just so you get used
to this notation.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.620
This is actually a physical
arrow, this is not a light ray.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.220
Now let's think about what
the image of this arrow--

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.700
let's say this arrow had eyes,
so it's actually a person.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.460
So this arrow had eyes,
what would this arrow see?

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.910
Well, let's just pick an
arbitrary point of this arrow.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.280
You could do it with any
point-- this object--

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.020
because every point will be
reflecting light diffusely.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.840
So I'm going to take
one point that's

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.850
coming straight out of the
mirror-- one light ray that

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.590
goes straight to the mirror--
so just parallel to the ground,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.780
straight to the mirror.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.560
Well, it's just going to reflect
straight off and then come back

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.000
to the source of that light.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.300
Maybe that arrow's eye, if
you view it as a person.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.510
And let's just do another
point, another ray

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.480
coming from that point.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.150
So another ray coming from that
point might come out like that.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.200
Incident angle is equal
to reflected angle,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.980
so then it would
come back like that.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.825
Now, maybe this whole
thing is an eye.

00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:02.895
Maybe that'll simplify things.

00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:04.520
So let's say this
whole thing is you're

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.980
looking really
close at a mirror.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.500
This whole thing is an eye.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.210
Now what would the eye see?

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.820
Well, it's looking--
this ray looks

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.505
like it's coming
from back over here.

00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:17.880
And then this ray
looks like it's

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.490
coming from back over here.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.865
This is where they
converge, so the eye

00:07:21.865 --> 00:07:24.890
would see this point
of the eye over there.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.280
So it will actually see itself.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.100
And in general, these
type of diagrams

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.410
are used to think about what
would the real or virtual image

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.630
be of an object once the
light from that object

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.480
either is reflected
off of a mirror,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.900
or goes through
some type of lens.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.110
And we'll be doing this a
lot more in future videos.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.485
But anyway, hopefully that
gets you a little bit familiar

00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:52.970
with the things we'll
be dealing with.
