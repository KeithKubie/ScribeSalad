PAUL SAXMAN: So Paul Saxman
developer advocate here at

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.740
Google and with me is Marcelo,
he's the technical lead on the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.380
Places API.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.390
And we're just going over a
quick demo of the APIs, the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.980
Places APIs that
are available.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.680
There's three big ones and he's
going to start out with

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.680
the Places auto complete.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.530
And go into the moderator
queue, go through the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.720
questions in moderator queue,
and then do a few questions

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.640
that we hear pretty regularly
about places API or go over a

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.670
few questions we
hear regularly.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.830
And then onto the interactive
portion of the show.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.010
I guess it's all interactive.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.810
If anybody has questions along
the way, fire them off and

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.590
we'll put them in moderator and
we'll try to get to them.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.140
MARCELO CAMELO: So going
through the demo again.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.580
So I'm starting with
auto complete.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.590
So if you guys are not familiar
auto complete takes

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.480
the user input and as the user
is typing the name of a place

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.610
it will be suggesting possible
places based on the string

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.600
that he typed and also the
view part of the map.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.970
It's pretty similar the auto
complete feature that you have

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.540
on maps.google.com.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.600
So here I'll start with a look
at the whole map of the globe.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.930
And I'll just start typing let's
say L so it's suggesting

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.190
London, Los Angeles.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.045
If I type B, Berlin,
Barcelona.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.270
So let's pick San Francisco.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.110
So I use the data coming back
from the auto complete widget

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.870
and use that to re center
and zoom in into my map.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.100
And I'm getting the view part
back from the map and feeding

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.580
back into the auto
complete widget.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.340
So now I'll try again the
same two searches.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.320
So I'll start with an L. Now
it's getting Lombard Street in

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.960
San Francisco.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.110
The B, which used to give me
Berlin, Barcelona, is giving

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.605
me Berkeley as a first result.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.530
PAUL SAXMAN: So Brazil is in
the top of the list there.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.440
Do you have some connection
with Brazil?

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.520
MARCELO CAMELO: Yes,
I'm Brazilian.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.230
So it looks like Google
Maps like

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.532
Brazil better than Belgium.

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:37.782
That's good.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.175
So if I now, let's try
getting a Starbucks.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.760
So I type the Star,
I go to Starbucks.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.350
So what I'll do here I'll
add the restriction.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.030
So let's say that I want
only establishment.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.840
So that's local listings, so
business, we'll be getting any

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.130
address or countries or anything
like that back.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.900
So if I now type S I get SFO.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.900
So San Francisco, so St
is enough for me to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.830
get Starbucks there.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.170
So we've got a bunch
of Starbucks.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.400
So no matter how hard I try I
will be getting San Francisco

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.800
as a result for instance.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.610
I could try instead, let's
say switch to geocodes.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.850
So geocodes will actually
just give me addresses.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.590
Right so if I try getting
Starbucks again.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.240
So I get Starbuck Drive
somewhere in California, but I

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.820
don't get Starbucks.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.750
So even the Starbucks Way.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.730
Another restriction I can use
is country restrictions.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.885
So I can type let's say
a country code.

00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:15.520
Let's say Australia.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.529
PAUL SAXMAN: I have a
challenge for you.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.640
Can we tell if there's a
Starbucks on Starbucks Way?

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.810
MARCELO CAMELO: We could try.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.340
We could go geocode, let me
remove the Australian

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:39.870
restrictions, say
Starbucks Way.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.020
Yeah if we have on
Starbucks Way.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.480
And we'll try establishment.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.730
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh I see.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.980
So you're basically taking
the union of two

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.660
searches to get you--

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.150
MARCELO CAMELO: I used the
first search to get me to

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.160
Starbucks Way and then
I switched it back to

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.230
establishment in between the
search for Starbucks.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.350
So there is this--

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.300
I forgot where Starbucks Way
is, but yeah so there's a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.100
Starbucks roasting plant
in Starbucks Way.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.830
Which probably the Starbucks
roasting plant is named the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.955
route called Starbucks Way.

00:05:12.955 --> 00:05:16.890
So it makes sense that we have
some relationship there.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.395
So yes, so the challenge
accepted.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:30.265
So going back to
San Francisco.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.220
And I'll put a restriction
of country Australia.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.050
And if I type G so though I'm
looking at San Francisco and

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.140
I'm typing G I'm getting the
Gold Coast in Queensland.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.200
If I remove the country
restriction, type G again what

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.290
I'll be getting is
Gary Danko, the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.340
restaurant in San Francisco.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.590
So the country restriction
will pretty much overrule

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.230
completely the view port bias.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.030
PAUL SAXMAN: So each of these
requests you're passing what

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.315
information?

00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:17.300
You're passing the type,
potentially a country, the

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.480
search query, and then also
the bounding box for your

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.360
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.570
MARCELO CAMELO: And the back end
will mix those up and will

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.440
rank all the results.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.970
And bring back the
top five or 10.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.310
PAUL SAXMAN: And this
is all in JSON XML.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.360
[INAUDIBLE] formats.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.790
MARCELO CAMELO: Yeah so
we have a JS API.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.250
That's what I'm using here.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.870
But also if you're writing
something that's not using

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.530
JavaScript you can also
use the web service.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.880
And the web service will either
give you responses in

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.810
JSON or XML.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.300
So if we go, let's try
going to Sydney.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.600
And then I want to show you a
really recent addition, which

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.950
is we called it type
collections.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:27.140
So auto complete is restricted
in that we can only use the

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.580
top two types from type
hierarchy which are

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.060
establishment and geocode.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.880
So you cannot specify
say restaurants, or

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.320
localities, or suburbs.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.720
So we've added to try to
mitigate that is type

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.820
collections.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.730
So for instance, if I type here
look in city and I type

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:56.190
G. I'll be getting first result
city George Street.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:05.070
But if I instead choose regions
and type G again I'll

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.420
be getting Glebe back.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.220
And Glebe is a suburb
of Sydney.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.690
In Australia suburbs
and cities they

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.880
have the same meaning.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.740
If I type N instead I'll be
getting New South Wales, which

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.160
is the state.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.470
And a bunch of suburbs
and cities mixed in.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.100
But if I use just cities and
type N again I won't be

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.980
getting New South Wales now.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:40.915
Because cities will restrict
it just smaller elements.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:50.210
A city, a suburb and regions is
more the macro elements on

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.370
the geopolitical subdivisions.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.800
So you'll be getting states
and province,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.900
that kind of stuff.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.530
So if you're building something
like let's say a

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:11.320
hotel finder, you may not really
want to give your user

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.640
street as results.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.860
You want to give them just
cities and suburbs.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.095
So you'd use the city
type collection.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.690
PAUL SAXMAN: So what would I do
if there was something like

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.530
a pseudo establishment?

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.453
Like let's say a farmer's
market, so if I want to find

00:09:28.453 --> 00:09:30.650
all the farmer's markets.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.570
MARCELO CAMELO: Yeah so you'll
have to be in our indexes.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.890
I don't think we have--

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:47.130
So if it's the farmer market
that is a permanent event we

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.480
may have it, but if it's
something that maybe will

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.110
happen once a week I don't think
that we will have it in

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.800
our indexes.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.950
But that's one interesting
question because what we want

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.260
to do with API is we want to
get a sense back from the

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.270
development community and their
users of what they think

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.120
a place is.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.540
Because currently Google has
it's own idea what a

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.690
place should be.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.540
So if you get the feedback from
developers and they have

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.950
the ability to add places
using the API.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:26.760
So if a lot of people start
adding farmer's market or even

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.820
bench in a park, there's no
reason if that's recognized by

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.310
applications and by users as
a valid and permanent place

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.120
there's no reason why it
shouldn't be indexed.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.510
PAUL SAXMAN: So someday we
might see speakeasies in

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.760
Google places.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.820
MARCELO CAMELO: So that's it
for the auto complete demo.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.810
And so the other important
service that the place API

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.010
provides is the ability
to search for places.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:12.920
Some people sometimes ask us
where should I use search and

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.710
where should I use
auto complete?

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:21.070
So auto complete is really
optimized to an interactive

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.600
session with user.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.740
The user is typing something.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.275
He knows what he's
looking for.

00:11:25.275 --> 00:11:27.570
He knows the name of the place
he is looking for.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.380
And he's typing into a keyboard
or a soft keyboard on

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.610
a mobile device.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:38.100
And auto complete will spit back
answers really quickly.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:43.460
So it's really low latency,
really fast, and at the same

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.120
time the ability to restrict
your search and refine your

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.300
search is much more limited.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.010
So if you're doing more
exploratory type of search, so

00:11:54.010 --> 00:12:02.340
you want to know what places are
around a certain suburb or

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.000
your user maybe he's holding a
phone right now and want to

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.640
know what's the nearest
bar or what's the

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.240
nearest grocery shop?

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.300
You'd search for that because
the user doesn't know exactly

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.550
what he's searching for.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.530
So that's what you would
use search for.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:33.640
The basic format is you give a
center in the regions and it's

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:39.220
going to return the twenty
places that are most prominent

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.780
around the query area,
the search area.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.210
So we're using here in this demo
we're using the map view

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.230
port as the search area.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:13:01.060
So we can position the map,
let's say around, Moscone

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.120
Center and we'll do a search.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.550
So that's all the places API
thinks are the twenty most

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.590
prominent places in this
area of San Francisco.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:22.130
So they are ranked by
order of prominence.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:27.860
So the most prominent place
are the that come first.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.660
PAUL SAXMAN: And it's really
kind of a variety of different

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.330
places right?

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.110
MARCELO CAMELO: There's no--

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.520
PAUL SAXMAN: Downtown
is a place in here.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.360
MARCELO CAMELO: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.280
I didn't do any restrictions
in terms of what places you

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.530
want us to return.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:51.950
So let me do it again with a
more narrow search radius.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.660
PAUL SAXMAN: And kind of what
I've seen too I mean the

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.050
sample of types that you have
here I mean it's really

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:56.880
extensive right?

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.010
I mean there's--

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.370
MARCELO CAMELO: Yeah, we
have I think around

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.460
130 different types.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:10.350
And there's a lot of important
types that are missing from

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.520
the list. But we're trying to
approach it really carefully

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.270
because inside Google
those types are

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.920
changing all the time.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.740
And once we commit that as an
API to outside developers we

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.360
cannot change them anymore.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.900
So we chose to at first expose
just those types that we

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.830
really trust aren't changing.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.690
And hopefully we're going to be
bringing more types in the

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.940
near future.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:51.430
So now I can try being
a little bit more

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.820
specific with my search.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:15:01.170
So I just clicked on store and
now my request will come

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.070
mostly for stores.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.250
So you actually can see there's
restaurants that come

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.240
back here, flagged as
restaurants in the icon.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.490
But if you actually dig into
them you're going to see

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:18.550
they're maybe a department
store that has a

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.940
restaurant or a cafe.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:27.520
Or MoMA has their own
cafe inside of them.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.570
So the fact that the icon
isn't really for a store

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.635
doesn't mean that that place
doesn't match your query.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.810
PAUL SAXMAN: And then one of our
moderator questions was on

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.570
how things are ranked in here.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.130
So--

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:52.950
MARCELO CAMELO: All right so, as
I said the basic ranking is

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.070
the same one as you get
on Google Maps.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.840
So you're ranking by the
prominence of the place in the

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.210
search area.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:06.460
So you can actually get a place
that is really close to

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.360
the search area boundary come
up as the first result.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:17.250
That probably means it ranks
really high in terms of

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:25.230
popularity and the number of
reviews, that kind of stuff.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:31.350
But we just recently added an
option to rank by distance.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:38.150
So when I rank by distance
I'm actually ignoring the

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.680
prominence.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.980
And I'm returning them in
order of distance to the

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.230
center of the search.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.690
So when I rank by distance I'm
not actually looking at the

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.220
boundary anymore.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.480
It's not a search area.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.200
I just give a point.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.850
And then we will return the 20
places that match the query

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.040
that are closest
to that center.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.700
PAUL SAXMAN: So then it's
really, I mean the maps window

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.160
that you have there won't
drop the pin--

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.349
MARCELO CAMELO: If I repeat the
same search you get the

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:18.080
same twenty places no matter
what zoom level I'm at.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:33.910
So one important point to make
about search by distance.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:46.410
So as you see here in my little
demo if I untoggle

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.180
store, so I have no types
restrictions, I can't actually

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.510
search by distance anymore.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.190
If you try doing rank by
distance and you don't provide

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.900
a keyword or a type restriction
you get an invalid

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.290
request back.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.980
So there's got to be some type
of restriction to your search

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:11.720
because it doesn't really make
sense to make a search when

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:17.140
you say give me the 10 closest
places to this point if you

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.346
don't say yeah, but what type of
place are you looking for?

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.010
PAUL SAXMAN: Awesome,
so we might want

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.450
to dive in to moderator.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.260
Actually I have one
more question.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.310
It was really interesting
to me.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.870
I notice you have check
boxes for the types.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.260
You can specify multiple
types?

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.190
MARCELO CAMELO: You
can, absolutely.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.970
Say that I'm working on a
website that is related to

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.940
travel so we may want
to do searches.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.960
The user is searching for what
type of attractions are around

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.810
a certain location.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.860
So you could do a search
with restaurants,

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.445
lodging, museum at once.

00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:57.340
And you get all of them.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.220
You don't actually have
to do three searches.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.340
You could do three searches
if you want more

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.160
than 20 results though.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.190
So it's up to you how you want
to structure your app.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.115
PAUL SAXMAN: Ultimately I mean
since the developers are

00:19:11.115 --> 00:19:13.450
getting this back in just raw
data they can always do their

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.040
own intersections.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.990
Their own kind of--

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.590
MARCELO CAMELO: Good yeah,
there's always a trade-off

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:21.720
there because we have much
more data, much more

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.110
information, in our back end
than the developer has when he

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.970
gets the results back.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:32.660
So we will do a better job at
ranking than what you could do

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.600
on the client side.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.208
So just before I go to questions
I just one thing

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:40.850
that I would like to
highlight here.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.400
So if you're searching
for restaurants.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.390
So you get all types of
restaurants and we don't have

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:50.120
types for each different kind
of cuisine for instance.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.340
What you could do is say
restaurants and Italian.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:02.130
And you're going to get just
restaurants that have some

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:09.720
type of Italian slant in their
maybe menu, or the reviews, or

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.670
the description of the place,
or the name of place.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.420
PAUL SAXMAN: You obviously
didn't search in North Beach

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.660
because that's kind of
sparse list there.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.390
North Beach is the Italian
neighborhood.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.880
MARCELO CAMELO: Oh right.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:30.570
So what I could do also could
be say search for karate.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:37.310
We don't have the specific type
for karate, but I could

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.475
do a search and maybe get
some karate schools.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.810
Right so that's the kind of
flexibility that you can get

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.200
with searches.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.820
PAUL SAXMAN: Very cool.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.910
Like I said if you have any
questions on these just drop

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.270
in moderator.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.190
And we're going to dive in--

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.590
Woah every time I reload
moderator the

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.840
order's a little different.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.230
So put your questions
in moderator.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.510
We're going to talk about
those right now.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.970
So we have one from
Peter in the UK.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.870
I don't know if Peter's on--

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.090
JEREMY: I'm Jeremy.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.150
But I'm with Peter.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.100
He can't-- he's somewhere
else but he can hear us.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.930
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh excellent.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.100
So he had a question on

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.880
highlighting KML line segments.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.430
Do you want to just reiterate
that question for us or?

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.170
JEREMY: Yeah, sure.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.770
PAUL SAXMAN: We could read it
off moderator for you as well.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.840
JEREMY: Read away.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.570
PAUL SAXMAN: OK cool.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.200
So he's asking is it possible
to highlight a KML line

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.390
segment on mouse over?

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:52.980
And the answer to that I think
we determined was, not yet.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:58.115
But this is actually good one
for our issue trackers, a

00:21:58.115 --> 00:22:02.140
feature request. This is one of
these kind of these cases

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.040
where we think it's
really nice to

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.480
get developer feedback.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.600
Kind of drive where
the product goes.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.240
So under that, so our map has
hundreds of KML lines that

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.020
represent roads.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.640
It gets confusing.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.470
We'd like to highlight separate
roads with a color

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.780
change or info window pop up.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:23.370
So this is exactly how we like
to get developer requests.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.040
If you do file one of these
feature requests, always try

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.100
to file it with what you're
trying to do and addition to

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.390
what you want the API to do.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.740
Because sometimes there's a
little bit of a mismatch.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.300
I mean, we may have another
API coming out

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.300
that may fit the need.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.690
In addition to what
you may think the

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.880
specific API should do.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:49.350
So always give us the use case
in addition to what you think

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.000
the API itself should
do technically.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.400
JEREMY: OK can I expand on
that question slightly?

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.870
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:02.340
JEREMY: What we'd like is,
we have this great

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.540
mass of roads as KMLs.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.070
When we go over each of these
roads we'd like not only the

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:15.140
road to show up, but some kind
of a pop up just to pop up as

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.320
it happens.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.560
Now we're going to pull a lot
information into those pop up

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.670
boxes eventually.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.690
We're trying to rewrite that
in AJAX at the moment.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.060
It would be too much to,
as you scanned across,

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.680
[INAUDIBLE] be popping up
all the information

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.140
to be pouring in.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.540
Initially we just want a little
bit of information.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.420
Just, say, the name the roads
and some very basic

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.120
information.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.400
And it should be clear which
road you're looking at when

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.580
you go over it.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.380
That's all.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.800
PAUL SAXMAN: Gotcha.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.360
This is great.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.900
Yeah, like I said I don't
personally have the

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.330
answer for that one.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.450
But I do understand.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.660
I don't think that's something
that we do support.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.150
What I'll do after the
conversation today is I'll put

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:58.340
the link to our issue
tracker online so

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.020
you can link to there.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.560
Everything you just said,
I mean enter as

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.450
much information can.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:10.940
It really helps us to clarify
the use case.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.540
And then once you get in the
issue tracker we can kind of

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.841
bounce back and forth
and kind of--

00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:15.803
JEREMY: Great, that's
really good.

00:24:15.803 --> 00:24:18.210
PAUL SAXMAN: --a
little better.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.740
So yeah so thanks a lot.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.490
And I'll post that soon
after talk today.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:31.120
We have one more, actually we
have quite a few more, I'm

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.360
going to go with what Andreas
back here has

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.110
highlighted I guess.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:38.730
So the question is, since
sometimes the map data API is

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:45.940
deprecated not available anymore
what are the options

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.970
to access and synchronize users'
maps, especially from

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.220
within the mobile apps?

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.890
Marcelo, are you--

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.370
MARCELO CAMELO: Yeah, no I'm
not really familiar, super

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.270
familiar with maps data API.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.360
PAUL SAXMAN: So maps data API
so this is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.850
So what he pointed out
was that yeah, it's

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.670
not available anymore.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.990
We do have a service called
Fusion Tables.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.300
And I can say that--

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.630
I actually went through
this migration myself.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.130
We were working on the
My Tracks app.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.890
We moved from the map data API
over to Fusion Tables.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.950
Fusion Tables is really
straightforward to use it's

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.870
just a matter of SQL queries
into a database over HTTP.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.520
So I think it's probably
good option.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.160
Take a look at it.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.180
If you don't think it really
fits what you're looking for

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.620
send us a question
and let us know.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.670
One thing somebody just pointing
out Fusion Tables is

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:57.630
experimental, which means that
it's subject to change.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:05.680
But I would say that it's
a good option over

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.770
the maps data API.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.240
So we're actually going to
rattle through a few more

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.780
questions kind of quickly here
because we're getting a little

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.180
long on time.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:19.340
So we have one question from
Dave in San Francisco.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:23.760
So his question was
about the API key.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.520
It looks like he was getting
some errors that the API key

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.970
was not valid any longer.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.000
Probably just try a new
API key and let

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.130
us know how it goes.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:37.030
And again if this persists this
could be a platform bug

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:41.140
that you'd want to file against
our issue tracker.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.090
Definitely let us know.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.820
But yeah definitely try
a different API key.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.510
We had one from Norman
Avia and he was

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.730
asking about the Places.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.760
How is the order in
Places API shown?

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:07.240
MARCELO CAMELO: So the basic
ranking criteria that we have

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.100
is the prominence of the place,
which you could call it

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:11.780
popularity.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.160
Although it's a bit
more complex.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.250
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.570
to go into the details.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.940
Then you have the option to
do the rank by distance.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.590
Which is important
to note here it's

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.920
not sorting by distance.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.720
So we don't take the same
results as you would with a

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.850
normal ranking and just reorder

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.910
them by their distance.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:41.610
We actually do the search with
a different ranking criteria.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.210
So you actually may get the
results are very different

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:50.020
from searching by what
we call prominence.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.330
Another criteria that can also
come into effect if you're

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:59.420
using the Web Service, you
actually submitting check-ins

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.900
is places with a lot of
check-ins will bubble up in

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.460
the rankings.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:12.300
So they'll be on top of the
ranking by prominence.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.780
Unless you're searching by
distance and then check-ins

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.030
will be ignored.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.120
PAUL SAXMAN: We got
one question about

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.590
the places API events.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.350
The question is whether
there are

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.400
public and private settings?

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.870
And what is the use case?

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:34.810
Is it appropriate for private
parties or public events?

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.210
This is from Leon down
in Melbourne.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.960
Cheers Leon long time no see.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.880
MARCELO CAMELO: So in terms
of private or public.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:56.925
Events for now, they're only
application specific.

00:28:56.925 --> 00:29:03.230
So you'll be adding events and
they'll be showing up on the

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.910
results for your specific app.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:12.790
If they'll be public or private
in terms of it's

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:18.070
John's party or a concert it's
up to you to decide.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.690
You can use it however
you want.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:24.580
When you add event it won't show
up on other people's app

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.370
just on your app.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.550
So it's private in that sense
when it comes to the semantics

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.800
that you want to assign to your
events it's up to your

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.330
application.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.580
You can use it however
you want.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.890
PAUL SAXMAN: So now onto another
question from Norman.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:49.030
How long will it take a place
to hit the API after a user

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.875
has added via the Android app?

00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:56.800
And what other sources are
there to add places?

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.150
MARCELO CAMELO: Alright so it
hits your own app immediately.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.670
So you add a place it will
show up in your results

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.920
immediately.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.710
Before it hits the Google
canonical index it has to go

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.390
through a moderation pipeline.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:15.985
And we're still trying
to sort that out, how

00:30:15.985 --> 00:30:16.620
it's going to work.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:22.720
Because we have to account for
spanning and also all the

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.200
other sources of data
that Google has.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.610
And the second part
of the question

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.180
is, what other sources--

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.670
PAUL SAXMAN: What other
sources are

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.720
there for adding places?

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.800
MARCELO CAMELO: So Google has
a lot of ways for anyone to

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.720
add a place to Google's
database.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.810
So mapmaker is one.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:49.190
If you're a business owner you
can add your business in.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:51.040
Claim it as yours as well.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.960
There's a whole process
for doing that.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:02.480
And Google uses a bunch of
different feeds and crawling

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.560
mechanism to build its index.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:12.420
Eventually we do want the places
API to be a way for

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.620
Google to know about
new places and

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.440
changes to existing places.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.260
We just not quite there yet.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.810
It's a difficult problem and
we're trying to tackle it in

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.060
the right way.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:33.100
PAUL SAXMAN: And next up
we have one from Mark.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.870
Is there going to be a
G+ map layer, like

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.550
there was with Buzz?

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.770
And can I check in
to an event?

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.620
And how can I see all events
near a selected place, or

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.850
around me on mobile?

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.880
So tough question.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.860
MARCELO CAMELO: So G+ map layers
wouldn't be really a

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.030
place API in the future
so I can't

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:56.150
really answer that question.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.200
Yes, you can check into event.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.175
And then the third part
of the question is--

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:08.900
PAUL SAXMAN: Whoops
I just lost it.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.180
MARCELO CAMELO: How can
I see all the events

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.300
near a selected place?

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.450
All right so there's no
way to search for

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.750
just for events yet.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:22.440
So you'll have to do a place
search and then look at all

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.650
those places that came
back as a result.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:32.230
And see the ones that
have event in it.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.440
So there's no way to restrict
results just to those places

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.580
that have events yet.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.300
But if you think that's
important for you, you can add

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.930
it to the issue tracker and
we're going to look at it.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.640
PAUL SAXMAN: I think we're
getting close to

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.780
the end of the queue.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:55.440
Let's see, we have
one here from--

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.880
I'm going to pronounce it wrong,
but [? Minantkey ?].

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.860
First question, can I display
the entire world map?

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.310
And I should be able to put
everyone's location in my

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.520
group in the world map and by
clicking the person I should

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.770
initiate a call.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:23.640
So probably need a little more
clarification on that one.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.605
It sounds a little bit like
a feature request

00:33:25.605 --> 00:33:27.420
so we're going to--

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.155
MARCELO CAMELO: To me it sounds
more like a description

00:33:30.155 --> 00:33:31.710
of an app that he
wants to build.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:36.640
He wants to display a world
map and show everyone's

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.820
location in the map and
click on the person

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.310
to initiate a call.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.990
So there's a lot of different
APIs that you're going to have

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.960
to use to build an
app like that.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.080
But it sounds like
a cool idea.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.530
PAUL SAXMAN: And I think the
last one we got on here was

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.530
from Jeremy in London, where
is the hang out?

00:33:58.530 --> 00:33:59.780
JEREMY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.800
PAUL SAXMAN: Awesome.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.960
So do we have any questions
from everybody and

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.330
anybody logged in?

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.080
So Jeremy you're all set?

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.730
Peter?

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.190
JEREMY: Yeah we're good boys.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.440
PAUL SAXMAN: Awesome.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.400
That's about it for time.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.980
We have a few questions that
we might go over maybe at

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.730
another time.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.920
Just about the places API in
general, but I think we

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.999
covered pretty much most
everything we had on that

00:34:30.999 --> 00:34:34.285
list. So any closing words?

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.023
MARCELO CAMELO: Keep submitting
feedback.

00:34:40.023 --> 00:34:44.040
JEREMY: Can I just ask, do
you guys have a thing

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:44.895
next week as well.

00:34:44.895 --> 00:34:48.120
Is there one next Tuesday?

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.500
PAUL SAXMAN: I think we have the
hangouts every week and--

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.889
actually we just got
a to be determined.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:57.340
So I think we've planned them
kind of on a weekly basis.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.410
But we'll post it on Google+.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:34:59.960
JEREMY: Cool OK.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.350
PAUL SAXMAN: You can add a
little plus stream and we'll

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.130
let you know.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.252
All the connection information
everything will

00:35:05.252 --> 00:35:07.030
be posted up there.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.020
JEREMY: Great.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.825
PAUL SAXMAN: And I guess in
terms of being places API or

00:35:11.825 --> 00:35:16.336
what not probably be a different
product API next

00:35:16.336 --> 00:35:20.500
week so in the maps realm.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.280
That's it for me.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.830
If there's any more
like I said I'll

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.210
post the issue tracker.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:27.120
We'd love to hear the feature
requests you guys have. Any

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.130
bugs that you guys
are running into.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.200
Any more questions we'll pick it
up on the Google+ comments

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.706
or the hangout.

00:35:35.706 --> 00:35:36.180
That's it.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.590
Thanks for tuning in.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:39.840
MARCELO CAMELO: Thanks guys.
