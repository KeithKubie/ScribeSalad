 BENJAMIN FRENKEL: Hello everyone! 

00:00:01.265 --> 00:00:04.980
 Let me introduce myself first. My name is Ben. This is the one shown on the slide. 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.490
 We are very happy to share with you. 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.320
 A variety of great services from Google Play 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.500
 These services can help you 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.300
 Successfully expand the game business on Play 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.630
 We announced an exciting news when we opened earlier today. 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.200
 That is, we canceled the 50MB limit. 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.950
 Now we increase the limit to 100MB 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.640
 The era of 50MB cap is over 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.070
 Long live 100MB! 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.460
 There is no doubt that this is a long time 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 The most urgent request of everyone 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.699
 So I think we can’t stress this anymore. 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:44.990
 JOHN MCGUIRE: Yes, thank you Ben. 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.230
 Hello everyone 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.530
 I am John McGuire. 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.630
 Is a member of the Google Play business development team 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.810
 I also feel that this news is exciting. 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.950
 Thank you very much for your tolerance of the 50MB limit. 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.120
 We have a lot on the scene... Oh, yes, I need this... 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.220
 We have a lot of game developers on site. 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.230
 I want to make a small investigation first. 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.970
 See how many of you have made mobile games 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.740
 If you have made it, please raise your hand. 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.030
 It seems that almost everyone has ever made it. 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.410
 I feel that people who make mobile games are very simple, please continue to raise your hand. 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.651
 Let me see 

00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:18.150
 Ok 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.850
 Only one or two people raised their hands 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
 Well, making mobile games is not easy 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.970
 I have done it myself. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.110
 I want to introduce to you below. 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.080
 The five stages we experienced while making the game 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.660
 And what help can Play do for you? 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.860
 The first is the concept stage 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.495
 This is the most interesting stage 

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:42.080
 You may need a meeting room, some pizza 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.660
 There is also a bunch of sticky notes 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.580
 Finally came up with a really good idea. 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.620
 Such as "Zombie Match 3" card battle game 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.320
 Soon you will need to decide 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530
 According to which idea to design the prototype 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.680
 You will hope as soon as possible 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.167
 Let your game run on your device 

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:00.750
 Main work in the prototype design phase 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.850
 Is constantly improving 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940
 See how fast you can improve your game based on feedback 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.520
 Make the game more perfect 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.690
 Next, when you are ready 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.830
 Realize some key performance indicators (KPI) through the game 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.600
 You can enter the trial release stage 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 Then you need to select one or more regions. 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.070
 Then start experimenting with your game to get KPIs. 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.180
 Understand how the market reacts to your game 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.510
 Finally, when you decide to release the game 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.650
 At such an important moment 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.900
 You need to hang your appetite as much as possible 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.175
 You can prepare a bunch of champagne and hold a series of celebrations. 

00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:31.170
 Let everyone have a drink together 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.670
 In fact, this is relatively easy 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.044
 Because next, you have to let the game go online. 

00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:37.114
 This is the toughest 

00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:38.530
 Today we are here to introduce to you. 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.040
 How can Play play in these stages? 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.490
 Help you 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.340
 At the moment, we can’t help you at the concept stage. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.590
 But maybe one day we can help with this. 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.830
 For Alpha/Beta testing 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.130
 Earlier today, Ellie has introduced the Alpha/Beta test. 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.190
 This is a feature in the Developer Console 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.880
 With this feature, you can upload APK 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.080
 And upload it to Alpha or Beta 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.820
 This feature has two important features 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.460
 One is that users must choose to participate. 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.580
 Alpha or Beta test 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.610
 The second is that users cannot post reviews. 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.230
 So when your game is in the prototyping phase 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.210
 This is really a good way 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.710
 Allows you to quickly and easily improve the game 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.580
 And will not have a negative impact due to problems or minor errors in the game. 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.300
 Second, Alpha or Beta testing can be open or closed. 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.920
 This is the feature we introduced a few months ago. 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.310
 I remember it was two months ago. 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.610
 If you choose closed test 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.000
 You may need to email 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.680
 Invite a group of trusted testers 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.010
 You must first invite them to accept the invitation 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.340
 You can join your test team 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.410
 Open beta test, or open alpha test, whichever is the kind 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.060
 In fact, all get a URL first. 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.030
 Then you can distribute the URL 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.700
 Anyone with this URL can download and play your game 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.885
 I recall the scene when I was making the game in 2012. 

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:01.650
 That was a long time ago, when we didn't have this test function. 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.980
 If you have one, this feature will be very practical. 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.890
 I will plan to use this feature like this. 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.970
 I will first conduct a closed beta test. 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.650
 Invite friends and family as testers 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.080
 Maybe also invite colleagues from our game team. 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.300
 Then I will go through the open beta test again. 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.290
 In order to pass the wider population 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.730
 Gather more relevant feedback 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.715
 There are many ways to distribute games. 

00:04:19.715 --> 00:04:21.339
 For example, if you have relevant marketing channels 

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.560
 You can distribute the URL through this channel. 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.130
 I think the Alpha/Beta test is really a great feature. 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.820
 We will always use this feature during game development. 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.330
 Next, you are ready to try to release the game. 

00:04:34.987 --> 00:04:36.820
 Trial is a very important stage 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.530
 Because this is the first time for consumers 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.310
 Really see your game 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.350
 We have developed related functions 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.731
 Can help you optimize your game during the trial release 

00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:48.605
 This feature is called a store listing experiment. 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.600
 Explain to everyone 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.230
 Product details experimental solutions currently available on the market 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.200
 very expensive 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.480
 And there are also some shortcomings 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.380
 You can see that this is a citation from Rovio. 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.130
 They spent $50,000 on testing for more than six months. 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.390
 Mainly tested the game's icon and description 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.470
 This solution is not perfect 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.200
 We want to continue to improve 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.750
 So we launched the store listing experiment feature a few months ago. 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.485
 You can use this feature to test your game’s icons, videos, and images. 

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:24.985
 And a short description and detailed description 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.720
 I just said 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.180
 Trial is the consumer in the market 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.750
 The first time I really saw your game 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.680
 When your game is in the trial release phase 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.960
 You might want to test something like icons 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.869
 Because icons are actually the most visible content for consumers. 

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:45.160
 Also during your development process 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.580
 One aspect that needs to be considered the most 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.430
 Here is an example for everyone. 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.720
 Is the developer of our cooperation with Kongregate 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.220
 You can see that during the trial release phase 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.520
 They have optimized or tested their game icons 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.020
 After that, their display volume per display increased by 91%. 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.920
 Everyone can think about this effect. 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.510
 Only need to make such improvements 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.240
 Can effectively control 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.690
 Cost per installation 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.898
 BENJAMIN FRENKEL: When I look at these things 

00:06:15.898 --> 00:06:18.580
 I can't predict it at all. 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.800
 Which icon might work best? 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.040
 Is Mr. Eyepatch? 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.090
 Will its effect be the best? 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.580
 Still the girl with the gun? 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.440
 Is that red-haired girl? Still this helicopter? 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.370
 Nobody knows 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.659
 We can't know the answer 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:29.450
 JOHN MCGUIRE: Yes. 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.957
 That's right 

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:31.540
 This is also our recommendation for everyone 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.860
 a best practice used during the trial release 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.180
 That is, optimize for content with unknown effects 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.620
 For example, which icon can well resonate with the player. 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.940
 Next, you decide to officially release the game. 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.637
 This is a very important moment 

00:06:45.637 --> 00:06:48.220
 We hope to help you as much as possible 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.380
 Hanging the appetite of consumers 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.320
 So we were a few months ago 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320
 Developed a product called pre-registration 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.010
 I am a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.480
 A new movie was released this summer. 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.100
 Named Terminator: Genesis 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:08.580
 Arno played two roles in 1984 and 2014. 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.350
 Developer Glu made a 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.160
 Games related to this movie 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.940
 I visited the marketing page they made. 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.790
 Click the "Click here to pre-register" button 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.640
 I entered their store. 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.910
 On the store page I saw a big green invitation button 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.900
 It says "Click here to pre-register" 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.634
 I received a notification after clicking 

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:35.800
 Which reads: Hey! We will send you a push notification when the game is released. 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.300
 Tell you that we have officially released the game 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.780
 I really like this way. 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.570
 I clicked "OK" 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.900
 I know 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.950
 Then I scroll down the page 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.250
 You can see a series of videos of the explosion, some marketing materials. 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.730
 And other similar content 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.610
 I can also share this game with my friends. 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.540
 And see what other games the developer has made. 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.090
 Everyone is usually busy. 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.060
 So sometimes I forget the specific release time. 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.130
 However, I have not forgotten this game. 

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.980
 I received a push notification after the game was released. 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.640
 Which reads: Hey! The game has been officially released 

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.510
 Come and play! 

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.370
 I clicked on the push notification 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.310
 Then I entered the store and started playing the game. 

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.320
 We believe pre-registration is a very important feature 

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.110
 Can hang out the appetite of consumers for your game 

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.870
 If everyone is interested in this feature 

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.250
 Can consult your business development manager 

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.560
 These are the whole process from initial idea to game release. 

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.040
 Next, Ben will introduce you. 

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.740
 Content related to the online operation of the game 

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.013
 See if you can continue -- hey, you can. 

00:08:35.013 --> 00:08:36.179
 BENJAMIN FRENKEL: Ok. 

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.890
 As John said before, everyone has officially released the game so far. 

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.270
 Has put the game on the market 

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.320
 Need to think now 

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.960
 How to make the game just released 

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.690
 Great success on Play 

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.760
 I am in the Play Games Service Team 

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.820
 As product manager 

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.810
 The mission of the Play Games Services team is to help customers make this transition happen smoothly. 

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:02.360
 Make your business grow and build a successful game 

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.570
 And the direction we have to work on is 

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.340
 Provide a way for relevant people and developers 

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.520
 Enable them to design new goals that keep players excited 

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.930
 In addition to the core game 

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.440
 Give players some new experiences 

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.589
 Such as achievements, leaderboards, player analysis 

00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:24.630
 Tasks, multiplayer games, etc. 

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.650
 All these different services together form a cohesive product 

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.930
 Such products can achieve greater success. 

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.210
 Mention the goals we have to work hard 

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.600
 That is the core task of our Play Games service team. 

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.620
 I want to revolve around the story of Eric Froemling 

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.180
 To specify 

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.520
 Eric is what we want to play through Play Games 

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.180
 Typical developer for their help 

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.480
 He is a team alone 

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.190
 All the work related to the game 

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.300
 He is an artist 

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.560
 Animator 

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.820
 game designer 

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.590
 At the same time, I have to be responsible for the user to get all the things that are basically done by him alone. 

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.600
 But for Eric, to be successful 

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.020
 He needs to bring this business 

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:08.220
 Provided to the player as a continuous service 

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.320
 And the huge challenge he faces is 

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.970
 Compete with the largest possible game developer 

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.364
 And such developers are equipped with many data analysis experts and developers. 

00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:19.280
 And artist 

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.400
 So our task is to get Eric 

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.060
 Ability to compete with large game developers 

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.550
 This is what our Play Games Services team is trying to do. 

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.320
 Our initial thought was 

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.200
 Want to provide developers with 

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.190
 Data analysis required to conduct business 

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.280
 This is what we did earlier this year. 

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.486
 Reasons for launching the Player Analytics tool 

00:10:40.486 --> 00:10:42.860
 Player Analytics is a set of reports in the Developer Console 

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.970
 Allows you to understand 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.430
 Everything that happens in the game 

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.990
 This is a good example 

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.194
 We have provided developers with 

00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:53.360
 Source/Sink report 

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.540
 When organizing GDC earlier this year 

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.190
 We stayed with Eric for a long time. 

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.930
 Produced a large number of different report samples 

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.010
 To test the effects of various ideas 

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.000
 We have seen the analysis data 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.410
 Share these reports to Eric 

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.870
 We found that the game was economically released after the release. 

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.840
 There is a serious imbalance problem 

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.580
 This is a typical problem 

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.280
 Too many games distributed 

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.010
 These game tokens are in the game 

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.650
 But not fully used 

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.920
 Here he uses the game token 

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.950
 The speed at which he distributes tokens is amazing. 

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.930
 Eventually leading to the game 

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.810
 Almost impossible 

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.490
 The moment when the player needs to make an in-app purchase 

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.525
 Therefore, we gave him this report. 

00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:42.800
 He quickly understood 

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.540
 Need to make some improvements to the current situation 

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.882
 Then he made some changes to the game. 

00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:49.590
 Immediately there was an immediate effect 

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.460
 The positions of these two lines are exchanged. 

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.300
 This blue line representing "sink" 

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.040
 For the first time, he exceeded him in the game. 

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.126
 Speed ​​of distributing tokens 

00:12:00.126 --> 00:12:01.500
 This is a huge turning point for him. 

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.320
 Just three weeks later 

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.730
 The average annual revenue of each active user has more than doubled 

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.760
 The average revenue per paying user has increased by nearly 70% 

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.500
 Produce such a big impact in such a short period of time 

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.260
 Almost unheard of 

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.800
 We will continue to work hard to provide more reports. 

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.572
 Bring more value to everyone 

00:12:22.572 --> 00:12:25.952
 In particular, Eric said such a passage. 

00:12:25.952 --> 00:12:28.160
 "Player Analysis" helped me to understand the shortcomings of BombSquad 

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.760
 Indicated the correct direction of improvement 

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.000
 Let me create the game I want. 

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.440
 And got the ideal income" 

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.330
 We will continue to work hard in this area 

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.319
 Provide new features for everyone 

00:12:40.319 --> 00:12:42.610
 Just recently, we launched 

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.130
 "Time Series Browser" 

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.780
 Time series browser is a report 

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.720
 Can help you understand 

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.660
 What happens at the most critical moment of the game 

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.280
 What happened when the player first started playing the game? 

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.020
 What happened before the player left the game? 

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.050
 You can use this report to compare 

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.480
 Different player types 

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.630
 You can compare players who spend more in the game. 

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.150
 Players who spend less in the game 

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.660
 And the dynamics of players who have never spent in the game 

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.810
 In this way, you can accurately understand some details. 

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.420
 For example, let's take a look at the third line here, which is player number 3. 

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.952
 The player spent $4.99 in the game. 

00:13:20.952 --> 00:13:22.410
 And before that, we can see 

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.090
 The player has won several different achievements 

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.130
 Hover your mouse over each graphic 

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.900
 You can learn more about the specific situation. 

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.990
 Let me introduce you to the background information here. 

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.700
 Everyone can see 

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.920
 Each line here represents a player 

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.980
 You can use this line to learn about all the events that the player has played during the game. 

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.120
 We collect all the time series every day. 

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.130
 Then pick a sample from it and give it to you. 

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.070
 So you can get to know more 

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.730
 What happened in the game 

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.210
 Intuitively understand what works well and which content is not performing well 

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.180
 We also plan to add some presets to this report. 

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.600
 These configurations can answer specific types of questions 

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.430
 For example, you can choose to ask a question 

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.230
 What happened when the player started playing the game? 

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.600
 At what stage of the game is the player lost? 

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.670
 Is the tutorial not good? 

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.380
 You can also ask questions like this before the player spends their first time? 

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.040
 You can see the player’s first cost here. 

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.210
 And all we do is align all the first cost events 

00:14:18.884 --> 00:14:20.300
 Look to the left 

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.865
 You can see all the things that happen before the player spends their first time. 

00:14:22.865 --> 00:14:25.070
 And looking to the right 

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.520
 You can see everything that happens after the player’s first spend. 

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.501
 You can compare different player types 

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:30.500
 As I said before 

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.640
 So that you can understand intuitively 

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.780
 Which content in the game works well 

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.630
 Those who spend more, what is their buying power? 

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.690
 And why some players are in the game 

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.390
 Very little cost 

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.340
 Of course, you still need to understand 

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.680
 Why are players leaving your game? 

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.990
 We also provided another pre-configured report. 

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.500
 Allows you to target players who have lost in the past 28 days 

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.200
 Align all the activities they left when you left the game 

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.370
 You can easily view to the left 

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.250
 Understand what caused this result 

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.500
 Is it because players often lose in tournament mode? 

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.050
 Do I need to improve the matchmaking mechanism? 

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.020
 You can use this report to understand everything 

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.850
 We also offer a set of custom activities 

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.965
 You can also add to the report 

00:15:11.965 --> 00:15:13.840
 So, except for all the default content 

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.280
 Understand player’s spending, achievements, and conversations 

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.820
 You can also record your own custom activities 

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.580
 Whether you want to visualize any information in this report 

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.640
 Can be done by adding an event to the game 

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.670
 To achieve this goal easily 

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.295
 On the second day 

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:30.441
 You will be able to view specific data streams from this report. 

00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:31.940
 And you can get to know more 

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.490
 The specific type of data you need 

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.030
 In addition, we also launched the "Activity Viewer" 

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:44.160
 It is a universal activity visualization tool 

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.690
 Tell us about the background information here. 

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.310
 We partnered with Eric before the Game Developers Conference earlier this year. 

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.000
 In the prototyping phase 

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.700
 We used a commercial BI product 

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.490
 You may also need to buy this product. 

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.160
 We collected all the raw activity data 

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.620
 Then enter all the data into this commercial BI tool 

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.860
 Then basically generated a prototype of all the reports 

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.730
 However, just in the process 

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.140
 We understand what is the key information and what types of reports 

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.865
 What types of visualization data 

00:16:11.865 --> 00:16:13.490
 Is really important 

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.640
 We pick out the prototyping phase of the player analysis 

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.790
 All use cases found 

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.550
 We will take all these key use cases 

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.670
 Are applied to this product 

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.070
 In this way, the event viewer 

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.530
 Can be used in this very expensive commercial BI product 

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.920
 Get all the significant data 

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.310
 Then we provide this data for free in the Developer Console. 

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.930
 So that developers can integrate Play Games services. 

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.512
 But only analyzing the data is not enough 

00:16:39.512 --> 00:16:40.970
 We are very satisfied with the analysis data. 

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.180
 We provide you with the most comprehensive and analytical data in the world. 

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.330
 But you must be able to really take action in the game 

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.730
 To get the core metrics in your KPI 

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.010
 it has been improved 

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.680
 So we launched the "Tasks" feature. 

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.000
 The task is for players across your entire community 

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.080
 Set time-sensitive goals 

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.020
 A task like this game is a typical example. 

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.190
 This is the game "TowerMadness 2" developed by our partner Limbic. 

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.240
 They designed a weekend mission 

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.530
 Every weekend, players will see the mission in the game app. 

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.520
 This is similar to the companion application for all of these services. 

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:16.480
 The system will display the tasks that need to be completed. 

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.869
 Players can accept tasks and join the game 

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:21.210
 Complete the task in the game 

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.829
 Earn the reward in this game, which is wool. 

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:28.329
 This is after you release the game 

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.730
 A great way to attract players to play games again 

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.170
 No need for players to update to get new APKs 

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.880
 Provide content in a dynamic manner 

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.120
 This point is very important 

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.566
 Helps you apply analytical data to the action phase 

00:17:42.566 --> 00:17:45.130
 Next I will introduce a short case study. 

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.760
 This case comes from our partner Concrete Software 

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.470
 This company has been in business for several years. 

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.670
 The team has about 10 to 15 people, mostly engineers. 

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.060
 They spend an extra minute each time dealing with the server infrastructure 

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.440
 And working online 

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.070
 Time available for engaging in your favorite game development work 

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.750
 Less 

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.600
 So through the "task" function 

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.340
 They have the opportunity to have the capacity of a large company 

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.880
 Without a huge server infrastructure 

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.940
 And other types of support 

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.800
 They got the service for free 

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.030
 Let them have time to invest in the game production work they love. 

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.570
 This is their most successful game "PBA Bowling" 

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.979
 John, are you bowling? 

00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:25.520
 JOHN MCGUIRE: I played very badly. 

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.840
 But I still enjoy it. 

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.840
 BENJAMIN FRENKEL: In PBA Bowling 

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.790
 Everyone can be a bowling superstar 

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.380
 Get a sense of accomplishment 

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.570
 They use the "task" function to get rid of 

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.420
 Properly follow all our best practices 

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.070
 In this use case 

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.640
 What makes people feel particularly excited is 

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.330
 The way they will provide players with new content 

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.840
 As an important part of the game 

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.150
 Take a look at this example. 

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.370
 This is the calendar of promotional events in January this year. 

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.000
 Everyone can see 

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.230
 They provide new content to players multiple times a week. 

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:03.540
 For example, on January 7, they launched the "Hammer Black Widow Legend" bowling 

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.090
 This is a great bowling 

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.040
 To be honest, it’s awesome. 

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.800
 In addition to launching new bowling balls 

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.140
 They also advertise in the game 

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.910
 Push notification 

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:20.160
 Post information using social media like Twitter 

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.510
 And every time they launch new content 

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.410
 Will launch a task at the same time 

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.170
 And they are going to task 

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.720
 As an important part of the online operations strategy 

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.370
 Because it’s about user engagement. 

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.882
 Produce measurable substantive impact 

00:19:36.882 --> 00:19:38.340
 They found out after observing the data. 

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.650
 On the day the player's mission is accepted 

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:47.620
 The number of sessions per player is 15% higher than the benchmark 

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.690
 And this effect is very long lasting 

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:54.720
 The player’s session count is still 4% higher than the benchmark after completing the task 

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.480
 So everyone can understand 

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.830
 Why do they want to provide new content to the player? 

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.860
 Think of the task as a core part 

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.300
 Next we will continue to discuss this topic 

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.660
 How to use the player statistics API for data analysis 

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.480
 Player Statistics API is our most recent 

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.100
 With the latest version of the Play Services SDK 

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.110
 New features introduced together 

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.990
 It can help you 

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.470
 Find out which segment of the player is located 

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.410
 Let me give you an example. 

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.110
 Suppose a player initiates a conversation in your game. 

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.370
 The player has already logged into the game 

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.800
 You can call the player statistics API 

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.220
 Found that the user's spending power in the game is in the 95th percentile 

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.660
 You also found that the user has not logged in to the game for 10 days. 

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.750
 At this point you can show the user a passionate promotional message. 

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.440
 It says: Welcome back! 

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.500
 We have prepared some gold coins for you. 

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.940
 You can buy some good things in the game. 

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.710
 Therefore, important player statistics 

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.170
 Allows you to segment each player group 

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.840
 Provide a tailored experience 

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.870
 And you can learn about it 

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.230
 For example, the percentile of the player's session, the duration of the session, etc. 

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.300
 We will continue to aggregate these statistics into this API. 

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.700
 I believe this will bring you 

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.120
 Great value 

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.540
 There is another good example 

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.559
 Suppose you want to motivate your ads 

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:17.600
 Earn revenue from players 

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.684
 Now this is a very common pattern 

00:21:19.684 --> 00:21:21.850
 We have some partners with up to 50% of the revenue 

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.520
 Is from such incentive ads 

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.480
 However, maybe you don't want it 

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.814
 Show incentive ads to all players 

00:21:28.814 --> 00:21:30.480
 For players who can never spend in the game 

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.740
 You may not want to run this type of ad. 

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.570
 Let's assume again that there is a player logging in to the game and you called the API. 

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.310
 You find that the player’s spending power is at the lower percentile 

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.810
 But the interaction with the game is very high 

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.750
 This type of player is right for you. 

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:51.490
 Object of this special option 

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:59.080
 We have already discussed 

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.240
 How does Play go through various methods? 

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.640
 Create value throughout the life of the game 

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.640
 But to build a good, successful game 

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.620
 Still very, very difficult 

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.870
 However, take advantage of the services John has just introduced. 

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.150
 Reintegrate Play Game Services 

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.110
 Everyone can take the first step towards success 

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:29.410
 Now we have a question and answer session at our site. Do you have any questions? 

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.835
 I seem to see someone raising her hand. 

00:22:34.675 --> 00:22:36.050
 Audience: You mentioned 

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:40.010
 Ability to see when users are losing 

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.820
 Is this defined by the developer? 

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.212
 Or is it preset by the Google Player Analytics tool? 

00:22:45.212 --> 00:22:46.920
 BENJAMIN FRENKEL: You are asking us how to define user churn? 

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.545
 Audience: Yes 

00:22:47.545 --> 00:22:48.500
 BENJAMIN FRENKEL: Ok. 

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.280
 His question is how do we define user churn? 

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.870
 This is the indicator we set for everyone. 

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.745
 But it has a standard formula 

00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:57.620
 If a player has not logged in to the game for 7 days 

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.350
 We will classify the player as a lost player. 

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:04.250
 And traced back to the last day the user played the game, which is his last activity in the game. 

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.200
 Audience: If I want to be in my game 

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.970
 Adjust this period to 10 or 14 days 

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.484
 Can I change it? 

00:23:12.484 --> 00:23:13.650
 BENJAMIN FRENKEL: Not working now. 

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.532
 But this is why we invite everyone to come here. 

00:23:15.532 --> 00:23:16.490
 This is a great feedback 

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.937
 Everyone is welcome to drink beer at the time of the arranged drink. 

00:23:19.937 --> 00:23:21.770
 We can talk 

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.747
 How to modify the definition of user churn 

00:23:24.747 --> 00:23:25.580
 Audience: Thank you! 

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:32.830
