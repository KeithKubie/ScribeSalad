1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,280
Which are crucial to our wellbeing.

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:07,281
And one of them is the capacity to openly
debate ideas and to expose ourselves

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,640
to ideas across the gamut. And I'm not
just talking about political ideas,

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,920
I'm talking about scientific ideas.
Yes.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,830
So how are we going to win the
battle against anti-vaxxers?

6
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:21,060
Like how are we going to persuade people
who believe that vaccines kill people

7
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,970
for which there is no scientific
evidence that they're wrong.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,470
We could imprison them like
that's force. Uh, we could vote,

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,090
which is sort of what we're
doing. We're saying, okay,

10
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:33,080
well you're a minority group who believes
these things so we're not going to

11
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,710
allow you to control policy.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,700
Or we could try to win the battle of
ideas and persuade them. Ultimately,

13
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:43,590
that's the only path that's in my view
that gets us to where we want to be. Yeah.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,473
And

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,110
just an honest assessment
of the actual data.

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,070
Like what we really know and understanding
how the scientists come to these

17
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:52,790
conclusions.

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,600
But the problem is these echo chambers
where people get involved with online

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,660
that magnify,
uh,

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,170
all of these beliefs and
you get radicalized. I mean,

21
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:05,810
I've seen people get involved
in these Facebook groups.

22
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:09,230
He's anti vaccs face Facebook
groups or you know, all,

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,580
all sorts of different things.

24
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:12,560
I mean that's how these
flat earth people get going.

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,420
They start listening only to people
that are involved in this circle.

26
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:20,500
They don't have a, a greater
understanding of the science involved in,

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,921
did you just see,

28
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:26,480
I just saw online their sec accrues to
the flat or cruise for a flat earth.

29
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:28,980
I don't know if you saw it to
ice wall. Yeah, the ice wall.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,700
That's a new wrinkle.

31
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:38,540
Cause the old flat earthers used to think
that the water was shown falling off

32
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:41,700
the disc of the earth. You know, like the
edge of the earth. They was just a disk.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,050
Now the new theory that
there's an ice wall, actually,

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,330
it's kind of not falsifiable.
That is to say you,

35
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:51,590
you could get on a cruise and sail to the
edge of the earth and you would find a

36
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:56,570
wall of ice there. So you
Antarctica. So you'd think,
Huh, it's flat. In other words,

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,750
they,
they have redefined their theory too,

38
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,850
to make it so that you can't disprove
it. Right. You don't get to an edge.

39
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:07,010
There's no edge. There's an ice
wall is what they're saying. No.

40
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,630
And Are you aware of Hashtag
spaces fake? No, I'm not.

41
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,340
I have to say,
but not expose myself to that space.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,330
There's a bunch of people that I

43
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,990
believe that space is fake.
It's not real,

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,850
but there's no real space and
that there's like lights up there.

45
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,970
Oh.
And that this is some sort of a,

46
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:32,440
a plan by Satan to a, it's a
lot of, it's very biblical.

47
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,740
It's really interesting. A lot of the
flat earth stop is very biblical. That's,

48
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:37,240
it has to do with the firmament.

49
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,650
And they use descriptions and
depictions from the Bible. Oh yeah.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
It's super bizarre.

51
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,310
And what's really bizarre is when you
listened to the youtube videos or these

52
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:52,900
discussions that are done by people
that use words that are real,

53
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,680
they string them together correctly.
They have like full sentences.

54
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,630
They appear to be articulate. It's very,
if you're a dummy, if you listen to those,

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,450
you go like, wow, this guy's
making a lot of sense. He's not,

56
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,650
but it sounds like he's making a lot of
sense because he's using all these words

57
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,460
that are correctly users. There's
oms. He saying it articulately,

58
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:17,320
there's like everything seems like like,
oh my goodness, this man is exposing.

59
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,000
He's exposing the reality, but it's
not. It's just fucking nonsense. Yes.

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,860
And if you don't know any better,
and that's all you listened to,

61
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,920
that's where your head will go.
The same with the Anti Vaccine Movement.

62
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,910
If you only listen to these anti-vaxxers,
they're making so much sense of like,

63
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,440
oh my God, it's giving everybody,
uh, all sorts of ailments.

64
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,140
Or you're on the spectrum. They have a
theory of how it does that, which is not,

65
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,180
it's uses, as you say, scientific words,

66
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:43,180
but it's actually not scientifically
correct. Right? It does this,

67
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,450
which then does that, which then does
that, they lay out a kind of causal chain,

68
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,620
which is false.

69
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,280
And then there's a problem of nuance
in perspective because there's so many

70
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,570
people that get vaccinated.

71
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,370
There's hundreds of millions
of people in this country,

72
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,330
billions of people worldwide.
And then there are instances,

73
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:03,160
rare occurrences where people have
real issues with vaccinations.

74
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,220
Well, there are some where they
have real issues. So for example,

75
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:10,060
there's some vaccines which are known to
cause certain neurological conditions,

76
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,060
rarely one out of a million
or 100,000 vaccinations.

77
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,160
More commonly is a situation in which
you have vaccination is so common.

78
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,450
Everyone is getting vaccinated.

79
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,740
And often that occurs near
to an occurrence of some
other rare condition. Yes.

80
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,400
And people associate the two, they think,
oh, because of the vaccine, this happened.

81
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:32,260
No. It's a coincidence. Either a war. Yes.
There's both in the, and there's also,

82
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,380
you know, if it's one out of a million
and you have 300 million, exactly.

83
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,850
You have 3 million, you know, I mean,

84
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,690
1 million people with an
issue is a big deal. Yeah.

85
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,600
With 300 million people. Yes. You,

86
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:49,601
you easily could have
300 really big cases,

87
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,351
you know,

88
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:54,820
300 cases where if something died from
vaccines and then you bring those in

89
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,460
front of people and say, Oh my God.
And then there's this one and this one,

90
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:01,000
this one, and there's 298 more.
And you're like, Holy Shit.

91
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,970
All these people are dying
from vaccines says, you know,

92
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,550
it doesn't feel good if it's your child.

93
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:10,660
But when we look at the greater
perspective of humanity,
and you say, well listen,

94
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,170
you don't want to bring back smallpox.
You don't want your child to get measles.

95
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,990
Babies can get measles when they
can't even be vaccinated for it.

96
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,160
This is one of the reasons why
we need to vaccinate children,

97
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:24,040
is to make sure they don't get measles
is a serious fucking problem and a

98
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:29,041
serious problem that scientists have
labored for untold decades to try to try

99
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:32,710
off of our civilization. That we can
actually stop these diseases. Yes.

100
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,240
And save children's lives.

101
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,140
I had a woman yesterday who is an
expert and she's a medical historian,

102
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,220
an expert in Victorian era
surgery. Uh, Lindsey Fitzharris,

103
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,070
and she wrote this great book called
the butchering art. And in it,

104
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,170
there's all these images
should shoot one of them.

105
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:51,420
She brought up of what smallpox
actually looks like when people get it.

106
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,350
It's horrible. Yes. I just
covers people's bodies. Yes.

107
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,530
For radicating this like
in and you die from it.

108
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,570
It's actually gone. Yes. We
don't get it anywhere credible.
