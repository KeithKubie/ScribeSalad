00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.740
Hello, calculator fanciers! A bit of an unusual one today.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.639
I have been sent this in by an amateur calculator appreciator.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.438
Robert in the United States of America found this in his parents' basement!

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.059
They you are, Robert. I bet you didn't think when you pulled this out and dusted it off

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.229
that one day you'd see it here! I mean, this is center court, the epicenter of the calculator appreciating world. It just goes to show you

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.739
everyone at home, with your little calculator collections, that one day, all your calculator dreams can come true.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.860
Okay, so here we have the Casio with an unexpected 'extra'

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.740
that's slightly more threatening than I like my calculators to be. But you can see, it has got two color printing,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.040
which is two more colors than most.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.060
Now, just very quickly, I'm aware this is officially a historic

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:00.279
calculator, because it's quite an old one that's been sent in. And some of you will be concerned that while it is

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.809
still in its original box,

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.658
it's not mint in its original box. It's been damaged here, like some kind of heavy blow to the top.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.688
There's some scuffing around the bottom. It is not museum quality.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.949
There's some marks on here. Very disappointing. And from a proper collecting point of view, we don't know the history of this calculator.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.869
It's got no provenance. I mean there's no chain that shows where this came from. So I'm well aware

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.289
this is not up to the standards you'd expect. But, for a bit of fun,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.679
I'm prepared to pop it open and have a closer look.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.980
And here we go. This should slide out. And oh, okay. So here we have

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.380
some paper for printing. That's gonna be handy.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.600
Here we've got some of these, with a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.000
yellowing tape on them to hold. Maybe it was yellow to start with. Now, for the UK collector

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.020
it's a little inconvenient that the US adapters are 120 volts,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.060
or freedom voltage, as it's commonly referred to.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.240
But as a purist, I'm not gonna swap that out for a replacement one.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.409
I want to keep the proper one. The official standard practice is to get an adapter to adapt the adapter to your local situation.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.070
So you need to get an adapter adapter, or adapter squared, as we call it. Little joke there from the calculator community.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.680
Okay, getting down to the calculator itself. We have, here we go, look at that!

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.820
So it's got a kind of dust cover there. So if it's in a place with lots of debris that might land on it,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.600
you can keep it carefully cased under there, at a moment's notice.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.320
It's got the full instructions! Look at that! And warranty.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.760
Now the HR 100 is well known for having the largest broadsheet instruction manual in the business. Look at that!

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.040
So the box has got quite a nice look to it. Now, as previously discussed, we can't use the US adapter

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.420
straightaway, and so we're going to have to put some batteries in the back of this bad boy. Okay, so it takes four

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.950
double A batteries.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.100
Batteries, please! Four double A's. Thank you very much. Now, we'll pop one in there.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.945
It's always very important to put your batteries in facing the right way around.

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:05.920
Otherwise, you will, your calculator can catch on fire, it can explode.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.660
Or even worse, you might get the wrong answer to one of your calculations.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.680
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to give you a gore warning.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.117
Look away if you don't like horrific medical sights,

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:19.309
because I've actually cut my finger opening up this cal-. You can see, look- look at that!

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.020
It's barely attached anymore. I've cut my digit while trying to get in to use some more digits.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.660
I mean that, that's just the risks I accept when you're opening calculators at this kind of level.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.200
Okay, we just pop that back on there, and now the batteries are in, we will fire this thing up to on!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.520
All right, so this is just basic calculator mode. So let's do, we'll do the standard divide by zero.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.320
One divide by zero equals...

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.140
tiny tiny error over there. Doesn't make a big deal of it. That's quite nice. And, we'll do a quick division

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.680
precision... does that clear?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500
One, oh, it's locked. Clear.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.640
Oh, okay. We're clear, here we go, okay. Let's do one divided by nine, equals.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.500
All ones, times nine, equals.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.980
So you can see there, not entirely accurate, which is quite good

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.520
if you're trying to fudge the books to have a little bit of wiggle room in your calculations.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.100
And finally you got 'feed' over here. So, obviously, when you're doing your accounts,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.900
you'll be working around the clock. If you do have to go and get some sustenance, you can just hit 'feed'.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.520
Oh!

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.380
Oh my goodness!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.189
Oh, so no, feed is for the printer! And you know what? That is why we're here.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.080
We want to see the printing in action. Let's load up the paper. Just tidy up the edge

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.860
there

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.020
Okay, so the paper goes, obviously, on the back here, so we'll shove it in there, and then hit 'feed'.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.409
Come on. Take it. Here we go!

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.139
Okay, now we're ready to do some calculations while it prints. So if I do one, plus,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.360
I've committed the one to the paper now. No going back.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.560
Two, plus, four, plus,

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.689
eight, plus, sixteen,

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:14.218
you can see, as I'm adding these numbers on, they're all being printed up there. We're up to 62, plus

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.719
124,

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.719
plus 248,

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.259
and now if we want to get the grand total, you hit star.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.860
And there it's printed at the bottom. And if we feed that up, you can see, there's my whole calculation,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.400
and then, you know what? You can you can then cut that off there.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.200
If you want to do a calculation

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.380
and send it to someone else, incredibly convenient, a little souvenir, send it off, everyone else can enjoy it.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.200
Okay, so let's do some tests while we're printing!

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.620
One, divided by, zero, equals.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.500
Oh, there, see, it's done a full line. You can see that it's not happy.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.649
It's done, no, no, no no no. Clear that. If I do one, divided by,

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:05.429
super zero, so double zero, and it goes, and, still no. Very very unhappy with that.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.669
Let's clear that out. Okay, let's try

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.980
seeing how it does with undoing division.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.720
So, one, divided by, nine, equals, and so there we've got,

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.079
very, loads of ones, very good. Now, we'll multiply that

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.110
by nine, equals.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:29.099
No, not quite. That's very disappointing.

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.659
What is this?

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:34.739
All right, so very knowingly, it tries to do it,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.920
and it didn't get back to one. So, then this is now a little monument to its shame.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.880
You can keep that. Right, you can, you can be like,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.500
"Look what you've done! That is very disappointing. I'm very upset with you."

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.040
Very rarely can you show a calculator what it's done incorrectly like that.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.840
Now one of the great things about a printing calculator, if you're doing a calculation, like you put in fifty eight

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.540
thousand, and you add, eight, right,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.760
and then you want to get the grand total for that,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:10.139
once it's printed out, you can feed it all the way through. And normally you've got to pick the calculator up and move it around.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.300
Because it's a printing calculator, nothing has to go anywhere, and you can still turn the answer around.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.500
So very quickly, we'll just check how big the display is. We've got one two three four five six seven eight,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.800
nine digits!

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.260
ten, eleven, twelve,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.540
no thirteen.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.260
It hits an error at thirteen, but it does display big twelve digits,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.020
that's quite nice.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.760
And if you want, if you want, you want to keep as a reminder

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.660
of just how many digits you've got, of course you can print that out, and there you are.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.140
In fact, on there are more than twelve things on the display, because you've got all the nice fancy

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:51.520
curly commas. Look at those! Good typography. You've got an overly sized decimal point, there's a space, and a plus.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.160
I mean that, that is a good display.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:01.680
So there you are. The Casio unexpected extra twelve digits, two color printing, big display, printing calculator.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.760
Model number HR dash 100 TE plus negative W, adapter included.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.440
Now, obviously, I'm just doing this is a bit of an exhibition piece. It's a bit of fun for the fans at home.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.860
I can't give it a proper score. So there you are, Robert.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.679
Thank you very much for sending this in. And thank you for being an inspiration

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:26.310
to everyone else getting into the calculator game. Who would have thought that a calculator you found in the

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:32.220
basement in the United States that would one day end up here at the South Surrey and Associated Regions

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.970
