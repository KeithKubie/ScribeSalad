00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.310
(soft music)

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.920
I belong to a very poor family.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.570
At home - it's just a room - we live there.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.010
My father is a car mechanic
and my mother is a housewife.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.300
As a child, I used to fear mathematics.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.410
Whenever I used to have
one question or one doubt,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.438
I used to feel very shy asking teachers

00:00:23.438 --> 00:00:27.993
because I heard that my friends
will laugh at me and stuff.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.530
But then, Khan Academy videos are best

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.680
because I can play whenever I want,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.273
how many times I wanted -

00:00:38.157 --> 00:00:42.490
- so because of videos, my
concepts were crystal clear.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.660
Now, I am able to teach
my fellow students.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.560
I am in love with mathematics
just because of Khan Academy

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.850
and of course Khan Academy is best

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.713
because it is free of cost.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.730
I also want to prove the world
and of course my village,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.440
that having a girl child is not a problem.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.330
Basically, I want to change the world

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.400
and education is the best way to do it.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.240
So, I started with myself,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.893
then of course my village
and then the whole world.
