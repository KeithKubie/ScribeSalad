00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here we've zoomed in on the relevant portion of the globe.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can see Syene and Alexandria.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, here the sun's rays strike vertically,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which by vertical we mean perpendicular  to the earth.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here at Alexandria, it doesn't strike vertically.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If I drew a line perpendicular to the earth,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I can see there's some angle here,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which we don't know just yet.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, we're trying to find the circumference of the earth.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We found out that as we move further north from Alexandria

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
this angle actually gets bigger

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the shadow gets bigger as well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It seems like there's some relationship--hopefully a mathematical one--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
between this angle and the circumference of the earth.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's see if we can figure it out.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm actually going to start by making a wish list.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This wish list is going to contain everything

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that I wish I knew in order to solve this problem.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Hopefully, we'll be able to come back to it later

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and address everything on it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I wish I knew this angle, and I'm going to call it the Greek letter α.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're dealing with the Greeks. Why not use the Greek letter?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's pretty common to call angles α in physics.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Okay, so on my wish list, I wish I had that angle--the angle α.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, what are we going to do with this angle α?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Let's not even worry about how to calculate it yet.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What are we going to do with it?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Well, whenever I get stuck on a geometry problem,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I start drawing lines, and they usually help me.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Since a circle is involved here, or a sphere--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but we're only looking at a circular cross section of it--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
drawing lines from the center is usually a good idea.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, I'm going to draw a line from the center to Syene

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and from the center to Alexandria.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Okay, now there's still now a ton jumping out to me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Maybe I'll extend this line--that sometimes helps me see what's going on.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Ah! Okay. Something just jumped out to me.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This angle α shows up in more than one place.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'll tell you there are other angles on this drawing

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that are equal to α--maybe one, maybe more.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm going to mark some contenders and why don't you tell me which ones are correct.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What about this angle? Is that equal to α?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Check that box if you think it is.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Or what about this angle? Is that equal to α?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This one? Or what about this one?

00:02:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For this quiz, just go ahead and check all of the angles that you think are equal to this one.
