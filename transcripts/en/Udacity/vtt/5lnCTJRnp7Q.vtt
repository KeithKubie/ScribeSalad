00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.680
Let's take a look at this method signature.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.990
We can see that ajax takes in URL and settings.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.490
And, settings come within these square brackets.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.540
In general, square brackets within documentation means that

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.060
something is optional.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.240
So, if we look at settings, we see that, in fact, all settings are optional.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.110
So, in all reality all you really need is a URL for an AJAX request.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.150
AJAX has another signature where your just passing in settings, and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.940
settings are optional.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.580
This leads to an interesting situation, let's talk about this for a second.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.970
The correct answer to this questions going to be URL, but

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.010
we can see that with this function signature we don't even need settings,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.630
settings are in fact optional.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.470
And, there is no url.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.690
so, you actually can call an ajax request without passing in anything to it.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.780
But, that would be kind of pointless,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.470
because while it would succeed, it wouldn't go anywhere.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.900
So, you're not really doing much of a request.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.440
In terms of real world requests, most post requests will probably have a url and

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.550
some data with them.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.400
Because in a post request, you're usually sending off data.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.570
And, GET request, in the real world, generally have a url along with some type

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.890
of call back function and some optional data passed along with the GET request.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.400
But, the only thing that's really necessary to send off a functional AJAX

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.770
request is a url string
