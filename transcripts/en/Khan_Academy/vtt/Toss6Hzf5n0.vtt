00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.424
Where we left off in the last video,
World War II had begun.

00:00:03.424 --> 00:00:08.148
In September of 1939 
Germany invades Poland.

00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:12.048
Followed shortly by France and 
Great Britain declaring war on Germany

00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:16.326
Followed shortly by the Soviet Union 
themselves under Stalin's leadership,

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:19.903
also invading Poland and laying claim
to their sphere of influence.

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:25.945
And so now we are going to enter into 1940.
And were going to see that in 1940 and 1941

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:32.490
things only start to accelerate in the Nazis',
and, as we'll soon call them, the Axis Powers' favor.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.858
So in April,

00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:39.715
you have the Germans 
invade Denmark and Norway

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:43.619
...Denmark and Norway...

00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:48.102
...let me make sure that I spell that right...

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:51.335
So Germany invades Denmark and Norway.

00:00:53.027 --> 00:00:55.175
This is April of 1940.

00:00:55.175 --> 00:01:00.233
and then you have May of 1940
Germany invades the Netherlands and Belgum.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:04.563
So Netherlands.... 
let me just write...let me write...

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:07.034
The Low Countries it's sometimes called
because this place,

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:12.153
the land in the Netherlands, right over here, is very close to sea level or sometimes even below sea level.

00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:13.426
Low Countries

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.922
So invades Netherlands, invades Belgium.

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:22.484
Kind of, kind of very similar 
to what happened in World War I,

00:01:22.484 --> 00:01:25.052
where that's kind of how Germany gets to France.

00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:30.515
And then in June, in June, Italy enters the fray.

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:34.331
Italy, which we've seen before, Italy declares war.

00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:40.657
Italy in the war, Benito Mousselini in the run-up to World War II is getting closer and closer to Adolf Hitler.

00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:45.862
And so, in June, Italy declares war on the Allies, on Great Britain and France.

00:01:45.862 --> 00:01:53.853
And so now Italy, so now Italy is formally in World War II.

00:01:53.853 --> 00:02:00.442
And as soon as Italy joins World War II, you start having all these skirmishes out here between Italy's colonies,

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:03.207
and it's kind of where they're ruling colonially,

00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:09.297
in Libya, and in Egypt where the 
British are essentially in control.

00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:14.482
So you start having all of these skirmishes across the border, the Egyptian and Libyan border.

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:18.853
So that was, that was June, 
and actually June, Italy is into the war.

00:02:18.853 --> 00:02:23.482
And then shortly thereafter
France falls to Germany.

00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:27.804
So this wasn't like World War I where we get kind of embroiled in all this trench warfare,

00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:30.353
that lasts over the duration of most of the war;

00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:35.924
very quickly, think about it, this is only what...
eight, nine months into the war.

00:02:35.924 --> 00:02:40.312
France falls, a major power, France falls to Germany.

00:02:40.312 --> 00:02:46.052
And they install Vichy France, which at 
first is in control for the part of France

00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:47.864
roughly the part of France that I'm highlighting.

00:02:47.864 --> 00:02:51.195
This the town of Vichy, which was the capitol of Vichy France.

00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:52.852
Which is why it's called that.

00:02:52.852 --> 00:02:57.548
And then later the rest of what's called Free France 
falls to Germany, later in the war in 1942.

00:02:57.548 --> 00:03:05.595
But things are really, really not looking good for the Allies.

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:11.208
So France falls, falls to Germany,

00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:15.938
the establishment of Vichy France, which is 
essentially controlled by the Germans,

00:03:15.938 --> 00:03:21.287
and then in July, Germany begins bombing Britain.

00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:26.087
So bombing... bombing Britain.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.985
The famous Battle of Britain, which was actually called 
The Battle of Britain even before it began.

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:34.065
Winston Churchill said, hey, we have to prepare for the upcoming Battle of Britain.

00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:38.098
And Germany starts bombing Great Britain.

00:03:39.014 --> 00:03:42.914
And then thing get only worse from there.

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:50.482
So in September, in September the Axis forms
with Japan, Japan joining.

00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:55.297
Japan signs the Tripartite Pact, and so becomes...

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:58.872
...the Axis forms between Japan Italy and Germany.

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:08.342
...signs Tripartite Pact....

00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:15.715
So Japan is in the mix, and since France is already fallen to Germany.

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:20.276
So Japan is now formally part of the Axis with Italy and Germany

00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:22.748
And since France has fallen to Germany,

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:27.482
Japan says, hey, maybe we can go after some of France's colonies, and in particular French-Indochina,

00:04:27.651 --> 00:04:30.004
which we now refer to as Vietnam and Cambodia.

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:36.612
And so, shortly thereafter, Japan attacks French Indo-China.

00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:38.942
so things are not really looking good at all.

00:04:38.942 --> 00:04:42.252
and it only gets worse from there.

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:47.365
In November... so once again we're 
a little over a year into the war now,

00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:52.356
we're entering the end of 1940, in November,

00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:55.336
Hungary and Romania are pressured to join the Axis

00:04:56.354 --> 00:05:02.168
So Hungary and Romania join the Axis

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:10.163
So as we see as we kind of are leaving 1940, things 
are not looking good at all for the Allied powers.

00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:12.654
You see this map, and I apologize for my messiness,

00:05:12.654 --> 00:05:15.451
it's looking more and more and more red.

00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:24.177
The only slightly, kind of, saving grace for the Allied Powers is what's happening over here in North Africa,

00:05:24.177 --> 00:05:33.762
is that eventually the end of 1940, the British are able to drive the Italians back into Libya.

00:05:33.762 --> 00:05:36.969
So let me do this in a different color, 
I'll do blue for the Allies

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:43.645
So the British are able to drive 
the Italian forces back into Libya.

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:47.545
And they are essentially able to defeat the Italians in Libya,

00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:52.048
and, but that's only going to take us into 1941, 
which I'll talk about in the next video,

00:05:52.048 --> 00:05:54.887
where the Germans send reinforcements under the command of Rommel,

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:55.887
and they're able to drive the 
British back again into Egypt,

00:05:55.887 --> 00:06:02.096
and we'll see in 1941 Germany 
and the Axis Powers

00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:05.336
only become more and more 
and more aggressive.

00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:12.464
And as we enter the end of 1941 we'll see 
the entry of the US into World War II.
