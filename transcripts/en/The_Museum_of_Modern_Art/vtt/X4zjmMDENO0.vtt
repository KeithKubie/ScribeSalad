00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:06.029
So I'm focusing on the Imperial Hotel, which
was first commissioned in 1915.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.559
It went through a whole design process in
Taliesin and then built on site completed

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:22.250
around 1922-23 just when the September 1st,
1923 earthquake hit in Tokyo, famously surviving

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:33.389
that and having a 45-year existence being
before and after World War 2 but then demolished

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:42.799
in 1967 in November just before the 1970 Osaka
Expo and the rise of high-rise buildings.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:50.239
So one of the great finds is this book from
1924 that was published just after it opened

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.280
after the earthquake in Japan that I'd never
seen before, this book has been fantastic

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.550
in bringing it back to life.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.970
What's amazing about it when you open it up,
you see the title in Japanese but then you

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.719
see Frank Lloyd Wright in English.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.920
Wright is misspelled, W-r-g-h-i-t.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.270
As you flip through the pages, you see the
plans, which are actually very different from

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:32.020
what was first designed in Taliesin, and then
you get a whole glimpse of the hotel from

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.909
the street, the rooms, and in the detailed
plan it shows you, actually with hand notations

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.659
that I believe were Wright's, where the photographs
were taken.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.450
Also, with the photographs, as we think about
this notion of reframing, we can literally

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.950
see that through photographs that are cropped,
framed to be very vertical, very horizontal,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.869
and show the particular vision of Frank Lloyd
Wrightâ€™s.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.729
And one, in particular, that I was very inspired
by, is one looking from the inside to the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:20.500
garden covered with snow and it's framed in
a way that is reminiscent of a Hiroshige print.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.930
That says The Jewel of the Orient and talks
about it being a blending of both East and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.260
West or actually that it is neither of the
East nor of the West but that perfect blending

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.349
and so how that works, this is also part of
the reframing, that it's not simply one or

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:47.629
the other, we see it in that dynamic process
and all the ideas that shaped it then also

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.670
as it is brought to life for the guests who
go there.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.569
Neither is East nor West becomes very important,
I think, in understanding the greatness of

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:08.230
the Wright design and not putting him into
a category but really understanding this international

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.709
experience that you would have had at the
hotel.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.730
This incredible experience of entering into
a world shaped by the use of materials, the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:28.620
oya stone, a whole world of furniture, china,
rugs that are ordered and composed but in

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.450
a very dynamic way.
