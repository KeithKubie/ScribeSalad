&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.653
&gt;&gt; Norma Krug: Welcome.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.620
[ Noisy crowd ]

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.860
On behalf of the Library
of Congress,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.780
welcome to the 2010
National Book Festival.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.313
We hope you're having
a wonderful hot day,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.820
celebrating the Washington
heat and the joy

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.360
of reading here in
the National Mall.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.120
Before I begin, I just have a couple

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.533
of housekeeping matters,
unfortunately.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.186
I want to inform you first that the
presentations here are being filmed

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.140
on the Library of Congress'
website for their archives,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.966
so please be mindful of this
as you enjoy the presentation.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.280
In addition, please do not sit
on the camera risers in the back.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.046
And one more minor detail --

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.190
If you were here for the
exquisite Corpse event earlier

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.903
and you have a red sticker in your
book, in your flyer, your program,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.696
sorry, please go to the back
table to pick up your book.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.243
There are some people who
haven't picked up their books, so.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.806
Without further adieu,
I'm Norma Krug.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.046
I am a contributing editor at
the Washington Post Book Review,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.506
and I'm here to introduce two
legions, and the story I'm

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.213
about to tell you has numerous
versions and I will tell you one

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.426
of them which is -- in the
late 50s, Norton Juster

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.903
and Jules Feiffer were living

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.513
in the same Brooklyn
Heights apartment building.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.826
Norton was working on a
book and pacing the floors

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.260
and he was either bothering Jules

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
or he was sharing all
of his stories with him.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.253
Both. Regardless of the
truth, Jules started sketching

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.876
and I'm sure you are all
aware what the result was --

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.043
the legendary Phantom Tollbooth.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.110
[Applause and cheering ]

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.713
Jules Feiffer, as you know, has gone
on to become a prolific cartoonist,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.900
playwright and book author.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.500
He's won an array of prizes
across many, many fields --

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.333
a Pulitzer, a George Polk award,
an OV and an Academy Award.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.630
Norton Juster is an architect.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.813
He's now retired.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.806
His firm's projects include the
Eric Karl Museum of Picture Book Art

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.753
in Amhurst, Massachusetts.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.110
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.800
He taught architecture and planning
at the Pratt Institute in New York

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.063
and was a Professor of
Design at Hampshire College.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.683
Some 50 years since their initial
collaboration, I'm sure you know

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.710
that the two authors have just
published a wonderful new book

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.940
called The Odious Ogre, which is
a draw fairy tale about an ogre

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.416
who is extraordinarily large,
exceedingly ugly, constantly hungry

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.640
and absolutely merciless
until he meets a young lass

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.036
who does not fear him.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.930
So, here to tell you
more about the book

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.143
and about their collaboration are
Norton Juster and Jules Feiffer.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.500
&gt;&gt; Norton Juster: Since you
already know everything about me,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.286
let me say a few words in
conclusion, and then we'll leave.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.100
[ Laughter ]

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.860
It has been fifty years,
almost fifty years since Jules

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.480
and I have worked together.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.883
Everybody asks that question.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.316
Some people think it's
rather surprising.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.916
It's really quite simple.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.316
Firstly, we wanted to make sure

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.623
that The Phantom Tollbooth would
still be around and worked.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.890
So we waited a little time.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.596
Secondly, when you would
see someone all of the time,

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.163
they get a little wearing, so we
figured that fifty years was just

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.043
about the right time for us to come
away from all of the problems we had

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.550
with The Phantom Tollbooth.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.750
So, anyway, I wrote this book.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.153
It's not a book that was
just written a few years ago.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.510
I started making notes for
it about forty years ago,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.380
and this is the way I usually work
-- I make notes about something,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.443
I stick it in an envelope and I put
it in a drawer where I forget it.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.616
And several months later, I'll take
it out and look at it and I'll say,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.510
nahhhhh, and I'll put it back.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.163
So I did this on and off for a long
time and one day a few years ago,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.256
I picked this out of the drawer
and I looked at it and said, hey,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.830
I think I know what to do with this.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.456
And I started working on it.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.590
Well, as soon as I finished it
and brought it into my editor,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.500
almost simultaneously, we just
said, Jules has to do this.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.180
And luckily he was available
to do it and we did it.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.806
&gt;&gt; Jules Feiffer: Unplugged.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.406
&gt;&gt; Norton Juster: Yes.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.940
[ Laughter ]

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.873
I didn't want to bring that out
but there was a long stretch

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.140
when Jules was really in decline.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.673
He did maybe six or eight
books, speaking engagements all

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.140
over the country, some
plays, a few other things,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.266
but he really wasn't
doing terribly well.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280
[ Laughter ]

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.173
So we decided we'd give him a little
break and he performed beautifully.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.600
Anyway, why don't you take over
for a little bit and talk about it,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.313
whatever you want to talk about?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680
[ Laughter ]

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.440
&gt;&gt; Jules Feiffer: Um.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.573
Well, I don't need
this if I have that.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.106
Can you hear me?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.306
&gt;&gt; Is your mike on?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.173
&gt;&gt; Is my mike on?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.640
OK. Are you criticizing
my dress, madam?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.040
[ Laughter ]

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.240
I have spent hours
preparing for this appearance.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.796
I didn't have a beard
before I came on here.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.430
[ Laughter ]

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.950
This is, um, I have
been, when Norton

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.980
and I originally did
The Phantom Tollbooth,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.070
I was a slashing hard-hitting
social and political cartoonist

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.570
for the Village Voice and other
publications who had no interest

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.883
in children's books because
I had no interest in children

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.110
because I didn't have them.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.176
And, essentially, did The
Phantom Tollbooth as a toss-away.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.203
It was something to do
for my friend, Norton.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.810
It was an exercise in
experimentation because,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.776
although I was not interested
in doing childrens books myself,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.633
I was informed on and
loved the whole history

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.816
of childrens book illustration,
particularly the 19th

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.576
and 20th century English
and American illustration

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.443
and I thought I would steal from
one of those guys in order to figure

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.813
out how to do this book, so, there
was an illustrator that I loved

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.046
at the time who seemed
closest to the looseness

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.206
of my own style named Edward
Ardizzone and I did my best

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.553
to channel him in my
work for the book.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.976
But, once I finished the book
and once we sold the book,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.790
and both of us were astonished
that it would have the shelf life

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.590
which goes on and on that it
did have, once that was done,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.846
I put childrens books behind me
to go on to the more serious work

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.960
of my life which was
overthrowing the government.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760
[Laughter ]

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.583
which I actually succeeded in doing

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.150
[ Laughter ]

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.416
with mixed results.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.150
[Laughter ]

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.013
But, something funny
happened over the years.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.153
What happened was that I married
twice, have three children,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.770
and suddenly I, who never wanted
children, never liked children,

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.330
was mad about children
because when you fall in love

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.856
with your own children, when
you seem to fall in love

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.123
with everybody else's children,
and what my children did,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.900
what my children forced me
to do was tell them stories.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.273
And I started telling these
kids stories to my oldest, Kate,

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.710
who now writes her own children's
books and which I collaborate on.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.710
One is about to come out from
Candlewick Press in the spring,

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:31.596
called My Side of the Car,
but we did Which Puppy?

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.596
a year and a half ago, and we
did Henry, the Dog with No Tail,

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.463
and she's also done many
more with other illustrators.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.673
But that came about because I
was making up stories to tell her

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.243
as I did with my daughter,
Hallie, and Bart George,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.403
a book you may know, began

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.903
as a bedtime story for
my daughter, Julie.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.170
[Applause ]

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.236
And word for word, the story I
told her is virtually the story

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.050
in that book.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.850
So, I began to love this thing
that I had dismissed early,

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.940
and what I also found out,
as politics began to fail me

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.616
as a subject because politics
began to fail as a nation,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.483
was that there was something
truly reviving and uplifting

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.200
about working for children.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.516
Because at the very
least, they were the future

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.950
and they couldn't screw
up anything yet.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.350
[ Laughter ]

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.960
And, while, with my adult work,
essentially writing the cartoons

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.673
and writing plays, they were
basically cartoons and plays

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:48.543
in a sense about disappointment,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.010
about being let down,
about unmet needs.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.296
But, with a kid's book, I can deal
with my silliness for the first time

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.813
and use that as a subject; my
optimism, you can deal with hope;

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.213
you can deal with innocence and,
as sour as we get over the years,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:12.833
as disillusioned as we get, what
saves us and has always saved us,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.630
is the continual rediscovery
and reinvention of innocence,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.263
of illusion, and nothing is better
than children's books as a nest

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.043
for that kind of illusion, to give
kids the sense, as I had as a kid,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.536
as I needed as a kid, as many
kids have and adults have,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:36.990
if you don't find it at
home, a sense of hope,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.386
a sense of identification, if you
don't find it in the neighborhood,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.103
if you don't find it with your
friends, if you don't find

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.456
in a school, my God,
there it is in literature,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.433
over and over and over again.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
[ Applause ]

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:56.563
And you find what you
feel that you're alone,

00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.413
and no one understands you, you
accidentally pick up a book,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:02.893
and 20 or 30 pages in, you say,
oh my God, this is about me.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.440
And it gives you a connection.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.283
It gives you a connection to
the world but also a connection

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.696
to sanity because you don't feel
like quite the freak you felt like.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:17.910
You don't feel quite
that alone anymore.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.416
And what I love about this work
is that, once being the recipient

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.983
of that kind of feeling from
different authors and illustrators

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.410
over the years and cartoonists too
in comic strips, now I'm the job

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.803
of trying to play the
same role for a generation

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:39.143
and several generations
of younger people.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.930
And it's a great job.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.536
It's a very happy kind of work.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.333
And it's given me as much
or more pleasure than any

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.100
of the various other things I do
and will continue to do and one

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.300
of the great pleasures was
to finally get back together

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.033
with Norton and figure out
how best to tell this story

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.890
of The Odious Ogre, which we've just
done together, and my first reaction

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:09.466
to the book was, all I want
to do is do the biggest ogre

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.380
in children's book history, so
that it can't fit on the page.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.500
And the rest of it, I must
say, is story-telling.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.696
I mean, that -- there
are great children's book

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.850
illustrations around.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.383
And some of them, if
you look at these books,

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:27.650
have little to do with the story.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.166
They have to do with the brilliant
illustrator showing himself

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.800
or herself off.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.000
But it seems to me that the only
point in a book, coming at this

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.050
from the point of view of a
cartoonist, where words and pictures

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.283
into play and mix and mingle,
is that the words and pictures

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.053
in the book, in Norton's, not so
much in The Phantom Tollbooth,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.680
because that were illustrations
for in a sense a novel,

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.460
but in the picture book, they should
mix and mingle like a comic strip

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.816
so that you can't tell where
one begins and the other --

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.233
they each affect each
other's sensibility.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:05.573
They are part of the same piece.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.146
They are twin together, and
that's what I try to do in this

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.000
and I'm very happy with how the
book came out which owes a lot also

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.096
to our editor, Michael
di Capua who guided this

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.706
and sometimes force-fed
it into the two of us and,

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.496
after loving what the illustrations
and loving every one said,

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.446
I think you have to do this one
over, and loving it ever so much,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.840
I think you have to do this
one over, and, you know,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:37.470
if you love doing the work,
you love the opportunity

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.203
to get it right this time,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:43.803
even though you thought it
was right the last time.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.470
Norton?

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.340
&gt;&gt; Norton: Thank you.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
