00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.729
Imagine for a minute that your blood cells
are shaped like sickles -- sorta like that

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:05.520
thing that the image of death carries?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520
Ouch right?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.260
But what exactly causes our friendly little
red blood cells to turn against us?

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.219
Sickle Cell Anemia is a blood disorder, where
instead of supple soft-frisbee red blood cells

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.150
that live for 120 days, your body forms stiff
pointy sickle-shaped cells that only live

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.850
for 10 to 20 days.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.300
RBCs need to be soft and pliable to squeeze
through your blood vessels safely and efficiently,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.160
so when they’re pointy they can get stuck
in vessels.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.530
When this happens in the chest, abdomen or
joints it can cause pain, if they get stuck

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.540
in the hands or feet you can get swelling,
and of course if they get stuck in organs

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.820
they can cause infections or (if they get
caught in the eye) vision problems.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.710
And if that wasn’t bad enough, the brittle
cells can break apart, delaying oxygen delivery

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.850
and causing fatigue!

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.830
This all sounds terrible.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.040
It was first described in 1910, in a dental
student named Walter Clement Noel who went

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.570
to a doctor in Chicago complaining of pain,
but this student wasn’t from Chicago -- he

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.220
was from Grenada.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.810
Sickle cell anemia predominantly affects approximately
1 in 400 African American births.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.260
It was a disease known in Africa for five
thousand years, but it hadn’t been described

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.140
in Western Medicine before 100 years ago.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.141
The doctor in Chicago, who’s name was James
B. Herrick was the first to describe it in

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:23.450
a paper and over the next century many doctors
have attempted to uncover how this debilitating

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.270
disorder works, and why it mainly affects
those of African descent.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.549
In the 1930s, a D.C.-based doctor named William
Cardozo was one of the first black doctors

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.229
to conduct research into this disease… and
he did so with a grant from Alpha Phi Alpha

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.010
the first black Fraternal organization.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.610
Cardozo felt that research into sickle cell
anemia had “reached an impasse” and that

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.030
no one had yet found the CAUSE of this horrible
disease.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.831
IF someone could provide a “new stimulus”
to get the research going, he wrote, maybe

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:56.600
we could discover more.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.869
His research, published in 1937, helped medicine
realize sickle cell anemia was inherited.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.229
Thanks to his research we now knew sickle
cell came from us -- and he helped explain

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.880
why it mainly affected people of African descent.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.040
Which is huge.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.340
While he was working on that other doctors
started to realize this disease was based

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.730
on oxygen content.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.650
In fact, Québécois researchers in 1930 Montreal
took a seven year old black girl and restricted

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.480
blood flow to her finger with a rubber band
-- no, this probably wouldn’t pass an ethics

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.190
board today -- In doing so, they found sickle
cells formed in the low oxygen environment

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.190
of her fingertip.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.930
Thus, they learned that with a bit of hypoxia,
or lack of oxygen, the cells would collapse

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.379
into all manner of weird pointy shapes, nearly
instantly returning to normal when exposed

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.459
to air.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.450
Their methods were questionable, to say the
least, but the results did shape future research.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.760
In the mid-20th century doctors discovered
that a single amino acid was responsible for

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.500
the hemoglobin on the red blood cells that
cause the sickling.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.800
But now that we understand the disorder enough
to try and solve it… but…

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.709
Unfortunately, we’re at another moment when
we may need more “new stimulus” for SCD

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.709
research.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.230
According to a Clinical Investigation from
2007, there are many possible treatments,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.450
including a bone marrow transplant, but there’s
still no cure.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.070
One option is medicine that helps fetuses
develop more hemoglobin, but it CAN make SCD

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.070
worse…

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.380
Maybe in the future an option could be genetic
manipulation of the system that helps our

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.790
bodies create blood, using genome engineering
basically, gene therapy.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.710
But for now, sickle cell anemia is just out
there, a life-threatening thorn in many people’s

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.710
sides.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.731
Cardozo was one of many doctors of many races
in the hunt for the causes of sickle cell

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:41.731
anemia.

00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:46.310
He’s notable because in the 1930s doctors
that looked like him were often not welcome

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.630
in the annals of medicine.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.280
That HE was able to make a discovery for a
disorder that affected so many people that

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.430
also looked like him, is a pretty big deal,
so we’re happy to recognize the part he

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.849
played in this story for Black History Month.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.000
For more on red blood, watch Jules’ video
about what bone marrow actually does!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.640
(Hint: it’s important).

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.390
And please subscribe for more seeker.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.250
Whenever I think of red blood cells, I think
of those soft frisbees that I used to throw

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.330
at my brothers.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.489
Maybe that’s why I think of RBCs as so darn
friendly!

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.740
Thanks for watching.
