00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.319
COLT MCANLIS: Ow. [BLEEP] dude.

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.610
One of the characteristics
that makes "Compressor Head"

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.920
successful, I think, is
really that dynamic range

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.110
between the two of us.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.594
Ow. [BLEEP] dude.

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:16.510
Can we try that again?

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.260
Do we want to do that one again?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.760
BRIAN GRADY: Sure.
"Compressor Head"

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.989
is a universe of knowledge.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.530
COLT MCANLIS: It
was my way of trying

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.081
to rekindle a love for this
lost computer science art.

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:29.330
So here's the tricky part
with arithmetic compression.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.760
Why the hell does it work?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.110
Even if you're a PhD
in computer science,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.683
you really aren't taught these
core fundamental algorithms

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:36.308
of compression.

00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:37.370
BRIAN GRADY: I never was.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.703
COLT MCANLIS: How would you
teach the most complex thing

00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:40.962
possible to a three-year-old?

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:42.670
Well, you wouldn't do
it with a computer,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.420
you wouldn't do
it with a diagram.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.250
You would put blocks and sticky
tape and really bright colors

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.445
to show them things
moving in space.

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:54.320
And I said, well, if
that's how I would teach

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.990
a three-year-old arithmetic
compression, obviously,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.240
it would work on a programmer.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.690
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.190
Huh.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.340
I remember when we pitched
it the first time internally.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.770
We were like, we want
to do this crazy thing

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.340
where we talk about compression
and we use Play-Doh.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.860
Oh right.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.460
And just deadpan from
everybody we pitched it to.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.300
They're like, I don't-- why?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.676
We shot a prototype
but we didn't

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:20.425
tell anybody we were
shooting a prototype,

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:22.400
and then we just handed
the video to people,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.030
and it kind of went viral
internally, if you remember.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.954
All of a sudden, my
boss's boss's boss saw it,

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.620
and they were like,
yeah, this is great.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.161
We want more.

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:32.210
Then all of a sudden,
overnight, everyone

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.540
wanted "Compressor Head."

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.010
There's something in this
video series just for you.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.482
It really was
Brian's vision to do

00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:39.690
a show that was different
than what we'd done before.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.312
It was the rules of
"Compressor Head."

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:43.770
BRIAN GRADY: You can't walk in
with any props in your hand,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.850
and everything that you use
has to come from the room.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.350
At Google, there's
this place called

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.380
the garage that
is made to develop

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.560
community and collaboration.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.750
We found out that we
could go into this room.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.310
We could use it like a studio.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.380
There were so many
possibilities.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.740
It had so much junk in it
for us to make things out

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.890
of that we could actually
go on set with Colt's ideas

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.699
and make stuff that represented
them pretty much in real time

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.190
right before we
started shooting.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.650
COLT MCANLIS: Part of the
mania of "Compressor Head"

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.441
is literally about the
fact that none of us

00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:16.790
know what we're doing until
five minutes beforehand

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.850
and the fact that all of us on
the shoot, all of us around it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.200
just have to be OK
with that, literally.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.280
BRIAN GRADY: The lighting
guy doesn't like it.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.905
COLT MCANLIS: The
two ended up creating

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:29.270
the Burrows-Wheeler
transform algorithm.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.910
For me, the magic was
really meeting Mike Burrows

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.240
or, as he prefers to be
called on the internet, Mike

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.240
[BLEEP] Burrows.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.130
BRIAN GRADY: That's
what he goes by.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.870
COLT MCANLIS: Mike's
the co-inventor

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.980
of Burrows-Wheeler transform,
and he works here at Google.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.520
Charming man, but
you talk to him

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.570
about the invention of
Burrows-Wheeler transform,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.440
and you realize it should
be the stuff of cinema.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.290
This story is so
amazing and dynamic,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.477
and you're just like, why
does no one know about this?

00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:57.560
Why is this not published?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.540
Why is this not on the
Wikipedia page, for god's sake?

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.600
Just getting a chance to meet
someone who was a part of that,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.530
I kind of fan boy-ed
out a little bit.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.220
I got red.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.845
One time, he caught
his finger in that.

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:10.850
It was actually pretty funny.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.350
You know what was
number two for me?

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.610
BRIAN GRADY: Hm?

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.905
COLT MCANLIS: Magnus.

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:13.670
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah, man.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.140
Let's do it.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.610
COLT MCANLIS: All right.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.327
Ready?

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:16.160
BRIAN GRADY: Magnus.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.210
COLT MCANLIS: The power
of Magnus in that scene.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.740
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Aw, yeah.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.250
COLT MCANLIS: If you keep up
with the Play Service's What's

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.090
New videos, Magnus is
the guy who does them,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.190
and Magnus's energy is just
so higher than any of us

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.535
can even get close to.

00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:31.910
And then number
three was Joanna.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.230
JOANNA SMITH: I want you
to go and do your job

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.470
and tell them exactly how
to succeed with compression.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.680
COLT MCANLIS: Joanna
did a fantastic job.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.540
She really didn't have
to act in that role.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.940
She really does
hate me that much,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.941
and she hates what I do that
much, that it was perfect.

00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:46.940
We've got to talk about
the dynamic arithmetic--

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.065
JOANNA SMITH: Some of
us have real work to do.

00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:50.270
BRIAN GRADY: She has so
little respect for you.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.940
COLT MCANLIS: She does.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.010
So anyway, we're trying a
bunch of different things.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.020
Tell us what you like.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.909
We did season two
because I could not

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.950
walk through a conference
without people stopping

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.520
me and asking for more.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.364
That's why we do these things
is for developers out there.

00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:03.780
And so if the
developers want more

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.970
and we hear them
wanting more, we'll

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.655
do season three in a heartbeat.

00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:09.780
The best thing about working
with Brian that really

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.240
humbles me is his patience.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.005
I mean, to have some crazy
bald guy running around, here's

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:16.589
all this crazy stuff, and
iterating back and forth

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.089
between you and I
about the movement

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.890
in the shot and the direction,
and then someone who actually

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.416
has a background in film
actually being patient with all

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:25.040
the craziness that
I bring to the table

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.320
and the last minute-ness.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.190
That thing makes
this magic happen.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.429
The mania kind of makes
it magical in that regard,

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:34.720
and Brian's ability to manifest
that and make it happen

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.394
is really cool.

00:04:35.394 --> 00:04:37.060
BRIAN GRADY: I enjoy
every moment of it.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.490
COLT MCANLIS: Well, it's
the cursing, really, that

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.200
brings us together as a team.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.260
BRIAN GRADY: The dirty talk.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.685
If I was going to work
with one of the guys here,

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:47.310
this would be the guy that would
go do something crazy with me,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.010
and I wanted to do
something crazy.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.040
He is known to make everybody
a little bit better than they

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.580
were, and I feel like that's
happened to me as well.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.865
I've learned more about
compression than I ever

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.220
thought I'd want to.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.332
It's really the most fun
I think I've had at work.

00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:05.540
COLT MCANLIS: We get it done.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.605
BRIAN GRADY: We get it done.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:07.604
COLT MCANLIS: Fist bump.

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:08.130
Boom.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.660
My name is Colt McAnlis, and
this is "Compressor Head."
