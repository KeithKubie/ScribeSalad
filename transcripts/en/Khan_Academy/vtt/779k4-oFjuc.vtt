00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:01.518
- [Voiceover] As we do AC analysis,

00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:04.223
and we do operations in
the frequency domain,

00:00:04.223 --> 00:00:06.453
we need to bring along Kirchhoff's Laws

00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:08.995
so that we can make sense of circuits.

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:11.120
So, in this video, I'm
gonna basically show

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.453
that Kirchhoff's Voltage Law works

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:15.590
in the frequency domain.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.820
And what I have here is a circuit

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.728
that has some voltage
source, an AC voltage source,

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.394
let's put AC on it like that,

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:25.005
and it has three impedances connected.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:29.313
Inside each of these boxes
is an R, an L, or a C,

00:00:29.313 --> 00:00:30.710
and we're not gonna show which

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.278
because we're gonna carry these along

00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:35.350
just as general impedances.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.820
So, in AC analysis, the
voltages are all cosine waves.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.070
So, v-in equals

00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:46.840
some voltage amplitude times cos

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:49.812
of omega-t plus

00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:54.008
we'll call it phi-zero,

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:58.187
some starting phase shift.

00:00:58.187 --> 00:00:59.512
So, this is our input signal.

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:01.464
Now let me label the
voltages on everything else.

00:01:01.464 --> 00:01:03.297
We'll call this v-one,

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:07.643
and I'm gonna label it this way, here,

00:01:07.643 --> 00:01:09.560
and this will be v-two,

00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:13.980
and I'll put it upside-down
like that, the plus,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.860
and this will be v-three,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.610
minus, plus, v-three.

00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:23.198
And, oh, now that I have v-one here,

00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:25.160
let's change the name of this to v-zero

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.645
just so I don't get i and one mixed up.

00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:29.316
So, we'll change that to zero.

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:31.789
So, the input source is v-zero,

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.367
and that's that voltage.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:38.419
Now, when we apply KVL to
this, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law,

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:40.253
what it says is if we start in a corner,

00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:41.344
if we start somewhere in the circuit,

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:42.981
let's start right here,

00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:46.012
and go around the loop,
it should add up to

00:01:46.012 --> 00:01:46.958
zero volts.

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.785
That's KVL for normal DC circuits,

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:53.025
and we're gonna see how that
applies to AC circuits, here.

00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:56.100
So in time domain, we say that v-zero

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.850
plus v-one plus v-two

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.499
plus v-three equals zero.

00:02:04.297 --> 00:02:06.108
So, let's talk about how
this is gonna turn out.

00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:07.873
Well, what do we know right now?

00:02:07.873 --> 00:02:10.822
Well, we know that v-zero is a cosine wave

00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:12.877
at some phase angle.

00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:16.952
Now, what do we know about
the other voltages in this?

00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:18.682
In AC analysis, what we're
doing is we're looking

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:20.157
for a forced response.

00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:23.059
So, we've let the natural
responses to die out.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.522
There's no switch in this circuit,

00:02:24.522 --> 00:02:26.298
and we just assume this circuit has been

00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:28.237
in this state forever.

00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:30.320
So, the natural response,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.993
the natural response has died out,

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:43.573
and that means we're looking
for the forced response.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.251
So, what we know is,
we have three voltages.

00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.168
We have three voltages.

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.295
We know that all these voltages

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:01.128
are gonna resemble the input voltage.

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:04.045
So, they're all gonna be sinusoids.

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:12.959
All the voltages here
are gonna be AC sinusoids

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.976
because the forcing
function is a sinusoid.

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:20.154
The other thing we know, they're gonna all

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:21.821
have the same omega.

00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:27.761
The frequency of this
voltage, and this voltage,

00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:31.337
and this voltage is gonna
be identical to omega, here.

00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:34.333
I'm gonna put a big bang there.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.946
That's really important.

00:03:35.946 --> 00:03:37.711
In an AC circuit, when you're driving it

00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:41.322
from a frequency, every
other frequency in the system

00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:43.155
is the same frequency.

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:47.487
This is a linear system
and linear components.

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.933
All the analysis we've done,

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:52.967
linear components don't
create new frequencies.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.242
They're all omega.

00:03:55.242 --> 00:03:57.123
Now, some other things we know.

00:03:57.123 --> 00:03:58.806
There's gonna be phase
shifts involved here.

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:00.037
Remember when we do impedance,

00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:04.516
we are multiplying by j and
rotating things by 90 degrees.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:07.099
So, we're gonna have different,

00:04:09.557 --> 00:04:11.890
different phi, for each one.

00:04:13.783 --> 00:04:15.095
And, the other thing we're gonna have,

00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:17.762
is we're gonna have different...

00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:22.433
The amplitude of our sinusoids
are gonna be different.

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:25.022
The amplitude of v-one could be different

00:04:25.022 --> 00:04:27.077
than the amplitude of v-two.

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:29.631
So, this is what an AC
solution is going to look like.

00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:31.997
Let's move on a little farther here.

00:04:31.997 --> 00:04:33.660
What I'm gonna do now is we're gonna take

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.980
this input voltage plus these
things that we know, here,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.689
and we're gonna see how
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law works

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:40.881
in the frequency domain,

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:45.026
when we worked with these
transformed z's, these impedances.

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:47.776
Okay, let's go ahead and do that.

00:04:49.287 --> 00:04:53.287
Okay, let's do a little
more in the time domain.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.935
And we'll write out
our KVL equation again.

00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:01.768
So, the KVL equation was v-naught,

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:05.169
cosine omega-t plus phi-zero

00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:12.024
plus v-one, that's the amplitude of v-one,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.777
cosine omega-t

00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:19.426
plus some different phase angle.

00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:21.539
We don't know what that is yet.

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.206
Plus, v-two, amplitude of v-two,

00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:28.383
cosine omega-t

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:31.692
plus phi-three

00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:37.676
plus v-three, the amplitude of v-three,

00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:41.708
cosine omega-t plus phi-three

00:05:44.562 --> 00:05:45.895
all equals zero.

00:05:47.174 --> 00:05:50.494
And omega, all these omegas,
are the same exact number,

00:05:50.494 --> 00:05:52.294
the same radian frequency.

00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:53.687
All the phi's are different,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:57.054
and all the v-twos and
v-threes are different.

00:05:57.054 --> 00:05:58.947
Okay, now I'm gonna switch

00:05:58.947 --> 00:06:01.614
to complex exponential notation.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.381
We just changing notation here.

00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:13.308
We can represent this number here

00:06:13.308 --> 00:06:15.308
as this is the real part

00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:17.982
of v-naught, v-zero,

00:06:20.498 --> 00:06:21.331
e to the j

00:06:22.878 --> 00:06:23.961
times omega-t

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.396
plus phi-zero.

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:31.719
That's exactly the same as this.

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.809
This cosine can be represented

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:37.652
as the real part of a complex exponential

00:06:37.652 --> 00:06:39.319
with this frequency.

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.851
And, I can write out the rest of these.

00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:48.833
V-one, e to the j

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.506
omega-t plus phi-one

00:06:56.193 --> 00:06:57.943
plus the real part of

00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:02.958
v-two, e to the j-omega-t,

00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:08.844
plus phi-two, parentheses,

00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:12.128
plus v-three,

00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:15.911
oops,

00:07:19.425 --> 00:07:20.425
real part of

00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:24.379
v-three,

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:27.246
e to the j-omega-t

00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:30.412
plus phi-three

00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:36.191
equals zero.

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:43.666
All right, now, one thing I can do next,

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:44.525
we can start to factor this.

00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:47.056
We can start to take
this apart a little bit.

00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:49.924
So, I know that if I have the expression,

00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:50.999
if I have the expression,

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:52.499
e to the j-omega-t

00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:58.283
plus phi, just in general,

00:07:58.283 --> 00:08:01.035
I can change that just
by exponent properties

00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:05.202
to e to the j-phi, let's get
the parentheses in there,

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:07.838
like that,

00:08:07.838 --> 00:08:11.171
e to the j-phi times e to the j-omega-t.

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:14.444
So, I'm gonna do this transformation

00:08:14.444 --> 00:08:16.940
on all four of these terms here.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.357
Let's keep going.

00:08:22.304 --> 00:08:23.137
So, we're still working on this.

00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:25.625
Let's go real part...

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.330
Now I'm gonna take apart omega-t

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.385
and phi-zero, here,

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:31.885
and I get v-naught

00:08:33.868 --> 00:08:35.535
e to the j-phi-zero,

00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:39.735
e to the j-omega-t,

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:43.129
plus real part,

00:08:46.378 --> 00:08:47.422
v-one,

00:08:47.422 --> 00:08:49.005
e to the j-phi-one,

00:08:51.844 --> 00:08:53.427
e to the j-omega-t,

00:08:55.121 --> 00:08:56.954
plus real part, v-two,

00:08:59.985 --> 00:09:01.568
e to the j-phi-two,

00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:06.817
times e to the j-omega-t,

00:09:09.724 --> 00:09:10.891
plus real part

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.653
v-three, e to the j-phi-three,

00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:21.464
e to the j-omega-t

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.513
all equals zero.

00:09:28.242 --> 00:09:31.203
And here's a nice simplification,

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:32.921
we take out this common term.

00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:35.649
We're gonna factor out this common term

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:38.714
across the entire equation.

00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:39.655
And what do we come up with?

00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:41.155
We come up with...

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:44.964
The result is the real part of

00:09:46.783 --> 00:09:47.616
v-zero,

00:09:48.524 --> 00:09:50.191
e to the j-phi-zero,

00:09:52.832 --> 00:09:53.665
plus v-one

00:09:57.012 --> 00:09:58.512
e to the j-phi-one

00:10:00.123 --> 00:10:02.706
plus v-two, e to the j-phi-two.

00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:07.598
See the pattern.

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:14.803
All that times

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:19.602
e to the j-omega-t.

00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:24.609
And we close that and that equals zero.

00:10:24.609 --> 00:10:25.514
Now, we're getting close.

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:27.523
We're getting close.

00:10:27.523 --> 00:10:30.808
All right, how do we
make this equation zero?

00:10:30.808 --> 00:10:34.317
Does e to the j-omega-t ever become zero?

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:36.317
Well, e to the j-omega-t

00:10:38.877 --> 00:10:41.536
e to the j-omega-t is a rotating vector.

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:42.869
It's never zero.

00:10:45.716 --> 00:10:46.946
So, that's not gonna do it.

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:47.779
So, how do we get it?

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:49.686
Well, that means that
this other term, here,

00:10:49.686 --> 00:10:52.101
has to be equal to zero.

00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:53.611
So, how am I gonna do that?

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.362
I'm gonna make one more notational change.

00:10:56.362 --> 00:10:58.695
This kind of a number, here,

00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:01.425
is called a phasor.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.309
It's some amplitude times e

00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:09.689
to a complex one angle,

00:11:09.689 --> 00:11:11.163
and there's no time up here.

00:11:11.163 --> 00:11:12.278
There's no time.

00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:14.495
The time is only over here.

00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:17.131
This is the only place that
time appears in the equation,

00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:19.088
and this is the only
place that omega appears

00:11:19.088 --> 00:11:21.758
in the equation, and these
are just phase angles,

00:11:21.758 --> 00:11:23.593
these are starting phase angles.

00:11:23.593 --> 00:11:27.041
So, my notation for a
phasor is gonna be...

00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:28.016
This gonna be called...

00:11:28.016 --> 00:11:31.302
I'm gonna call it v-zero and
I'm gonna put a line over it

00:11:31.302 --> 00:11:33.891
to indicate that it's a complex vector,

00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:35.141
and that equals

00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:38.317
v-naught,

00:11:38.317 --> 00:11:40.150
e to the j-phi-naught.

00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:46.615
So, when you see the vector
symbol and the aught,

00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:48.615
that's that right there.

00:11:56.376 --> 00:11:58.876
And we can write now, finally,

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.594
the real part of

00:12:04.526 --> 00:12:05.950
V-naught

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.367
plus V-one phasor

00:12:10.377 --> 00:12:11.794
plus V-two phasor

00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:15.188
plus V-three phasor

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:19.504
equals zero.

00:12:21.744 --> 00:12:25.077
So, this is KVL in the frequency domain.

00:12:34.548 --> 00:12:36.848
And fortunately, it looks like...

00:12:36.848 --> 00:12:39.302
It looks exactly like KVL that we remember

00:12:39.302 --> 00:12:41.028
from our DC analysis.

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:43.826
The sum of the voltages,
going around the loop,

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:45.869
is equal to zero, and, in this case,

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:48.586
it's the sum of the phasors
going around the loop

00:12:48.586 --> 00:12:50.003
is equal to zero.

00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:55.288
Let's try to give a graphical
interpretation to this.

00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:05.914
Here's our real and imaginary
plane, the complex plane,

00:13:05.914 --> 00:13:09.112
and what it says is that these phasors...

00:13:09.112 --> 00:13:10.201
So, let's say that v-naught,

00:13:10.201 --> 00:13:13.745
let's say that v-naught look like that.

00:13:13.745 --> 00:13:15.869
That was our voltage source, okay.

00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:17.544
This represents a vector spinning around

00:13:17.544 --> 00:13:19.860
at the frequency, omega,

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.484
and it's offset phase is
this angle right here.

00:13:24.484 --> 00:13:26.234
So, this is phi-zero.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.664
Each of these other
components is gonna have

00:13:31.664 --> 00:13:34.422
an AC voltage, a sinusoidal voltage on it,

00:13:34.422 --> 00:13:36.918
with some phase and some magnitude,

00:13:36.918 --> 00:13:38.691
and what KVL tells us,

00:13:38.691 --> 00:13:42.444
it puts a constraint on
what those voltages can be.

00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:43.919
So, we have three impedances here.

00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:44.894
I don't know what they are

00:13:44.894 --> 00:13:46.415
because we didn't fill in the circuit,

00:13:46.415 --> 00:13:48.737
but there's gonna be some vector

00:13:48.737 --> 00:13:50.258
associated with each one of those.

00:13:50.258 --> 00:13:52.789
Let's say that's vector-one,

00:13:52.789 --> 00:13:55.956
and let's say that this is vector-two,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.707
and what it says is that vector-three,

00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:02.709
by the time we get done,

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:05.792
vector-three has to sum back to zero.

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:10.831
So, this kind of a constraint

00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:14.476
where voltage is going around in a circle,

00:14:14.476 --> 00:14:15.997
have to come back to zero,

00:14:15.997 --> 00:14:18.459
that's KVL and the frequency domain.

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:20.711
That's what that means.

00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:23.335
So, we've shown that KVL
works in the frequency domain.

00:14:23.335 --> 00:14:24.322
I could do a similar analysis

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:27.352
and show that KCL,
Kirchhoff's Current Law,

00:14:27.352 --> 00:14:29.964
also works in the frequency domain,

00:14:29.964 --> 00:14:32.135
and that means, fantastically,

00:14:32.135 --> 00:14:34.144
that all the tools that we developed

00:14:34.144 --> 00:14:37.490
for DC analysis of just resistor circuits,

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.412
all those tools work
for AC analysis as well.

00:14:41.412 --> 00:14:42.563
Thanks for listening.
