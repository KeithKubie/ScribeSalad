00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:10.876
&gt;&gt;Bill: Eighty-five minute
classes are a long time

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:14.146
for most kids, so having
that little break in there

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.066
in the afternoon has really
helped our kids re-energize,

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:18.336
and teachers as well.

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:34.366
&gt;&gt;MHS Unplugged is
recess, but we wanted

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.306
to give it a theme name so that
the idea of unplugging yourself

00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:41.996
from the curriculum,
unplugging yourself from stress,

00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:43.056
unplugging yourself

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:46.386
from electronics just
becomes the main focus

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:49.806
of the fifteen minutes per day
that we offer MHS Unplugged.

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.196
Students and faculty come up
with activities that they would

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:56.296
like to offer during that time.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:00.696
&gt;&gt;William: Recess is kind of
interesting for a high school.

00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:03.496
It's a nice way to relax in
between your classes and kind

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.756
of get out some of
your tiredness.

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:09.000
There's art stuff, you know,
you can play board games.

00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:20.396
&gt;&gt;Bill: We really make a point
to say, "You have permission

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:22.456
and you need to stop
what you're doing

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:24.996
and do something
totally different,

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.376
something that's
mindful, challenging,

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:29.306
something that creates
community,

00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:30.936
something that creates
generosity."

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:34.226
Sometimes by doing an
activity with that kid

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.686
that is having a tough
time in your class,

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:39.526
there's a connection that's
made, it's very powerful.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.286
&gt;&gt;Tom: Nice, that was nice.

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:43.956
Jon, you throw something out.

00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:51.976
&gt;&gt;Student: F, C,
C sharp, F sharp.

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:54.486
&gt;&gt;Jon: It's a good
time to just mellow out

00:01:54.486 --> 00:01:56.506
and just clear your head

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:58.226
from the schoolwork
that you're doing.

00:01:58.646 --> 00:02:01.436
Other times, I'll go to
the gym and play basketball

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:03.976
or I'll go outside and play
lacrosse, or I'll meditate.

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:11.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right,
you all ready?

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:14.006
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes, shh, just have to be quiet.

00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:17.386
&gt;&gt;Meditation Recording: Lie
in the posture of savasana.

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:23.076
Take three full deep breaths
and with the exhalation,

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:27.306
feel a sense of letting go.

00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:29.586
The whole face is becoming soft.

00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:34.476
Feel the shoulders
sinking into the floor.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:38.836
&gt;&gt;Student: Thank you.

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:40.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Of course, thank you.

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:42.696
&gt;&gt;Bill: There's this
community happening

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:45.856
and relationships are
fostered because folks

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:47.486
who normally don't see each
other all day get together

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:47.976
for fifteen minutes.
