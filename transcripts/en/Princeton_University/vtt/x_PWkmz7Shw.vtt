[CHOIR SINGING]

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.730
PENNA ROSE: Choral music can
be a transcendent experience.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.370
Everybody comes bringing
a different gift.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.760
Some have great pitch, some
have a great personality.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.920
Some have just the ability to
sight read specks off a wall.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.200
So you put all of
these people together,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.340
and all of those
talents make the group

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.160
bigger than the individuals are.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.410
My name is Penna Rose.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.510
I'm the director
of Chapel Music,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.750
and this is my 25th
year at the University.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.840
My goal with this choir is
to infect these students

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.122
with the love of choral music.

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.580
ELIZA DAVIS: One
of the things that

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.890
has been so great about being
president of Chapel Choir

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.110
is being able to
work with Penna,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.880
and have her sort of guide me.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.190
I think she was sort of the
first adult at Princeton

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.780
that I really felt
comfortable with

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.420
and I really felt sort of
had my back in anything.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.430
I feel so lucky to have had her.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.980
I think Princeton can
be really hard at times,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.890
and Penna has always been
sort of that constant presence

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.740
and guide for me
here, which has been --

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.570
I'm extremely grateful for that.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.880
PENNA ROSE: So please,
do everything you can.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.630
You're right here.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.910
All you've got to do is look
up and there's the stick

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.490
right in your face, right?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.100
They're just
imagining it, and it's

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.600
happening right on the beat.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.010
They're just amazing,
amazing, amazing.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.470
So please be equally amazing.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.350
How about that?

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.041
All right, good.

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:30.540
ERIC FUNG: I think
that Penna really

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
does emphasize making the
music mean something to you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.790
and connecting with
the text and the --

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.160
and the -- the music.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.920
She is definitely a mentor
figure, not just to me, but

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.220
to everyone else in the
choir and to whomever

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.130
wants to have that
relationship with her.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.512
She will definitely
be open to that.

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:51.220
PENNA ROSE: So you
turned your thesis in.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.510
ELIZA DAVIS: Yes, I
turned my thesis in.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.660
PENNA ROSE: Good, OK,
tell me all about it.
I

00:01:53,660 --&gt; 00:01:54,910
What was it about?

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.500
ELIZA DAVIS: So it was
about -- so I was writing about

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.291
the Millennium Development
Goodoals, and how --

00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:59.850
PENNA ROSE: Princeton
is competitive,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.740
and I think can
be difficult. So I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.230
want them to have
a safe space where

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.080
everybody is treated the same.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.100
This space becomes their home.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.830
When the kids graduate
and they talk about it,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.540
after they've graduated,
they talk about

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.212
the community of the choir and
how important that is to them.

00:02:17.212 --> 00:02:19.670
[CHOIR SINGING]

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.660
JENNIFER BORGHI: Penna
taught me probably

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.320
the most essential
lesson about making music

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.810
that I have ever
received and which

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.420
I see embodied by only the
best and rarest musicians

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.630
that I've encountered since --

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.290
since I left here.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.600
Penna said to me one
day, never ever, ever,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.180
put yourself before the music.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.690
That sums up the way
Penna makes music.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.990
That sums up music in
this chapel and the reason

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.630
why I keep coming back.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.870
Penna is one of very few people
I know who conveys that over

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.290
and over again.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.900
What you are singing, what
you are saying is important.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.316
ERIC FUNG: From
Opening Exercises,

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:08.320
to yesterday's
Baccalaureate, she

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.775
has filled our
undergraduate lives

00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:12.340
with heavenly sounds
and angelic music.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.250
And she has not only
served as a mentor,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.596
but has also been a great friend
to many in the audience today.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:20.442
We would like to thank her and
extend her an honorary class

00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:20.942
membership.

00:03:20.942 --> 00:03:22.985
And we're surely happy
to have her in the ranks.

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:25.260
Welcome to the great
Class of 2017, Penna.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.760
PENNA ROSE: I tell the students
often, um, in this space,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.740
there has been music going on.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.530
There have been a lot of words
also spoken in this space.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.480
But there's been a lot of music.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.850
And the music from those
former times is in the stones.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.040
And so this is your
opportunity to put your music

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.520
in those stones, so that
in future generations,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.610
that sound is going
to reverberate

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.745
with what they are doing.

00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:54.160
And it's very important.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.380
That is part of your
legacy at Princeton

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.140
is to put your beautiful
sound in these stones.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.050
I've never found anything else
that feeds me like music does.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.330
I tried to do other
things a couple of times,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.760
and I was miserably unhappy.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.540
So I said, all right, I give up.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.490
I will just do this, because
it brings me such joy.
