00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, so I lied. I am going to tell you how charging by induction works.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But I hope you did put some thought into it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
One way you can charge by induction is by exchanging your single sphere for two

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
connected by a detachable conducting rod.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In this case, negative charges will be attracted to this end of our little dumbbell

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and positive charges will be left in this end, then we can just detach our connection

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and tada, we have two charged objects--one positive and one negative.
