&gt;&gt; AWKWARD FAMILY PHOTOS.COM HAS
BUILT AN EMPIRE OF PICTURES THAT

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.346
FAMILIES WILL SPEND THE REST OF
THEIR LIVES WISHING NEVER

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:12.846
EXISTED.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.249
BUT LUCKILY THEY DO.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.652
COMEDIANS FOR 250 POINTS I WOULD
LIKE YOU TO CAPTION THESE FAMILY

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.989
PHOTOS, ALL RIGHT? VERY SIMPLE.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.093
&gt;&gt; FIRST ONE, THIS GUN LOVING
CLAN.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.797
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BABY LOOK
MORE FRIGHTENED IN MY LIFE.

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:36.203
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BABY THAT
SHOULD LOOK MORE FRIGHTENED.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:36.970
&gt;&gt; Chris: WHAT IS THE CAPTION.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.307
&gt;&gt; THERE USED TO BE MORE OF US.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:46.246
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.414
&gt;&gt; Chris: MARIA.

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.450
&gt;&gt; WE ARE THE COWARDS, WE DON'T
KNOW HOW TO USE OUR WORDS.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.151
&gt;&gt; Chris: NICE.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.087
I WILL GIVE YOU POINTS FOR THAT.

00:00:54.188 --> 00:01:03.864
GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE, THESE
PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:12.639
&gt;&gt; I WONDER WHAT FAMILY THEY'RE
FIGHTING AGAINST.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.509
&gt;&gt; Chris: IF YOU OPEN A PHOTO
OUT IT IS THE MCCOYS ON THE

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.177
OTHER SIDE.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.512
ALL RIGHT NEXT ONE.

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:21.548
THIS VIOLENTLY DOMESTICATED
FAMILY.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:27.621
&gt;&gt; GRRR.

00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.723
&gt;&gt; IT'S SO FUNNY WHEN I CHOKE
THEM. JACKIE.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:31.458
NACO LIBRE.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.361
&gt;&gt; Chris: YES.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.562
POINTS.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.799
I THINK A BETTER PICTURE WOULD
BE HIM TRYING TO GET HIS HANDS

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.569
AROUND THEIR WAISTS.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.105
(BLEEP). DAMN.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:51.411
&gt;&gt; IF DADDY DOESN'T KILL US TYPE
2 DIABETES WILL.

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:54.348
&gt;&gt; AH.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:57.518
&gt;&gt; Chris: I FEEL BAD BUT THE
AUDIENCE WANTS ME TO GIVE YOU

00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:58.118
POINTS, SO YOU GET 'EM.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:01:59.887
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:04.424
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE BAD PEOPLE! YOU ARE
BAD PEOPLE! YOU SHOULD FEEL

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:10.063
BAD! YOU ARE JUST FUELING THE
FIRES OF HOW BAD YOU ARE!

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.698
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT WAS GREAT.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:12.933
THAT WAS GREAT.

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:16.670
&gt;&gt; Chris: DARK EVIL HEARTS OF
THIS AUDIENCE SO POINTS FOR YOU,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.804
MARIA BAMFORD.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.811
NEXT ONE, HOW ABOUT THESE
PROBABLY NOT VERY FIT PARENTS.

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:25.712
&gt;&gt; YES, TOMMY.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:30.417
&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM
THE OUTSIDE.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:37.124
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:40.093
&gt;&gt; IT MUST BE REAL SPECIAL IF
YOU HAVE TO WEAR A BOW TIE TO GO

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.094
IN THERE.

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:45.566
&gt;&gt; WHO KNEW IT WAS SEMIFORMAL.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.834
&gt;&gt; Chris: ALL RIGHT.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:47.301
NEXT ONE.

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:49.436
THIS FIERY FAMILY.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.139
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.674
&gt;&gt; Chris: YES, TOMMY.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:56.476
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T KNOW THE FLATTOPS
WERE HEREDITARY.

00:02:56.577 --> 00:03:01.949
&gt;&gt; Chris: THEY ARE, YEP.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.885
IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO MAKE
THIS PICTURE AWESOME THEY WOULD

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:06.253
ALL HAVE FLATTOPS.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:06.854
BUT, NO.

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:08.055
YOU HAVE POINTS.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:08.789
MARIA.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.894
&gt;&gt; WE ARE FINE, EVERYTHING IS
FINE.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:19.233
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:23.437
&gt;&gt; WE ARE JUST HANGING OUT AND
MAKING OUT IN THE CRAB NEBULA.

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:24.605
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.606
JACKIE.

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:27.541
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUT
DURING THE RAPTURE.

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:28.442
&gt;&gt; Chris: YES.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.779
GOOD.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.714
POINTS.

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:39.653
HOW ABOUT THIS LAST ONE, THESE
PARENT TO BE?

00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:42.155
&gt;&gt; I DON'T FEEL GOOD RIGHT NOW.

00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:43.690
&gt;&gt; Chris: JACKIE?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.627
&gt;&gt; HORIZONTAL STRIPES DO WHAT?

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:53.901
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:54.902
MARIA.

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.772
&gt;&gt; HONEY, I CAN FEEL IT KILLING
FROM THE INSIDE.

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:04.311
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:09.516
&gt;&gt; DOCTOR? THIS BABY IS GOING TO
(BLEEP)ING DELIVER ITSELF.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:17.124
&gt;&gt; WHEN DID HOT TOPIC GET A
MATERNITY SECTION.
