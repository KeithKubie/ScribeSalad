00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.960
Phenology, the word, comes from the Greek
word "pheno" which means "to appear" and is

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.230
usually comprised of the study of the timing
and the duration of events in the lifecycle

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.910
of plants and animals.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.580
In California, perhaps the most iconic wildflower
is California Poppy and the flowering of California

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.180
Poppy once it is induced occurs on a daily
basis for weeks and even months under good

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.760
conditions.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.710
And the petals open to reveal the pollen containing
anthers inside until the flowers are pollinated

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.670
at which point the flower will wilt, the petals
will fall off and the seed containing ovary

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.010
will rapidly expand to contain hundreds of
seeds to be disbursed by the wind when the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.149
fruit opens up.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.320
At the scientific end of the spectrum, is
flowering at the end of winter advancing?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.850
Owing to the increased warmth that we're experiencing
during our ever shorter winters or are they

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.069
perhaps in some cases being delayed owning
to say a lack of water necessary for those

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:22.969
processes to progress normally?

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.060
So today we're here at Hastings Reserve to
conduct a phenology workshop.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.950
People from around the community came in.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.380
Scientists and just some members of the public
and they're reporting their observations online

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.560
to an online program that the National Phenology
Network created.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.560
Essentially this program its kind of like
Facebook for nature.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.130
Well we all recognize that there aren't enough
scientists in California or elsewhere to provide

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.430
enough phenological observations with enough
frequency to be able to detect small changes

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.259
from year to year and so for that we need
to turn to the public to contribute to the

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:27.889
statewide and the ultimately to the national
database as well.
