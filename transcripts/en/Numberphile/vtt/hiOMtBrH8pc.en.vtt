MATT PARKER: I'd like to talk
to you about the number 98.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.503
98 is a bit large for
people to think it's

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:07.830
quite a cool number.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.930
However, if you take
the square root of

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.030
98, it equals 9.89949.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.270
What I like is that the first
two digits are the same as the

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.000
digits in the number you were
taking the square root.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.110
This works for other numbers.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.140
If you take the square root
of 99, it equals 9.94999.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.380
Starts with 99.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.850
And when I saw this,
I saw 98 first.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.870
I thought, wait a minute, I
wonder if there are other

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.610
bigger ones.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.990
And it turns out there are.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:45.580
If you take the square root of
9998, that equals 99.98999.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.440
And there's your 9998.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.540
And all these numbers-- and
you can keep going.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:58.660
9999, if you square root
9999, it starts 99.99.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.050
And there's other stuff
going out there.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.390
But it starts with those.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.580
And this continues.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.106
The next one, it's always
an even number of nines.

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:11.730
So 9999, and then ending
with an 8.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.100
And 9999, ending with a nine.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.550
You've got these numbers where,
if you take their

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.570
square root, they begin with
exactly the same digits.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.660
Admittedly, only in base 10.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.320
But I was just doing
this in Excel.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.900
I made a little spreadsheet,
and I was putting

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.510
in all these numbers.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.630
And I found these.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.050
And I went, I wonder
if there are more?

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.270
And I couldn't find any more
where the square root starts

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.710
with exactly the same digits
as the number itself.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.970
But then I went, you know what,
I wonder if there any

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.530
numbers where just after the
decimal point, maybe just the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.020
digits after there are the same
as the number itself.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.170
And there are.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.940
I'll just do a couple.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.440
The first one is 77.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.070
Because if you do the square
root of 77, it starts with 8,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.000
which is a bit disappointing.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.650
But then 77 appears
right there.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.210
And, in fact, any number--

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.835
so 9797, and then 997997.

00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:10.320
And this pattern continues
all the way down.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.210
Each of those, this one is 98.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.980
You ignore that.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.745
It then goes 9797
and then I think

00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:19.740
it's like 95 or something.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.930
But this here, so there's 77.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.610
There's 9797.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.710
This one here starts 998.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.600
We ignore that.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.170
And then you've got 997997,
and then a bunch of stuff

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.090
after that.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.180
But there it is.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.890
I find these weird properties
of numbers fascinating.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.110
And again, I'd never
heard of this.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.850
No one ever talked to me about
numbers where the decimals in

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.150
the number appear in
its square root.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.350
I looked online, I couldn't find
anyone else talking about

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.130
these sorts of numbers.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.560
I asked some friends.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.460
No one had heard of these.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.035
And I was like, well, I've got
to call them something because

00:02:52.035 --> 00:02:53.110
I was making notes on them.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.500
I was looking into
different types.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.100
And so I called them grafting
numbers, because you start

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.850
with a number and then its root
just grows off from it.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.590
However, up until now, they're
being quite boring.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.100
Because there's these
two families.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.440
There's the 98 family and the
77 family, which is a quite

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.520
predictable series of numbers.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.610
And I wanted to see if were
more exciting ones.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.160
So I thought, how am
I going to do this?

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.490
Up until now, I've been putting
this into Excel and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.270
doing a spreadsheet.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.270
And Excel is great, because you
can see the numbers that

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.330
you're doing calculations.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.035
And you can search
for numbers.

00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:27.915
But you hit the limits
quite quickly.

00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:30.100
And so I thought, you know what,
I've been meaning to

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.950
learn how to program
in Python, which is

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.820
a programming language.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.580
If you've done any programming,
I highly

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.430
recommend Python.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.740
Don't go through life without
being able to program.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.350
It's a whole area of a way of
thinking and a way of doing

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.580
things that underpins all
our modern technology.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.170
At least, for a little while,
out of interest.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.720
It's like everyone should
skydive once, because we're

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.170
the first generation of humans
that can jump off

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.590
that kind of a height.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.150
You know, just a--

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.920
you know, this weekend
I'm going to fall

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.850
from a plane and survive.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.180
No other human's been
able to do that.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.760
So I programmed a
little script.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.880
And I found all the numbers up
to 10 million which appear

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.790
somewhere in their root before
you go past the decimal point.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.745
Because once you fall off
that decimal point, it

00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:16.880
is a long way down.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.910
It looks like it stopped, but
it's just checking bigger and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.089
bigger numbers.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.519
See, it's found a few more.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.880
And it's checked the first
million at this point.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.780
I'll show you the
ones I've found.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.080
There's another-- and I'm not
going to bother with the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.940
square root sign anymore, just
to make life easier.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:38.680
764, its root is 27.64054
and so on.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.160
And there it is there.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.370
764 appears a little way in.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.120
And in fact, 765 does the same
thing, 27.6586 and so on.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.874
And there it is there, 765.

00:04:53.874 --> 00:05:01.880
5711 gives you 75.57115,
and there it is

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.312
there, and that continues.

00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:08.800
The next one down was 5736.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.230
That gives you 75.73638
and so on.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.410
And there it is there, 5736.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.960
So in addition to the ones I
showed you before, these are

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.120
all the other numbers that
appear somewhere at the

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.690
beginning of the square root.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.730
Now, mathematicians can be very
patronizing towards some

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.290
of the sciences.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.740
In fact, physicists themselves
refer to biologists as people

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.250
doing stamp collecting, because
all they're doing is

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.140
looking at things and
just labeling them.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.540
They're not doing any of the
underlying patterns or the

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.480
reasoning behind it.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.970
And I, as much as I make fun of
biologists, I also do like

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:50.570
stamp collecting.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.180
I like biology, for
the record.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.590
And in maths, there's some
great fun doing stamp

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.820
collecting.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.520
So these numbers are
meaningless, to be honest.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.570
This only works in base 10.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.790
There's no rhyme or reason.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.450
It could be a complete accident
that 5711, its square

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.990
root starts 5711.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.365
There could be absolutely
no meaning.

00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:16.860
But I enjoyed writing a computer
program, as such, to

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.050
search through and to find
all these numbers.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.940
But then the mathematician
in me thought, what

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.080
if there is a pattern?

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.620
What if there is something
underneath these?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.440
And so I suddenly
looked at these.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.990
I went, wait a minute.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.370
This one here, 76394,
looks a lot like

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.490
this one here, 7639321.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.100
In fact, it's the first five
digits of this, and then

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.520
rounded up, as such.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.480
And then I went, wait a minute,
what if I take the

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.890
first three digits of this
and round that up.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.200
And that's over here, 764.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.250
And so it looked like there was
this pattern of numbers.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.870
And so I wrote a different
program to just look for the

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.780
numbers of this form.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.520
And I'll show you
what I found.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.800
If you continue on, this pattern
does keep going.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.530
The next one down-- where
we up to-- gets to 31.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:12.070
The next one is 763932023.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.120
That appears in its
square root.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:23.920
The one after that
was 76393202251.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.226
The next one is 7639320--

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:31.645
0, I'll make sure I
get this right--

00:07:31.645 --> 00:07:39.440
0225003, from memory.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:39.830
Yep.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.060
And then the next one is a bit
longer, and a bit longer, and

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.610
a bit longer.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.360
And it keeps going.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.500
And there is this sequence
of numbers that have

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.630
the grafting property.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.560
And I thought, well,
what is it?

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.970
And if you just take this string
of numbers, it turns

00:07:52.970 --> 00:08:00.250
out this string of numbers is 3
minus the square root of 5.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.120
If you work out 3 minus the
square root of 5 as a number,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.120
it equals 0.763932.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.870
And then it's exactly the
same sequence as far in

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.440
as you care to go.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.940
So this family of grafting
numbers are

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.610
based on this constant.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.530
And so I decided this--

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.260
I call it a grafting constant.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:28.660
And if you take that number
and multiply it up.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.560
So if you multiply it, well,
first of all, by 1,000 and

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.220
then round it up, you
get the first one.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.429
If you multiply that by 100
and round it up, you

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:36.720
get the next one.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.370
Multiply it by 100, get the
next one, and then so on.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.889
You get-- there's
a whole family.

00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:42.280
Actually, if you want to write
that mathematically, we'll put

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.570
that in brackets.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.000
You're then going to have to
multiply this by 10 to the

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.590
power of 2n minus 1.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.640
That will generate your
next term up.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.960
And in maths, to say round
up, we do what's

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.500
called ceiling brackets.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.150
So I'm going--

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.480
I'll do--

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.250
it's like, I draw
them like this.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.150
There are variations.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.830
It's calculate that, round
it up to the next number.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.190
And you get a whole family
of grafting numbers.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.710
So there you are.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.550
I was very pleased because I
went from just being the

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.520
mathematical equivalent of a
trainspotter, pulling out

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.790
these random numbers, to finding
some that had an

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.040
underlying pattern, and the
constant that generates them.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.240
And that made me
disproportionately happy.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.010
And this may be number four.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.896
I've not come across it, but
most things in maths have the

00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:30.110
number four.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.630
I was at the Maths Jam weekend,
which is the Maths

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.600
Jam conference.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.340
So math jams are monthly
gatherings in pubs to do maths

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.730
and talk about fun things.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.460
Once a year we get together,
so 130, not mathematicians,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.310
just people who like maths,
were in a room.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.150
And everyone gets five minutes
to talk about something that

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.170
they assume everyone else
will find interesting.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.000
And I talked about
these numbers.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.370
And some people just found the
programming aspect of finding

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.420
these, and just categorizing
them, was interesting.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.200
But the mathematicians in the
room were a bit more pleased

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.820
when I could show that there's
a family which has an

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.870
underlying pattern to them.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.700
And I don't know what happens.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.990
I've thought, you could
look at them.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.450
You could do cube roots.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.380
You could do this in
different bases.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.950
There's always another way
to generalize this

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.200
and see what happens.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.390
BRADY HARAN: What do you
think about this?

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.460
What do you think I
think about this?

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.140
MATT PARKER: I--
goodness knows.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.060
My theory was that, as a
mathematician, my theory is

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.860
not that unusual.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.900
Because I figure if you find
something interesting, someone

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.100
else will find something
interesting.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.350
And I found these numbers
interesting.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.060
And well, I'm sure I'm unusual
in a lot of ways, but there

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.340
must be some other people who
find this stuff fascinating.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.580
And so, I thought I'd
share it with them.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.130
And some people did.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.380
They thought it was great.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.130
I sat on the train and learned
computer programming.
