JIM YOUNG: Well,
welcome everybody.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.784
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:05.390
I'm Jim Young.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.210
I work on the Google
for Work team.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.530
And I want to welcome
everybody to today's session.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.850
I think it's going to be a
very thought-provoking and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.470
interesting session, something
completely different than what

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.290
you've experienced previously.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.720
So in introducing our
guest today, at Google,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.730
we have something called
10x and a healthy disregard

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370
for the seemingly impossible.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.500
But our guest today
has done some things

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.820
in the physical, mental,
and emotional realm

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.729
that definitely
qualifies for that.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.450
He basically did the Iditarod
on foot, not on a sled.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.620
He then went on to do the
Badwater Ultramarathon, which

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.352
is 140 miles, 168
roughly, give or take?

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:45.060
JOE DE SENA: 135.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.387
JIM YOUNG: 135 in
140-degree heat.

00:00:47.387 --> 00:00:48.095
JOE DE SENA: 137.

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:48.594
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:49.240
JIM YOUNG: 137.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.740
Not that he remembers.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.620
Down to 49 degrees roughly?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.450
JOE DE SENA: Yeah.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.870
JIM YOUNG:
Temperature variation.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.870
And then did the Vermont
100 ultra marathon,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.712
and then did the Lake Placid
Ironman all in one week.

00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:05.420
JOE DE SENA: It was
much cheaper flights.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.830
JIM YOUNG: So I wanted to
welcome Joe De Sena to Google.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.950
We met recently up at his farm
for a little, unique off-site

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160
that we're going to get
into a little bit later.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.560
So welcome to Talks at Google.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.280
To start things off, I
thought it was fascinating

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.370
that when you do
ultra-endurance events, often

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.480
you experience unique things.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.240
You hallucinated about
hamburgers one time.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.340
And I'm sort of curious.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.610
How does one-- how did
that condition come about,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.262
and where were you, and
what were you doing?

00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:39.720
Sort of walk us
through, how do you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.928
hallucinate about hamburgers?

00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:43.240
JOE DE SENA: I've
hallucinated a lot,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.795
as has anybody that's gone
beyond 24 hours no sleep

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:48.045
and really pushing themselves.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:52.090
But what's interesting is
you can actually smell.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.180
So you're not only
seeing what is not there,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.770
but you're smelling it.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.140
All the sensations exist.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.130
And you're absolutely
convinced that there's

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.421
a McDonald's around the corner.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.880
We were in Canada at the time.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160
It was 30 below.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.900
We had already gone
four days without sleep.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.229
I was starving, obviously.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.022
Our philosophy used to be,
as a team, if you're hungry,

00:02:11.022 --> 00:02:11.980
you're eating too much.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.470
So we were always hungry.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.090
And I swear there was
a McDonald's there.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.970
And it wasn't.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.720
But a more interesting
hallucination story

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.380
was we were nine days
into a race, four of us,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.550
and in the sky were these
wonderful cumulus clouds.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.850
And we all saw the
same Disney figures.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.030
Because 12 hours later,
we were talking about it,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.810
and we all saw the same thing.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.460
And so that's interesting.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.720
One more hallucination story.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.100
We were in Alaska,
day eight, day nine,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.957
and we all saw a
bear coming at us.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.040
And so we got in position.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.206
We got our hiking poles out.

00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:49.820
We were ready to
defend ourselves.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.480
It was a tree.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.260
It hadn't moved.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:52.252 --> 00:02:54.794
But this bear was coming at us.

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:56.460
JIM YOUNG: I once had
something similar.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.700
I played 36 hours of
continuous tennis.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.870
And I was playing singles.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.520
And I actually thought I had
a doubles partner on my side.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.730
I'd started hallucinating.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.720
So per his point,
beyond 24 hours,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.410
it's interesting what the
human mind goes through.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.980
So many people may not know
that you actually started off

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.900
as an entrepreneur
at a very young age.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.860
And I'm sort of curious, your
upbringing and the influence

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.509
of where you grew
up, your parents.

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:21.925
And how did you
start off becoming

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:23.770
an entrepreneur at
such a young-- I

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.620
think it was in your teenage
years or even before that?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.760
JOE DE SENA: Even
before that, yeah.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.350
So my dad was very successful.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.960
He was an entrepreneur across
many different industries.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.580
And he went broke
in the mid-'80s.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.899
And my neighbor,
unbeknownst to me,

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.440
was the head of the organized
crime family, the Bonanno crime

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.310
family.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.230
And he had no--

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.271
JIM YOUNG: Wait a second.

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.710
JOE DE SENA: He had no son.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.270
He had daughters.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.560
And he took a liking to me.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.370
And I was looking
for work, just a way

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.870
to make a few extra dollars.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.804
And he said, clean my pool.

00:03:55.804 --> 00:03:57.720
And that led to another
pool and another pool.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.940
And before you know
it, I had 750 customers

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.180
that were mostly organized crime
people, which had its benefits.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.138
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.120
And so that was my
entrepreneur story

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.150
at a young age,
which ultimately led

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.541
me to get a job on Wall Street.

00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.040
And--

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.940
--I just kept building.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.390
JIM YOUNG: We've talked
about this before.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.022
Folks seemingly have it.

00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:26.480
And you were instilled with
certain values and certain work

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.890
ethic by your parents,
but in different respects.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.299
Each one had things that
they came at you with.

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:34.840
Can you sort of walk
us through that?

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.896
I mean, how does that
start off in early life

00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:40.520
and then manifest itself in some
of your later accomplishments?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.020
JOE DE SENA: So my
dad was a workaholic

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.720
even when he was going
through tough times.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.553
Everybody in the
neighborhood we grew up in,

00:04:45.553 --> 00:04:50.010
even if they were doing bad
things, were pretty committed.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.420
People owned pizza places.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.200
People owned cement companies.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.840
They just worked very hard.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.710
My mother, for whatever reason,
got into yoga, meditation,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.330
health food, and
ultra-endurance running.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.455
And the reason she got into
ultra-endurance running

00:05:03.455 --> 00:05:05.610
is in Queens, not
far from our house,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.630
was a run called the
Transcendence Run.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.890
It was a 3,000-mile run
around a one-mile loop.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.860
And just as a young
person hearing that,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.660
my limits then were
set at a different bar.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.020
Well, if somebody
could run 3,000 miles

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.510
around one-mile loops,
what else could you do?

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.269
And so those two influences
really shaped me.

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:28.060
JIM YOUNG: You end up
selling your business

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.150
and deciding to
go to Wall Street.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.130
Can you sort of walk us
through the transition there?

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.390
So you're very successful.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.130
You're doing these different
companies, the pool products

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.089
industry, if you
will, and the pools.

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.630
But you also launched several
other companies in the process.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.400
But then you said, I want
to go to Wall Street.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.830
JOE DE SENA: Well, I
didn't say-- the last thing

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.840
I wanted to do was
go to Wall Street.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.256
I said I would
never-- and this is

00:05:48.256 --> 00:05:50.160
going to upset
everybody here-- I never

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.250
was going to sit in front
of a computer all day.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.800
I wanted to work physically.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.710
I just enjoyed being physical.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.800
And in college, I
had met a gentleman

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.660
who was a very
successful investor.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.270
And he had begged me to make
an investment in a stock.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.187
And I had no interest.

00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:06.061
I was doing very well
with the pool business.

00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:07.760
We now had a
construction company.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.110
And he would just
call me relentlessly,

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.612
month after month, that he
wanted me to cross the river,

00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:14.320
go to Manhattan, and
work on Wall Street.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.835
He saw something
with my work ethic

00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:18.800
that he thought I could
really capitalize on.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.670
And I kept saying no.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.099
And then one day, he said, I
want you to buy this stock.

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.640
And he gave me the
name of the stock.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.700
And I thought, he's nuts.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.660
I'm not going to do it.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.130
And I went to go collect
money, in accounts receivable,

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.870
from one of my
construction customers,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.310
who was a pharmacist.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.820
And I asked him,
I said Eli, what

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.070
do you think of this stock
my friend just recommended?

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.194
And he said I can't believe
you're mentioning that,

00:06:40.194 --> 00:06:41.573
because I was just
in the shower,

00:06:41.573 --> 00:06:43.406
and that's the stock
I'm going to buy today.

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:44.550
And he sat me down.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.690
And he said, you're
young, you're not married.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:46.610
You should make an investment.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.026
And so he convinced me to take
the money he owed me, which

00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:52.526
was substantial, and put it with
his broker and buy this stock.

00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:54.400
And the next day, the
company got taken over.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.330
And I made $100,000 in a day.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.586
And I said, I'm
going to Wall Street.

00:06:58.586 --> 00:06:59.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.679
That's a lot better
than cleaning pools.

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:03.220
JIM YOUNG: Do you
have any more tips?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.140
Just kidding.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.720
So you're very successful
on Wall Street.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.470
You did have a few
bumps in the beginning.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.650
I'm sort of curious of that.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.090
JOE DE SENA: Lots of bumps.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.210
JIM YOUNG: Why did
you leave that world?

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.251
You were very successful.

00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:18.170
You built up this company, I
think it was 10 years or so.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.645
But what was the
aha moment where

00:07:19.645 --> 00:07:21.810
you said, this isn't what
I want to ultimately do,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.480
I want to do
something different?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.446
And making that change
is a very big change

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.570
at that point in your life.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.320
JOE DE SENA: Yeah.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.830
For me, I don't
think it was ever

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.410
planned to be there to
begin with, as I described.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.274
And I certainly wasn't
going to stay there.

00:07:35.274 --> 00:07:36.690
I was there for a
specific reason.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.130
I wanted to make some money
before I had a family.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.205
And I always had a picture
of a little red barn

00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:42.580
next to my desk,
and that's where

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.600
I was going, wherever that was.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.070
And we found a
place up in Vermont.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.850
The opportunity came
up to sell the company.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.880
We went to Vermont.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.020
And that was that.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.030
And I always had this influence
on people, the same influence

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.570
my mother had, which was
I would just rope people

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.230
into exercise and
sweat and yoga.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.070
And before you know
it, it changed lives.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.867
And I really just
wanted to do that.

00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:07.450
JIM YOUNG: You wanted
to change lives.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.600
And you start off with what
would be called typically

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.750
elite athletes running
these incredible races.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.740
But then, I'm sort of curious,
you wanted to reach the masses.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.190
And you started Spartan Races.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.360
And could you sort
of give us the notion

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.780
behind those and involving some
people that normally may never

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.820
have exercised or gotten
involved to that level?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.510
It's fascinating that many
events and sports are geared

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.120
for the upper
level, but you want

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.929
to reach out to all communities
and all types of people,

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.470
regardless of their previous
athletic prowess or lack

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.299
thereof.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.510
JOE DE SENA:
Originally, I said, I

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.289
want to reach--
maybe 50,000 people

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.370
in the world would do this.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.790
And then we said, wow, we
can get it to a million.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.790
We got to hit a million.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.060
And we hit a million.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.310
And so now we want to hit
10 million people a year

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.560
and really affect change.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.357
Because when they come
into our ecosystem,

00:08:56.357 --> 00:08:58.440
they start eating better,
they get better friends,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.717
they start going to bed early,
they drink less, they work out.

00:09:02.717 --> 00:09:03.550
And so we nailed it.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.637
We found something that
really appeals to people.

00:09:07.637 --> 00:09:09.220
It sounds funny
saying it here, right,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.279
but that's not
technologically advanced.

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:13.820
It's actually going
backwards, right?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.944
We're getting people dirty.

00:09:14.944 --> 00:09:19.090
We're getting them to sweat
and crawl under barbed wire.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.690
And so who knows what that
number eventually goes to.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.370
But we see all
walks, sizes, shapes.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.300
696-pound men come
out and do it.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.750
Little kids come out and do it.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.500
One day, I was sitting
at the barbed wire.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.470
I like to really mess
with people sometimes.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.850
And I had a fire hose.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.460
And I was just
blasting people as they

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.360
were trying to go
through the barbed wire.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.861
And I thought, wow, that woman
has an incredible costume on.

00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:42.610
She looks like Flo
from "The Brady Bunch."

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.470
There's no way she's
really 75 years old,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.595
but she looked like 75.

00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:47.470
And so I wanted to blast
the costume off her,

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.730
and it wasn't coming off.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:49.790
She was really 75.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.460
I felt terrible afterwards.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.294
Broke her teeth.

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:54.960
No, I'm kidding.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.515
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:56.515 --> 00:09:57.890
JIM YOUNG: So who
in the room has

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.560
done a Spartan Race or Trifecta?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.140
I think we've got quite a good
sampling here, a vast majority.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.932
So how big has it grown?

00:10:05.932 --> 00:10:07.265
I mean, it's gone international.

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:09.422
So you give us a
semblance-- you mentioned

00:10:09.422 --> 00:10:11.130
almost a total number
of one million now.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.940
But how many countries?

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.980
I mean, this is almost
a worldwide phenomenon.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.373
JOE DE SENA: We have to
get to 42 countries, which

00:10:15.373 --> 00:10:16.940
is our goal, because we want
to get this in the Olympics.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.500
We want to make
an Olympic sport.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.060
And we're in 17 countries now.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.570
We'll reach just shy of a
million participants this year.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.535
And it's just, yeah,
logistically challenging.

00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:29.660
I look at Google, as you
walk me around the campus,

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.260
and think, how did
you grow this fast?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.730
Because on our little, tiny
scale, it's challenging.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.520
But we've got a lot more to go.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.540
JIM YOUNG: Many folks
often talk about starting

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.250
with the end in mind.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:46.010
Or you took steps, and
some folks do in between.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.090
Did you engineer a spot that's
10 years out and sort of

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.370
reverse-engineer from there?

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.112
Or did you take it
from a point forward,

00:10:52.112 --> 00:10:53.820
where you sort of have
these incrementals

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.770
in between for milestones?

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.229
I'm always curious
how folks-- you

00:10:57.229 --> 00:10:58.770
know, when you reach
a million people

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.570
and you're taking
10 million, how

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.357
did you come about doing that?

00:11:03.357 --> 00:11:04.440
Was it one step at a time?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:04.752
JOE DE SENA: Yeah.

00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:07.418
So I have a really sophisticated
system for starting businesses.

00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:08.446
I fire.

00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:09.320
And then I get ready.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.023
And then I aim.

00:11:10.023 --> 00:11:10.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:13.155 --> 00:11:14.780
I didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.900
I really didn't
know whether people

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.441
were going to want
to do this or not.

00:11:17.441 --> 00:11:19.620
Maybe, like I said,
50,000 people would do it.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.790
But if you stay in touch
with the consumer--

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.695
and I do, personally.

00:11:23.695 --> 00:11:26.920
I take hundreds and hundreds
of emails and phone calls,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.682
and shake hands,
and talk to people.

00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:30.890
And I went through it myself.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:31.740
It's very authentic, right?

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.280
I do this.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.660
I live this lifestyle.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.290
So I know what's going
to aggravate people,

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.260
in a good way.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.480
I know what's going
to get them healthier,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.760
from my own experience.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.860
And if we keep doing that,
it just seems to work.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.470
JIM YOUNG: So what makes
successful people tick?

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.867
And so you wrote a
very interesting book

00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:51.700
called "Spartan Up!"

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.780
And some of you
may have read it.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.863
And I highly recommend it.

00:11:53.863 --> 00:11:55.420
It's a "New York
Times" bestseller.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.961
But you took some
of these concepts--

00:11:56.961 --> 00:12:00.010
and it's not just about the
athletic part and fitness.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.370
It's about the emotional state.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.664
It's about the mental state.

00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:06.080
Can you sort of walk us through
the book, what it's about,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.460
and what folks would glean
from it by reading it?

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.100
JOE DE SENA: What happened was,
early on, when I was building

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.750
these businesses, I would
bring in lots of employees,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.290
just like Google or any company.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.190
And it intrigued me, as it
probably does anybody running

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.970
a business, why some people were
amazing and others weren't, why

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.530
some people could commit, why
some people had motivation,

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.330
why some people
showed up, and didn't.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.440
And invariably, I found
Eastern Europeans or foreigners

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.870
in general were just
amazing employees for me

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.460
in the businesses
I was building.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.560
They didn't ask
about vacation time.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.320
They didn't ask about
getting paid more money.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.830
They really just
wanted more hours.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.871
They wanted to work more.

00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:47.890
That was a privilege for them.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.850
And I wanted to get to
the core of why that was.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.317
And was there a secret
sauce that we can then

00:12:53.317 --> 00:12:55.400
share with the rest of the
world so that everybody

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.660
could be that motivated?

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.030
And I think there is.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.479
Will people actually
follow it step by step?

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.020
I don't know.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.680
Some will.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.110
I mean, we've gotten an
amazing response from the book.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.340
It was a "New York Times"
number two bestseller.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.370
At the core of it is changing
your frame of reference.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.030
So how do you fight
for milk every day

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.160
when you've got an
abundance of milk?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.720
And for me, what I do is I do
300 burpees in the morning.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.560
They're terrible.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.850
It brings me back to
a third-world country.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.940
I want to escape, right?

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.970
I want to get back to
just not doing burpees.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.340
And I take a cold shower.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.080
And then the rest
of the day is easy.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.550
No matter what bad news you
get, you're not doing burpees.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.264
It's not so bad.

00:13:33.264 --> 00:13:34.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.570
JIM YOUNG: And you
wrote the book,

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.245
but you're looking
at different ways

00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:39.370
of getting the message out.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.520
And I heard earlier
that you're looking

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.480
at doing a podcast
for the people

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.147
to experience this
content more often

00:13:46.147 --> 00:13:47.480
and to have these conversations.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.116
Could you sort of get into
the "Spartan Up" podcast

00:13:51.116 --> 00:13:52.740
that's going to be
launched next month?

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.739
JOE DE SENA: So we started
spartanuppodcast.com,

00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:57.580
I believe, is our URL.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.420
And we've interviewed, in the
last three months, 115 people,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.460
people like Richard
Branson, the guy who

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.010
shot Bin Laden, the
CEO of Kodak, Twitter,

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.490
hopefully somebody at Google.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.390
And we just tried to
get to the core of what

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.740
made that person successful.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.240
As an example, interviewed
a person from Lebanon

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.380
the other day.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.540
And he's a multi-billionaire,
lives out in LA.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.420
His story is amazing.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.400
He was in Lebanon at a young
age in the mid-'70s doing really

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.350
well.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.180
And they kidnap him.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.350
Some people from Syria,
they hang him upside down,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.060
they beat him for 96 hours.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.700
He was definitely hallucinating.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.520
He escapes.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.092
They throw him out of Lebanon.

00:14:37.092 --> 00:14:38.050
He loses his employees.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.670
He loses his business.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.390
He lands in Geneva,
meets somebody

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.110
related to the Shah of Iran.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.152
They bring him into Iran.

00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:46.693
He rebuilds his
business and his life

00:14:46.693 --> 00:14:48.090
over the next three, four years.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.840
And then they kill a
bunch of his friends.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.350
They throw him out of Iran.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.830
He lands in LA, $17 in his
pocket, rebuilds his life.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.450
And now he's a
multi-billionaire here.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.640
Just went back to Lebanon
for the first time.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.650
How does that happen?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.550
How does that person
keep taking one step

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.050
and putting it in
front of the other

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.700
and then have such a great
demeanor and personality?

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.660
And maybe we can copy that.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.240
JIM YOUNG: So in
your course, you're

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.710
interviewing some
amazing people.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.040
But you also encounter
all walks of life.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.490
And do you ever get frustrated
in dealing with people that you

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.460
know can do more but aren't?

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.190
How do you deal
with that situation?

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.148
JOE DE SENA: Every day.

00:15:23.148 --> 00:15:24.370
Every day.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.280
Yeah, it's an
internal frustration.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.160
And I don't know.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.280
I have the ability
to motivate people.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.262
I just need them
to show up, which

00:15:32.262 --> 00:15:34.220
is why I think a lot of
friends don't visit me.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.650
Because I have a tendency
to rope them into things.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.650
I had one friend
show up once, who

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.600
had only ever biked 20 miles.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.720
And I said, come on,
let's go on a bike ride.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.780
We went 270 miles.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.880
He never visited again.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.322
He never came back.

00:15:50.322 --> 00:15:52.030
But I do have the
ability to get them out

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.790
on that first bike ride.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.820
JIM YOUNG: So I went to visit
Joe up in his place in Vermont.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.200
We got up at 0430.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.920
I think we were to
your place by 0530.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.450
And we do our
morning 300 burpees.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.030
In the back, he's got a
very unique, little mountain

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.755
that he's put in place
1,500 granite steps

00:16:09.755 --> 00:16:12.840
that you then do
after the 300 burpees.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.110
And so there's a
little shack on top.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.240
I got stuck halfway up.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.110
So down comes somebody who's
a friend of Joe and mine.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.560
I met him at this event.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.560
It's a guy named
Tony the Fridge.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.350
He carries a refrigerator on his
back and does ultra marathons.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.675
But anyway, Tony doesn't
lift or carry me.

00:16:31.675 --> 00:16:34.050
What he tells me is, you're
going to get up the mountain.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.110
Here's the technique you use.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.740
And he got me up, in tiny
steps, with my head up.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.842
And I was in severe pain.

00:16:39.842 --> 00:16:41.550
They were waiting on
the top of mountain.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.780
They don't stop until
the last person's up.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.120
And I'll never forget that.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.980
Between the morning
workout and that,

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.104
he's basically got
me back on that path.

00:16:50.104 --> 00:16:52.770
Because I'd become a Googler who
sits in front of a computer way

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.710
too often.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.880
And so this has
sort of re-energized

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.071
me to get back in it, sort
of like your Wall Street

00:16:58.071 --> 00:16:58.570
experience.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.490
So I thank you for that.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.280
Now, you're involved
in a lot of stuff.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.880
And I know you're focusing
on the Spartan Race

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.588
and building out.

00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:06.329
But you also have
some new endeavors,

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.240
like the 431 Project.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.670
And I'm wearing
that T-shirt here.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.935
Can you tell us a little bit
about it, what it's about,

00:17:13.935 --> 00:17:15.560
what problems you're
trying to address,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.311
and how maybe Googlers and
people across the world--

00:17:18.311 --> 00:17:19.310
JOE DE SENA: Could help?

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:19.740
JIM YOUNG: --could help.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.190
Exactly.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.940
JOE DE SENA: Yeah.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.030
So back in 431 BC, we
stumbled upon this concept

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.420
of the four elements--
earth, air, water, fire.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.740
And so it got me thinking,
today's four elements

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.170
are like computers,
cellphone, doughnut, couch.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.760
And can we get kids,
who are expected

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.480
to live five years less than
the current generation, healthy?

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.770
Can we get them back immersed
in those four elements?

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.947
And to do that, I
thought, we have

00:17:43.947 --> 00:17:45.780
to get a bunch of
influential people around.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.529
And you showed up.

00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:48.480
Tony the Fridge showed up.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.030
148 other people showed up.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.104
And we sat around,
like a think tank,

00:17:53.104 --> 00:17:54.270
and said, how do we do this?

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.710
And so we've already come up
with some really cool and neat

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:57.210
ideas.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.020
And the idea is to
get kids moving.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.790
To give you a
background on my kids--

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.290
and don't call social
services-- but my kids

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.090
will do kung fu every
day for an hour.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:12.200
They'll do wrestling practice
for an hour-- daughters, too.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.180
And my seven-year-old ran
the New York Marathon, when

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.290
he was eight years old,
ran the Boston Marathon.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.841
So kids can do a lot
more than we ask of them.

00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:25.840
JIM YOUNG: And one of the
speakers at this event

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.636
was Winter--

00:18:26.636 --> 00:18:27.760
JOE DE SENA: Yeah, Vinecki.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.620
JIM YOUNG: --Vinecki, who's
run a marathon on all seven

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.120
continents.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.210
She's 15.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.030
Absolutely amazing.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.040
I highly encourage you to
go on to their website that

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.950
has all the YouTube
videos of these speakers.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.170
It's fascinating to cover
everybody from Winter

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.415
to some of the health
and nutrition folks

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:45.450
that are folks doing studies.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.510
And I know McKinsey
just put out a report

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:53.800
saying that worldwide obesity
is now a $2 trillion problem.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.610
So obesity is going
to surpass starvation

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.330
as a worldwide problem.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.930
And Joe is trying
to help address that

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.510
through this Project 431 and
getting kids moving again.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.650
So when we're up there,
we started a new tradition

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.390
on the last day.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.270
And you may or may not
recall what it was.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.304
So in the military, you
get a challenge coin,

00:19:13.304 --> 00:19:14.720
in which case, you
have to present

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.295
each other with
a challenge coin.

00:19:16.295 --> 00:19:18.170
And if the person
doesn't have it,

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.810
they have to do
something for you.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.830
So to this day, Joe gave
these up at the Project 431

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.750
the last day.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.220
I carry this with
me at all times.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.450
If I present it to somebody
who was also there,

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.552
Joe, and he doesn't have his
challenge rock in return--

00:19:33.552 --> 00:19:34.760
JOE DE SENA: I don't have it.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.290
JIM YOUNG: What
do we have to do?

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:36.900
JOE DE SENA: You got to tell me.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.190
I don't know.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.390
JIM YOUNG: We have
to do 20 burpees.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.100
JOE DE SENA: All
right, let's do them.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.935
JIM YOUNG: So we're
going to 20 burpees.

00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:43.435
And we're going to get energized
for our Question and Answer

00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:43.550
period.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.210
JOE DE SENA: You guys in?

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.630
JIM YOUNG: You guys in?

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.730
Who's in?

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:45.280
JOE DE SENA: We got to do it.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:45.780
Let's do it.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.644
JIM YOUNG: Let's
do it as a group.

00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:49.632
JOE DE SENA: Let's do it.

00:19:49.632 --> 00:19:50.470
Exercise one.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:55.450
Two.

00:19:58.438 --> 00:20:01.424
Three.

00:20:01.424 --> 00:20:01.924
Four.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.396
Five.

00:20:08.396 --> 00:20:08.896
Six.

00:20:11.882 --> 00:20:12.382
Seven.

00:20:15.368 --> 00:20:15.868
Eight.

00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:22.342
Nine.

00:20:22.342 --> 00:20:23.836
And 20.

00:20:23.836 --> 00:20:27.820
[PANTING]

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.314
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:29.314 --> 00:20:31.804
JIM YOUNG: [GRUNTS] Well done.

00:20:31.804 --> 00:20:32.370
OK.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.810
Let's go ahead-- bring
those chairs back in,

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.980
and we'll do a little
Question and Answer.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.460
AUDIENCE: So I can maybe
start with one from the Dory.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.520
And the first
question is, what's

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.220
the one thing that makes you
go after you've hit a wall?

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.062
How can we apply this
to our daily lives?

00:20:47.062 --> 00:20:49.270
JOE DE SENA: One foot in
front of the other basically

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.487
is the trick.

00:20:51.487 --> 00:20:52.820
Everybody's going to hit a wall.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.236
And so what I like to do--
this morning, I went for a run.

00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:57.130
I did my workout, and
then I went for a run.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.760
And I ran to a point where
I kind of hit a wall.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.320
I didn't feel like
going anymore.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.130
Then I had to turn
around and get back.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:08.180
So I purposely make
sure I hit walls a lot.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.960
And you'd be surprised how
you can move that wall.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.880
I think we live in a
little, small boxes.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.920
And we don't really
test ourselves.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.440
And so it's important
that we go out and do

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.491
some of these things
that might sound crazy.

00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.080
But I think they
only sound crazy,

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.880
because normal gets
worse each year.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.500
We all like comfort.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.860
And because we like comfort and
there's all these advancements

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:39.770
in technology, normal is moving
those walls closer to us.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.205
And a lot of people don't
want to hit the wall,

00:21:42.205 --> 00:21:43.230
if that makes sense.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.480
JIM YOUNG: This is real water.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.521
It's not a hallucination.

00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:47.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.600
Thank you.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.541
JOE DE SENA: Thanks.

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:50.290
AUDIENCE: Hi, Joe.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:50.740
JOE DE SENA: Hi.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.323
AUDIENCE: It's a
pleasure to meet you.

00:21:52.323 --> 00:21:53.930
JOE DE SENA: My pleasure.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.776
AUDIENCE: Spartan
changed my life.

00:21:55.776 --> 00:21:57.017
JOE DE SENA: How?

00:21:57.017 --> 00:21:57.600
AUDIENCE: How?

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.308
JOE DE SENA: How did
it change your life?

00:21:59.308 --> 00:22:04.014
AUDIENCE: I did my first Spartan
Beast in 2013, Sacramento.

00:22:04.014 --> 00:22:05.680
I didn't do any kind
of training for it.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.580
I just jumped in there.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.210
It was like jumping
with the wolves.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.920
I was, like, in pain for
maybe, like, two weeks.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.420
Yeah.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.620
It was the worst.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.500
JOE DE SENA: But it woke you up?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.586
AUDIENCE: It showed me what
I needed to do to train.

00:22:21.586 --> 00:22:23.210
And then I tried my
Trifecta this year.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.960
JOE DE SENA: Nice.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.120
AUDIENCE: And then this past
week, I just ran in Malibu.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.930
JOE DE SENA: Nice.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.470
AUDIENCE: And I got the battle
wounds to prove it, you know.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.000
JOE DE SENA: But you're hooked?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.650
You're hooked?

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.108
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'm hooked, hooked.

00:22:33.108 --> 00:22:35.070
I just keep coming
back for more.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.240
The question I wanted to
ask you is, I did the rope.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.260
I usually finish that obstacle.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.740
But this weekend, the top of
that rope was like butter.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.260
The majority of us
were just like--

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.800
JOE DE SENA: Sliding?

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.715
AUDIENCE: --sliding
right through it.

00:22:47.715 --> 00:22:48.870
I don't know why.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.750
I was all the way at the top.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.508
And I had my lace wrapped on
the top of one of the knots.

00:22:53.508 --> 00:22:55.132
All I had to do was
just pull myself up

00:22:55.132 --> 00:22:57.660
one more time, slap that bell.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.220
And just couldn't get
that grip, none of us.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:00.640
JOE DE SENA: Couldn't do it?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.140
AUDIENCE: We were
all just like, ah.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.120
And we'd be up there wiping
our hands and nothing.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.410
Tried it again,
slipped right through.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.850
Try it again, slipped
right through.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.970
So I just said, screw it, put
my hand up and just leap up

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:13.470
for it.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.844
And then right
when I did that, I

00:23:14.844 --> 00:23:17.416
was just going to be
falling all the down now.

00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:19.120
And then battle scars all over.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.680
JOE DE SENA: Did you go back up?

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.372
AUDIENCE: I tried it again.

00:23:22.372 --> 00:23:22.750
JOE DE SENA: Didn't do it?

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.090
AUDIENCE: No.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.510
No difference.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.343
JOE DE SENA: What time
did you go out there?

00:23:25.343 --> 00:23:26.260
What day was it?

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:26.670
AUDIENCE: It was a--

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:27.520
JOE DE SENA: Saturday?

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.395
AUDIENCE: --Saturday.

00:23:28.395 --> 00:23:31.394
We ran the 12:15 wave.

00:23:31.394 --> 00:23:33.310
JOE DE SENA: I had just
been at the rope climb

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.768
putting Vaseline
all over the rope.

00:23:34.768 --> 00:23:37.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:37.034 --> 00:23:38.597
AUDIENCE: I was
like, wait a minute.

00:23:38.597 --> 00:23:40.430
Because, like, why is
it so slippery up top?

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.810
JIM YOUNG: Be thankful he
didn't have the water hose.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:42.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:43.570
JOE DE SENA: I saw
on the registration

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.732
you were from Google.

00:23:44.732 --> 00:23:45.556
I did that.

00:23:45.556 --> 00:23:46.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.070
AUDIENCE: It was like nice and
dry all the way at the bottom.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.250
It was just at the top.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:49.310
JOE DE SENA: Every
other rope was dry.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.935
I couldn't believe
you picked that one.

00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:52.258
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.055 --> 00:23:55.596
You wanted to know
why, now you know.

00:23:58.134 --> 00:23:59.800
AUDIENCE: Just, I'm
honored to meet you.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.600
AUDIENCE: So there's one more
question on our Dory page.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.870
So from scaling the participants
from 40,000 to over a million,

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.340
what's been the biggest growing
pains for the organization,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.400
and any lessons
learned from that?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.670
JOE DE SENA: Technology.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.130
And that would be a
question for Google.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:24.830
I mean, we're stressed in
trying to quickly develop

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.110
all the technology required
in social, and registration,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.600
back end, CRM, just like
any company our size.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.960
That's been-- thank god we
have a lot of adventure,

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.610
racing types and
super athletes working

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:43.070
for us that will work 24 hours
a day, hallucination or not.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.270
And so that part-- I
can't say it's easy.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.810
That's the lesser of
the challenge for us.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.221
The larger challenge
has been technology.

00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:53.720
JIM YOUNG: Google might just
have a few cloud platforms that

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.100
can help out with scaling this.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.059
AUDIENCE: For me, the
obstacles in the Spartans

00:24:58.059 --> 00:24:59.433
were always kind
of the fun part.

00:24:59.433 --> 00:25:00.860
The running always sucks.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.850
Uphill always sucks.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.880
And the obstacles were
just that little nugget

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.920
that kind of keep you going
after the running parts, right?

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.490
Curious.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.531
Out of all the obstacles
you've seen, dealt with,

00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:14.440
thought of, what is one you'd
like to have that you can't?

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.030
JOE DE SENA: I love
the gladiators.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.480
I don't know if you remember
the gladiators at the end.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.500
I love the gladiators.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.080
But if we want to be a sport,
we've got to be consistent.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.690
And you can't take a chance
that a gladiator, one gladiator

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.434
is going to take a
guy out or a woman out

00:25:29.434 --> 00:25:31.350
right at the end when
they're about to finish.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.641
We used to have gladiators
standing at the finish line.

00:25:33.641 --> 00:25:36.550
So now you've spent two hours
getting through this thing.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.420
You've gone up and
down the rope 12 times.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.370
You finally got it.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.980
And then you get taken out
by a gladiator at the end.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.060
I loved it.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.012
But I don't think it
works for us being sport.

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:48.470
AUDIENCE: My former
office mate got

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.260
hit by a gladiator going
across the finish line

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.980
and broke his wrist.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.820
JOE DE SENA: There you go.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.320
AUDIENCE: And then,
as a programmer,

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.420
told our boss that he was super
excited to do it next year.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.890
And our boss was furious.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.210
So my question is,
how do you choose

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.820
the balance between
fitness-based obstacles--

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.150
like, anybody can--
well, not anybody,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.810
but you don't need a
lot of specific training

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.525
to pull a tire uphill.

00:26:12.525 --> 00:26:15.500
How do you balance that with
really skill-based things,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.370
like throwing a javelin, that
seems to be just a burpee fest?

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:26.300
JOE DE SENA: The operative
word there is "balance."

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.540
I get lots of emails
from the fast runners

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.230
that say, why do
you have to have

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.500
so many obstacles and
why so many heavy things?

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.420
I get lots of emails
from the strong people

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.415
that say, why do we have
to have so much running?

00:26:37.415 --> 00:26:38.790
People that are
talented at spear

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.300
throw want us to have
nine spear throws.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.980
So it's this balance of
kind of-- without sounding

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.880
terrible-- breaking everyone,
of getting everybody

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.030
uncomfortable
across the spectrum.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.500
And if we do that, then we've
really achieved our goal.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.230
Like, if I slowed a runner down,
speed up the heavier, fast guy,

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:05.220
or woman, and even trip up
the person that's really

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.690
talented at some of those
more technical obstacles,

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.890
then we've won.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.655
So that's the balance.

00:27:10.655 --> 00:27:12.030
AUDIENCE: How do
you best prepare

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.915
and how do you best
recover for the events?

00:27:13.915 --> 00:27:14.640
Do you have any advice?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.390
JOE DE SENA: It just
depends how committed

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.870
you are as far as
preparation goes.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.430
When I was really training
for my events-- and some

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.550
of the elites that
train for Spartan Race

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:27.870
will train no less than three
and a half, four hours a day.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.500
So that's committed, right?

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.020
And then if somebody says, look,
I don't have a lot of time.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.600
I can't spend that
much time doing this.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.920
And I'm not that fit.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.280
You can get out there just
by walking a mile a day

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.260
and doing 30 burpees
and 30 pull-ups.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.930
By the way, pull-ups scare
everybody, because they say,

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.120
I can't even do one pull-up.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.577
Do jump-ups.

00:27:47.577 --> 00:27:49.660
Literally, if you did 30
jump-ups a day every day,

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.076
and 30 burpees,
and walked a mile,

00:27:51.076 --> 00:27:53.027
you'd get through any
one of these events.

00:27:53.027 --> 00:27:55.360
You're not going to win them,
but you'll get through it.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.526
And you're still probably
going to be a little sore.

00:27:57.526 --> 00:27:58.960
That's a bonus.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.420
Recovery is ice
plunge, ice water.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.152
Not hot water, ice water.

00:28:03.152 --> 00:28:04.110
JIM YOUNG: Well, great.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.730
Well, we want to thank all the
Googlers that showed up today.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.729
We want to thank, especially,
some Googlers that

00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:13.100
helped out in the background--
Jonas and Sasha, Cliff,

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.160
helping out.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.310
And we've got something
special in store for you.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.810
So we're going to head
over to the Garfield area.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.130
And we've got our own little
Spartan Googler course set up.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.755
But first and
foremost, obviously, we

00:28:23.755 --> 00:28:26.010
want to thank Joe and
his team for coming today

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:30.490
and for sharing
with us his vision.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.574
Highly recommend his book.

00:28:31.574 --> 00:28:32.948
And then, of
course, the podcasts

00:28:32.948 --> 00:28:34.300
that are coming up in January.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.380
I highly recommend
those as well.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.510
So Joe, on behalf of Google,
we want to thank you.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.220
JOE DE SENA: Thanks
for having me.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.660
JIM YOUNG: And look
forward to everyone

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.900
over at the obstacle course.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.140
Thank you.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:42.973
JOE DE SENA: Thanks.

00:28:42.973 --> 00:28:46.090
