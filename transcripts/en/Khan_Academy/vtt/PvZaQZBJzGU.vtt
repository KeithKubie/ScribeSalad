00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:02.439
- [Instructor] We're told
that given that h prime

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:04.933
of negative four is equal to zero,

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:08.864
what is an appropriate
calculus-based justification

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:12.490
for the fact that h has a relative maximum

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.461
at x is equal to negative four?

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:16.811
So right over here,

00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:19.934
we actually have the
graph of our function h.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.144
This is the graph y is equal to h of x.

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:24.151
And we don't have graphed
the first derivative,

00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:26.178
but we do have graphed
the second derivative

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:29.578
right here in this orange
color, h prime prime.

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:30.565
So they're telling us,

00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:33.493
given that h prime of negative
four is equal to zero,

00:00:33.493 --> 00:00:35.907
so that's saying that given
that the first derivative

00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:37.811
at x equals negative
four is equal to zero,

00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:39.756
and you can see that the
slope of the tangent line

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:44.750
when x is equal to negative
four does indeed equal zero.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.435
So given that, what is a calculus-based,

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:52.092
let me underline that, a
calculus-based justification

00:00:52.092 --> 00:00:54.454
for the fact that h has a relative maximum

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.611
at x equals negative four?

00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:59.239
So this first one says
that the second derivative

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.424
at x equals negative four is negative.

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:04.108
Now, what does that tell us?

00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:07.315
If the second derivative is negative,

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:12.276
that means that the first
derivative is decreasing,

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:14.730
which is another way of
saying that we are dealing

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.219
with a situation where, at
least at x equals negative four,

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.302
we are concave downwards,

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:25.598
downwards, which means that
the general shape of our curve

00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:27.396
is going to look something like this

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:29.507
around x equals negative four.

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:33.423
And if the slope at x equals
negative four is zero,

00:01:33.423 --> 00:01:36.340
well, that tells us that,
yes, we indeed are dealing

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.809
with a relative maximum point.

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:41.856
If the second derivative
at that point was positive,

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:43.917
then we would be concave upwards.

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:46.215
And then if our derivative is zero there,

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:49.202
we'd say, okay, that's a
relative minimum point.

00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:51.671
But this is indeed true.

00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:55.091
The second derivative is negative
at x equals negative four,

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:57.035
which means we are concave downwards,

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.952
which means that we are a upside U,

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:03.194
and that point where
the derivative is zero

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:04.749
is indeed a relative maximum.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.526
So let me, so that is the answer.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.519
And we're done, but let's
just rule out the other ones.

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.850
H increase before x equals negative four.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.075
That is indeed true.

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:16.705
Before x equals negative
four, we are increasing,

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:18.281
and h decreases after it.

00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:21.890
That is true, and that is one
rationale for thinking that,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.296
hey, we must have a maximum point,

00:02:24.296 --> 00:02:26.208
assuming that our function is continuous

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:28.290
at x equals negative four.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.123
So this is true.

00:02:29.123 --> 00:02:31.439
It is a justification
for a relative maximum,

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.718
but it is not calculus-based.

00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:37.244
And so that's why we
can rule this one out.

00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:39.590
The second derivative
has a relative minimum

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.465
at x equals negative four.

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.729
Well, it does indeed seem to be true.

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.366
There's a relative minimum there,

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:48.461
but that's not a justification for why

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:51.761
this is why h of negative four

00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:55.448
or why we have a relative maximum
at x equals negative four.

00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:57.405
For example, this,

00:02:57.405 --> 00:03:01.631
you could have a relative minimum
in your second derivative,

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.030
but your second derivative
could still be positive there.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.761
So what if the second
derivative was like that?

00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:07.681
That would still be a relative minimum.

00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:09.671
But if it was positive at that point,

00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.795
then you would be concave upwards,

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.050
which would mean that at
x equals negative four,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.345
your original function
wouldn't have a maximum point,

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.097
it would have a minimum point.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.808
And so just a relative
minimum isn't enough.

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:22.296
In order to know that you are dealing

00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:24.834
with a relative maximum,
you would have to know

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:27.529
that the second derivative
is negative there.

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:31.234
Now, this fourth choice, h
prime prime is concave up,

00:03:31.234 --> 00:03:33.907
it does indeed look like
the second derivative

00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:38.515
is concave up, but that,
by itself, does not justify

00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:41.735
that the original function is concave up.

00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:44.713
For example, well, I could
use this example right here.

00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:47.341
This is a potential second derivative

00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:49.322
that is concave upwards,

00:03:49.322 --> 00:03:51.527
but it is positive the entire time.

00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:54.519
And if your second derivative
is positive the entire time,

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.174
that means that your first derivative

00:03:56.174 --> 00:03:58.154
is increasing the entire time,

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.670
which means that your original function

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.159
is going to be concave
upwards the entire time.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.725
And so if you're concave
upwards the entire time,

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:08.859
then you would not have a relative maximum

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.443
at x equals negative four.

00:04:10.443 --> 00:04:13.140
So we would rule that one out as well.
