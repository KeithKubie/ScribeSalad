00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.762
Good evening, and welcome.

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:25.448
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.660
Let me just start by saying
that the crowd tonight is

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.250
bigger than the crowd that
Paula Poundstone brought

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.820
in last night.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130
Good for you folks.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.440
Before I introduce
our speaker tonight,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.010
I just want to
mention that today

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.560
Adam Block, he does the
astronomy at Mount Lemmon

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.650
Science Center, has some
incredible photographs that he

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.990
has taken.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.210
And if you want to have the
photographs signed by him,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.720
you have to buy them today.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.440
So on the way out, he's
out there waiting for you

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.390
to buy all his photographs.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.070
They really are
truly extraordinary

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250
and just don't run out.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300
I always acknowledge
all of those folks that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.980
pay so that all of
us don't have to pay

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.676
to listen to our speakers.

00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:26.800
And today, I'd just like
to mention, in particular,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.770
the Galileo Circle.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.530
Each evening we do acknowledge
all of these folks.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.060
The Galileo Circle members
support the College of Science,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.420
and monies that they give to
the College of Science support

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.890
undergraduate students.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.910
And this year 80 students
were supported generously

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.040
because of the support
of these folks,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.590
and I thank you
very much for that.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.102
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.330
And I also want to
thank those of you that,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.190
because of the lecture series,
have joined the Galileo Circle.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.640
There were some of
you that did that.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.990
And I want to thank, indeed,
all of our donors, Galileo

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.580
Circle or not, for sharing our
vision for research excellence,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.411
novel teaching and outreach,
and creating opportunities

00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:17.160
for our community.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.522
Thank you very much.

00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:22.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.030
Many of you may have
been here last week

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.210
when Turner was
talking about some

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.920
of the heroes of cosmology.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.750
And he mentioned
that some of those

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.000
are actually here at the
University of Arizona.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.510
And he chuckled that they did
their research at Chicago,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.130
which was just a bad joke.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.530
But one of those is
actually sitting right here.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.536
David Arnett, would you
stand up for a second.

00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:50.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.790
And if it wasn't for
David Arnett research,

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.940
we really wouldn't know if
our universe was expanding,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.030
contracting, or whatnot,
because we really would

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.100
know how far these stars are.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.600
He was the one that was able to
figure out luminosity in stars

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.350
and how that could be used to
determine if they were moving

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.730
away from us or not.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.302
So David, good for you.

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:19.158
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.870
Well, today, we're going to hear
from one of my favorite faculty

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.230
members in the in the college,
Professor of Astronomy Phil

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.600
Pinto.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.470
Phil was heavily into
fire crackers, gunpowder,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.180
rocket engines, and all
things that are explosive.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.220
So it was natural that after his
undergraduate work at Harvard,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.320
he moved to the Lick
Observatory at UC Santa Cruz

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.330
to do graduate work on
supernova, the largest

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.350
explosions in the universe.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.960
And just as he was finishing his
dissertation, remarkably still

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.680
with all his fingers,
the brightest supernova

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.180
in 400 years exploded
in a nearby galaxy.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.000
Being at Santa Cruz, this
had nothing to do with pot.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.528
It was the real stuff.

00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:02.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.420
Phil shifted into high gear.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.570
And with his advisory,
published the first paper

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.790
describing that
supernova and went on

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.750
to study this Rosetta Stone
for astronomers of wavelengths,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.830
from the infrared to gamma rays.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.190
He has since published
over 120 papers

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.399
on the physics of
stellar explosions,

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.339
high-energy density
plasmas in the laboratory,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.960
techniques for computer
modeling in astrophysics,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.980
and most certainly
on the formation

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.690
of large-scale structures
in the universe.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.140
Phil is one of the founders
of the Large Synoptic Survey

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.260
Telescope.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.150
This is the most important
new endeavor in astronomy,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.130
as described by the National
Academy of Sciences.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.080
It's an 8.4-meter telescope,
whose primary mirror is

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.620
currently in fabrication here
at the Steward Observatory Lab.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.130
Phil will also be giving a
version of this talk on April

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.220
1st at the Mount
Lemmon Sky Center,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.140
followed by an
evening of viewing

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.510
many of the celestial
objects you'll be

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.420
seeing in this lecture today.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.250
You can find out more about
this event from Mount Lemon Sky

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.890
Center folks in the lobby.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.190
And please help me welcome
Professor Phil Pinto.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.618
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:16.578
Great.

00:05:16.578 --> 00:05:17.078
Thank you.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.370
Good evening.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.650
For those of you who have been
here in the last few lectures,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.430
I hope you believe by now the
universe began in a big bang

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.397
about a little less than
14 billion years ago.

00:05:35.397 --> 00:05:37.730
And I thought I'd just give
you a little reprise of what

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.460
we've learned so far.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.070
The universe began in an
unimaginably hot, unimaginably

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.090
tiny and dense knot and
expanded from much less

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.350
than the size of a
proton in much less

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.390
than a fraction of a second
up to a macroscopic size.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.830
The expansion slowed
down somewhat after that

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.170
and continued for the
next 400,000 years.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.080
The universe
expanded and cooled.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.340
And eventually it got down
to about 5,000 degrees.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.010
As Mike Turner told us
last time, at that point,

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.170
the protons and the electrons
in the gas began to recombine.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.320
And he showed us that it
made the universe become

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.200
transparent, but there
was nothing to see,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.420
and so this is the dark ages.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.660
Well, the universe
continued to expand.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.060
Matter began to clump together
under its own gravity.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.160
And eventually, it formed
about 100 million years later,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.380
the first stars.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.000
And since that time,
stars and galaxies

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.400
have been forming continuously.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.900
The peak rate of
that star formation

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.691
was about half the age
of the universe ago,

00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:38.710
about 7 billion years ago.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.270
And the universe has continued
to expand and cool ever since.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.450
And most recently,
we've been seeing

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.770
the effect of dark energy,
causing the universe

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.820
to expand ever more rapidly.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.470
And that leads us to today and
the subject of our lecture--

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.650
the contents of the cosmos.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.880
Now, we've talked a
lot in this series

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.900
about how we don't know
a lot about the contents

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.560
of the universe.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.972
Dark energy was only
discovered in the 1990s,

00:07:07.972 --> 00:07:09.680
and yet it composes
most of the universe.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.710
And we don't know where it
comes from or what it is.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.990
Dark matter's been around
for the last 30 years

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.860
or so, in our knowledge, and
we still don't know what it is.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.094
And together they make
up 95% of the universe.

00:07:24.094 --> 00:07:25.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.248
But tonight, I'm here to talk
about the 5% that we do know--

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:30.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.200
--basically everything in the
universe that we can see around

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200
us and the material, the kind
of normal matter that you

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.990
and I and planets and
stars are made of.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.020
And so of that 5%,
almost all of it

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.180
is just hydrogen and helium gas
that comes out of the Big Bang.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.020
Stars, the stuff we look
out and see as astronomers,

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.140
comprise only half a
percent of the universe.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.990
The next third of a
percent is composed

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.740
of neutrinos, tiny
particles that travel

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.810
at nearly the speed of light.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.810
And they interact very,
very weakly with matter.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.050
These neutrinos can actually
pass right through the Earth

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.521
with hardly ever noticing it.

00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:08.770
And we're not going to talk
about neutrinos quite yet,

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.186
but they'll play
a very major role

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:13.030
later on in the discussion.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.070
And finally, we get to tonight's
topic, the heavy elements.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.700
Heavy to an astronomer
means an element

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.310
that's not hydrogen or helium--
carbon, nitrogen, silicon,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.780
oxygen, uranium,
everything else.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.350
And they make up only 1/30
of 1% of the universe.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.460
So you can either think of
that as a terribly small detail

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.830
or as very special, right?

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.736
I prefer to think
that quality is

00:08:35.736 --> 00:08:36.944
more important than quantity.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.400
So now some of you have gasped.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.150
But you'll all remember
the periodic table

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.980
from your high school
chemistry course.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.180
And this lays out the elements.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.230
The elements, as you remember,
are the basic building blocks

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.746
of matter.

00:08:52.746 --> 00:08:56.390
And here's a rather
fanciful diagram of an atom.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.470
And each of the
elements is composed

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.670
of atoms of a given kind.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.740
And here in our carbon
atom, we have a nucleus,

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.090
and remember Mike Turner told
us that protons are always red

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.404
and neutrons are always blue.

00:09:08.404 --> 00:09:10.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.020
So here we have the nucleus
with six protons in red.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.110
And the six protons
mean that it's carbon.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.840
Each element has a
fixed number of protons

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.900
that say what the nuclear
charge of that element

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.820
is and gives it its name.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.940
It also has six neutrons.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.944
And if you add the 6 and 6,
even I can come up with 12,

00:09:28.944 --> 00:09:29.860
and this is carbon-12.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.460
And we'll get back
to that in a minute.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.810
Surrounding the atom are
a bunch of electrons.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.460
And atoms join together
to form molecules

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.840
and all the substances around
us by sharing electrons.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.910
But that's chemistry.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.200
I don't know anything
about chemistry.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.741
So we're going to
stick to the nuclei

00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:46.710
and find out where
the nuclei come from

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.050
and leave what happens
later to the chemists.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.920
Now, I mentioned we
had carbon-12 there.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.570
And that's an example of an
isotope-- the same number

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.710
of protons, because
the number of protons

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.940
tells you what element it
is, but different numbers

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.580
of neutrons.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.290
So for example, here's
some hydrogen isotopes.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.200
Plain hydrogen is
just one proton.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.640
That's almost all the
hydrogen in the universe.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.285
It does come in another flavor,
however, with one neutron,

00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:12.243
and that's called deuterium,
or heavy hydrogen.

00:10:12.243 --> 00:10:14.610
And there's still a third one.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.370
It's got two neutrons
and a proton,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.090
but you rarely see that
because it decays radioactively

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.560
in about 12 years, and
so it's quite rare.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.510
It's called tritium.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.040
Helium also has isotopes.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.280
Most elements of isotopes.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.810
And helium isotopes we'll
be talking about tonight

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.340
are the light helium--
two protons and a neutron,

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.670
helium helium-3.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.730
And helium-4 is the
normal kind of helium,

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.200
two protons and two
neutrons-- so isotopes,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.851
or same number of protons,
different number of neutrons.

00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:50.350
Now, while we're doing a little
bit of a physics class here,

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.810
I want to talk about one
more thing that's important,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.530
and that is heat.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.480
What we macroscopically
think of as heat

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.009
is microscopically the
motion of particles.

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:00.550
And for tonight's
talk, the particles

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.000
will be the nuclei or
the atoms in a gas.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.910
And so a cold gas is a bunch
of particles whizzing around.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.830
But they're not whizzing
around very fast.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.413
And they don't collide
all that often.

00:11:10.413 --> 00:11:13.240
And when they do collide, they
don't collide that hard, right?

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.670
But if you heat that gas
up, they whiz faster.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.990
They collide more frequently.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.570
And when they collide, they
collide more energetically.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.350
So cold gas is low speed,
fewer, weaker, collisions.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.610
Hot gas is higher speeds,
more and stronger collisions.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.360
Enough of physics.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.200
Let's try doing some astronomy.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:37.100
So let's, ask where did all this
stuff, the carbon, the oxygen,

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.620
the uranium, iron, all the
elements other than hydrogen

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.740
and helium, where
do they come from?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.522
Well, we might try
with the Big Bang.

00:11:43.522 --> 00:11:45.980
You might ask, did the Big Bang
produce that sort of stuff?

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.580
It produced all
the rest of matter.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.377
Why shouldn't it have done that?

00:11:49.377 --> 00:11:51.710
And we can try looking at
nucleosynthesis, the synthesis

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.300
of nuclei, in the Big Bang.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.950
The way we start is to measure
the temperature of the universe

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.960
today.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.000
And as Chris and Mike
have both told you,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.290
that's about three
degrees above absolute 0,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.120
minus 454 Fahrenheit.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.401
So space is pretty cold.

00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:07.150
And that's the cosmic
microwave background

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.670
that the WMAP
satellite measured.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.730
We can also measure the
density of universe,

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.880
go out and measure the number of
stars, the number of galaxies,

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.320
the gas between the stars,
take all that mass that we see,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.610
smear it all out, and
on average, the universe

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.090
contains about one
atom per cubic meter.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.150
So the universe is very empty.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.780
So now we can run
the universe backward

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.662
and see what can be made.

00:12:31.662 --> 00:12:33.870
This is what's really neat
about being an astronomer.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.007
Honey, what did you do
today at the office?

00:12:36.007 --> 00:12:37.340
Oh, I ran the universe backward.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.520
So back about three
minutes after the Big Bang,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.900
the temperature's about
a billion degrees,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.330
and the density
of the universe is

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.780
about like the air in this
room, about a thousandth

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.850
of a gram per cubic centimeter.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.300
The universe is a
sea of particles,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.210
in particular protons
and neutrons, the red

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.175
and blue particles
that we know about.

00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:01.050
And they're whizzing
around because it's hot.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.008
It's a billion degrees.

00:13:02.008 --> 00:13:04.860
And hot gas has the
particles whizz around fast.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.960
And some of these protons and
neutrons collide together,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.820
and occasionally they stick
and they form a heavy hydrogen,

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.900
a deuterium nucleus.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.730
And they give off some energy.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.150
And Mike forgot to note
that energy is always

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.626
depicted by green squiggles.

00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:20.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.350
Those are photons.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.440
Now, once enough
deuterium is built up,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.010
the deuteriums can collide
together, throw off a neutron,

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.990
and stick and form
some helium-3.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.540
And some of that helium-3 can
collide with another deuteron

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.807
and throw off a proton
and form helium-4.

00:13:39.807 --> 00:13:41.390
So there are lots
of particles running

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.977
around colliding into each
other, making new nuclei.

00:13:44.977 --> 00:13:46.560
And basically, any
way you could think

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.220
of putting those
particles together

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.303
is actually happening there
in the early universe,

00:13:50.303 --> 00:13:52.860
in the first few minutes.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.680
And if you do a careful
calculation of all this,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.920
what you come up with is that,
depending upon how much stuff

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.220
is in the universe, you make
a certain amount of helium,

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.730
a certain amount of deuterium,
a certain amount of helium-3,

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.460
and a certain amount of the
very light isotope of lithium-7.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.392
If you put in the numbers
that we observed today

00:14:13.392 --> 00:14:14.850
for the density
and the temperature

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.620
I talked about, what you
find is exactly what you

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.350
see when you go out and
measure how much helium there

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.470
is coming out of the Big Bang.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.690
And this is one of the real
triumphs for the Big Bang

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:25.190
theory.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.740
It was able to predict
the composition

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.410
of the universe, at least in
terms of the light elements

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.430
that we see today.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.010
It makes about 24% helium.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.160
Excuse me, my microphone
is falling off here.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.230
It makes about 24% helium.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.270
Most of the rest is
hydrogen and trace amounts

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.780
of these other light isotopes.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.821
But it's a great triumph
for the Big Bang theory.

00:14:46.821 --> 00:14:48.650
It's horrible for us.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.080
Where's all the elements?

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.200
Where did all these
other elements come from?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.140
So it didn't happen
in the Big Bang.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.390
We've got to look elsewhere.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.745
So let's look for some clues.

00:14:59.745 --> 00:15:01.120
The first thing
we ought to do is

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.440
figure out what is it we're
actually trying to make.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.290
What are all these elements?

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.705
So we could look at the Earth.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:08.080
And when we look
at the Earth, we

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.430
find it's made mostly of oxygen
and silicon, calcium, and iron,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.610
maybe a little bit of
potassium and aluminum,

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.660
sodium-- things that make rocks.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.790
As you might imagine, the
Earth is made of rocks.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.830
All these other
elements, some of which

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:28.564
you may have heard the names
of, are in much lower abundance,

00:15:28.564 --> 00:15:30.230
all the way out to
uranium at the corner

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.330
there, which is the heaviest
naturally occurring element.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.680
We could also look
at the human body.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.410
A 70-kilogram adult
contains mostly oxygen,

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.430
a fair amount of
carbon and hydrogen,

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.430
little bit of nitrogen, calcium,
and pretty much all the rest

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.570
are vitamins, right?

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.370
And you know that's a
rather different sample

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.420
than the Earth.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.020
Oxygen actually is the most
abundant element in your body

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.120
as well as in the Earth.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.450
But where is all that iron?

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.630
Where's all that silicon?

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.040
We're not rocks.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.072
And so this is a
different set of elements.

00:16:08.072 --> 00:16:09.280
So we don't want this either.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.927
This is not a representative
sample of the universe.

00:16:12.927 --> 00:16:15.510
What we really need to do is do
what astronomers do, is go out

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.770
and look at the outer
layers of stars,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:22.040
look at the gas between stars,
and look at its composition

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.610
and measure the
composition of rocks

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.335
that fall to Earth from
outer space-- meteorites.

00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:28.610
And when you do that,
you put it all together,

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.410
you find this pattern here.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.190
The universe is mostly
hydrogen and helium.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.760
The next most
abundant element is

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.360
oxygen followed by carbon and
closely by iron, nitrogen,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.630
and then all the rest
trailing off down here, again,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.027
toward gold and uranium
at the bottom end.

00:16:47.027 --> 00:16:48.610
So the question for
tonight really is,

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.770
how do we get from here, what
came out of the Big Bang,

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.320
to here, what we're made
of, or at least what

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.510
the solar system is made of?

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.460
Well, one clue is
that the oldest stars

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.109
are very deficient in
these heavy elements.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.650
If you look at their
several thousand

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.640
older stars near the
Sun, you see some of them

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.930
here have almost no
heavy elements at all.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.410
They're almost pure
hydrogen and helium.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.550
And even a fair number
of them have only 1%

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.819
the amount of heavy
elements that the sun has.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:25.200
So these stars must have formed
before the heavy elements were

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.540
made in the universe.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.540
They must have formed out of
some primordial material that

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.080
hadn't been enriched
yet by whatever process

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.360
we're looking for tonight.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.420
So much of nucleosynthesis must
have occurred since the oldest

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.090
stars were formed.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.750
Another clue is that
the Sun has been

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.181
shining for 4.3 billion years.

00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:45.680
It doesn't seem
like much of a clue,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.232
but it'll become very
important in a moment.

00:17:48.232 --> 00:17:49.690
And if you look at
this photograph,

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.605
you'll notice that there
that's not a sunspot.

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:54.980
That's the space
shuttle Atlantis

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.450
coming into dock with the
International Space Station.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.930
It's an incredible
photograph taken

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.221
by a French amateur astronomer.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.200
So if you think the formation of
elements has to do with stars,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.040
you're right.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.180
So let's talk a little
bit about how stars work.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.570
Here's a wonderful image
from the Hubble Space

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.460
Telescope of some cold,
dense clouds of gas.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.560
That's these things
depicted in brown.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.950
And they are in the
process of forming stars.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.340
Clumps of gas
inside these clouds

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.900
are separating out and
beginning to contract

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.370
into their own gravity.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.220
As they contract, they
compress the gas in them.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.460
And of course, gas when
you compress it, heats up.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.090
And so they continue
to collapse.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.920
They continue to
contract and heat up

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.940
until they get to be
hot enough to shine

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.625
in the visible part
of the spectrum.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.250
At this point, we
call them protostars.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.340
They're almost
stars but not quite.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.450
And when they do
that, their light

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.170
begins to erode the
gas around them.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.680
And you can see all these
wispy streamers coming off,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.830
the white-colored
stuff coming off here,

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.030
into the warmer gas
surrounding, as this gas is

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.840
being blown away, revealing
these new stars that

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.524
are being formed.

00:19:06.524 --> 00:19:08.940
And here's another image of a
similar star-forming region.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.420
And this is not a
painting, right?

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.454
This is a real Hubble
Space Telescope image.

00:19:13.454 --> 00:19:14.370
It's quite remarkable.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.120
And here's another dark cloud.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.200
You can see it going
diagonally across the image.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.800
And those little stars in the
middle among the green stuff,

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.070
those are brand new stars,
only a few hundred thousand

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.424
or a million or so years old.

00:19:34.087 --> 00:19:35.420
So we've got our protostar here.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.210
It's collapsing.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.649
It's getting hot.

00:19:37.649 --> 00:19:39.190
If you want to make
a star out of it,

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.250
it's got to stop collapsing.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.166
It's got to sit there.

00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:43.790
It's got to last
for a long time.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.580
So to balance the gravity
pulling the gas in,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.150
we need to have something to
push it back at the gravity

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:51.380
and keep the star in balance.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.020
And that forces pressure-- it's
the pressure of the hot gas

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:55.810
inside.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.997
All those particles are
whizzing around its heat.

00:19:57.997 --> 00:20:00.080
They collide into each
other, and those collisions

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.900
create pressure.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.970
So once our star has
contracted enough

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.160
and warmed up enough
inside, there's

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.306
enough pressure for
that outward force

00:20:09.306 --> 00:20:10.930
to balance the inward
force of gravity,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.680
and the star's in
hydrostatic equilibrium.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.720
But the star has a problem.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.100
And this problem is absolutely
key to understanding

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.180
how stars work.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.210
And it goes like this.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.540
A star loses energy by shining.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.870
Are you with me?

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.590
Stars shine.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.170
Internal energy is what supports
the star against gravity.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.250
So we're losing some
of this energy that's

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.510
supporting the star.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.027
Losing that energy
reduces the pressure,

00:20:40.027 --> 00:20:41.568
and that causes the
star to contract.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.210
If the star contracts, it
makes gravity in the star

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.540
stronger because you're putting
all that mass closer together.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.090
So now what happens to the
gas if it gets put in a higher

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.050
gravitational field?

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.630
Well, we can go look at the
solar system for a clue.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.650
Here's a schematic--
a very bad schematic--

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.660
of the solar system.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.480
If we go in closest
to the Sun, Mercury

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.980
is there, traveling
at 50 kilometers

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.880
a second around the Sun.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.860
It's very close.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.364
The gravity is
very strong there.

00:21:09.364 --> 00:21:10.780
If we go further
out to the Earth,

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.677
where the gravity
isn't as strong,

00:21:14.677 --> 00:21:17.010
the Earth is only moving
around the Sun at 30 kilometers

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.680
a second.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.920
If we go even further out,
all the way to Jupiter,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.400
where the gravity
is even weaker,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.772
it's traveling at 13
kilometers a second.

00:21:25.772 --> 00:21:27.230
So what you can
take away from this

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:31.000
is the stronger the gravity,
the faster the particles move.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.310
It doesn't matter if particles
are planets or atoms in a gas.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.400
So let's go back to our star.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.610
When the gravity gets stronger,
the particles in the gas

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.240
move faster.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.230
So what's faster
moving gas, faster

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.120
moving particles in a gas?

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.090
Heat.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:56.760
That makes the star hotter,
which makes it shine brighter.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.500
So you can see the problem.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.578
It's a vicious circle.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.280
The more energy it loses, the
hotter it gets, the brighter it

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.640
shines, and the faster
it loses energy.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.930
Now this was recognized
back in the mid-19th century

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.210
by Kelvin in England and
Helmholtz in Germany.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.230
And this was actually
a good thing,

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.050
they thought, because they
were wondering-- the geologists

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.170
at the time were saying, gee,
the Earth is several hundred

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.130
million years old at least.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.370
And people asked, what kept
the Sun shining for so long?

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.870
They didn't know about
what we know today.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.520
And so Kelvin and
Helmholtz suggested

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.400
that this is a way to
convert gravity into light

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.920
and make the Sun shine.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.040
But then in about 1910,
Sir Arthur Eddington,

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.691
an astronomer in
England, computed

00:22:44.691 --> 00:22:46.690
this would only last for
about 30 million years.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.640
And by that time, the
geologists had figured out

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.380
the Earth was at least
a billion years old.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.588
So there was something wrong.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.040
And in 1938, Hans
Bethe figured out

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.970
what that something
wrong was and figured

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.750
out how to make the Sun shine.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:06.000
And it provides a temporary, at
least, solution for our star.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.970
So this happens very much
like in the Big Bang.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.195
Inside the star, once the
star is contracted and warmed

00:23:12.195 --> 00:23:14.280
up enough-- in this
case of the Sun,

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.980
about 15 million
degrees-- protons

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.370
whack together, form deuterium.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.920
Another proton can
add on, form helium-3.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.730
Two helium-3s can collide,
kick off a couple of protons

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.620
and make helium-4, much
like in the Big Bang.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.180
And then that process converts
four hydrogens to one helium-4

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.170
and releases energy.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.395
And that energy is what makes up
for the energy lost by the star

00:23:42.395 --> 00:23:43.150
as it's shining.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.861
Bethe won the Nobel Prize
in Physics in 1967 for this,

00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:51.110
because that's actually a
pretty significant problem--

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.180
why does the Sun shine?

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.210
That deserves a Nobel prize.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.130
So how does this work?

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.820
How do we get
energy out of that?

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:03.130
Well, it turns out four protons
by themselves weigh about 3%

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:07.910
more than when they're bound
together in a helium nucleus.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.880
And when those
four protons fuse,

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.360
the difference between the mass
of the four protons themselves

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.330
and the mass as helium, that
3%, is converted into energy.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.180
Remember E equals MC squared?

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.540
Mass and energy are equivalent,
as Einstein told us.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.770
Now, that 3% doesn't
seem like very much.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.270
But it's actually quite a lot.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.030
If you take four pounds of
hydrogen, this much, and fuse

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.970
it, you get the
energy out of burning

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:37.810
a billion gallons of gasoline
or a million tons of TNT.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.470
So it's actually a
very effective way

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.780
to produce energy.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.540
So stars shine by
nuclear fusion,

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.520
this process of fusing
atoms together and making

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.860
heavier atoms out of them.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.260
And the Sun fuses
about 630 million tons

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.560
of hydrogen per second.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.290
Over on the other side there is
the Castle Bravo Nuclear Test.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.700
That was an early
nuclear test in 1954

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.070
in the South Pacific
on Bikini Atoll.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.350
And 60 pounds of hydrogen
were fused in an instant,

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.850
and it released 15
megatons of energy.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.100
So you might ask yourself,
why doesn't the Sun blow up

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.320
the same way as that bomb?

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.950
Well, the Sun is contracted
and heated up just

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.960
until there was enough burning
to provide enough pressure

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.810
to counteract gravity.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.050
If you were to make it
burn a little faster,

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.480
it would expand, cool down, and
the burning would slow down.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.930
So there's a nice
thermostat that

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.934
keeps the star doing
just what you hope.

00:25:36.934 --> 00:25:39.350
Over here, to make a bomb,
that's not what you want to do.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.480
You want to heat the stuff up
so much, that it all burns,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.065
all fuses.

00:25:43.065 --> 00:25:43.940
I talk about burning.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.190
I don't mean chemical burning.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.660
I mean nuclear fusion.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.640
It burns so fast, that it
all goes up in an instant,

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.920
and that's what you
want for a bomb.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.320
But to get that to happen
in the nuclear test,

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.740
they had to heat the
hydrogen in that bomb

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.850
to 300 million degrees.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.442
The Sun is only 15 million
degrees in its core.

00:26:01.442 --> 00:26:02.900
So that's why the
Sun isn't a bomb.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:08.135
It's a gradual
thermonuclear reactor.

00:26:08.135 --> 00:26:10.010
But I said that this
was a temporary solution

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.190
to our star's problem.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.710
And it is.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.334
Eventually, the star's
going to run out

00:26:15.334 --> 00:26:18.150
of hydrogen. It's
not going to have

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.810
any fuel left in the center.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.370
So the Sun is 4.3 billion
years old at the moment.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.030
You don't have to
worry about it.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.710
It's not going to
run out of fuel yet.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.680
It's going to last another
seven billion years or so.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.930
And a star that's 5%
as massive as the Sun

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.430
will last more than a trillion
years, which is forever

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.200
to anybody but a cosmologist.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.840
But consider a star that's a
lot more massive than the Sun,

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.020
maybe 25 times the
mass of the Sun.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.500
It's got a lot more gravity.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.640
It needs a lot more pressure
to balance that gravity,

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.300
so it's got to be a
lot hotter inside.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.430
If it's a lot hotter, it
shines a lot brighter,

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.200
and it has to burn
its fuel faster

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.510
to make up for that lost energy.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.420
So it turns out that a
massive star will run out

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.130
of fuel in something like 10
million years, which is almost

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.720
an eye-blink to an astronomer.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.570
And so when it runs out of
fuel, what's it going to do?

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.790
It's going to start
contracting again and heat up.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.123
That's the only thing it can do.

00:27:12.123 --> 00:27:15.550
That's its problem again.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.260
And when it heats
up enough, maybe

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.580
above 100 million degrees,
and density's over 1,000

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.130
grams per cubic centimeter
as it contracts,

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.710
it gets hot enough to
fuse helium together

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.910
to make this
isotope beryllium-8.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:32.210
So two heliums collide
together, make up beryllium-8.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.390
Beryllium-8 then gets hit
by helium-4 making a carbon.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.530
Helium-4 hits the
carbon to make oxygen.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.910
So now finally, we're making
some familiar elements--

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.170
carbon and oxygen.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.792
So why, you ask, didn't
this happen in the Big Bang?

00:27:46.792 --> 00:27:49.670
Well, it turns out
beryllium-8 is very unstable.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.310
When you make it, when you
whack two heliums together,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.680
the beryllium that forms
wants to break back up

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.580
into two heliums.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.390
It wants to do so so fast,
that it only lasts for about 10

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.545
to the minus 21 seconds.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.210
And in the Big Bang,
it wasn't very dense

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.550
and there weren't enough
reactions, weren't enough

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.920
collisions for helium
to hit the beryllium

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.850
before it decided to break
up again into 2 heliums.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.400
In our star now, though,
it's a million times

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.040
denser than the Big Bang.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.100
And so sometimes,
at least, there's

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.020
a helium around ready
waiting to hit that beryllium

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.070
before it decays.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:30.180
And so this is
how helium burning

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.660
can produce carbon
and oxygen. And that

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.750
again, solves the star's problem
for a certain amount of time.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.170
Now, when the Sun
runs out of helium,

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.250
it will, of course, start
contracting and heating up.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.200
But before it actually
gets to the point

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.800
where the carbon atoms
can start fusing together,

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.720
it will actually
form a solid, a kind

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.400
of a solid out of that carbon
and oxygen in the middle.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.910
And that solid will
provide pressure

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.830
that solves the problem
of the star forever.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:02.050
It doesn't need heat anymore to
keep the pressure up and resist

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.180
gravity.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.460
And so once that happens, the
outside layers of the star

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.530
keep burning for a while.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.597
They run out of fuel eventually.

00:29:09.597 --> 00:29:11.430
They go through some
various [? paroxysms ?]

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.740
and they're ejected
from the star.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.290
And what you're left
with is a white dwarf,

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:20.760
a hot ball of carbon oxygen in
the center and a ring of gas.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.580
That's the outside layers of the
star that have been expelled.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.199
And it's called a
planetary nebula.

00:29:26.199 --> 00:29:28.240
Now, the Sun will only
expel hydrogen and helium.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.960
But stars slightly heavier
than the sun will actually

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.847
expel a little bit of carbon
and nitrogen. And that's good.

00:29:33.847 --> 00:29:35.930
We've made some heavy
elements, and we've actually

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.320
put them back out in the
universe, where someday they

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.897
can form a planet
and maybe a person.

00:29:40.897 --> 00:29:42.480
Except that a planet
or a person would

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.942
pretty boring with only
carbon and nitrogen.

00:29:44.942 --> 00:29:46.400
So we're finally
getting somewhere,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.525
but we're not there yet.

00:29:48.525 --> 00:29:49.900
And I just can't
help showing you

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.430
some of these wonderful
images of planetary nebulae.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.870
They're among the most beautiful
objects in the universe.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.370
Here is, again, that
white dwarf in the center.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.220
That dot is the hot
ball of carbon oxygen.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.930
And you can see the
gas being thrown off

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.850
in shells as it runs out of
fuel on the outside of the star.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.820
And that hot white
dwarf is so hot,

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.960
that it's shining in
the ultraviolet region

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.430
of the spectrum and ionizing
and exciting the gas

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.740
and causing the gas
around it to glow.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.910
And here's another one.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:23.360
The star in the middle is that
hot white dwarf left behind.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.690
And the colored material
is the gas that's

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.254
been ejected from the star.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.726
So for a star below 8 or 10
times the mass of the Sun,

00:30:35.726 --> 00:30:36.850
that's the end of the line.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.500
There's no more story.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.180
The star never gets hot
enough to fuse carbon.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.410
It ends up as a dead white
dwarf-- not very interesting.

00:30:49.184 --> 00:30:50.600
So the next question
you might ask

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.366
is, how does he
know all this stuff?

00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:54.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.592
You ever been to a star?

00:30:56.592 --> 00:30:59.730
You ever been inside a star?

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.320
Not very likely.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.320
So how do you know this?

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.599
Well, we can't do
experiments in astronomy.

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:07.140
Given the kind of
physical conditions

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.556
we deal with, you probably
don't want us doing experiments

00:31:09.556 --> 00:31:11.310
in astronomy.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.110
And all we can do is
thought experiments.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.037
We can ask, what if?

00:31:14.037 --> 00:31:15.620
It turns out the
universe is giving us

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.210
an enormous number of stars
of all different masses

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.790
in all different stages
of their evolution.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.019
And so we can go and
try to piece together

00:31:24.019 --> 00:31:25.810
what we see in different
places and come up

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.690
with a general
picture a theory that

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.359
allows us to synthesize all
this data into a coherent whole.

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:33.900
But we do this by
thought experiments

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.566
not by actually going
and actually doing

00:31:35.566 --> 00:31:37.680
a real experiment.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.340
In the last 60
years, computers have

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.640
become more and more
important to helping us

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.180
with these thought experiments.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.640
We can't keep enough of
the data in our head.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.480
And the models we
come up with get

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.105
to be more and more complicated,
and we can't work through them

00:31:50.105 --> 00:31:51.910
without a computer.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:56.530
And so this is a very large
computer at Lawrence Livermore

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.380
National Lab.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.020
But the best
supercomputer center

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.859
I know of used for astronomy
is the one in Spain.

00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:04.400
If you really want
to get inspiration

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.860
about what makes
the universe tick,

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.050
you put your supercomputer
center in a Romanesque church,

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:10.965
right?

00:32:10.965 --> 00:32:13.340
This helps you get maybe just
a little extra inspiration.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.510
So as you may have thought,
may have suspected,

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.580
the real story tonight
is in the massive stars,

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.730
the stars more massive than
about 10 times the Sun.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.982
And here is the Pleiades.

00:32:26.982 --> 00:32:28.440
Those of you who
drive a Subaru may

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.800
recognize this constellation,
this group of stars.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.640
Subaru is Pleiades in Japanese.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.050
And interestingly, the
Pleiades, the Subaru,

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.354
is in the constellation Taurus.

00:32:40.354 --> 00:32:41.609
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:41.609 --> 00:32:43.400
I've never quite
understood the connection.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.150
But there must be
something deep in there.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.240
In any event, these
are all massive stars,

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.030
stars greater than about 10
times the mass of the Sun.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.870
And let's now try to follow
what their evolution looks like.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.060
We've talked about
hydrogen. The star

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.710
starts out burning
hydrogen to helium.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.700
In a massive star, it's maybe
more like 20 million degrees.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.320
And this lasts about
10 million years.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.840
It runs out of hydrogen.
It's starts fusing helium.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.770
Helium burns at maybe
200 million degrees.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:16.940
The star is hotter.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.920
It's brighter.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.530
It's got to make more energy
to make up for that luminosity

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.590
and so it burns faster.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.600
This only lasts for
maybe a million years.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.490
When it runs out of
helium, it starts

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.830
contracting and heating up
and starting to burn carbon.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:33.070
Now, in carbon burning,
the star gets a problem.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.700
Remember neutrinos,
those little particles

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.080
that can travel right through
the Earth without noticing?

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.470
Well, it turns out and gas
above about a half a billion

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:45.360
degrees the gas makes neutrinos.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.520
And those neutrinos once
made, they leave the star.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.010
So all of a sudden, the star
has a hole in it, in a sense,

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.910
for energy, right?

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.382
These neutrinos are carrying
away energy from the star.

00:33:56.382 --> 00:33:57.840
So not only does
the poor star have

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.460
to burn its fuel to make up for
the light that's shining off

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.410
its surface, it
now has to make up

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.310
for all those neutrinos that are
carrying away energy as well.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:08.020
And so it's got to burn
much faster and much hotter.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.690
And carbon burning
only last 1,000 years.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.699
When it runs out of carbon,
it contracts and heats up

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:17.500
to about 1.5 billion
degrees and starts

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.159
burning neon to make
oxygen, magnesium,

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.359
aluminum, phosphorus.

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:22.900
Now we're actually
getting somewhere.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.701
We're really building
some elements.

00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:26.825
This only last three years.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.060
When it runs out of
neon, you guessed it,

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.480
it starts burning oxygen
at 2 billion degrees.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.940
At this rate, it's really
making a lot of neutrinos,

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.420
and they're really robbing
the star from a lot of energy.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.162
And so this only lasts
for eight months.

00:34:44.162 --> 00:34:45.870
So you can see the
arc of the story here.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:46.870
We're getting somewhere.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.429
Something's about to happen.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.920
But before we go
there, I just want

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.190
to talk to you
about how computers

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.530
have begun to really
play a major role in how

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:01.620
we view the physics that
goes on inside stars.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.110
I'd say until about 10 or
15 years ago, most people

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.460
would think of these
nuclear burnings

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.730
as more like coals in a fire,
sort of a gentle reaction

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.910
producing heat, but not
a lot of action going on.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.660
But now that we have
a big enough computer

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:19.150
to start simulating things
in three dimensions,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:25.982
now that I can figure out how to
use this clicker-- there we go.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:37.200
You can see-- this is
in silicon burning-- how

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.700
things are actually more
like a roaring fire, right?

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.490
Streams of sulfur are
rising up in here.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.060
Fuel is falling down.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.870
There's a lot of violent
activity [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.920
Back to our star.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.810
The star runs out of
oxygen. It contracts

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.870
and heats up to
3.5 billion degrees

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.689
and starts to burn
silicon to iron.

00:35:59.689 --> 00:36:00.980
But that's the end of the line.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.180
That only takes a week.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.990
And the star has now run
into a really big problem.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.880
Because it turns out
you can take any element

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.160
you like lighter than
iron, fuse it together,

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.330
and they can't make energy.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.500
Any element heavier
than iron, however, you

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.530
get energy out when
you break it up.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.550
That's how the Palo Verde
Nuclear Plant works.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.610
You take uranium, a
very heavy element,

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.070
break it up into smaller
pieces, called fission,

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.000
and get energy out.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.940
So you can't burn iron.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.870
So the star's run out
of any possibility

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:35.105
to make up the energy
its losing from neutrinos

00:36:35.105 --> 00:36:35.980
and from its surface.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.187
So here we are.

00:36:41.187 --> 00:36:42.770
You might guess that
there's something

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.420
happening from the title.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.455
Our star is now about 1,400
times as big as the Sun.

00:36:49.455 --> 00:36:51.830
And it's mostly still hydrogen
and helium on the outside.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:55.550
But in the center,
it's burned helium.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.420
And in the inside that,
there's a little nugget

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.830
of carbon and oxygen. And then
inside that, neon, oxygen,

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:02.470
and magnesium.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.710
These are all the burning
stages we've talked about.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:08.062
Here we're already down to
only 10% the size of the Sun.

00:37:08.062 --> 00:37:11.110
And in the middle, finally,
we have this silicon layer

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.960
and the iron core in the middle.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.510
Now, that iron core, again,
finds itself in a quandary.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.620
It's begun to contract.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.411
It's begun to heat up.

00:37:22.411 --> 00:37:24.410
But it can't do the same
thing it's done before.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:27.030
It can't fuse iron
together to get energy out.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.960
This is the Large Magellanic
Cloud, a small galaxy

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.700
that orbits the Milky Way.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.287
It's about 150,000
light years away.

00:37:40.287 --> 00:37:41.870
And if you look very
carefully, you'll

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.530
see the circle that
always appears in the sky

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.988
before something
important happens.

00:37:44.988 --> 00:37:46.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.880
This is how we know
to go look there.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:57.240
And on February 23, 1987, a star
in the Large Magellanic Cloud,

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.260
and it's the tiny little dot
right there not the big blob,

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.347
exploded.

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:04.930
And it exploded
because of the physics

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:08.070
I'll talk about in a minute
to do with this iron core.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.360
And all of a, sudden, this
star, in less than a day,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.350
started putting out
more than 250 million

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.680
times the luminosity of the Sun.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.120
And that explosion
made 25,000 times

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.710
the mass of the Earth
of iron and even more

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.370
oxygen and other elements.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.720
So this in fact, is
where the elements

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.100
are formed-- in supernovae,
in the explosions of stars.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.350
And these explosions-- oh,
there's Time magazine, yes.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.561
It's nice to see your
work on Time magazine.

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:34.560
They were a little slow.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.659
If you notice the date
at the top is March 23.

00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:38.700
They were about a month
late, but that's not bad.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.158
And we'll also cut
them some slack.

00:38:40.158 --> 00:38:43.504
Of course, there's no noise in
space, so it didn't go bang,

00:38:43.504 --> 00:38:44.170
but at any rate.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.140
So supernovae happen
every 100 years or so,

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.050
maybe a little more frequently,
in a typical galaxy.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.770
And there are lots of
supernovae that people have

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.810
seen from Earth before now.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.570
This is the remnant
of Kepler's Supernova.

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.679
It blew up in October 1604.

00:39:03.679 --> 00:39:05.470
And Johannes Kepler
saw it and described it

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.630
as being brighter than
every star in the sky

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.510
except for Venus.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.000
It's about 13,000
light years away.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.190
And what you see in this image
is a quite remarkable image.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.370
You see the gas expanding
at 20 million miles an hour,

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.190
spreading out.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.500
It's about 14 light
years across by now.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.950
And the blue light, the
blue in this picture

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:29.770
is actually X-rays from the
Chandra X-ray Satellite.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.760
And that's where the
first gas, the fastest gas

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.940
is running into the gas around
the star in that galaxy,

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.180
in our galaxy.

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.800
The yellow and green is from
the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.970
And that's gas that's
inside the supernova

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.850
and has been warmed
up by the interaction.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.310
And the red comes from the
Spitzer Space Telescope,

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:54.440
and it's dust.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.490
It's heavy elements
inside that supernova

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.240
that have been warmed up and
are glowing in the infrared.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.220
So this is as if you
could take your eyes

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.950
and expand the wavelengths
you can see from the X-ray

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:07.030
all the way to the infrared.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.470
Worth spending a few billion
dollars on space telescopes?

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.970
I think so.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.850
This is Supernova 1054.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.600
It was seen by the Chinese
and a number of other places

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.960
around the world.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.060
It's now called the Crab Nebula.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.068
It's a bit closer at
6,500 light years.

00:40:24.068 --> 00:40:25.901
And it was visible in
the sky for two years.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.670
This is another supernova
remnant in Cassiopeia.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.179
It's also expanding at about
11 million miles an hour.

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:38.470
It's 50 million degrees where
it's running into the gas

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:42.310
around it, this blue
part of the image.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.140
And remarkably, it wasn't seen.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.530
There's some possibility
that John Flamsteed saw it

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.020
in England but not likely.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.580
It may have just been that
year was a very cloudy year,

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.560
and the chances of
seeing it were slim.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.370
But in any event,
these explosions

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.290
do occur with some
frequency in the galaxy.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.550
And let's find
out how they work.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.760
So here we have a
diagram of the inner,

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.760
say, 100 miles or
so of this star.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.450
So it's really a small
piece of the star.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.860
And in the center here, in
the blue dot in the middle,

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.040
is this iron core.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.330
It's just run out of silicon,
and it's sitting there.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:21.010
It's now having to
contract and heat up.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.600
In a few hours, it gets so hot,
that the iron nuclei that it's

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.310
made of begin to split
apart back down into protons

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.760
and neutrons and helium.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.950
Now, the star just spent
the last 10 million years

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:35.540
putting it all together.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.200
And it's gotten energy out.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.690
So to split it
apart takes energy.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.689
But where does that
energy come from?

00:41:41.689 --> 00:41:42.230
The pressure.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.364
Now, we've been talking so
far about gradual collapse.

00:41:47.364 --> 00:41:48.780
When the star runs
out of fuel, it

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.070
gradually collapses and
shrinks down and warms up.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:56.350
Now things happen in a
much faster time scale.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:57.850
Once the nuclei
begin to break up,

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:59.630
the bottom falls
out of the star.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.070
In 0.2 seconds, the
iron core collapses

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:07.120
from the size of the moon
to the size of Tucson.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.585
It reaches a speed of about a
quarter of the speed of light.

00:42:10.585 --> 00:42:12.710
And by the time it gets
down to the size of Tucson,

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.450
it's denser than
an atomic nucleus--

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.670
10 to 15 grams per
cubic centimeter

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.700
and a trillion degrees.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.880
If you work that
out, Revelations

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.470
tells us that hell is a
burning lake of brimstone.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.540
Well, sulfur, brimstone,
melts at about 500 degrees.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.710
So it's about 2 billion
times hotter than hell.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:32.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.480
But at any rate, it's
at a trillion degrees.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:41.660
And at that density, the force
that holds nuclei together,

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.760
the strong nuclear
force, which is normally

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.760
attractive to nuclei,
becomes repulsive.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.260
And so all of a
sudden, this huge mass

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:53.220
is falling in, more
or less in free fall.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.630
Then all of a sudden,
there's an enormous pressure,

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.410
and it bounces.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.820
And it starts bouncing out
at a significant fraction

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.840
the speed of light.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.570
But of course the rest of the
star, like in an old cartoon,

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.944
doesn't know what's
happened yet.

00:43:04.944 --> 00:43:06.880
And so it's still falling in.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.850
And where they meet,
a shock wave forms.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.850
And the shock wave
is trying to push

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.830
the star, in-falling
orange stuff,

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:19.100
back out as this inner
part of the star expands.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.950
But as that material
falls through

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:24.500
from the rest of the star,
it too is heated up so much,

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.910
and it disintegrates
and takes energy away.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:30.770
And so that shock wave is in
danger of being overwhelmed,

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.140
and the whole star
could collapse down

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.290
and form a black hole.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.420
And large stars do that.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.730
Stars more than about
40 or so solar masses

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.730
do, in fact, we think,
collapse to a black hole.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.229
But for stars that are in the
intermediate range, between 10

00:43:45.229 --> 00:43:49.210
and 40 or so solar masses, the
neutrinos come to the rescue.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.190
This collapsing neutron
star, because now that's

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:58.080
what it's called-- its iron core
is turned into a neutron star--

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.100
radiates away roughly 25%
of its mass as neutrinos.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.600
So for about a
second, that thing,

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.870
which is now the size of
Tucson, has a luminosity greater

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.690
than the entire rest of the
visible universe combined.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:15.370
And even though neutrinos can
fly right through the Earth,

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.610
the density here is so
large that they're trapped,

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:22.390
and they begin to add energy
right behind that shock.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:24.686
And they add energy
and rejuvenate it

00:44:24.686 --> 00:44:26.060
and make up for
the energy that's

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.770
lost as it's dissociating the
material from the star that's

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:30.270
falling in.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:33.370
And on a good day
on your computer,

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:36.780
this causes that material to
start convecting and roiling

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.056
and boiling, and eventually you
get an explosion-- not always.

00:44:42.056 --> 00:44:44.430
This is something that we are
working very, very intently

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.580
on at the moment.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.614
And we don't really
understand all

00:44:47.614 --> 00:44:48.780
of the physics that goes on.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.600
It's very, very complicated.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:55.060
But here is the result
of a calculation.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.290
I have to use the clicker
again to get the movie to play.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:59.400
We can see this happening.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.840
Here's the star falling in.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.380
The shock wave
tries to move out,

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.380
but it gets overwhelmed
by the star.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.850
And now it's sort
of in a balance.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.350
But the neutrinos
are adding energy.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:12.100
The star's continuing
to fall in.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.724
But it's getting hotter and
hotter behind that shock.

00:45:14.724 --> 00:45:16.390
And energy's building
up and building up

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.130
from these neutrinos.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.740
And eventually, enough energy
gets imparted to this material

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.210
that it can actually move
on and blow the star apart.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.720
Now, that took a
while on-- it actually

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.130
only took about 0.3 seconds
inside the supernova.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.193
It also took about three months
to compute on a computer.

00:45:33.193 --> 00:45:36.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.970
So we're not quite ready
to do real-time computing

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.178
for [? star ?] evolution yet.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.660
Here's an image starting from
the configuration we left it

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.030
at, zooming out now so we
can see more of the star.

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.250
You can see that roiling
and boiling mass.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:55.590
That's finally coming out.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.470
The star's collapsing in.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:01.480
Once it hits that
yellow, the in-fall

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.690
has turned into an outflow.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.430
And this will continue out and
go all the way to the surface,

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.170
destroy the star, and
throw the material out

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:12.280
at tens of millions
of miles per hour.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.030
As it does that, it
heats the start up

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:19.061
and actually burns it even more
and makes more new elements.

00:46:19.061 --> 00:46:19.560
Whoops.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.990
That's the wrong one.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:26.330
Here's a 3-D version
of a similar model

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:27.080
for core collapse.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:33.580
See the star collapses.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.980
There's the shock wave.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.950
It's slowing down.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.980
The star's still falling in.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.060
You can see now that
the inside of the star

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.049
is becoming convective.

00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:43.090
It's roiling and boiling.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.140
It's becoming unstable.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:46.366
It's getting more
and more energetic

00:46:46.366 --> 00:46:48.365
as this energy gets
imparted from the neutrinos.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:59.810
You sit there watching
the output every day

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:02.390
from these computer
models-- blow!

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.990
Go on!

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.630
Do it!

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:04.310
Do it!

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:06.646
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.980
This one looks kind of marginal.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:10.596
I don't know.

00:47:10.596 --> 00:47:13.010
It's taking a long time.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.230
We're now up to,
what, 0.4 seconds.

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:22.202
Oh, now it's looking a
little more promising.

00:47:22.202 --> 00:47:24.410
Well, maybe not.

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:28.710
It's torture to wait so
long for these things.

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:29.990
Now we zoom down a little bit.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:31.940
And now finally, it's
getting to be larger.

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.090
Eventually, the
shockwave is going

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:37.070
to make it out and
blow up the star.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:37.710
There it goes.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:47.430
And that's what results.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.100
That's the Crab Nebula again.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.180
And inside in the blue,
you see an X-ray image

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.960
of the Chandra X-ray Satellite.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:59.050
And in the middle there
is a spinning neutron star

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.240
with a very strong
magnetic field.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.140
And it's spitting out
a very strong stream

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.180
of energetic particles
and whipping the gas

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.850
with its magnetic field and
heating it to tens of millions

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:08.440
of degrees.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.270
And that thing is called a
pulsar, and that's left behind.

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:12.520
That's the object left behind.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.320
That's why we know that
the Crab Nebula was

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.280
this kind of supernova.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.719
That we saw the explosion,
that's pretty obvious.

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:22.760
But down in the middle is
a rotating neutron star

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.634
that was left behind.

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:25.612
That's that remnant
of that iron core

00:48:25.612 --> 00:48:27.445
that you only get in
this kind of explosion.

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:36.260
Well, we talked about stars
bigger than 8 solar masses.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.380
They develop iron cores.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.730
The cores collapse.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.730
On a good day on
the computer, they

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:43.830
explode, make lots of
elements, and send them out

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.480
into the universe, and
leave behind a neutron star

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.940
or a pulsar or a black hole.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.267
We've also talked about stars
less than eight solar masses

00:48:53.267 --> 00:48:54.850
that make a planetary
nebula and leave

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:57.470
behind a dead white dwarf.

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:00.050
Well, there's one more
twist to this story.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.750
And that's if the white
dwarf has a companion,

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:04.980
if it's in a binary star
systems so the two stars are

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.510
going around each other.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:10.467
In that case, they can
make a type Ia supernova.

00:49:10.467 --> 00:49:12.300
And these are among the
brightest explosions

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:12.966
in the universe.

00:49:12.966 --> 00:49:14.740
That's what Dave Arnett did.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.270
He gave us the idea for
how these things work.

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:22.730
And a typical type Ia supernova
emits the Sun's whole lifetime

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:27.150
energy every second--
so as much energy

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:28.650
as the Sun will
produce overall it's

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:33.170
10 billion years of life, every
second, 30 million billion

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.001
billion billion megatons of TNT.

00:49:36.001 --> 00:49:37.500
Isn't it fun to be
able to say that?

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:42.460
I looked for what the right
unit for that would be.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.520
So I went out and
looked on Wikipedia

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.680
and found that the largest
prefix we have-- everybody

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.529
knows kilo and mega and giga.

00:49:50.529 --> 00:49:52.320
Maybe if you buy a hard
disk for a computer

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.270
you know about tera nowadays.

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:58.200
But it turns out yotta is
the biggest prefix for 10

00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:58.700
to the 24.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.569
So this is 30 billion
yottatons of TNT.

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.570
Or if you like, that
many of those Castle

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:12.610
Bravo nuclear explosions.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.170
But no matter how
you say it, the scale

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.930
is so far beyond
anybody's ability

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.947
to compare it to what
we know, that you just

00:50:18.947 --> 00:50:20.738
have to sort of accept
the number of zeros.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.830
But they're so
bright that you can

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.950
see these supernovae more than
halfway across the universe.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.450
And in fact, it was
the measurements

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:34.510
of the distant supernovae
that first enabled

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:36.870
us to detect the
presence of dark matter

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:39.510
in the universe and the fact
that the universe was expanding

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.301
at an ever more rapid rate.

00:50:44.014 --> 00:50:44.805
So here's a galaxy.

00:50:44.805 --> 00:50:47.020
It's three pictures
of the same galaxy.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.177
On the left, is a galaxy
before the supernova.

00:50:49.177 --> 00:50:51.260
In the middle, is a supernova
after it's going off

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.030
at its peak brightness.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:57.004
You can't really tell from
this image, but at the time,

00:50:57.004 --> 00:50:58.670
that supernova is
putting out more light

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:01.601
than the entire rest
of the galaxy combined.

00:51:01.601 --> 00:51:03.100
And then a little
bit later, you see

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.340
it's beginning to fade away.

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.820
Here's another galaxy.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:10.100
We turn on the handy
cosmic indicator.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.089
That's the supernova
right there.

00:51:12.089 --> 00:51:13.630
By the way, the
reason we're building

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:16.114
this telescope,
the LSST, is to be

00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:18.030
able to find these
supernova, because we don't

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:20.150
have the arrows, it turns out.

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:23.110
And so the only way to find
supernovae in enough quantity

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.700
to really study them is to go
out and look at the entire sky

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.470
as often as possible and compare
it with the previous night

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:33.290
and see where some new
bright object has appeared.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.160
But for now, we'll
use the arrows.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.310
Here's another spiral
galaxy with another type Ia

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:38.510
supernova in it.

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:40.350
So we can see these
throughout the universe.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.730
And they're a very handy
tool for measuring distances

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:44.580
and doing cosmology.

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.420
But they're also very
handy for making elements.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.736
This is how it works.

00:51:49.736 --> 00:51:51.110
When the star's
in a white dwarf,

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.651
there's a companion
star, and they're

00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:53.984
orbiting around each other.

00:51:53.984 --> 00:51:55.400
And now we've got
our white dwarf,

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.600
because that star's
run out of fuel,

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.560
and we have a carbon oxygen
ball, that white dwarf.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.710
And when its companion runs out
of fuel, runs out of hydrogen,

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.280
it swells up, starts burning
helium in the middle,

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.760
becomes a red giant.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.970
The white dwarf can
suck some of the gas

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:16.000
off that companion star, and
it spirals in and ends up

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.550
adding to the mass
of the white dwarf.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:20.860
And as the white
dwarf gets heavier,

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.430
it gets denser in the
middle and hotter.

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:26.180
And when it reaches a
special mass, 1.35 times

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.090
the mass of the Sun, something
called the Chandrasekhar mass,

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:32.270
it reaches about a
density of a few times 10

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:34.740
to the 9 grams per
cubic centimeter.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.440
At that point,
carbon atoms finally

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.640
begin to fuse, even
in that low mass star.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.695
And for about 1,000
years, it begins to fuse,

00:52:42.695 --> 00:52:46.320
and the burning accelerates,
and it goes faster and faster.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.380
And then one day, by dumb
luck, a small part of that star

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.780
begins to burn very rapidly.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.450
It heats up strongly.

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:55.950
And within a few
seconds after that,

00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:58.210
a thermonuclear explosion
engulfs the entire star,

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:03.870
turning it to iron, producing
30 billion tons of energy.

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:06.490
So here's a movie by
[? Casey ?] [? Meekin ?],

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.870
one of our post-docs
at Steward Observatory.

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.880
And this was this calculations
that were done at Chicago,

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.568
so Mike would be
happy about this.

00:53:13.568 --> 00:53:15.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.890
Let me get my clicker.

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:20.670
The green here is a white dwarf.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.720
And the little dot in the
middle is this burning part

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.340
that's just begun to burn.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.940
And you'll see that as it begins
to burn, it becomes buoyant.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.940
And the burning rises to the
surface like a mushroom cloud.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.660
And then nuclear flames
spread out across the surface.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.050
They get past the equator.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.550
Once they get past
the equator, they

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.716
start coming together again.

00:53:41.716 --> 00:53:44.130
And where they meet
at the antipode,

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:45.270
they ignite a detonation.

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.650
And that detonation wave,
then, destroys the star.

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:48.483
So here's the movie.

00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:55.070
Here you see the burning begin.

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.220
The mushroom of hot gas that's
burning ever faster breaks

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:04.310
through the surface of the
star. [? It's happening. ?] It's

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:06.365
ignited down here
[? by ?] detonation.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:14.030
In about a second,
the entire star's

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:15.783
engulfed and turned into iron.

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:37.550
So as I said, the type Ia
supernovae mostly make iron.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.910
They turn the entire star
into iron and elements

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:42.680
near iron-- titanium,
chromium, vanadium, nickel,

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.370
cobalt, what have you.

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.730
And a typical explosion
of this kind of supernova

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:49.750
makes about 200 times
the Earth's mass in iron,

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:50.450
not much else.

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:55.216
But this iron
production is what's

00:54:55.216 --> 00:54:57.840
responsible for most of the iron
tonight that you're sitting on

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.810
and the iron in your blood.

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:02.680
And interestingly, it doesn't
actually make it as iron.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.130
It makes it as a radioactive
isotope nickel-56.

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:10.330
And nickel 56 decays to
cobalt-56 in about six days.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:13.980
And about 77 days later, that
cobalt-56 decays to iron.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.860
And so the iron
that's in your blood

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.276
and that you're
sitting on tonight

00:55:17.276 --> 00:55:20.174
was once radioactive fallout
from a thermonuclear supernova.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.110
And what you see halfway
across the universe

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:28.280
is, in fact, not that 30
billion yottatons of energy.

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.160
What you see is the glow
from the radioactive

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.994
decay of nickel to iron.

00:55:37.504 --> 00:55:38.420
And there it is again.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:42.640
We believe Kepler's Supernova
was a type Ia supernova.

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.210
And so it's expanding.

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:46.400
And in a few more thousand
years, 10,000 years,

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.890
that iron will get mixed in
with the gas of the galaxy

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:54.410
and have a chance
to form new stars.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:56.590
So the origin the
elements is in stars

00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:58.940
and in titanic explosions.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.090
You can take the Sun
and ask, how much

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:02.710
of the material of
the sun would have

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:04.410
to have gone through a
supernova to reproduce

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.785
that set of elements we saw
at the beginning of the talk?

00:56:06.785 --> 00:56:08.920
It turns out if
10% of the Sun has

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.150
passed through a
star in a supernova,

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:12.650
you would make the
chemical elements

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:16.340
we see inside the Sun today.

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:18.730
For you, it's much bigger.

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:20.872
90% of your body has
passed through a supernova.

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:30.770
So you really are stardust.

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:32.534
I won't sing.

00:56:32.534 --> 00:56:33.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:35.570
So the elements
necessary for life

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:38.300
were created and are still being
created throughout the universe

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:42.410
by the evolution of stars and
the explosion of supernova.

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:44.680
So the stuff of
life is everywhere.

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.420
And if that's the
case, it's most likely

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.970
that life itself is everywhere.

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:50.880
And I'd like to
stop by going back

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.950
to our picture of the
star-forming clouds

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.180
and zoom out.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.430
And you can see those three
fingers are down here just

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.150
below the center.

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:05.412
And in the green, this whole
region is forming stores.

00:57:05.412 --> 00:57:07.120
But what's interesting
about this picture

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.640
is the red is hot
gas left behind

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.590
from a supernova that occurred
a few thousand years before.

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:18.110
So a star there formed
elements, blew up,

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:21.650
scattered those elements
out into new gas,

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:25.540
probably bumped the gas enough
to get it to start collapsing.

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:27.180
And that gas there
is now collapsing,

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:31.110
forming new stars, new planets,
and who knows who else.

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:32.970
Thank you.

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:37.458
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:48.326 --> 00:57:50.990
Thank you very much.

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:53.440
And I think we have a few
minutes for just a couple

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.390
of questions, if
anybody would want

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:59.382
to talk about nuclear bombs.

00:57:59.382 --> 00:58:01.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:12.220
Did I get the right impression
that the stars or the suns

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.230
rotate, like the Earth?

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:19.950
Stars themselves rotate,
just like the Earth, yes.

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:22.137
And in fact, the
rotation of stars

00:58:22.137 --> 00:58:24.220
can actually affect the
mechanism of the explosion

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:24.928
of the supernova.

00:58:24.928 --> 00:58:28.220
That's one of the things
that we're working on today.

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.100
So our own sun rotates?

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.060
Our own sun rotates.

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.350
Oh, I never knew that.

00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:32.850
Thank you.

00:58:40.276 --> 00:58:42.510
Has anybody looked
at the possibility

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:47.790
of just how many supernovas
have created the heavier

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.920
elements, say, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.870
Oh, [? great ?] number.

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:53.810
You can actually ask,
what is the amount

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:55.270
of mass in the universe?

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.730
I mean just on the Earth.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:57.800
Oh, just for the Earth?

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.400
Yeah.

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.180
Well, it would take much
less than one supernova

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.710
to create enough heavy
elements to make the Earth.

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:05.540
But more likely than
not, many supernovae

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:08.180
contributed to the heavy
elements in the Earth

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:11.939
by mixing their production
in the gas in the galaxy.

00:59:11.939 --> 00:59:14.480
So that's happened over quite
a long time and travelled quite

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.070
a ways.

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:16.560
That's right.

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.350
What is a black hole?

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:20.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:24.670
Ooh, a black hole-- I'm going to
go the short, technical answer

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:26.450
and avoid the question.

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:30.320
A black hole is
a region of space

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.780
where the escape
velocity is greater

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.110
than the speed of light.

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:37.590
And since nothing can travel
faster than the speed of light,

00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:39.980
nothing can leave that region.

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:45.000
And what goes on
inside that black hole,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.460
we can't know because no
information can get out

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.140
to tell us.

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.890
It's an interesting
philosophical question

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:52.359
as to whether
that's even science,

00:59:52.359 --> 00:59:54.150
because you can't do
an experiment in there

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:55.760
to find out.

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.820
But so what happens when
a massive star collapses?

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:02.290
It gets smaller and smaller and
denser and denser and denser,

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:05.800
until the gravity is so strong
that light can't get out

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.260
anymore from that area.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.440
And that's a black hole.

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:18.960
What happens to the companion
star of a Ia supernova?

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.020
It has quite a ride.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:25.470
Remarkably, it does
not get destroyed.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:30.140
And there a number of people who
have been doing models of this.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.270
It gets stripped of its
outer layers of gas.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:37.970
It gets heated up somewhat.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:39.760
It probably bounces
around in rings

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.630
because it gets
whacked pretty hard.

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:46.520
But it pretty much remains
intact, remarkably enough.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.500
Have you met Chandra Sekhar,
and he's a cool dude?

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.890
I have not met Chandra Sekhar.

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:53.450
Dave has.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:54.730
I have not, I'm afraid.

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:57.080
Where do the
meteorites come from,

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.770
and does their
composition tell us

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:01.555
anything about these
supernova explosions?

01:01:01.555 --> 01:01:02.055
Absolutely.

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:06.370
So we start out
with all this gas

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:07.600
in those dark clouds we saw.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.790
They collapse.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.950
They form a star.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:14.120
Some of the gas forms
a disk around the star.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.950
And out of that disk,
the heavy elements

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:18.470
condense and form rocks.

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.146
Those rocks combine together.

01:01:20.146 --> 01:01:22.520
And that's basically the
history of how you make planets,

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.830
in a nutshell.

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.890
But not everything
goes into planets.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:29.140
Some of it stays as
little rocks, as dust.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.890
And those little
rocks and that dust

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:33.961
are asteroids and
smaller objects

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:35.210
going around the solar system.

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:36.877
And every once in a
while, one of them

01:01:36.877 --> 01:01:39.335
gets whacked by the gravity of
Jupiter or some other planet

01:01:39.335 --> 01:01:42.630
and deflected and eventually
comes and hits our atmosphere.

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:45.840
So that's a sample ready
made, delivered right to us

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.830
on Earth of the primordial
stuff out of which

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:52.710
the solar system was made-- this
stuff that the supernova had

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.210
produced.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:58.060
And so it's a great help to
us to look at these asteroids

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:01.180
and actually be able to
measure the relative amounts

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.020
of different isotopes in them.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.050
There's quite a lot of
very interesting stuff

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:08.370
analogous to look at tree
rings for nucleosynthesis

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:10.858
that you get from meteorites.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.250
Black holes don't emit
anything by definition.

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:25.970
However, as stuff falls
into a black hole,

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:29.120
it goes from a very large
volume to a much smaller volume,

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.400
and it gets squeezed.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.700
And it can squeeze and get
sufficiently hot to emit X-rays

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.500
just before it
falls down the hole.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:41.200
So in a sense, black holes
don't themselves emit.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.680
But the system that contains
a black hole can emit X-rays.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.720
That's right.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.650
So if anybody else
wants to listen to--

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:48.035
You haven't--

01:02:48.035 --> 01:02:48.980
Oh, one more question.

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.870
You haven't talked about
formation of the elements

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:55.840
heavier than iron, such as
uranium and [? latitium. ?]

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.970
And is the reason why beryllium
is so rare in the universe

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:05.270
because beryllium-8
is so unstable.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:08.460
Yes to the latter one.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.640
The former question-- where do
the elements heavier than iron

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.940
come from?

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.450
It's a much more
difficult subject.

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:19.260
It goes basically like this.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.650
There are two sets of
elements heavier than iron.

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:25.160
One of them gets produced
down inside that red region

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.150
inside the star,
that shock that's

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:28.830
being heated by the neutrinos.

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:31.421
That's something
called the r-process.

01:03:31.421 --> 01:03:32.920
And the way that
works is there's so

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.250
many free neutrons in
that gas, they just

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:37.210
keep adding more
and more neutrons

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.626
on to the nuclei that are there.

01:03:38.626 --> 01:03:40.250
And every once in a
while, one of those

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.020
neutrons turns into a
proton, and the thing

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.710
keeps building up to heavier and
heavier and heavier elements.

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:47.460
And that's the rapid
process, because that

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.610
happens all in a small
fraction of a second.

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:52.280
There's another
analogous process called,

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.400
you guessed it, the s-process,
or the slow process,

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.920
where in helium
burning in some stars,

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.690
heavy elements that
are already there,

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:04.040
iron, for example,
that's already there,

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.850
can slowly absorb more
neutrons and build up

01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:09.440
to heavier and heavier nuclei.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.610
But both of those arr a
much more complicated story,

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:13.279
and so I figured
we'd start with stick

01:04:13.279 --> 01:04:14.820
with the gratuitous
violence tonight.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.290
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.110
Well, thank you very much, Phil.

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:19.330
Thank you, again.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:22.680
[APPLAUSE]
