00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.370
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: We ready?

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.060
Good morning.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.170
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.680
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: This is exciting.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.710
Here we are starting the day of
the National Book Festival here

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.550
in Washington, D.C. Welcome.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.340
Welcome especially to those of
you who are new, relatively new

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.350
to Washington, D.C. I'm Amy Stolls.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.460 position:56%
I'm the Director of Literature at
the National Endowment for the Arts,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.100
and it's my distinct pleasure to
open the National Book Festival

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.720
by featuring our Poetry Out
Loud winners from this year

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.860 position:56%
and our distinguished judge from
this year, and poet, Adrian Matejka.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.570
Before we do that, I'm going

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.210
to there's a couple
things I want to say.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.920
That all day here at the Library
of Congress National Book Festival,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.580
we're recognizing and
celebrating the importance

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.670
of reading and authors and book.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.510 position:56%
And the Library of Congress makes it
seem so easy to do this every year.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.880
But the truth is, the National Book
Festival is a huge undertaking,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.800
and it is a huge financial
undertaking.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.160
And it's been made possible by
generous support from our sponsors.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.580
The National Endowment
for the Arts is one.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.880
You can see who they are in your
programs and on the video monitors

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.180
around the Convention Center.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.010
But we can't take for granted that
this event will continue to exist.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.140
So I'd like to ask you to consider
making a contribution using your

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.440
cell phone.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.660
You can send a text to make a
one-time gift that will be added

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.160
to your mobile phone bill.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.570
And it the details are on screen
and on the back of your program.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.670
And so now, on to the main event.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.910
The National Endowment for the Arts
Literature Program supports reading

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.390
and books and authors across
the country in many ways.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.790
We give direct grants to poets
and writers and translators.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.010 position:56%
We give grants to organizations,
like publishers and literary centers

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.380
and service organizations
and book festivals like this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.840
to do what they do too
encourage people to read.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.970
We also have a program
called the NEA Big Read,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.500
which is a community read program.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.380
We give grants to 75
communities around the country.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.320
And we have a program called
Poetry Out Loud, which we're going

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.860
to feature today and you're
going to hear all about.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.010
You can find out more
information about our programs.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.190
In the back at the table we
have a whole bunch of pamphlets

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.530
and our wonderful staff back there.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.190
Hi, staff.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.490
[Laughs] All right.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.500
Before we-- I'm going to
turn it over to Eleanor,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.710
who has been managing the Poetry
Out Loud program for a long time.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.030
I want to take a moment

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.870
to acknowledge our
National Student Poets

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.460
who were just recently named
and it's very exciting.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.680
And it's always exciting
when we have young poets,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.620
like Poetry Out Loud and our
National Student Poets going

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.470 position:56%
around the country as ambassadors of
poetry, because they're passionate

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.840
about poetry and they're
good at what they do.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.860
The President's Committee on
the Arts and the Humanities,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.840
the Institute of Museum and
Library Sciences, and the Alliance

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.780
for Young Artists and
Writers partner

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.070
to present the National
Student Poets Program,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.370
the country's highest honor

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.290
for youth poets presenting
original work.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.780
So five outstanding high school
poets whose work exhibits

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.120
exceptional creativity and
dedication to their craft

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.110
and promise are selected
annually for a year of service

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.070 position:56%
as National Poetry Ambassadors, much
like our Poetry Out Loud folks are.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.960
So I really want to
acknowledge the five

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.230
who just recently won
this distinguished award.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.140
And I'm going to say this
names and ask them to stand

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.150
up and so we can applaud.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.370
Representing the Southeast,
Annie Castillo.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.980
[applause] Representing
the West, Kinsale Hueston.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.470
[applause] Representing
the Midwest, Ben Lee.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.950
[applause] Representing the
Northeast, Juliet Lubwama.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.280
[applause] And representing the
Southwest, Camila Sanmiguel.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.730
Round of applause for
all of them, please.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.040
Thank you.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.120
I had the pleasure of
listening to them yesterday

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.770
and reciting their poems
and was incredibly moved

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.730
and inspired that this
is our future.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.900
In the same way that
when I went to the finals

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.120
and I know Adrian can speak
to this too, as can Eleanor,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.420
and everybody in the audience,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.620
that when you hear these
poets recite poetry,

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.780
whether it's their own or
others, it makes you really,

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.650
really hopeful for our future.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.900
And that they can do all sorts of
things and have dedicated a portion

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.370
of their lives to poetry.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.380
So with that, I'm going to turn
it over to Eleanor Billington

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.940
to tell you about Poetry Out
Loud and to introduce Adrian.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.740
Thank you.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.050
[ Applause ]

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.350
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington:
Hey, everybody.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.650
Good morning.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.950
So welcome to the festival.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.250
Amy already welcomed you,
but I want to do it again.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.550
It's really a wonderful event.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.200
We are so happy you're
here with us this morning.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.470
On behalf of everybody at the
NEA, thank you for being here.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.390
So as Amy said, my name
is Eleanor Billington.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.080
I've been helping to manage
Poetry Out Loud for many years,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.840
and it is quite a wonderful job.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.540
I'm very, very lucky.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.290
So I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the program.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.980
I'm going to do that first and then
introduce the guests on the stage.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.490 position:56%
And then I'll get out of the way
and they're going to do their thing,

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.790
which is going to be great.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.140
So Poetry Out Loud is a national
youth arts program that seeks

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.810 position:56%
to foster a new generation of
literary readers and engage citizens

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.350
by capitalizing on
recent trends in poetry.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.270
And those are recitation
and performance.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.770
So Poetry Out Loud encourages high
school students to learn classic

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.240
and contemporary poems
through memorization

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.100
and then public recitation.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.040 position:56%
So this was started as a partnership
back in 2005 between the NEA

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.060
and our great partnership, The
Poetry Foundation, and 53 state

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.790
and jurisdictional arts
agencies across the country,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.550
which means that the Poetry Out
Loud program is in every state,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.190
D.C. The U.S. Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.280 position:56%
Since the program began, we have
had 3.3 million students participate

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.510
and over 50,000 teachers
across the country.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.120
The program helps students
build public speaking skills

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.650
and self-confidence,
but most importantly,

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.930
it really helps them discover
their own creative voice.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.620
I say this every year
at the book festival,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.040
but I say it because it's
important for us to acknowledge.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.060
And for many people, and I was
included in this group actually,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.250
before I started to
work on the program.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.510
Poetry recitation can sound
a little bit dry, right?

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.890
But you're going to see in a couple
minutes firsthand, that the power

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.380
of a poem spoken aloud
is real and it's moving.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.230
And these students are
absolutely phenomenal.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.820
So how does the program work?

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.120
It's a pyramid structure.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.420
It's a lot like the spelling bee.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.950
The students start at the
classroom level and then they move

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.700
on to a school-wide competition,
and then they may have a regional

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.270
or a state finals competition.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.680
And then they finally come to
D.C. to the national finals,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.980
which are held here every spring.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.500
If you are an interested high
school student in the audience

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.770
or an interested high school
teacher, there is still time

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.240
to sign up for this year.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.580
So if you want to find out
more or want to get in touch

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.950
with your state arts agency
that's hosting the competition

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.910
in your state, you can go to the
table in the back, like Amy said,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.490
where our staff members are, and
find out more about the program.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.790
So you can get involved this year.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.500
It is not too late to get involved.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.070
We have a great website that's
dedicated to Poetry Out Loud.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.010
It's poetryoutloud.org and on the
website there are over 900 poems

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.850
that are eligible for recitation.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.300
There's a great teacher's guide.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.770
There are tips for reciting.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.490
There are great video examples.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.790
Actually, most of the students

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.760
on the stage are featured
in videos online.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.960
So you can find out a lot
more about the program there.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.480
Again, everything in the
back table about POL is free

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.370
and everything online is free too.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.430
Last year, we had more than 315,000
students participate in Poetry

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.040
Out Loud, and today you're going to
hear from three of those students,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.410
three state champions who made
it all the way to the top nine

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.470
at the 2017 Poetry Out
Loud National Finals.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.240
Poetry Out Loud students are
eligible for prizes at the state

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.020
and national level,
including a $20,000 prize

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.910
for the national champion.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.800
Every year, Poetry Out Loud
awards more than $100,000

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.300
in prizes and school stipends.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.460
So a $20,000 prize is
nothing to scoff at.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.170
It's incredible, especially
for a poetry recitation, right?

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.490
But we believe that the real
reward for us as administrators

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.180
of this program, but
also for the students,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.250
is when they connect very deeply
with the poems that they memorize.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.310
In a recent conversation
with the Iowa Review,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.690
our new U.S. poet laureate Tracy
K. Smith describes one of the first

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.160
and most important relationships
she had with a memorized poem.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.630
She says this.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.030 position:56%
"In one of my fifth grade textbooks,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.410
there was an Emily Dickenson
poem titled 'I'm Nobody!

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.770
Who are you?'

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.470
I inadvertently memorized it.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.980
It almost felt like the
speaker and I were in collusion

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.480
with one another, like there was
this amazing space the speaker had

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.850
invited me into.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.130
I liked that sense
of private mischief

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.600
that poetry seemed to
be able to extend."

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.920
This morning, we extend
an invitation to you

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.680
to enjoy what these poems will
bring to your own life experience.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.660
We invite you to listen differently
and to embrace the mystery

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.690
and mischief of language, and
we ask that you honor the work

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.770
of these students as they
share their perspectives

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.330
and talents with you.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.740
Before we begin, I'm going to
tell you a little bit about all

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.120
of our guests and our moderator.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.420
So Iree Mann.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.720
Iree, do you mind waving?

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.180 position:56%
[laughs] Iree is the 2017 Poetry Out
Loud state champion from New York.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.330
She's a senior at Syosset
High School in Long Island,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.130
and she is here with
her mom and her teacher.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.910
She's very involved in the African
American Club and is captain

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.320
of interpretive events on her
school's speech and debate team.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.880
Iree wants to pursue acting as a
career and she enjoys writing plays

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.770
and sharing her own stories with
a limited audience right now.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.070
She said just her dogs.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.290
[laughter] So she's working up
to a broader audience, right?

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.590
[laughter] Nick Amador.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.190
Nick? Is a 2017 --
is our 2017 Poetry

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.960
Out Loud second place national
finalist, and he's a senior

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.090
at Punahou High School in Hawaii.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.580
He is passionate about
theatre, stories,

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.210
and combating climate change.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.270
In his free time, he writes poetry,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.500
watches Game of Thrones,
and plays with his dogs.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.390
So we have a canine theme.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.170
[laughter] We also are so happy

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:03.790
to welcome the 2017 Georgia state
champion, who is also our Poetry

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.090
Out Loud national champion
for this year, Samara Huggins.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.370
Samara's a freshman at
Pratt Institute in New York.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.500
She is studying fashion
design there.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.400
In addition to designing,
she is a writer

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.430
and a supporter of
all things creative.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.730
She's also going to be featured

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.460
at the international
storytelling festival

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.410
in Jonesborough, Tennessee
next month.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.710
Finally, we are very, very pleased
and honored to be joined by poet

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.790
and Poetry Out Loud national
finals judge, Adrian Matejka.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.610
Adrian is going to lead today's
discussion with our students.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.830
He is the author of
four books of poetry.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.510
His third book of poems,
"The Big Smoke,"

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.770
about prize fighter Jack
Johnson, was a finalist

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.890
for the National Book Award
and the Pulitzer Prize.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.740
His most recent collection, "Map to
the Stars," explores the tensions

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.510 position:56%
between geography, race, and poverty

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.830
in America during the
Reagan era in the '80s.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.370
You can hear more from Adrian

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.680
about his new book right
here in this room at 1:00pm.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.330
[laughter] But now, we're going
to talk about Poetry Out Loud.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.060
So he's a champion for the program.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.920 position:56%
We are so honored and just delighted
to have him here this morning.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.600
You guys are going to really
enjoy their discussion.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.270 position:56%
So that is more than enough from me.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.340
It is time to turn everything
over to Adrian and the students.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.510
Thank you guys again for being
here and enjoy listening.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:17.110
[ Applause ]

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.460
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Thank
you for that, Eleanor.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.070
I'm going to sit down because I
got rained on, and you'll notice

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.230
that my pants are all
soaked if I stand up, right?

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.820 position:56%
[laughter] But I'm so glad to be
here, and I don't know where Amy is,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.750
but thank you, Amy, for that too.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.570
I've been really fortunate to
work with Poetry Out Loud for,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.600
I don't know, maybe eight years?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.950
I started out as a local judge in
St. Louis and got to spend time

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.510
with the program that way.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.500
And then I become a regional judge,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.620
and then last year I was
fortunate enough to hear all three

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:52.880
of the amazing performers on stage
right now last April as they --

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.720
I mean, you're going to hear it.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.200
So I thought that what we
might do to start out with,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.370
because this is a program about
poetry and about recitation

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.400
and about inhibiting
a kind of art in a way

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.570
that makes it publicly
accessible, I thought the best way

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:13.690
to begin would be to allow
them to recite a poem for you.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.080
And so then you'll see it,
and then we can talk about it

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.280
after you get a better sense.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.390
Iree do you want to start and
then we'll just go across.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.690
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: Sure.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:40.770
Hi, guys. [laughter]

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.920
"The Golden Shovel"
by Terrance Hayes.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.210
After Gwendolyn Brooks.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:45.970
I. 1981. When I am so small
Da's sock covers my arm,

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:53.950
we cruise at twilight until we
find the place the real men lean,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.780 position:56%
bloodshot and translucent with cool.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:06.550
His smile is a gold-plated
incantation as we drift by women

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:11.240
on bar stools, with nothing left
in them but approachlessness.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.230
This is a school I do not know yet.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:21.830
But the cue sticks mean we are
rubbed by light, smooth as wood,

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.730
the lurk of smoke thinned to song.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.350
We won't be out late.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.570
Standing in the middle

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:41.120
of the streets last night
we watched the moonlit lawns

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.890
and a neighbor strike
his son in the face.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.250
A shadow knocked straight.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:58.110
Da promised to leave me everything:
the shovel we used to bury the dog,

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:03.700
the words he loved to
sing, his rusted pistol,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.780
his squeaky Bible, his sin.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.790
The boy's sneakers
were light on the road.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:16.950
We watched him run to us
looking wounded and thin.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.570
He'd been caught lying or
drinking his father's gin.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.660
He'd been defending his
ma, trying to be a man.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:32.600
We stood in the road, and
my father talked about jazz,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.060
how sometimes a tune
is born of outrage.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.260
By June the boy would
be locked upstate.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.890
That night we got down
on our knees in my room.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.410
If I should die before I wake.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.310
Da said to me, it will be too soon.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.590 position:56%
II. 1991 Into the tented city we go,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.710
weakened by the fire's
ethereal afterglow.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.230 position:56%
Born lost and cooler than heartache.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.130
What we know is what we know.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.550
The left hand severed and
schooled by cleverness.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.850
A plate of weekdays cooking.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.150
The hour lurking in the afterglow.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.450
A late night chant.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:10.750
Into the city we go.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.050
Close your eyes and strike a blow.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.350
Light can be straightened
by its shadow.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.650
What we break is what we hold.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.950
A singular blue note.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.250 position:56%
An outcry singed exiting the throat.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.550
We push until we thin, thinking
we won't creep back again.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.850
While God licks his kin, we
sing until our blood is jazz,

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.150
we swing from June to June.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.450
We sweat to keep from weeping.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.750
Groomed on a diet of
hunger, we end too soon.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.550
Thank you.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.260
[ Applause ]

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.560
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
That's really wonderful.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.380
And the poem that Iree just
recited, "The Golden Shovel,"

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.220
is based on a poem by
Gwendolyn Brooks too.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.850
So the end of each line is a word

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.870
from Gwendolyn Brooks'
poem "We Real Cool."

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.310
It's a really wonderful
kind of take on form,

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.020 position:56%
and then also just a beautiful poem.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.620 position:56%
I really want to ask you about that,

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.600
but I know we have this
little bit of time.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.090
[laughter] So it's a whole
conversation I'd love

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.730
to have around these poems.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.280
But let's -- thank you for that.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.580
Nick, would you like to go?

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.880
&gt;&gt; Nick Amador: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.900
"Lions" by Sandra McPherson.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.700
Lions don't need your help.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.490
In the Serengeti, for instance,

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.090 position:56%
one thousand like the very rich hold
sway over more than Connecticut.

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.440
The mane of the lion, like the
hooked jaw of the male salmon,

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.370
acts as a shield for defense and
is the gift of sexual selection.

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:29.290
His eyes are fathomless amber.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.980
The lion is the most
social of the big cats.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.860
Pride members are affectionate
among themselves.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.540
They rub cheeks when they meet.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.000
They rest and hunt together.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.780
And cubs suckle indiscriminately.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.360
But strangers or members

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.110
of a neighboring pride
are not usually accepted.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.530
If a pride male meets a
strange female he may greet her

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:55.590
in a friendly fashion
and even mate with her,

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.530
but the pride females
will drive her off.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.760
Male lions, usually depicted
as indolent freeloaders

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.530
who let the lionesses do all the
hunting, are not mere parasites.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:10.510
They maintain the integrity
of the territory.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.490
Lions eat communally but
completely lack table manners.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.250
Indeed, lions give the impression

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.980
that their evolution toward a
social existence is incomplete,

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.290
that cooperation in
achieving a task does not

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.600
yet include the equal
division of the spoils.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.880
More bad news: lions
are not good parents.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.410
But prowess, that they have.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.820
Their courage comes
from being built,

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.410
like an automobile, for power.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:47.950 position:56%
A visible lion is usually a safe
lion, but one should never feel safe

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:56.490
because almost always there
is something one can't see.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:01.410
Given protection and power a
lion does not need to be clever.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.690
Now, lions are not
the most likable kind

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.970
of animal unless you are
a certain type of person.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.820
That is, not necessarily leonine
in the sense of manly or ferocious,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.460
but one who wouldn't mind resting
twenty of twenty-four hours a day

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.300
and who is not beyond
stealing someone else's kill

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.080
about half the time.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.960
Lions are not my favorite kind
of animal, gazelles seem nicer,

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.860
[laughter] A zebra has his
own sort of appealing pathos,

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.550
especially when he is
sure prey for the lion.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.160
Lions have little to
offer the spirit.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.760
If we made of ourselves
parks and placed the lion

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.770 position:56%
in the constituent he most
resembled, he would be in our blood.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.510
Thank you.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:58.050
[ Applause ]

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.570
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: A visible
lion is usually a safe lion?

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.870
Is that the line?

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.870
[laughter] I'm going
to take that with me.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.480
[laughter] I think it's wonderful
to have "The Golden Shovel,"

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.070
and then Sandra McPherson's poem
one after another to see the range,

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.420
not only of poetry in
its own, but also the way

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:22.250
in which these young performers
have taken advantage of the kind

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.400
of tone of poetry to share.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.140
It's really great.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.750
Thank you for that.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.970
Samara, would you like to go ahead?

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.780
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: "The
Farmer" by W.D. Ehrhart.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:48.180
Each day I go into the
fields to see what is growing

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.770
and what remains to be done.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:59.560
It is always the same
thing: nothing is growing,

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.770
everything needs to be done.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:10.940
Plow, harrow, disc, water,
pray till my bones ache

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.340
and hands rub blood-raw
with honest labor.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:23.340
All that grows is the slow
intransigent intensity of need.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:30.060
I have sown my seed on soil
guaranteed by poverty to fail.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:34.370
But I don't complain,
except to passersby

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:39.030
who ask me why I work
such barren earth.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:45.070
They would not understand me if I
stooped to lift a rock and hold it

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.050
like a child, or laughed,

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:54.570
or told them it is their
poverty I labor to relieve.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.060
For them, I complain.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:05.350
A farmer of dreams
knows how to pretend.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:13.210
A farmer of dreams knows
what it means to be patient.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.520
Each day I go into the fields.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:27.200
[ Applause ]

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.500
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
[laughing] Oh, that's so good.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.660
Thank you for that,
all three of you.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.230
So "A farmer of dreams
knows how to pretend."

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.020
What a wonderful metaphor.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.150
Can you talk a little bit about
how you selected that poem,

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.710
and then maybe we could
spin this in.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.250
I know there's 900 poems
you can choose from.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:47.340
So maybe talk a little bit about
what drew you to that to start

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.460
out with, because that's important.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.280
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: "The Farmer"
was the last poem that I choose,

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.980
because for the competition, each
student has to have three poems.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.960
So I chose "Novel" by Arthur
Rimbaud, "Dream Song 14"

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.740
by John Berryman, and
then "The Farmer."

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.180
And I needed a different tone.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.380
I had a youthful conversational
tone with "Novel."

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.580
And more sarcastic and cynical
tone with Berryman's poem.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.220
So I wanted something that
was a little bit deeper,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.400
a little bit darker.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.520
And this poem is about
perseverance and struggles.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.440
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: And it
feels very timely too, right?

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.310 position:56%
I think one of the great gifts of
poetry is it can be timeless, right?

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.320
It's the kind of that you could
-- if it was written in 1800,

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.960
it could still matter now because
those basic things, need and want

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.290
and love, they sort
of transcend, right?

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:51.490
The trick is figuring out how to
offer that message to someone.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.240
Did you read poems before
you started in this program?

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.540
Or was this something that the
program kind of get you going?

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.880
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: Did
I read them out loud?

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.180
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
Well, just in general.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.480
Where you a fan of
poetry to start out?

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.780
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: Oh, I was.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.080
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah?

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.380
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: Yeah.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.680
I read poetry a little bit.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.980
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: See,
this is the thing, right?

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.680
You know, I'm just going to confess
now that when I was in high school,

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.360
I was busy doing everything
possible not to read.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.880
[laughter] So when I spend
time with people who are

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.590
so much more sophisticated than I
was, I just think, wait a minute?

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.710
You knew about po-- I didn't
even find out about poetry

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.500
until high school,
but I thought poetry

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.370
and rap music were the same thing.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.110
[laughter] So then probably
since you came into it that way,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.280
since you already knew
about poems, is there a--

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.830
has the program, working in this
program at all changed the way

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.360
that you imagine a
poem to work or to be?

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.660
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: It has.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.960
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.260
How so?

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.560
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: Now I know
that poetry is really alive.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.860
You know, you hear your
English teachers tell you

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.440
that literature is timeless and
poetry lives and all this stuff.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.040
And it sounds like it makes
sense, but I didn't believe it

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.410
until I started in Poetry Out Loud

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.620
and until I made the
poem come alive.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.530
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah,
that's really wonderful.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.830
What about you, Nick?

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.090
Had you been reading poems
before this or was this something

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.160
that you came to through
Poetry Out Loud?

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.460
&gt;&gt; Nick Amador: Yeah.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.090
I-- I don't know.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.450
Poetry was never a huge part of
my life until Poetry Out Loud.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.050
I'm an actor, so I had
done a lot of theatre.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.350
And I think part of the reason that
I started with Poetry Out Loud is

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:22.940
because I love being in front
of people and I love talking.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:28.810
[laughter] So I think that is why
I got involved in Poetry Out Loud.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.950
But poems are like
friends, you know?

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.230
You have to spend time
with them in order

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.620
to realize not only what they
mean, but what they mean to you

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.700
as an individual and how you
can try your best to do justice

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.570
to that message and make sure

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.090
that other people understand
what it means to you

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.390
through the way that you speak it.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.540
So Poetry Out Loud has
allowed me to understand poems

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.840
in a completely different way.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.320
I have a totally changed

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.180
and improved appreciation
for what poetry is.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.480
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.780
And you get to come to D.C.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.310
&gt;&gt; Nick Amador: And I get to come
to D.C. [laughter] It's far away.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.610
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: It's really far.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.310
I think you-- this was your second
year in the finals group too,

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.610
or the regional group, right?

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.910
&gt;&gt; Nick Amador: Yes.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:17.320
Yeah. So this past spring
was-- I won second place,

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.430
and that was the second time
that I had made it to nationals.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.980
The year before, I
had won third place.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.280
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.580
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
Yeah, it's always--

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.440
so I got the opportunity to
hear Nick two years in a row

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.320
and he was wonderful both times.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:34.440
It's not surprising that the
process of articulating poetry

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.040
or reciting poetry would speak
to you as a theatre major too.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.160
Because some poems are
just monologues, right?

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.830
So you have the opportunity-- the
best poetry, and I think all three

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:49.630
of you display this -- communicates
and it shares a kind of thing

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.670
in the truest sense, right?

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:55.130
There's poems that require
digging in and learning and reading

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:59.450
and re-reading, but for me, the
greatest poems offer themselves up.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:03.000
And we can assist in that
in some way as readers.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.730
Iree, did you read
poetry before this

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.130
or was this a new thing for you?

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.220
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: This
was a very new thing.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.890
[laughter] I have never really gone

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.450
into poetry before,
even in high school.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.690
I've never read a poem
and gone into it

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.090
until my teacher was
like, "How about this?

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.390
Join Poetry Out Loud."

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.690
And I was like, okay.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.700
And then that's when
poetry kind of stuck with me

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.470
and I understood what poetry meant.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.930
I looked at it in a different
way, and I really got into it more

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.780 position:56%
than any piece of literature really.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:44.700
And I spent my most time looking
at poems, learning about poets.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.920
And it was a whole different world.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.780
So I enjoyed it very much.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.080
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
Wow, that's great.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.790 position:56%
The idea too of discovering this
new art, it's the oldest art, right?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.090
This is the thing.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:00.050
It's the oldest form of literature,
and it comes from the tradition

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.350
that we're sharing, right?

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.560
It's the oral tradition
or hearing a story told,

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.410
and it's so wonderful
to embrace that again.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.090
I've had this theory that keeps
not being true, that at some point,

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.140
poetry's going to become the
most popular art form ever.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.950
[laughter] Because it's short.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.780
[laughs] And so, you know, I'm
like, okay, there's this thing.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.080
You have it all right there.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.000
It doesn't take three weeks,
like it takes to read a novel.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.390
It's for you.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.570
It gives itself to you in
a short period of time.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.630
But somehow, that just
keeps not being the case.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.690
[laughter] So do you
have a favorite poem,

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.150
now that you've spent
all of this time?

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.450
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: You know what?

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.740
I've-- my favorite poems right
now, I've spent the most time

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.770
with the three poems that I
picked for Poetry Out Loud.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.870
And I think I understand
them so much more

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.750
than the other poems
that I've looked at.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.680
And I mean, they've been in
my backpack for the longest.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.180
They've been in my
pocket for the longest.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.690
[laughter] I mean, so those
are my favorite poems.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.440
I think it's the most
thing that I've put my time

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.980
into because they've stuck with
me for a very long time now.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.630
And yeah, I would say those are
my favorite poems right now.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:05.930
[laughs]

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.230
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah, those
are good poems to appreciate.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.530
So what were the other two?

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.730
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: So "Break
of Day" by John Donne

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.550
and also "American
Smooth" by Rita Dove.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.850
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
Oh, that's so great.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.870
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: Yeah, they're all
kind of different from each other.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.170
Yeah.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.470
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: But all
very sonically pleasing, right?

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.770
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: Right, yeah.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.070
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: I think
that that's also the great gift

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.010
of this is that there's a-- just
in this list that Iree gave us,

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.540
it spans centuries, right?

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.840
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: Yes.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.140
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: And
poetry is so timeless,

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.930
you can have John Donne next to
Rita Dove and they don't seem

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.280
in opposition in any
really wonderful way.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.580
Nick, what about you?

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.840
What's your favorite poem or
your favorite poet right now?

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.600
&gt;&gt; Nick Amador: My favorite
poem is "The Love Song

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.930
of J. Alfred Prufrock"
by T.S. Eliot.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.230
[laughter]

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.530
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.860
It was -- I think that
was the first poem

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.310 position:56%
that I was just like, wait a minute?

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.170
You can do that with language?

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.500
I think it's like,
"I should be a pair

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:55.380
of ragged claws scuttling
across the silent seas."

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.680
It was over for me once I
started to access it like that.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.750
Do you remember any of the poem?

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.050
&gt;&gt; Nick Amador: I do.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.350
Yeah. Just the beginning,

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.830
because that's what captured me
right away is "Let us go then,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.720
you and I, when the evening
is spread out across the sky

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.580
like a patient etherized
upon a table."

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.570
And the first time that
I read those words,

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.900
in an English class actually,
I was just like, what?

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.200
[laughter] Yeah, it's
the same thing.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.500
Like, you can do that?

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.440
And the reason that it's my
favorite poem is because, you know,

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.450
it is a really long one, so
there's a lot to digest with it.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:32.360
But I think that the purpose of
art is storytelling, and really,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.590
really good art can
familiarize the unfamiliar.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.760
But really great art can
defamiliarize the familiar.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.200
You know, like William Carlos
Williams' "Red Wheelbarrow."

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.000
That's kind of an infamous
example because I mean,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.670
everybody knows what a wheelbarrow
looks like, but just this --

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:52.240
something about the way that
he writes it, it's like,

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.760
do I know what a wheelbarrow is?

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.060
[laughter]

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.580
But "The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock" takes --

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.590
I mean, like, it takes
the idea of life

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:05.460
and just completely
tosses it on its head.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.080
And the way that it
does it is so beautiful.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.380
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.680
And I mean -- that's great.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.270
Do you agree with that, Samara?

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.080
That that's what art can do?

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.470
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: Yeah, I've
never heard it said like that.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:17.860
That was beautifully put.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.160
But yeah--

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.010
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: I saw you nod
and I was like, yeah, we're here,

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.310
like [inaudible] [laughter].

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.610
So what's your favorite
poem right now?

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.910
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: One
of my favorite poems,

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.760
because I don't think
I have just one.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.060
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah, good.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.360
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: It's one

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.780
that I recited maybe two
years ago at Poetry Out Loud.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.300
What's it?

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.540
"A Locked House" by W.D. Snodgrass.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:45.910 position:56%
Yeah. It's about this love that kind
of falls apart, but it's told kind

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.910
of as a metaphor about a house
that is deteriorating over time.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.210
So--

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.510
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah,
that's really wonderful.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.810
Do you remember any of it?

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.110
Could you--

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.410
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: I remember
the last stanza, yeah.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.030
"The house still stands, locked,

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.350
as it stood untouched a good
two years after you went.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.110
Some things passed
in the settlement;

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.760
some things slipped away.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.770
Enough's left that I
come back sometimes.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.800
The theft and vandalism
were our own.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:22.620
Maybe we should have known."

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.920
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Wow,
that's really great.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.220
[laughing]

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.040
[ Applause ]

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.340
So you know, we talked a little bit

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.650
about this before we started
the program, and I was like,

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.450
okay, who remembers poems?

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.110
Because I don't remember any poems.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.910
I remember like a line
here, a line there.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.270
This is what -- my job.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.570
I'm a professor.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.380
I teach poetry every day, and I
still don't know more than a line

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.920
or two here or there, right?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.690
[laughter] That's what all
my sheets of notes are for.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.010
But I come up, and like, oh, yeah,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.580
we've got these memorized,
no problem.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:53.230
[laughter] And so not only --
well, it makes me feel really --

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.330
it makes me feel about
where poetry is going to be

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.040
and where it's going
to go, continuing.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.150
And we're going to run out of
time here in just a second.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.100
So I left them with --
I want to leave them

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.950
with one really tough question,

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.430
because I know they can
handle this question.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:11.100
So I think quite a bit about what
a poem is and what it can do.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.930
But what's the difference,
do you think,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.200
and I'll just start
with you, Samara.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.560
What's the difference
between you know, poetry and,

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.030
I don't know, like a YouTube video?

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:24.830
And what can poems do that
YouTube or a photograph

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.700
or something like that cannot do?

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.000
[laughing]

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.840
&gt;&gt; Samara Huggins: One of the
reasons that I love poetry is

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.260
because it is so concise.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:42.700 position:56%
The poet has a select amount of
words that they decide they can use,

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.800
but they have to convey so much
emotion and a story and passion.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.140
And they have to do that in
such a short set of words.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.230
And the structure matters so much.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:58.880
And I think that in a video,
you can see everything.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.800
Everything is in front
of your eyes at once.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.590 position:56%
But with poetry, you have to dissect
it and it can mean so much more.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.890
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.630
Yeah, well that is very personal
in that way, so you can own it.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.930
That's great.

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.230
Nick, what about you?

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.530
Same question.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:19.800
&gt;&gt; Nick Amador: Yeah, I think
other mediums, like YouTube videos,

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.280
you know, like books, like
paintings, they're really good

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:31.120
at taking something abstract
and making it accessible.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.830
And poetry does do
that to an extent,

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:36.420
but what sets poetry apart
is its ability to, you know,

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.050
like I said before, defamiliarize
the familiar; take something

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.010
that you're used to, writing about
something completely ordinary

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:47.720
and finding the things
that are abstract about it

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:53.880
and creating new worlds
from ordinary experiences.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.520
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah,
that's really wonderful.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.260
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: Yeah, I think
poetry, it gives you--

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.960
you can visualize everything
for yourself.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.160 position:56%
A video, it's already there for you.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.140
You're watching it, you've already
seen someone else's perspective,

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.500
but you can have those, you know,

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.930
your own thoughts and
your own imaginary.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.140
And you can make up anything.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.440
It's your own world.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.740 position:56%
I think that's why it's so intimate.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.790
And also, a photograph,
it's just a moment.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.490
And I think poetry,
it's a whole story.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.790
You know, it's your own world.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.150
You can create it however you want.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.110
And I think that's
the difference for me.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.410
[laughs]

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.710
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.010
No, it's so true.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.310
That's really wonderful.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.610
And that is-- that is great.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:39.910
I am so proud of the work-- like
I had anything to do with it.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.590
I had nothing to do with the
work the three of you have done.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.040
[laughter] But I'm
so proud of the way

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.690
that you represent poetry, right?

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:48.070
There are people in the audience
who actually can help take credit

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.410
for maybe supporting a little bit.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.000
But you all did the work
and you learned these poems

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.230
and recited them beautifully.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.680
And thank you so much for your work

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.510
and for sharing your
poems with us today.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:07.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.250 position:56%
Okay. So-- how much time do we have?

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:11.550
Ten minutes?

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.850
Okay. So we have just
a little bit of time,

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.380
and I wanted to close everything
out with, if this is okay,

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.870
asking you each to
recite one last poem?

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.890
Can we do that?

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.670
She's like, I'm closing in now,
I thought I was ready to go.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.670
[laughter] If you don't want to,

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.940
I mean I was hoping
we would have time.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.240
But can we do that?

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.720
&gt;&gt; Nick Amador: I don't
think I know one.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.020
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
Okay, that's okay.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.320
That's all right.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.620
[laughter] So I'll tell you what.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.920
&gt;&gt; Just go.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.220
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Okay, so --

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.520
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: Yeah, I can.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.820
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: And hey, listen,

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.120
this is going to be
the last thing we do.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.420
And thank you all so much
for coming and listening.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.720
We really appreciate it.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.020
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: Sure.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.320
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Thank you, Iree.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.060
Sorry to put you on the spot.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.760
&gt;&gt; Iree Mann: Hi, guys, again.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.450
[laughter] "Break of
Day" by John Donne.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:04.060
'Tis true, 'tis day,
what though it be?

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.740
O wilt thou therefore rise from me?

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.500
Why should we rise
because 'tis light?

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.320 position:56%
Did we lie down because 'twas night?

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.510 position:56%
Love, which in spite of darkness
brought us hither, should in despite

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.860
of light keep us together.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:30.760
Light hath no tongue, but is all
eye; If it could speak as well

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.830
as spy, this were the
worst that it could say,

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:39.210
that being well I fain should
stay, and that I loved my heart

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:46.370
and honour so, that I would not
from him, that had them, go.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:52.650
Must business thee
from hence remove?

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:59.870 position:56%
Oh, that's the worst disease of
love, The poor, the foul, the false,

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:05.740
love can admit, but
not the busied man.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:16.440
He which hath business, and
makes love, doth do such wrong,

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:21.740
as when a married man doth woo.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:29.040
[ Applause ]

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.090
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Ladies and
gentlemen, your 2017 winners

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.090
of Poetry Out Loud, here they are.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.010
Incredible.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.730
[ Applause ]

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.380

of the Library of Congress.
