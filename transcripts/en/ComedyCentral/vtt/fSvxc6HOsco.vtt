00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:07.174
AS WE JUMP TO OUR NEXT
GAME, FUTURE HASHTAG WARS.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:20.787
&gt;&gt; TONIGHT IS ACTUALLY OUR 300TH
EPISODE OF @MIDNIGHT.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.824
I POSED FOR THAT FOR LIKE FIVE
HOURS AND I THINK THEY WERE

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.093
A LITTLE CONSERVATIVE AROUND
THIS AREA BUT OTHERWISE I THINK

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.828
THEY DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.430
THIS MEANS WE BASICALLY HAD TO
COME UP WITH 300 DIFFERENT

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.133
HASHTAG WARS.
I GOTTA BE HONEST, WE THOUGHT

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.402
THE EVENT HORIZON OF US
RUNNING OUT OF THOSE WOULD HAVE

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:39.239
HAPPENED A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:42.042
COMING UP WITH HASHTAGS IS NOT
EASY, AND IF YOU FORGOT THAT,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.811
REMEMBER WE JUST DID
#BADTRAMPSTAMPS THIS EPISODE

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.114
ALONE.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.216
SO COMEDIANS, YOU GUYS ARE OLD
PROS. WE COULD USE SOME HELP

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.884
CLEARLY, SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO
COME UP WITH AS MANY

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:55.055
IDEAS FOR FUTURE HASHTAG WARS
THAT WE WILL USE AS YOU CAN.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.858
I'M GONNA PUT 60 SECONDS ON THE
CLOCK AND BEGIN.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.092

&gt;&gt; Chris: YES.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:52.179
THAT'S THE END OF FUTURE HASHTAG
WARS.
