00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.880
Hey Charles.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.780
&gt;&gt; Hey Michael.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; So like I get to lecture near you today.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.290
&gt;&gt; Yes you do. I can even see you.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.250
&gt;&gt; This is, this is crazy. I sort of don't

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.230
have my regular pad. This makes me a little uncomfortable.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.310
&gt;&gt; But you look very dashing in your nice blue suit.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.520
&gt;&gt; Thanks. We're going to record some live action stuff today.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.510
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.950
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right so. Do you remember

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.150
last time we were talking about Bayesian learning?

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.550
&gt;&gt; I do, because I led that.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt; Right. Good point.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.130
And so one of the questions that I asked as a follow-up was, these

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.160
quantities, these probabilistic quantities that we're working

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.420
with. Is there's anything that we need to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.790
know about how to represent and reason with them. And you said that I should

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.840
look into it. Yeah, because I, I just, I yeah you should look into it.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.130
&gt;&gt; So I did. So, and it's cool. And so

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.720
I figured it would be fun to tell you about it.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, well I look forward to it.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.220
&gt;&gt; Thanks! And also I want to point out, we're

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.980
using a different color scheme today. Isn't that a nice blue?

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.290
&gt;&gt; It is a nice blue, its sort

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.260
of a relaxing blue. As opposed to that blue blue that we used before.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.310
&gt;&gt; It's like Cerulean... Is it?

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.730
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.900
&gt;&gt; It's more like periwinkle.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.580
&gt;&gt; No, it's definitely not periwinkle.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.430
&gt;&gt; Oh you're right, it's not periwinkle. Periwinkle's a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.010
&gt;&gt; Navy.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.270
&gt;&gt; No, it's too light to be navy.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.570
&gt;&gt; All right, so so good, so right. It turns out that there's this concept

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.240
called Bayesian Networks, which is this wonderful

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.410
representation for representing and manipulating probabilistic quantities over

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.170
complex spaces. And so it fits in really well

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.760
with the stuff you were talking about last time.
