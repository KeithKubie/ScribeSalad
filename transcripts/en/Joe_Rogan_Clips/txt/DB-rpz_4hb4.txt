Speaker 1:          00:00          Happen. The Joe Rogan experience. Do you a I used to live in, in La. Where are you at now? I moved back to Hickory, North Carolina. Damn. I was out here 18 years. Just couldn't do it anymore. No, well it was a couple things. You know, my career has always been like a roller coaster and good years, bad years. And um, I actually just add miss, I miss my family. I haven't, you know, I missed out on a lot growing up, you know, so, and the market was really good. I had this condo in studio city. I bought it for a certain amount and then it's, it's, it gained value. And I thought, well, this is, if I'm going to do this, now's the time to pull the trigger. And I think I saw you at the, I'm probably not saying I'm Outta here. I'm bouncing and I, uh, my goal, the road so much.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Right? Yeah. Well that's the thing too. And the industry's changed. Like, you know, I already have a manager and an agent. It's not like I need to be here for every little audition, you know, I'll, I'll put myself on tape. I got eastbound and down on a tape, I got Harold and Kumar on a tape, you know, and then now the second audition, yeah. You flop for it. But like, you know, getting your foot in the door to that tape. But I can do that now later. It's just changed so much. That's if you want to act and you do so much stand up on the road, there's really no reason to be here unless you just want to perform at the store all the time. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, and I moved back to Hickory and I was going to get myself a nice lake house in Lake Hickory.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Yup. Still want to do that. But then as soon as I get home, you know, thanksgiving dad has a stroke. So I see that happen that you ever seen someone who had a stroke there when an APP, I was looking right at him and it was weird because my dad's a funny guy. Like I thought maybe because we were going to eat Thanksgiving dinner late, like it was like a 6:00 PM thing we were doing to get other people in the house. And so he was complaining all day about not eating like I'm hungry. We were, we were, we going to eat, we're not going to eat. And I'm looking around anatomy sitting next to the fireplace and he just like, he just like nose dives but just head first right into the hardwood floor. And it was like pumped. You hear like a thump. And I was like, Oh, dad's making a joke.

Speaker 1:          02:05          We haven't eaten yet. It's a, you know, he's making the thing about like a low blood sugar or something. And I was kind of laughing at my brother's like, no, he hit really hard. His head hit that floor way too hard for that to be a jug. And then you walk over to him and arms curling up one eyes going like that and it's like, this is a stroke. And we called nine one one they came pretty quick, but they suffered some serious brain damage right here. And so he's paralyzed. Was left side now, but I was in a weird way, happy that I was at home when this happened because you know how was still out here and that should happen. Right? Be Be hating life. Yeah. But the fact that I'm there and able to help mom out, you know, going through it all of this, this whole thing, because she's got glaucoma and she's got brittle bones, you know, she can't physically lift him up and do stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:55          And the fact that we were in the house and able to help, it's crazy. It was, I didn't see the drooping of the face. I didn't see that happen. You know, that's what people say when you see a stroke. You see like the drooping happens. Yeah. Like that, that fat chicken total recall. You know, let's see. We're at explodes. Get rid of her. I was surprise. I thought that I thought that that was why it was, but no, he just hit the floor. So have you toured it all since that or have you just been small places? I can. I didn't take on extra gigs. I, but I didn't cancel the ones I had. So the ones that I could drive to definitely as well. Let me go. I have a brother who's there as well, so, um, but I definitely didn't take on anything for, you know, since Thanksgiving that wasn't already there.

Speaker 1:          03:45          So yeah, it's uh, but he's, he's at a skilled nursing facility now and they showed us the X. Right. You know, the, the, the Mri of the brain damage that happened, he had a collided artery. He's got, now he's keeps getting UTI infections because he has a catheter because it also, it doesn't just fuck with your muscles. It's the organs on that side too. So his bladder has got to relearn how to operate. So he's got a catheter, you know, and that, that that's just opens you up for Uti infections a lot. And those, I don't know if you know, they're like Uti infections when you're older. Like it really devastates you, cause you, you hallucinate. So you see shit. Oh No. Yeah. And it's weird being in there and you know, he would like, uh, I make sure that bears don't out there. I'm like a bear, like he keeps hearing or think there's a bear outside the window.

Speaker 1:          04:35          So yeah. That, that was happening back home for that. But um, are there bears where you live? Not, no, not, not the skilled nursing facility. I mean, there might be some tweaks. Yeah, no bears. I allowed to say twink trouble. He used to be able to just make a joke about that. What's dangerous? Yes. Yeah. No, but uh, yeah. Hoping for the best. Still going through Rehab, occupational therapy, physical therapy. Do they think that he'll be able to recover some function on this left side? I think you know, that they always want to get dangle a little bit of light of hope at the end of the talk. I'll Chase's but uh, you know, some people recover quickly, some people not at all. Some people three years later can recover. You need a, here you go. Yeah. Three years later. I mean, you know, so we're just still, we're still doing all of it.

Speaker 1:          05:28          John Singleton just died from a stroke. That's Rad Shit. Yeah. And he was, was 51 51. Yeah. It can happen to anybody at any age. Luke Perry, same thing. 51 stroke. That's right. Yup. Yeah. Crazy. The lot of strokes or happened. Fuck man. I wonder if those folks smoked cigarettes. Well, my dad definitely did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They send in cigarettes, contribute pretty heavily to strokes. He used to smoke a lot when he was younger and then quit, you know, when he was in his late forties. Um, but that was a lot, you know, in fact in where you'd smoke at 12 years old or something, a whole pack. I don't know if singleton smoked, but I do know Luke Perry did. Yeah. Yeah. And this woman that I talked to who is a neurologist, was telling me that that's a significant factor. It raises your chances of stroke pretty significantly. Yeah. So I'm back in here, cream, but I came, I'm going to come my ideas to come out here. You know how that season keep doing it, right? Yeah. Right. And then hit the store. I was there last night was fun. It was good seeing you, man. You too, man.
