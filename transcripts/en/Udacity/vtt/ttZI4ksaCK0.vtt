00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.495
Functions for exponential growth and exponential decay have some major

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:08.180
differences. But they're also very closely connected as we've just seen.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.938
There's one small similarity that we haven't discussed yet, though. All

00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:15.898
functions of the form f of x equals a to the x, where of course, a is greater

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:23.684
than 0 and not equal to 1. Have the same y intercept. What is it? Well, you can

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:30.496
plug in zero for X to find out. Please put its coordinates here.
