00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.050
I'm gonna I'm gonna have to find a copy
all right get down I feel the presence

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:48.060
all right get down I feel the presence
 

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.800
all right get down I feel the presence
of an actual time stone hmm yeah is it

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:51.810
of an actual time stone hmm yeah is it
 

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:52.430
of an actual time stone hmm yeah is it
the most

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440

everyone keeps talking about because I
 

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:02.900
everyone keeps talking about because I
think the quantum realm is the gauntlets

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:02.910
think the quantum realm is the gauntlets
 

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.810

the advantage of having characters that
 

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.529
the advantage of having characters that
are also for the most part intrinsically

00:40:55.529 --> 00:40:55.539
