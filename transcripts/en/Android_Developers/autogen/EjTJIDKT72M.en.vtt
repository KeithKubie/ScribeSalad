coming everyone my name is Nick butcher
I'm an Android designer and developer

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460
I'm an Android designer and developer
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.579
I'm an Android designer and developer
and I'm here today to talk to you about

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589
and I'm here today to talk to you about
 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.410
and I'm here today to talk to you about
the material design principles about

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420
the material design principles about
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.540
the material design principles about
understanding and building them we've

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
understanding and building them we've
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.009
understanding and building them we've
got a lot to cover I want to teach you a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
got a lot to cover I want to teach you a
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.230
got a lot to cover I want to teach you a
lot of stuff today so let's get started

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
lot of stuff today so let's get started
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.960
lot of stuff today so let's get started
so material design who's heard of it

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
so material design who's heard of it
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.570
so material design who's heard of it
hopefully everyone and so introduced at

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
hopefully everyone and so introduced at
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.220
hopefully everyone and so introduced at
Google i/o a couple of years ago right

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
Google i/o a couple of years ago right
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.340
Google i/o a couple of years ago right
and an amazing design system for helping

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
and an amazing design system for helping
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.560
and an amazing design system for helping
you build incredible consistent usable

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
you build incredible consistent usable
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.810
you build incredible consistent usable
apps and one of the things that I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
apps and one of the things that I
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.790
apps and one of the things that I
personally really really like about

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
personally really really like about
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.100
personally really really like about
material design and I think sets it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
material design and I think sets it
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.930
material design and I think sets it
apart from other design systems out

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
apart from other design systems out
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.610
apart from other design systems out
there is this it has these principles it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
there is this it has these principles it
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889
there is this it has these principles it
has these kind of it strives to go

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
has these kind of it strives to go
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.720
has these kind of it strives to go
beyond what a lot of design systems do

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
beyond what a lot of design systems do
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.459
beyond what a lot of design systems do
out there it tries to answer the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
out there it tries to answer the
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.860
out there it tries to answer the
question what is the the material that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
question what is the the material that
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.229
question what is the the material that
your UI is actually built out of it

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
your UI is actually built out of it
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.360
your UI is actually built out of it
provides these guidelines which describe

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
provides these guidelines which describe
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.910
provides these guidelines which describe
the world that your UI lives in it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
the world that your UI lives in it's
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950
the world that your UI lives in it's
kind of like how we have the laws of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
kind of like how we have the laws of
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.779
kind of like how we have the laws of
physics in the real world which you know

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
physics in the real world which you know
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.979
physics in the real world which you know
once you understand the laws of physics

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
once you understand the laws of physics
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.750
once you understand the laws of physics
they can be applied to other situations

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
they can be applied to other situations
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329
they can be applied to other situations
it's the same in the UI world if you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
it's the same in the UI world if you
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830
it's the same in the UI world if you
have this kind of level of consistency

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
have this kind of level of consistency
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800
have this kind of level of consistency
underneath things it means that patterns

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
underneath things it means that patterns
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.090
underneath things it means that patterns
learn in one place can be applied

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
learn in one place can be applied
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.330
learn in one place can be applied
elsewhere while material design is very

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
elsewhere while material design is very
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190
elsewhere while material design is very
wide-ranging it kind of gives you a lot

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
wide-ranging it kind of gives you a lot
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350
wide-ranging it kind of gives you a lot
of patterns and components to to work

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
of patterns and components to to work
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.640
of patterns and components to to work
with to build your UI eyes with no

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
with to build your UI eyes with no
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.980
with to build your UI eyes with no
design system can be like comprehensive

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
design system can be like comprehensive
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.300
design system can be like comprehensive
it can't kind of think of every single

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
it can't kind of think of every single
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149
it can't kind of think of every single
situation every use case that your app

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
situation every use case that your app
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.819
situation every use case that your app
is trying to solve for but by having

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
is trying to solve for but by having
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.249
is trying to solve for but by having
some underlying principles some kind of

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259
some underlying principles some kind of
 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230
some underlying principles some kind of
like consistency underneath if you try

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
like consistency underneath if you try
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.390
like consistency underneath if you try
and stick to these when you solve your

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
and stick to these when you solve your
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.910
and stick to these when you solve your
particular use case and it'll feel

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
particular use case and it'll feel
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620
particular use case and it'll feel
consistent with the other components and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
consistent with the other components and
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.819
consistent with the other components and
patterns out there making for a better

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
patterns out there making for a better
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.780
patterns out there making for a better
experience for everyone but the problem

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
experience for everyone but the problem
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.160
experience for everyone but the problem
with the principles is that they're

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
with the principles is that they're
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.980
with the principles is that they're
somewhat abstract I feel sometimes it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
somewhat abstract I feel sometimes it
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.810
somewhat abstract I feel sometimes it
can be hard to understand exactly how

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
can be hard to understand exactly how
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.120
can be hard to understand exactly how
they apply to your application so like

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
they apply to your application so like
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.590
they apply to your application so like
today to talk to you about this this is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
today to talk to you about this this is
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630
today to talk to you about this this is
an application I built and called plaid

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
an application I built and called plaid
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.289
an application I built and called plaid
and which attempts to embody these

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
and which attempts to embody these
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.899
and which attempts to embody these
principles so by discussing some

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
principles so by discussing some
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.270
principles so by discussing some
concrete examples of applying the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
concrete examples of applying the
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.249
concrete examples of applying the
principles I hope to help you to develop

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
principles I hope to help you to develop
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.919
principles I hope to help you to develop
a better understanding of what they are

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929
a better understanding of what they are
 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.510
a better understanding of what they are
to understand how they can actually help

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
to understand how they can actually help
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.960
to understand how they can actually help
improve your application

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970
improve your application
 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.330
improve your application
as well as teach you how to build them

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
as well as teach you how to build them
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.170
as well as teach you how to build them
on Android so um a couple of things this

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
on Android so um a couple of things this
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.600
on Android so um a couple of things this
app is completely open source so you can

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610
app is completely open source so you can
 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.180
app is completely open source so you can
grab the source code on github or you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190
grab the source code on github or you
 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.890
grab the source code on github or you
can join this India at the moment on the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900
can join this India at the moment on the
 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.030
can join this India at the moment on the
Play Store which you can join up that

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
Play Store which you can join up that
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.330
Play Store which you can join up that
top link this app also I want to call

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
top link this app also I want to call
 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.730
top link this app also I want to call
out uses a minimum SDK of 21 it's a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740
out uses a minimum SDK of 21 it's a
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.950
out uses a minimum SDK of 21 it's a
lollipop and Beyond app I did that

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960
lollipop and Beyond app I did that
 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.380
lollipop and Beyond app I did that
mostly to kind of unburden myself and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390
mostly to kind of unburden myself and
 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.700
mostly to kind of unburden myself and
backwards-compatibility to see what we

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710
backwards-compatibility to see what we
 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.290
backwards-compatibility to see what we
could build but there are efforts going

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300
could build but there are efforts going
 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.240
could build but there are efforts going
on actually mostly driven by amazing

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250
on actually mostly driven by amazing
 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.740
on actually mostly driven by amazing
third-party contributions so there's a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750
third-party contributions so there's a
 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.210
third-party contributions so there's a
backport branch which actually brings it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220
backport branch which actually brings it
 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.420
backport branch which actually brings it
all the way back to api 17 and so yeah

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430
all the way back to api 17 and so yeah
 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.570
all the way back to api 17 and so yeah
let's crack on with the application so

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580
let's crack on with the application so
 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.190
let's crack on with the application so
let's go through the material principles

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200
let's go through the material principles
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.740
let's go through the material principles
one time and let's see how we can

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750
one time and let's see how we can
 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.570
one time and let's see how we can
actually make the application better and

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580
actually make the application better and
 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.780
actually make the application better and
how to build those things so the first

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
how to build those things so the first
 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.070
how to build those things so the first
material principle is the idea of

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080
material principle is the idea of
 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.800
material principle is the idea of
material tangible surfaces so this is

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810
material tangible surfaces so this is
 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.390
material tangible surfaces so this is
the idea that everything in your UI

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400
the idea that everything in your UI
 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.270
the idea that everything in your UI
lives within a surface and these

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280
lives within a surface and these
 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.530
lives within a surface and these
surfaces can have you know different

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540
surfaces can have you know different
 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.360
surfaces can have you know different
sizes and shapes and elevations and so

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370
sizes and shapes and elevations and so
 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.190
sizes and shapes and elevations and so
on now surfaces really really help you

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200
on now surfaces really really help you
 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.290
on now surfaces really really help you
to they tap into pop your brain which

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300
to they tap into pop your brain which
 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.940
to they tap into pop your brain which
recognizes that one thing is separate to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950
recognizes that one thing is separate to
 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.350
recognizes that one thing is separate to
another we call that kind of tangible

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360
another we call that kind of tangible
 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.300
another we call that kind of tangible
objects that means you can see that a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310
objects that means you can see that a
 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.680
objects that means you can see that a
button is going to be you know a tap

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690
button is going to be you know a tap
 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.479
button is going to be you know a tap
target or that one surface is going to

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489
target or that one surface is going to
 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.570
target or that one surface is going to
move past each each other it's also

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580
move past each each other it's also
 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.190
move past each each other it's also
really helpful for providing hierarchy

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200
really helpful for providing hierarchy
 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.540
really helpful for providing hierarchy
in your application we're really good at

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550
in your application we're really good at
 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.530
in your application we're really good at
knowing that kind of things which are

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540
knowing that kind of things which are
 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.240
knowing that kind of things which are
closer to you or larger are more

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
closer to you or larger are more
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.530
closer to you or larger are more
important we just notice in the real

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540
important we just notice in the real
 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.270
important we just notice in the real
world and you can use that in your UI to

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280
world and you can use that in your UI to
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.920
world and you can use that in your UI to
direct attention to the most important

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930
direct attention to the most important
 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.340
direct attention to the most important
information here's an example so in the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350
information here's an example so in the
 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.890
information here's an example so in the
application and I show some images from

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900
application and I show some images from
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.449
application and I show some images from
the awesome and show-and-tell site

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459
the awesome and show-and-tell site
 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.490
the awesome and show-and-tell site
called dribble and the image is like the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500
called dribble and the image is like the
 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.259
called dribble and the image is like the
primary focus of this application of

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269
primary focus of this application of
 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.210
primary focus of this application of
this screen so so it gives this like big

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220
this screen so so it gives this like big
 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.330
this screen so so it gives this like big
old prominent area at the top but once

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340
old prominent area at the top but once
 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.740
old prominent area at the top but once
you you know once you've seen the image

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750
you you know once you've seen the image
 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.729
you you know once you've seen the image
you might perhaps want to take some

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739
you might perhaps want to take some
 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.199
you might perhaps want to take some
other actions so there's comments or

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209
other actions so there's comments or
 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.250
other actions so there's comments or
descriptions and so on right

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260
descriptions and so on right
 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.600
descriptions and so on right
I kind of want to get it out of the way

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610
I kind of want to get it out of the way
 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.750
I kind of want to get it out of the way
but still have it accessible so here's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760
but still have it accessible so here's
 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.520
but still have it accessible so here's
how we do it in plaid hopefully you can

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530
how we do it in plaid hopefully you can
 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.259
how we do it in plaid hopefully you can
see it kind of collapses with like a

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269
see it kind of collapses with like a
 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.240
see it kind of collapses with like a
some parallax to keep it centered but at

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250
some parallax to keep it centered but at
 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.030
some parallax to keep it centered but at
a certain point the image kind of pins I

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040
a certain point the image kind of pins I
 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.650
a certain point the image kind of pins I
like to think of it and lifts up to let

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660
like to think of it and lifts up to let
 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.620
like to think of it and lifts up to let
the content pass below it if we're to

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630
the content pass below it if we're to
 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.240
the content pass below it if we're to
take a 3d view of what's going on here

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250
take a 3d view of what's going on here
 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.460
take a 3d view of what's going on here
it's kind of like this if it collapses

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470
it's kind of like this if it collapses
 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.839
it's kind of like this if it collapses
to a certain point and then the surface

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849
to a certain point and then the surface
 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.550
to a certain point and then the surface
itself lifts up into a separate surface

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560
itself lifts up into a separate surface
 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.170
itself lifts up into a separate surface
and there's another surface going on

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180
and there's another surface going on
 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.640
and there's another surface going on
here the floating action button we're

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650
here the floating action button we're
 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.810
here the floating action button we're
saying that this is the most prominent

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820
saying that this is the most prominent
 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.190
saying that this is the most prominent
thing I think that you know liking a

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200
thing I think that you know liking a
 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.030
thing I think that you know liking a
shot is one of the most prominent

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040
shot is one of the most prominent
 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.860
shot is one of the most prominent
actions I want to call out so having

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870
actions I want to call out so having
 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.450
actions I want to call out so having
that on its own surface which moves with

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460
that on its own surface which moves with
 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.310
that on its own surface which moves with
certain physics and then snaps when it

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320
certain physics and then snaps when it
 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.450
certain physics and then snaps when it
reaches the bottom of that layer there

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460
reaches the bottom of that layer there
 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.600
reaches the bottom of that layer there
again helps it direct attention so how

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610
again helps it direct attention so how
 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.690
again helps it direct attention so how
would we build this well I decided to

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700
would we build this well I decided to
 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.430
would we build this well I decided to
use a stateless animator because you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440
use a stateless animator because you
 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.190
use a stateless animator because you
could imagine doing this yourself so

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200
could imagine doing this yourself so
 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.750
could imagine doing this yourself so
listen to the scroll position of the

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760
listen to the scroll position of the
 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.520
listen to the scroll position of the
list and when you reach a certain you

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530
list and when you reach a certain you
 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.590
list and when you reach a certain you
know minimum height for the image then

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600
know minimum height for the image then
 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.960
know minimum height for the image then
just elevating it but that would put on

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970
just elevating it but that would put on
 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.670
just elevating it but that would put on
you the burden of having to like run an

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680
you the burden of having to like run an
 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.590
you the burden of having to like run an
animation workout if the user is like

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600
animation workout if the user is like
 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.880
animation workout if the user is like
quickly scrolled and quickly scroll back

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890
quickly scrolled and quickly scroll back
 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.170
quickly scrolled and quickly scroll back
that you have to cancel it and reverse

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180
that you have to cancel it and reverse
 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.570
that you have to cancel it and reverse
it instead using a stateless animator it

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580
it instead using a stateless animator it
 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.909
it instead using a stateless animator it
helps you to it does it automatically

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919
helps you to it does it automatically
 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.920
helps you to it does it automatically
for you so all I do is I basically set

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930
for you so all I do is I basically set
 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.840
for you so all I do is I basically set
this state of pinned to true or false

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850
this state of pinned to true or false
 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.610
this state of pinned to true or false
depending on them how far these are

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620
depending on them how far these are
 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.710
depending on them how far these are
scrolled and then just run an animation

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720
scrolled and then just run an animation
 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.550
scrolled and then just run an animation
over the translations ed property and it

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560
over the translations ed property and it
 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.900
over the translations ed property and it
will produce this lifting up and pinning

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910
will produce this lifting up and pinning
 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.460
will produce this lifting up and pinning
effect are use them surfaces again in

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470
effect are use them surfaces again in
 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.260
effect are use them surfaces again in
the same screen when looking at comments

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270
the same screen when looking at comments
 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.290
the same screen when looking at comments
on a shot so for each of the comments in

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300
on a shot so for each of the comments in
 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.760

you know an alternative presentation

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430
you know an alternative presentation
 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.710
you know an alternative presentation
might have been to have these comments

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720
might have been to have these comments
 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.659
might have been to have these comments
visible or overflow icons and so on so

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669
visible or overflow icons and so on so
 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.159
visible or overflow icons and so on so
forth but that would have led to a more

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169
forth but that would have led to a more
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.510
forth but that would have led to a more
kind of cluttered kind of look and feel

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520
kind of cluttered kind of look and feel

I wanted to sing a bit cleaner so using

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010
I wanted to sing a bit cleaner so using
 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.950
I wanted to sing a bit cleaner so using
the idea of surfaces here I think helped

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960
the idea of surfaces here I think helped
 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.260
the idea of surfaces here I think helped
because as you tap on a surface we have

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270
because as you tap on a surface we have
 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.670
because as you tap on a surface we have
this idea that raises up and get some

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680
this idea that raises up and get some
 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.960
this idea that raises up and get some
elevation a little drop shadow and

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970
elevation a little drop shadow and
 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.480
elevation a little drop shadow and
underneath and the comment actions

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490
underneath and the comment actions
 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.520
underneath and the comment actions
reveal themselves so again I fill

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530
reveal themselves so again I fill
 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.870
reveal themselves so again I fill
surfaces help to make it a cleaner

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880
surfaces help to make it a cleaner
 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.390
surfaces help to make it a cleaner
presentation and building it was pretty

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400
presentation and building it was pretty
 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.820
presentation and building it was pretty
easy and the three steps to it which

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830
easy and the three steps to it which
 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.370
easy and the three steps to it which
I'll walk you through so firstly it's a

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380
I'll walk you through so firstly it's a
 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.469
I'll walk you through so firstly it's a
comment is an adapted way so in the the

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479
comment is an adapted way so in the the
 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.620
comment is an adapted way so in the the
list fees adapter we work out with it we

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630
list fees adapter we work out with it we
 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.820
list fees adapter we work out with it we
can hold on to the position of the

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830
can hold on to the position of the
 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.950
can hold on to the position of the
currently expanded item and based on if

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960
currently expanded item and based on if
 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.570
currently expanded item and based on if
it's expanded one we just set the

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580
it's expanded one we just set the
 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.270
it's expanded one we just set the
visibility of those little actions there

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:42.390
of that is doing so inside the frame
 

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.870
of that is doing so inside the frame
layout there is a ListView here which is

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880
layout there is a ListView here which is
 

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.420
layout there is a ListView here which is
sending scroll events and basically and

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.430
sending scroll events and basically and
 

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.330
sending scroll events and basically and
you just override a few api's so the

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:50.340
you just override a few api's so the
 

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.400
you just override a few api's so the
first one is on start nessus Chrome so

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.410
first one is on start nessus Chrome so
 

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.510
first one is on start nessus Chrome so
this is basically asking are you

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:53.520
this is basically asking are you
 

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.860
this is basically asking are you
interested in listening to monastic

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:54.870
interested in listening to monastic
 

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.510
interested in listening to monastic
Scrolls here I'm saying anything that's

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:56.520
Scrolls here I'm saying anything that's
 

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.250
Scrolls here I'm saying anything that's
scrolling vertically I'm interested in

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260
scrolling vertically I'm interested in
 

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.070
scrolling vertically I'm interested in
please send me more events so if you

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080
please send me more events so if you
 

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.590
please send me more events so if you
return true tip from that one and every

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600
return true tip from that one and every
 

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.300
return true tip from that one and every
time the user Scrolls in the list

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:05.310
time the user Scrolls in the list
 

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.540
time the user Scrolls in the list
I'll get this on nested scroll event so

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:08.550
I'll get this on nested scroll event so
 

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.340
I'll get this on nested scroll event so
you can do stuff with like working out

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:10.350
you can do stuff with like working out
 

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.780
you can do stuff with like working out
how much the list is scroll by itself

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:11.790
how much the list is scroll by itself
 

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.340
how much the list is scroll by itself
but the one I'm actually really really

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.350
but the one I'm actually really really
 

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.810
but the one I'm actually really really
interested in here is that last

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820
interested in here is that last
 

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.720
interested in here is that last
parameter which is dy unconsumed that

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:17.730
parameter which is dy unconsumed that
 

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.250
parameter which is dy unconsumed that
basically tells me if the list has

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260
basically tells me if the list has
 

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.440
basically tells me if the list has
scrolled to the end of its scroll range

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:21.450
scrolled to the end of its scroll range
 

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.960
scrolled to the end of its scroll range
but the user carried on trying to scroll

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:23.970
but the user carried on trying to scroll
 

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.180
but the user carried on trying to scroll
there were some unconsumed scroll events

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:26.190
there were some unconsumed scroll events
 

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.580
there were some unconsumed scroll events
so I want to take those and I'll then

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:28.590
so I want to take those and I'll then
 

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.920
so I want to take those and I'll then
just use set translation Y and set scale

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:30.930
just use set translation Y and set scale
 

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.780
just use set translation Y and set scale
to actually translate and scale down all

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:32.790
to actually translate and scale down all
 

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.020
to actually translate and scale down all
the content moving it away and then

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.030
the content moving it away and then
 

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.930
the content moving it away and then
finally when the user let's go I can

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940
finally when the user let's go I can
 

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.940
finally when the user let's go I can
work out did they scroll past a certain

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:40.950
work out did they scroll past a certain
 

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.280
work out did they scroll past a certain
threshold if so I'm going to finish the

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.290
threshold if so I'm going to finish the
 

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.960
threshold if so I'm going to finish the
activity and run an animation to kind of

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:44.970
activity and run an animation to kind of
 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.970
activity and run an animation to kind of
collapse it otherwise I'll settle it

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:46.980
collapse it otherwise I'll settle it
 

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.540
collapse it otherwise I'll settle it
back into its natural position

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:50.550
 

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.930
the final part the puzzle here is that

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:52.940
the final part the puzzle here is that
 

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.820
the final part the puzzle here is that
the activity was like sat on top of the

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:55.830
the activity was like sat on top of the
 

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.080
the activity was like sat on top of the
previous activity and you can see

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.090
previous activity and you can see
 

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.910
previous activity and you can see
through to it the one behind the way

00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920
through to it the one behind the way
 

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.890
through to it the one behind the way
that you do that is you say you set this

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:00.900
that you do that is you say you set this
 

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.590
that you do that is you say you set this
flag window is translucent and what that

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600
flag window is translucent and what that
 

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.000
flag window is translucent and what that
means is that you're telling the system

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.010
means is that you're telling the system
 

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.910
means is that you're telling the system
don't finish the previous activity so

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920
don't finish the previous activity so
 

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.380
don't finish the previous activity so
we'll go into on pause but it won't

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:09.390
we'll go into on pause but it won't
 

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.030
we'll go into on pause but it won't
actually go into ondestroy

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040
actually go into ondestroy
 

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.070
actually go into ondestroy
because you're saying that the content

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.080
because you're saying that the content
 

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.170
because you're saying that the content
on top is translucent it's going to be

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180
on top is translucent it's going to be
 

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.370
on top is translucent it's going to be
able to see through to you it's kind of

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380
able to see through to you it's kind of
 

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.920
able to see through to you it's kind of
like if you showed a dialog on top of

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:18.930
like if you showed a dialog on top of
 

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.030
like if you showed a dialog on top of
your app rather than showing a new

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040
your app rather than showing a new
 

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.460
your app rather than showing a new
activity it won't finish you and then

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:22.470
activity it won't finish you and then
 

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.780
activity it won't finish you and then
you set a semi-transparent window

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.790
you set a semi-transparent window
 

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.280
you set a semi-transparent window
background and for those of you who

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.290
background and for those of you who
 

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.720
background and for those of you who
don't read hex colors that's like a semi

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:26.730
don't read hex colors that's like a semi
 

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.280
don't read hex colors that's like a semi
opaque gray at a bullet so that was

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.290
opaque gray at a bullet so that was
 

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.040
opaque gray at a bullet so that was
surfaces again I think made it more

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.050
surfaces again I think made it more
 

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.020
surfaces again I think made it more
understandable so another example of

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.030
understandable so another example of
 

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.400
understandable so another example of
services in the application is this is a

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:37.410
services in the application is this is a
 

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.220
services in the application is this is a
dribble profile screen and so here are

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.230
dribble profile screen and so here are
 

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.140
dribble profile screen and so here are
used services with great prejudice to

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:42.150
used services with great prejudice to
 

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.800
used services with great prejudice to
basically show content hierarchy so here

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:45.810
basically show content hierarchy so here
 

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.390
basically show content hierarchy so here
when you scroll the content I actually

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:47.400
when you scroll the content I actually
 

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.250
when you scroll the content I actually
trip made the decision to leave the kind

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260
trip made the decision to leave the kind
 

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.200
trip made the decision to leave the kind
of the profile information statically

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.210
of the profile information statically
 

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.270
of the profile information statically
and have the images scroll completely on

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.280
and have the images scroll completely on
 

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.680
and have the images scroll completely on
top of it completely in front of the

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:54.690
top of it completely in front of the
 

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.360
top of it completely in front of the
content so this is me like being

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:56.370
content so this is me like being
 

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.130
content so this is me like being
opinionated in saying I think the images

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140
opinionated in saying I think the images
 

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.510
opinionated in saying I think the images
are the most important part of this I

00:11:59.510 --> 00:11:59.520
are the most important part of this I
 

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.330
are the most important part of this I
want to direct attention to those and

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:01.340
want to direct attention to those and
 

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.340
want to direct attention to those and
and that's how you do it so how would

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:04.350
and that's how you do it so how would
 

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.530
and that's how you do it so how would
you build this you can consider that you

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540
you build this you can consider that you
 

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.210
you build this you can consider that you
know a frame layout lets you overlap

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.220
know a frame layout lets you overlap
 

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.010
know a frame layout lets you overlap
content so you might put the and the

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.020
content so you might put the and the
 

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.870
content so you might put the and the
profile information in one layer then a

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880
profile information in one layer then a
 

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.180
profile information in one layer then a
recycler view of images on top and

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:14.190
recycler view of images on top and
 

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.560
recycler view of images on top and
that's all well and good what about the

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:15.570
that's all well and good what about the
 

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.870
that's all well and good what about the
clicks if the recycler view is on top

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880
clicks if the recycler view is on top
 

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.860
clicks if the recycler view is on top
how do you let clicks pass through so I

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:21.870
how do you let clicks pass through so I
 

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.530
how do you let clicks pass through so I
kind of cheat a little bit here so I set

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540
kind of cheat a little bit here so I set
 

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.120
kind of cheat a little bit here so I set
a non-touch listener on to the recycler

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.130
a non-touch listener on to the recycler
 

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.850
a non-touch listener on to the recycler
view itself and then I work out where

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860
view itself and then I work out where
 

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.560
view itself and then I work out where
the top of the first item is which have

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:30.570
the top of the first item is which have
 

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.370
the top of the first item is which have
I've set down with some padding so then

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380
I've set down with some padding so then
 

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.510
I've set down with some padding so then
if the touch point where you're touching

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:35.520
if the touch point where you're touching
 

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.910
if the touch point where you're touching
in the recyclerview is above the first

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920
in the recyclerview is above the first
 

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.850
in the recyclerview is above the first
item I directly call and dispatch touch

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860
item I directly call and dispatch touch
 

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.590
item I directly call and dispatch touch
event onto the content behind this is

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600
event onto the content behind this is
 

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.930
event onto the content behind this is
the description field behind and so

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:44.940
the description field behind and so
 

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.460
the description field behind and so
that's four words on the touch event so

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:46.470
that's four words on the touch event so
 

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.540
that's four words on the touch event so
again like kind of letting the touch

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:47.550
again like kind of letting the touch
 

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.280
again like kind of letting the touch
pass through the recyclerview onto the

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:49.290
pass through the recyclerview onto the
 

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.230
pass through the recyclerview onto the
content behind so lets you do this kind

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240
content behind so lets you do this kind
 

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.490
content behind so lets you do this kind
of layering trick I'm a last example of

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500

ripple back to the item so what I do is

00:15:59.879 --> 00:15:59.889
ripple back to the item so what I do is
 

00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:01.499
ripple back to the item so what I do is
I walk through the swatches one at a

00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:01.509
I walk through the swatches one at a
 

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:03.179
I walk through the swatches one at a
time you have to go through them each

00:16:03.179 --> 00:16:03.189
time you have to go through them each
 

00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:05.340
time you have to go through them each
because you know you're not guaranteed

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:05.350
because you know you're not guaranteed
 

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.619
because you know you're not guaranteed
that there's going to be a named swatch

00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:07.629
that there's going to be a named swatch
 

00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:09.299
that there's going to be a named swatch
so for example if I were to give it you

00:16:09.299 --> 00:16:09.309
so for example if I were to give it you
 

00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:10.590
so for example if I were to give it you
know a black and white image it's not

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600
know a black and white image it's not
 

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.389
know a black and white image it's not
going to be able to return me a vibrant

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399
going to be able to return me a vibrant
 

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.549
going to be able to return me a vibrant
color from that so you go through them

00:16:14.549 --> 00:16:14.559
color from that so you go through them
 

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:16.799
color from that so you go through them
one at a time in a preference order work

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:16.809
one at a time in a preference order work
 

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:18.389
one at a time in a preference order work
out what color to use and then create a

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399
out what color to use and then create a
 

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:20.160
out what color to use and then create a
new ripple drawable and then set that as

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:20.170
new ripple drawable and then set that as
 

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.569
new ripple drawable and then set that as
the foreground onto the image you

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:21.579
the foreground onto the image you
 

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:24.179
the foreground onto the image you
touched on actually take this idea of it

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:24.189
touched on actually take this idea of it
 

00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:26.759
touched on actually take this idea of it
further and when going into a details

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:26.769
further and when going into a details
 

00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:29.189
further and when going into a details
view of an image so here I am like quite

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199
view of an image so here I am like quite
 

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:30.929
view of an image so here I am like quite
zoomed in so as I click onto each image

00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:30.939
zoomed in so as I click onto each image
 

00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:33.210
zoomed in so as I click onto each image
I want to have this kind of like

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:33.220
I want to have this kind of like
 

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.980
I want to have this kind of like
immersive kind of seamless feel to the

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:34.990
immersive kind of seamless feel to the
 

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.960
immersive kind of seamless feel to the
application so what I do is I again use

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:36.970
application so what I do is I again use
 

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.879
application so what I do is I again use
color and picking I pick a color out of

00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:38.889
color and picking I pick a color out of
 

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:41.160
color and picking I pick a color out of
the image and so it's a sighted spot

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.170
the image and so it's a sighted spot
 

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.720
the image and so it's a sighted spot
color you could have achieved something

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:42.730
color you could have achieved something
 

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.829
color you could have achieved something
similar by using like you know a

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839
similar by using like you know a
 

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:45.960
similar by using like you know a
semi-transparent lino partially black

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:45.970
semi-transparent lino partially black
 

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.329
semi-transparent lino partially black
perhaps status bar color and having the

00:16:48.329 --> 00:16:48.339
perhaps status bar color and having the
 

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:49.379
perhaps status bar color and having the
content run behind it

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:49.389
content run behind it
 

00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:51.090
content run behind it
but because the you know the detail

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:51.100
but because the you know the detail
 

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.619
but because the you know the detail
screen is all about the image I wanted

00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:52.629
screen is all about the image I wanted
 

00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:54.569
screen is all about the image I wanted
to overlay as as little as possible to

00:16:54.569 --> 00:16:54.579
to overlay as as little as possible to
 

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:56.160
to overlay as as little as possible to
not have anything on top of it so

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.170
not have anything on top of it so
 

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.699
not have anything on top of it so
instead I use this color picking but

00:16:59.699 --> 00:16:59.709
instead I use this color picking but
 

00:16:59.709 --> 00:17:01.889
instead I use this color picking but
what about a situation like this so

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:01.899
what about a situation like this so
 

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:04.949
what about a situation like this so
here's an image which is you know a cup

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959
here's an image which is you know a cup
 

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:06.809
here's an image which is you know a cup
of like major color blocks if you were

00:17:06.809 --> 00:17:06.819
of like major color blocks if you were
 

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.880
of like major color blocks if you were
to run palette over the entire image

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:08.890
to run palette over the entire image
 

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.529
to run palette over the entire image
like this it's likely going to pick out

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:10.539
like this it's likely going to pick out
 

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:11.909
like this it's likely going to pick out
the kind of purply blue in the middle

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919
the kind of purply blue in the middle
 

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:12.899
the kind of purply blue in the middle
right because it's the most dominant

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:12.909
right because it's the most dominant
 

00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:15.090
right because it's the most dominant
color but that's not what I want but I

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:15.100
color but that's not what I want but I
 

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.470
color but that's not what I want but I
don't want to have this you know a

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480
don't want to have this you know a
 

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.569
don't want to have this you know a
purpley status bar then I block a Y then

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:18.579
purpley status bar then I block a Y then
 

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:19.649
purpley status bar then I block a Y then
another purple in the middle it's going

00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:19.659
another purple in the middle it's going
 

00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:21.899
another purple in the middle it's going
to look quite discontinuous what I

00:17:21.899 --> 00:17:21.909
to look quite discontinuous what I
 

00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:23.730
to look quite discontinuous what I
really want is to run palette over just

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:23.740
really want is to run palette over just
 

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.199
really want is to run palette over just
a subset of the image just the top part

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:25.209
a subset of the image just the top part
 

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:27.389
a subset of the image just the top part
such that that's going to be the best

00:17:27.389 --> 00:17:27.399
such that that's going to be the best
 

00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:29.039
such that that's going to be the best
color to and set it against as the

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:29.049
color to and set it against as the
 

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:30.990
color to and set it against as the
status bar so you could imagine the

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000
status bar so you could imagine the
 

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.190
status bar so you could imagine the
situation you could like you know

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200
situation you could like you know
 

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.990
situation you could like you know
a second bitmap and run palette over

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000
a second bitmap and run palette over
 

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.340
a second bitmap and run palette over
that that's really quite inefficient

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:35.350
that that's really quite inefficient
 

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.779
that that's really quite inefficient
palettes already kind of like walking

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:36.789
palettes already kind of like walking
 

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:39.240
palettes already kind of like walking
over the bitmap a better thing you can

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.250
over the bitmap a better thing you can
 

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.090
over the bitmap a better thing you can
do is use the region API so palette here

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.100
do is use the region API so palette here
 

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.009
do is use the region API so palette here
offers that API that says only look at

00:17:44.009 --> 00:17:44.019
offers that API that says only look at
 

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:45.659
offers that API that says only look at
this area of an image when you're

00:17:45.659 --> 00:17:45.669
this area of an image when you're
 

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:48.600
this area of an image when you're
picking colors from it to consider so it

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:48.610
picking colors from it to consider so it
 

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.049
picking colors from it to consider so it
can be much more efficient and also want

00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:52.059
can be much more efficient and also want
 

00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:53.159
can be much more efficient and also want
to call out that in fact that palette

00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:53.169
to call out that in fact that palette
 

00:17:53.169 --> 00:17:55.049
to call out that in fact that palette
lets you set the maximum number of

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:55.059
lets you set the maximum number of
 

00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:56.549
lets you set the maximum number of
colors that you look at that you

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559
colors that you look at that you
 

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:58.049
colors that you look at that you
consider in the image basically what its

00:17:58.049 --> 00:17:58.059
consider in the image basically what its
 

00:17:58.059 --> 00:17:59.490
consider in the image basically what its
parts doing is walking through trying to

00:17:59.490 --> 00:17:59.500
parts doing is walking through trying to
 

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.259
parts doing is walking through trying to
bucket the colors into a smaller and

00:18:01.259 --> 00:18:01.269
bucket the colors into a smaller and
 

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:02.850
bucket the colors into a smaller and
smaller bucket sizes until it comes out

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:02.860
smaller bucket sizes until it comes out
 

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.169
smaller bucket sizes until it comes out
with this palette of clothes which are

00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:04.179
with this palette of clothes which are
 

00:18:04.179 --> 00:18:06.419
with this palette of clothes which are
in the image and you can control that so

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:06.429
in the image and you can control that so
 

00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:08.730
in the image and you can control that so
here I found setting this and allowed me

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:08.740
here I found setting this and allowed me
 

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.529
here I found setting this and allowed me
to pick the more dominant colors quicker

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539
to pick the more dominant colors quicker
 

00:18:12.539 --> 00:18:14.730
to pick the more dominant colors quicker
and lastly you might have noticed I'm

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:14.740
and lastly you might have noticed I'm
 

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.190
and lastly you might have noticed I'm
using the awesome light status bar API

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200
using the awesome light status bar API
 

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.350
using the awesome light status bar API
on marshmallow so that basically lets me

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360
on marshmallow so that basically lets me
 

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.980
on marshmallow so that basically lets me
set dark icons and for the the Wi-Fi and

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:22.990
set dark icons and for the the Wi-Fi and
 

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.320
set dark icons and for the the Wi-Fi and
the clock and the battery and so forth

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:24.330
the clock and the battery and so forth
 

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.090
the clock and the battery and so forth
the way you do that is I basically pick

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.100
the way you do that is I basically pick
 

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.769
the way you do that is I basically pick
a color from the image for the status

00:18:28.769 --> 00:18:28.779
a color from the image for the status
 

00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:31.850
a color from the image for the status
bar and then check if it's light by

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860
bar and then check if it's light by
 

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.310
bar and then check if it's light by
essentially converting the RGB into HSL

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320
essentially converting the RGB into HSL
 

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.110
essentially converting the RGB into HSL
hue saturation and lightness and then

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120
hue saturation and lightness and then
 

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.460
hue saturation and lightness and then
looking at that third component just the

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:38.470
looking at that third component just the
 

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.649
looking at that third component just the
lightness and seeing if it's over a

00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:40.659
lightness and seeing if it's over a
 

00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:42.000
lightness and seeing if it's over a
certain value then saying yep that's

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.010
certain value then saying yep that's
 

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.759
certain value then saying yep that's
light and if so setting the status bar

00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:44.769
light and if so setting the status bar
 

00:18:44.769 --> 00:18:46.649
light and if so setting the status bar
icons to dark so it's all about creating

00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:46.659
icons to dark so it's all about creating
 

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:48.659
icons to dark so it's all about creating
this kind of like immersive feel where

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:48.669
this kind of like immersive feel where
 

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.190
this kind of like immersive feel where

the UI next up material recommends using
certain grids so here I'm overlaying and

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:58.809
certain grids so here I'm overlaying and
 

00:18:58.809 --> 00:19:00.419
certain grids so here I'm overlaying and
some of the key lines which we work with

00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:00.429
some of the key lines which we work with
 

00:19:00.429 --> 00:19:03.090
some of the key lines which we work with
on material and I think this really

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.779
on material and I think this really
really helps

00:19:03.779 --> 00:19:03.789
really helps
 

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:05.580
really helps

to kind of scan it and kind of parse it

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919
to kind of scan it and kind of parse it
 

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:11.730
to kind of scan it and kind of parse it
and you look at it one section of the

and you look at it one section of the
 

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.460
and you look at it one section of the
material and specular ship and I found

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:14.470
material and specular ship and I found
 

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:15.659
material and specular ship and I found
quite interesting was that it says that

00:19:15.659 --> 00:19:15.669
quite interesting was that it says that
 

00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:17.430
quite interesting was that it says that
you should use an 8 DP grid for most

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440
you should use an 8 DP grid for most
 

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.830
you should use an 8 DP grid for most

order to get this nice regular rhythm

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:42.909
order to get this nice regular rhythm
 

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:45.379
order to get this nice regular rhythm
and just for comparison sake

00:19:45.379 --> 00:19:45.389
and just for comparison sake
 

00:19:45.389 --> 00:19:47.449

hopefully you can see that this is kind

00:19:51.229 --> 00:19:51.239
hopefully you can see that this is kind
 

00:19:51.239 --> 00:19:52.729
hopefully you can see that this is kind
of you might consider it a small thing

00:19:52.729 --> 00:19:52.739
of you might consider it a small thing
 

00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:55.009
of you might consider it a small thing
like maybe you're having types it on the

00:19:55.009 --> 00:19:55.019
like maybe you're having types it on the
 

00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:57.199
like maybe you're having types it on the
grid but I really think it helps and the

00:19:57.199 --> 00:19:57.209
grid but I really think it helps and the
 

00:19:57.209 --> 00:19:58.729
grid but I really think it helps and the
readability of the screen you can Park

00:19:58.729 --> 00:19:58.739
readability of the screen you can Park
 

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.169
readability of the screen you can Park
scan down it and read it and hopefully

00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179
scan down it and read it and hopefully
 

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:03.249
scan down it and read it and hopefully
it just feels a lot more regular to you

00:20:03.249 --> 00:20:03.259
it just feels a lot more regular to you
 

00:20:03.259 --> 00:20:05.359
it just feels a lot more regular to you
so what we really want is be able to

00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:05.369
so what we really want is be able to
 

00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:07.759
so what we really want is be able to
specify that line height so here's the

00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:07.769
specify that line height so here's the
 

00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:10.159
specify that line height so here's the
style where I've set a specified line

00:20:10.159 --> 00:20:10.169
style where I've set a specified line
 

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:11.509
style where I've set a specified line
height to match it and we call out

00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:11.519
height to match it and we call out
 

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:13.369
height to match it and we call out
especially that I call it line height

00:20:13.369 --> 00:20:13.379
especially that I call it line height
 

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:14.719
especially that I call it line height
hint rather than just line height

00:20:14.719 --> 00:20:14.729
hint rather than just line height
 

00:20:14.729 --> 00:20:17.899
hint rather than just line height
because width type and we all know we

00:20:17.899 --> 00:20:17.909
because width type and we all know we
 

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:19.609
because width type and we all know we
should be working with SP units right so

00:20:19.609 --> 00:20:19.619
should be working with SP units right so
 

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:20.959
should be working with SP units right so
that you can take into account if the

00:20:20.959 --> 00:20:20.969
that you can take into account if the
 

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:22.699
that you can take into account if the
user has bumped up or down the text size

00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:22.709
user has bumped up or down the text size
 

00:20:22.709 --> 00:20:25.069
user has bumped up or down the text size
for their particular needs so I call it

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:25.079
for their particular needs so I call it
 

00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:26.839
for their particular needs so I call it
line hind hint because I this lets you

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:26.849
line hind hint because I this lets you
 

00:20:26.849 --> 00:20:29.089
line hind hint because I this lets you
specify the line height in the same

00:20:29.089 --> 00:20:29.099
specify the line height in the same
 

00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:31.489
specify the line height in the same
units in sp such that if the user is set

00:20:31.489 --> 00:20:31.499
units in sp such that if the user is set
 

00:20:31.499 --> 00:20:33.109
units in sp such that if the user is set
their text to be larger you want the

00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:33.119
their text to be larger you want the
 

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:37.219
their text to be larger you want the
line heights to grow with it then I

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:37.229
line heights to grow with it then I
 

00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:39.979
line heights to grow with it then I
created a custom view which extends text

00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:39.989
created a custom view which extends text
 

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:43.669
created a custom view which extends text
view and just some magic for us first it

00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679
view and just some magic for us first it
 

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:46.310
view and just some magic for us first it
basically takes that line height you

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320
basically takes that line height you
 

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.560
basically takes that line height you
specified and rounds it up to the

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:48.570
specified and rounds it up to the
 

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.769
specified and rounds it up to the
nearest 4 DP and essentially making sure

00:20:51.769 --> 00:20:51.779
nearest 4 DP and essentially making sure
 

00:20:51.779 --> 00:20:52.849
nearest 4 DP and essentially making sure
it's going to and the line height is

00:20:52.849 --> 00:20:52.859
it's going to and the line height is
 

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:53.989
it's going to and the line height is
going to be a multiple of 4

00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:53.999
going to be a multiple of 4
 

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:56.779
going to be a multiple of 4
I then work out the height of the the

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:56.789
I then work out the height of the the
 

00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:59.119
I then work out the height of the the
font and then call an API which textview

00:20:59.119 --> 00:20:59.129
font and then call an API which textview
 

00:20:59.129 --> 00:21:02.239
font and then call an API which textview
does give you set line spacing which

00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:02.249
does give you set line spacing which
 

00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:03.889
does give you set line spacing which
wants to take the line spacing edition

00:21:03.889 --> 00:21:03.899
wants to take the line spacing edition
 

00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:05.539
wants to take the line spacing edition
so that's the line height I want minus

00:21:05.539 --> 00:21:05.549
so that's the line height I want minus
 

00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:06.859
so that's the line height I want minus
the height of the font is the addition

00:21:06.859 --> 00:21:06.869
the height of the font is the addition
 

00:21:06.869 --> 00:21:09.919
the height of the font is the addition
and that will give you the for DP

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:09.929
and that will give you the for DP
 

00:21:09.929 --> 00:21:11.779
and that will give you the for DP
Griffith you want the custom view

00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:11.789
Griffith you want the custom view
 

00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:13.459
Griffith you want the custom view
actually does some extra stuff it makes

00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:13.469
actually does some extra stuff it makes
 

00:21:13.469 --> 00:21:15.169
actually does some extra stuff it makes
sure the padding top is the right so

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179
sure the padding top is the right so
 

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:16.879
sure the padding top is the right so
that the first base line sits on the

00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:16.889
that the first base line sits on the
 

00:21:16.889 --> 00:21:18.619
that the first base line sits on the
grid and it's just the padding bottom to

00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:18.629
grid and it's just the padding bottom to
 

00:21:18.629 --> 00:21:19.879
grid and it's just the padding bottom to
make sure the entire element is a

00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:19.889
make sure the entire element is a
 

00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:22.729
make sure the entire element is a
multiple of 4 DP as well and so a bit of

00:21:22.729 --> 00:21:22.739
multiple of 4 DP as well and so a bit of
 

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:24.049
multiple of 4 DP as well and so a bit of
work but I really think it really helps

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059
work but I really think it really helps
 

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.399
work but I really think it really helps
give you this nice regular type of

00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:25.409
give you this nice regular type of
 

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:29.389
give you this nice regular type of
typography speaking of typography I also

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:29.399
typography speaking of typography I also
 

00:21:29.399 --> 00:21:31.759
typography speaking of typography I also
make use of some of the more advanced

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:31.769
make use of some of the more advanced
 

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:33.169
make use of some of the more advanced
features of Roboto so I hope you know

00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:33.179
features of Roboto so I hope you know
 

00:21:33.179 --> 00:21:34.609
features of Roboto so I hope you know
that fonts often come with lots of

00:21:34.609 --> 00:21:34.619
that fonts often come with lots of
 

00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:36.409
that fonts often come with lots of
variations in them so for example here

00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419
variations in them so for example here
 

00:21:36.419 --> 00:21:38.419
variations in them so for example here
I'm using the small caps presentation

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:38.429
I'm using the small caps presentation
 

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:39.739
I'm using the small caps presentation
and this is what we they call old-style

00:21:39.739 --> 00:21:39.749
and this is what we they call old-style
 

00:21:39.749 --> 00:21:40.909
and this is what we they call old-style
numbering which gives you a different

00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919
numbering which gives you a different
 

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:43.669
numbering which gives you a different
numbering format I feel that using these

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679
numbering format I feel that using these
 

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:45.229
numbering format I feel that using these
different typographic variations help

00:21:45.229 --> 00:21:45.239
different typographic variations help
 

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:47.479
different typographic variations help
you to kind of express hierarchy and you

00:21:47.479 --> 00:21:47.489
you to kind of express hierarchy and you
 

00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:49.369
you to kind of express hierarchy and you
know give some visual interest to the

00:21:49.369 --> 00:21:49.379
know give some visual interest to the
 

00:21:49.379 --> 00:21:51.019
know give some visual interest to the
screen you have more range of them

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:51.029
screen you have more range of them
 

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:52.969
screen you have more range of them
presenting texts so rather than using

00:21:52.969 --> 00:21:52.979
presenting texts so rather than using
 

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.229
presenting texts so rather than using
lots of different text sizes or colors

00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:54.239
lots of different text sizes or colors

easily they use it's kind of web syntax

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960
easily they use it's kind of web syntax
 

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.230
easily they use it's kind of web syntax
where SMTP for example means use small

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240

grids are awesome and I also think it's

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:23.970
grids are awesome and I also think it's
 

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.850
grids are awesome and I also think it's
interesting to break out of the grid so

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860
interesting to break out of the grid so
 

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.140
interesting to break out of the grid so
here for example we have this floating

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:27.150
here for example we have this floating
 

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.000
here for example we have this floating
action button which kind of straddles

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.010
action button which kind of straddles
 

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.310
action button which kind of straddles
this title and description field there's

this title and description field there's
 

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.780
this title and description field there's
kind of like breaking out the grid draws

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:32.790
kind of like breaking out the grid draws
 

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.720
kind of like breaking out the grid draws
attention to it but you can come into

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:35.730
attention to it but you can come into
 

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:36.800
attention to it but you can come into
issues when you're doing this kind of

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:36.810
issues when you're doing this kind of
 

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.290
issues when you're doing this kind of
thing so you don't want the the fab to

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:39.300
thing so you don't want the the fab to
 

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.090

important information so what are you

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:44.160
important information so what are you
 

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.700
important information so what are you
going to do you could for example just

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:46.710
going to do you could for example just
 

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.470
going to do you could for example just
add some padding to the right which

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480
add some padding to the right which
 

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.620
add some padding to the right which
might you know prevent any overlapping

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:51.630
might you know prevent any overlapping
 

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.120
might you know prevent any overlapping
of the text but you're going to end up

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.130
of the text but you're going to end up
 

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.770
of the text but you're going to end up
with this kind of less than ideal

everyone knows that the textview doesn't
have like a flowing api unfortunately

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:19.590
have like a flowing api unfortunately
 

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.680
have like a flowing api unfortunately
but hopefully you know that and text you

uses something else under the hood to
actually lay out its texts it which is

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.170
actually lay out its texts it which is
 

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.700
actually lay out its texts it which is
called a layout funnily enough and but

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:28.710
called a layout funnily enough and but
 

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.160
called a layout funnily enough and but
layout got an interesting but so static

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:31.170
layout got an interesting but so static
 

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.630
layout got an interesting but so static
layout particularly which is what's used

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640
layout particularly which is what's used
 

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.700
layout particularly which is what's used
for unchanging text got interesting

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:34.710
for unchanging text got interesting
 

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.860
for unchanging text got interesting
addition in API 23 which is called set

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:36.870
addition in API 23 which is called set
 

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.680
addition in API 23 which is called set
indents so this API takes an array of

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:39.690
indents so this API takes an array of
 

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.530
indents so this API takes an array of
intz and specifying the indents to use

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:42.540
intz and specifying the indents to use
 

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.000
intz and specifying the indents to use
per line so we can use the API to work

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.010
per line so we can use the API to work
 

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.850
per line so we can use the API to work
out where which lines of text in the

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860
out where which lines of text in the
 

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.850
out where which lines of text in the
title field overlap with a fab and set

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860
title field overlap with a fab and set
 

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.680
title field overlap with a fab and set
an indent so on that second line send

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:54.690
an indent so on that second line send
 

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.140
an indent so on that second line send
indent on the right and such that we can

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.150
indent on the right and such that we can
 

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.810
indent on the right and such that we can
build this kind of flowing behavior so

00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820
build this kind of flowing behavior so
 

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.940
build this kind of flowing behavior so
create a custom view again which again

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:01.950
create a custom view again which again
 

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.920
create a custom view again which again
works out where the overlap between

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:03.930
works out where the overlap between
 

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.280
works out where the overlap between
these two views are and it calculates an

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:07.290
these two views are and it calculates an
 

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.990
these two views are and it calculates an
array of these overlap these indents

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000
array of these overlap these indents
 

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.880
array of these overlap these indents
that we want to set so essentially the

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:10.890
that we want to set so essentially the
 

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.410
that we want to set so essentially the
second line in the right index is going

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:12.420
second line in the right index is going
 

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:12.620
second line in the right index is going
to

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:12.630
to
 

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.500
to
have an indent and then you create a

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:15.510
have an indent and then you create a
 

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.540
have an indent and then you create a
allow through the Builder object passing

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:17.550
allow through the Builder object passing
 

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.640
allow through the Builder object passing
those indents again letting you wrap the

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:19.650
those indents again letting you wrap the
 

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:24.010
those indents again letting you wrap the
text around it this is kind of cool

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:24.020
text around it this is kind of cool
 

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.150
text around it this is kind of cool
approach I think it's quite a useful

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.160
approach I think it's quite a useful
 

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.810
approach I think it's quite a useful
thing but it comes with a giant warning

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:28.820
thing but it comes with a giant warning
 

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.360
thing but it comes with a giant warning
so as you can see this extends view

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:32.370
so as you can see this extends view
 

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.480
so as you can see this extends view
unfortunately textview it doesn't have a

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:35.490
unfortunately textview it doesn't have a
 

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.310
unfortunately textview it doesn't have a
set layout method so you can't just

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320
set layout method so you can't just
 

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.840
set layout method so you can't just
create your own static layout and pass

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:38.850
create your own static layout and pass
 

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.700
create your own static layout and pass
into textview so I'm having to extend

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:40.710
into textview so I'm having to extend
 

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.070
into textview so I'm having to extend
view and then in ondraw having to draw

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080
view and then in ondraw having to draw
 

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.800
view and then in ondraw having to draw
the layout onto the canvas

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:44.810
the layout onto the canvas
 

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.330
the layout onto the canvas
so it's a pretty cool technique but that

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340
so it's a pretty cool technique but that
 

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.860
so it's a pretty cool technique but that
means you're not I text you so if you

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:48.870
means you're not I text you so if you
 

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.810
means you're not I text you so if you
have to do things like rights left's

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820
have to do things like rights left's
 

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.460
have to do things like rights left's
poor accessibility that you're kind of

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:52.470
poor accessibility that you're kind of
 

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.880
poor accessibility that you're kind of
on your own

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:52.890
on your own
 

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.440
on your own
there so great power great

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:54.450
there so great power great
 

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:59.180
there so great power great
responsibility one of those api's right

00:24:59.180 --> 00:24:59.190
responsibility one of those api's right
 

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.290
responsibility one of those api's right
when I'm talking about layouts as well

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:00.300
when I'm talking about layouts as well
 

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.960
when I'm talking about layouts as well
and one of the things I wanted to do on

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:02.970
and one of the things I wanted to do on
 

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.580
and one of the things I wanted to do on
the grid screen is provide a bit more

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:04.590
the grid screen is provide a bit more
 

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.350
the grid screen is provide a bit more
visual interest well a regular grid is

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360
visual interest well a regular grid is
 

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.520
visual interest well a regular grid is
kind of fine

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:07.530
kind of fine
 

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.810
kind of fine
I actually wanted to provide a bit more

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820
I actually wanted to provide a bit more
 

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.370
I actually wanted to provide a bit more
visual interest and kind of you know

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380
visual interest and kind of you know
 

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.020
visual interest and kind of you know
highlight certain items so here for

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.030
highlight certain items so here for
 

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.260
highlight certain items so here for
example and I the middle image is

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.270
example and I the middle image is
 

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.600
example and I the middle image is
actually spanning two columns so it's

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:17.610
actually spanning two columns so it's
 

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.040
actually spanning two columns so it's
maintaining aspect ratio but spanning

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.050
maintaining aspect ratio but spanning
 

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.510
maintaining aspect ratio but spanning
two columns again to provide visual

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520
two columns again to provide visual
 

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.270
two columns again to provide visual
interest to certain items recycle if you

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280
interest to certain items recycle if you
 

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.920
interest to certain items recycle if you
use grid layout manager makes it super

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:24.930
use grid layout manager makes it super
 

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.860
use grid layout manager makes it super
simple to do you basically set a grid

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:27.870
simple to do you basically set a grid
 

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.210
simple to do you basically set a grid

span and the set span sighs look up and
 

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.650
span and the set span sighs look up and
to return how many columns it should

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:33.660
to return how many columns it should
 

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.290
to return how many columns it should
span and I basically delegate that to my

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:36.300
span and I basically delegate that to my
 

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.060
span and I basically delegate that to my
adapter which knows more about each item

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:38.070
adapter which knows more about each item
 

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.250
adapter which knows more about each item
the problem with this approach is a grid

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260
the problem with this approach is a grid
 

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.900
the problem with this approach is a grid
layout manager will happily leave gaps

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:41.910
layout manager will happily leave gaps
 

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.900
layout manager will happily leave gaps
so if you say you know the I want to

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:44.910
so if you say you know the I want to
 

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.610
so if you say you know the I want to
span two columns but it's actually in

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620
span two columns but it's actually in
 

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.810
span two columns but it's actually in
the second column it will actually just

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820
the second column it will actually just
 

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.310
the second column it will actually just
leave a gap and put it on to the next

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320
leave a gap and put it on to the next
 

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.230
leave a gap and put it on to the next
root line which isn't what I want so

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240
root line which isn't what I want so
 

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.150
root line which isn't what I want so
here's some pro tip on how to you can

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:53.160
here's some pro tip on how to you can
 

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.280
here's some pro tip on how to you can
avoid that I essentially work out hold

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:55.290
avoid that I essentially work out hold
 

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.750
avoid that I essentially work out hold
on to the positions of the items that I

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760
on to the positions of the items that I
 

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.810
on to the positions of the items that I
want to expand across multiple columns

00:25:58.810 --> 00:25:58.820
want to expand across multiple columns
 

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.040
want to expand across multiple columns
do some bookkeeping to basically work

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.050
do some bookkeeping to basically work
 

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.320
do some bookkeeping to basically work
out where in the row that will appear

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:03.330
out where in the row that will appear
 

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.030
out where in the row that will appear
because I want to span all the columns I

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:05.040
because I want to span all the columns I
 

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.950
because I want to span all the columns I
know that the item has to appear in the

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960
know that the item has to appear in the
 

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.310
know that the item has to appear in the
leftmost in column 0 row 0 and row

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320
leftmost in column 0 row 0 and row
 

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.500
leftmost in column 0 row 0 and row
position 0 in order to span otherwise

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:12.510
position 0 in order to span otherwise
 

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.030
position 0 in order to span otherwise
it's going to leave a gap and then

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:14.040
it's going to leave a gap and then
 

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.320
it's going to leave a gap and then
essentially swap it with the next item

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:15.330
essentially swap it with the next item
 

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.360
essentially swap it with the next item
it could appear in in order to not leave

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:17.370
it could appear in in order to not leave
 

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.880
it could appear in in order to not leave
any gaps

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:19.890
 

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.130
I want to say that this approach has

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140
I want to say that this approach has
 

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.710
I want to say that this approach has
some drawbacks oh right now here is how

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720
some drawbacks oh right now here is how
 

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.410
some drawbacks oh right now here is how
it looks on a tablet so here are using

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:27.420
it looks on a tablet so here are using
 

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.000
it looks on a tablet so here are using
four columns but essentially spanning

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.010
four columns but essentially spanning
 

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.160
four columns but essentially spanning
four columns maintaining aspect ratio is

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.170
four columns maintaining aspect ratio is
 

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.780
four columns maintaining aspect ratio is
an ideal it's leaving to this whole

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:32.790
an ideal it's leaving to this whole
 

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.430
an ideal it's leaving to this whole
thing so here's a sneak peak of

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440
thing so here's a sneak peak of
 

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.440
thing so here's a sneak peak of
something I'm working on right now so

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:36.450
something I'm working on right now so
 

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.970
something I'm working on right now so
this is a custom recyclerview

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980
this is a custom recyclerview
 

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.760
this is a custom recyclerview
layout manager which allows is allowing

talking about the recent updates the

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:09.390
talking about the recent updates the
 

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.060
talking about the recent updates the
motion design guidelines if you haven't

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:11.070
motion design guidelines if you haven't
 

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.070
motion design guidelines if you haven't
checked out I highly encourage you to do

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080
checked out I highly encourage you to do
 

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.130
checked out I highly encourage you to do
so

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:15.140
so
 

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.570
so
so the most meaningful motion section

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580
so the most meaningful motion section
 

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.310
so the most meaningful motion section
talks about using motion not just for

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320
talks about using motion not just for
 

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.040
talks about using motion not just for
kind of fish showbiz but for actually

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.050
kind of fish showbiz but for actually
 

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.810
kind of fish showbiz but for actually
guiding focus and giving like a spatial

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820
guiding focus and giving like a spatial
 

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.730
guiding focus and giving like a spatial
model for providing interaction cues and

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740
model for providing interaction cues and
 

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.470
model for providing interaction cues and
character so let's look at what this

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480
character so let's look at what this
 

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.240
character so let's look at what this
principle mean how they helped me in my

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:29.250
principle mean how they helped me in my
 

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.170
principle mean how they helped me in my
app so here for example is a list of

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:33.180
app so here for example is a list of
 

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.880
app so here for example is a list of
players a list of people to dribble

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:34.890
players a list of people to dribble
 

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.090
players a list of people to dribble
users and when you click on one of them

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:37.100
users and when you click on one of them
 

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.400
users and when you click on one of them
it expands out and to go to a detail

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:40.410
it expands out and to go to a detail
 

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.810
it expands out and to go to a detail
screen so you again that could have been

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820
screen so you again that could have been
 

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.950
screen so you again that could have been
just let you know a new screen with a

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960
just let you know a new screen with a
 

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.860
just let you know a new screen with a
default transition but I think that an

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:45.870
default transition but I think that an
 

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.300
default transition but I think that an
motion really really helped the design

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:47.310
motion really really helped the design
 

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.890
motion really really helped the design
here it's going a bit far so let's slow

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900
here it's going a bit far so let's slow
 

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.000
here it's going a bit far so let's slow
it down and look at the things that's

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.010
it down and look at the things that's
 

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.490
it down and look at the things that's
happening when you click on a user first

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500
happening when you click on a user first
 

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.950
happening when you click on a user first
thing I raise it up so it's the idea

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960
thing I raise it up so it's the idea
 

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.660
thing I raise it up so it's the idea
that this item is lifting out of the

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:56.670
that this item is lifting out of the
 

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.600
that this item is lifting out of the
list and then grow so you see how the

00:27:59.600 --> 00:27:59.610
list and then grow so you see how the
 

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.660
list and then grow so you see how the
whole card itself and grows out from its

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:02.670
whole card itself and grows out from its
 

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.940
whole card itself and grows out from its
original position while also the image

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:04.950
original position while also the image
 

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.530
original position while also the image
the main kind of point of focus during a

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:06.540
the main kind of point of focus during a
 

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.960
the main kind of point of focus during a
transition smoothly transitions from its

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:08.970
transition smoothly transitions from its
 

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.490
transition smoothly transitions from its
previous position into new position and

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500
previous position into new position and
 

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.080
previous position into new position and
then finally the rest of the content

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:12.090
then finally the rest of the content
 

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.790
then finally the rest of the content
enters so how would we build that

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:16.800
 

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.990
the first bit rays on touch that's easy

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000
the first bit rays on touch that's easy
 

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.850
the first bit rays on touch that's easy
that's the my friend a stick list an

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:20.860
that's the my friend a stick list an
 

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.290
that's the my friend a stick list an
animator we looked at earlier

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:22.300
animator we looked at earlier
 

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.540
animator we looked at earlier
here we're keying on whether the state

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:24.550
here we're keying on whether the state
 

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.460
here we're keying on whether the state
if it's pressed or not pressed and we

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:26.470
if it's pressed or not pressed and we
 

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.320
if it's pressed or not pressed and we
say we want to animate the translation

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:28.330
say we want to animate the translation
 

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.910
say we want to animate the translation
said based on if it's pressed or not

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:29.920
said based on if it's pressed or not
 

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.600
said based on if it's pressed or not
that's pretty simple

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:32.610
that's pretty simple
 

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.800
that's pretty simple
next up the expanding road that this is

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:34.810
next up the expanding road that this is
 

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.720
next up the expanding road that this is
a shared element transition using the

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:36.730
a shared element transition using the
 

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.750
a shared element transition using the
API twelve transitions API there's

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760
API twelve transitions API there's
 

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.310
API twelve transitions API there's
actually two shared elements going on

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320
actually two shared elements going on
 

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.410
actually two shared elements going on
here the first one the image is pretty

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:43.420
here the first one the image is pretty
 

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.210
here the first one the image is pretty
obvious right yusei's the images here

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:45.220
obvious right yusei's the images here
 

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.240
obvious right yusei's the images here
and it's going to here and this change

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.250
and it's going to here and this change
 

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.820
and it's going to here and this change
bounds transition will handle the size

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:50.830
bounds transition will handle the size
 

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.340
bounds transition will handle the size
and location change for you the second

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:53.350
and location change for you the second
 

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.480
and location change for you the second
shared element is actually the

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:54.490
shared element is actually the
 

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.430
shared element is actually the
background so the background of the list

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440
background so the background of the list
 

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.380
background so the background of the list
item I say is the shared element and I

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:58.390
item I say is the shared element and I
 

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.780
item I say is the shared element and I
want it to transition to the background

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:00.790
want it to transition to the background
 

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.130
want it to transition to the background
of the details view and it grows out

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:02.140
of the details view and it grows out
 

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.800
of the details view and it grows out
like this so one drawback of this

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:04.810
like this so one drawback of this
 

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.960
like this so one drawback of this
approach is that by default transitions

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:06.970
approach is that by default transitions
 

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.130
approach is that by default transitions
will use what's called the shared

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:08.140
will use what's called the shared
 

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.960
will use what's called the shared
element overlay that means that they're

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:09.970
element overlay that means that they're
 

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.940
element overlay that means that they're
on top of everything else now if you put

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:11.950
on top of everything else now if you put
 

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.350
on top of everything else now if you put
the background on top of everything else

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360
the background on top of everything else
 

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.670
the background on top of everything else
you're not going to see any of the rest

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:14.680
you're not going to see any of the rest
 

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.810
you're not going to see any of the rest
of the content so we wanted the

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:15.820
of the content so we wanted the
 

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.160
of the content so we wanted the
background to come in and the content to

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.170
background to come in and the content to
 

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.020
background to come in and the content to
come in at the same time and so you

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:19.030
come in at the same time and so you
 

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.820
come in at the same time and so you
actually have to turn off that shared

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:20.830
actually have to turn off that shared
 

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.100
actually have to turn off that shared
element overlay using this flag in your

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.110
element overlay using this flag in your
 

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.780
element overlay using this flag in your
in your theme and that will yet prevent

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:27.790
in your theme and that will yet prevent
 

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.690
in your theme and that will yet prevent
that issue next we want to call out is

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:30.700
that issue next we want to call out is
 

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.130
that issue next we want to call out is
you hopefully you notice it's using this

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:32.140
you hopefully you notice it's using this
 

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.190
you hopefully you notice it's using this
kind of arced motion approach so things

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200
kind of arced motion approach so things
 

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.780
kind of arced motion approach so things
that move linearly can often seem

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:36.790
that move linearly can often seem
 

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.880
that move linearly can often seem
robotic like using arc smooth and curved

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:38.890
robotic like using arc smooth and curved
 

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.650
robotic like using arc smooth and curved
motion paths feel more natural and more

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:40.660
motion paths feel more natural and more
 

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.010
motion paths feel more natural and more
kind of organic to us and this is super

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:44.020
kind of organic to us and this is super
 

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.600
kind of organic to us and this is super
simple to do in a shared element

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:45.610
simple to do in a shared element
 

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.070
simple to do in a shared element
transition you literally just add this

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080
transition you literally just add this
 

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.020
transition you literally just add this
and tag here inside your transition

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:49.030
and tag here inside your transition
 

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.670
and tag here inside your transition
definition the same arc motion and it

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:50.680
definition the same arc motion and it
 

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.710
definition the same arc motion and it
will do this arced path for you so easy

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720
will do this arced path for you so easy
 

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.520
will do this arced path for you so easy
I love it and the last bit is a custom

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:56.530
I love it and the last bit is a custom
 

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:57.960
I love it and the last bit is a custom
transition which I wrote called

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:57.970
transition which I wrote called
 

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.260
transition which I wrote called
which I've called lift off now it's

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:01.270
which I've called lift off now it's
 

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.320
which I've called lift off now it's
easiest to show you what this does by

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:04.330
easiest to show you what this does by
 

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.210
easiest to show you what this does by
showing you it and with and without it

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:06.220
showing you it and with and without it
 

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.760
showing you it and with and without it
so here's two versions of the same video

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:07.770
so here's two versions of the same video
 

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:11.490
so here's two versions of the same video
so you touch on the item oh yeah one's

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:11.500
so you touch on the item oh yeah one's
 

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.250
so you touch on the item oh yeah one's
weird ones we're happy to see that I

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260
weird ones we're happy to see that I
 

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.960
weird ones we're happy to see that I
hope you can see there that as they

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:15.970
hope you can see there that as they
 

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.480
hope you can see there that as they
start expanding one of the items is

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:18.490
start expanding one of the items is
 

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.970
start expanding one of the items is
casting a shadow using my custom

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:20.980
casting a shadow using my custom
 

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.290
casting a shadow using my custom
transition Jakarta shadow and one isn't

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:22.300
transition Jakarta shadow and one isn't
 

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.380
transition Jakarta shadow and one isn't
so it's not gosh guys it's bit easier to

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:25.390
so it's not gosh guys it's bit easier to
 

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.730
so it's not gosh guys it's bit easier to
see on the way back actually

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:26.740
see on the way back actually
 

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.860
see on the way back actually
this is because if you haven't seen

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:28.870
this is because if you haven't seen
 

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.740
this is because if you haven't seen
transitions all happen in the in the

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:31.750
transitions all happen in the in the
 

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.910
transitions all happen in the in the
destination window they're all happening

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:32.920
destination window they're all happening
 

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.650
destination window they're all happening
in the details view so in the details

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:34.660
in the details view so in the details
 

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.600
in the details view so in the details
view the background has no elevation or

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:36.610
view the background has no elevation or
 

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.000
view the background has no elevation or
anything it's the background so it by

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.010
anything it's the background so it by
 

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.030
anything it's the background so it by
default won't cast a shadow so by

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:42.040
default won't cast a shadow so by
 

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.410
default won't cast a shadow so by
running a custom transition which will

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:43.420
running a custom transition which will
 

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.760
running a custom transition which will
actually set some elevation on the

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:44.770
actually set some elevation on the
 

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:45.870
actually set some elevation on the
background while while it's

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880
background while while it's
 

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.120
background while while it's
transitioning we can actually cast this

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.130
transitioning we can actually cast this
 

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.370
transitioning we can actually cast this
shadow this might seem you know maybe I

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:50.380
shadow this might seem you know maybe I
 

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.410
shadow this might seem you know maybe I
was being bit too nitpicky and you know

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:52.420
was being bit too nitpicky and you know
 

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.600
was being bit too nitpicky and you know
this is actually add anything but you

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:54.610
this is actually add anything but you
 

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.250
this is actually add anything but you
might not see it at full speed but it

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:56.260
might not see it at full speed but it
 

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.260
might not see it at full speed but it
just feels better it feels right

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:58.270
just feels better it feels right
 

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.510
just feels better it feels right
like trust me this is like the easiest

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:00.520
like trust me this is like the easiest
 

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.580
like trust me this is like the easiest
transition I've ever written in my life

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:02.590
transition I've ever written in my life
 

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.110
transition I've ever written in my life
you basically passed it in I could have

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120
you basically passed it in I could have
 

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.600
you basically passed it in I could have
value elevation to use during the change

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:06.610
value elevation to use during the change
 

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:10.500
value elevation to use during the change
and you just animate the translation Z

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:10.510
and you just animate the translation Z
 

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.660
and you just animate the translation Z
property to start off from that elevated

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:12.670
property to start off from that elevated
 

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.790
property to start off from that elevated
value and settle down back to zero over

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:14.800
value and settle down back to zero over
 

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.900
value and settle down back to zero over
the course of the transition and

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:15.910
the course of the transition and
 

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.790
the course of the transition and
actually run this to a slightly longer

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:17.800
actually run this to a slightly longer
 

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:23.250
actually run this to a slightly longer
duration than the miss even sure I run

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:23.260
duration than the miss even sure I run
 

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.540
duration than the miss even sure I run
it for a slightly longer duration than

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:24.550
it for a slightly longer duration than
 

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.580
it for a slightly longer duration than
the change bounds as well so you see

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:26.590
the change bounds as well so you see
 

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.930
the change bounds as well so you see
actually kind of like changes into

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:27.940
actually kind of like changes into
 

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.490
actually kind of like changes into
position and then settles down so it

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:29.500
position and then settles down so it
 

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.049
position and then settles down so it
gives its effect this effect of lifting

00:31:31.049 --> 00:31:31.059
gives its effect this effect of lifting
 

00:31:31.059 --> 00:31:33.510
gives its effect this effect of lifting
up and growing and collapsing and

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:33.520
up and growing and collapsing and
 

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:40.260
up and growing and collapsing and
settling back in last piece is that the

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:40.270
settling back in last piece is that the
 

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.910
settling back in last piece is that the
image is moving upwards so I wanted the

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:41.920
image is moving upwards so I wanted the
 

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.040
image is moving upwards so I wanted the
content to enter upwards with it to make

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:44.050
content to enter upwards with it to make
 

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.140
content to enter upwards with it to make
it this kind of cohesive experience so

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.150
it this kind of cohesive experience so
 

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.400
it this kind of cohesive experience so
rather than like you know the image

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:47.410
rather than like you know the image
 

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.960
rather than like you know the image
coming in and the content just popping

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:48.970
coming in and the content just popping
 

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.160
coming in and the content just popping
in I wanted it to kind of like feel like

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:50.170
in I wanted it to kind of like feel like
 

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:52.830
in I wanted it to kind of like feel like
it was all moving in the same path so

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840
it was all moving in the same path so
 

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.600
it was all moving in the same path so
mostly it's handled with this window

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:54.610
mostly it's handled with this window
 

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.040
mostly it's handled with this window
content transition so there's both a

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.050
content transition so there's both a
 

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.600
content transition so there's both a
shared element transition and the window

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:57.610
shared element transition and the window
 

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.010
shared element transition and the window
content transition on the same screen

00:31:59.010 --> 00:31:59.020
content transition on the same screen
 

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.440
content transition on the same screen
and it's just using this slide and to

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:01.450
and it's just using this slide and to
 

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.799
and it's just using this slide and to
slide the content in from the bottom and

00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:03.809
slide the content in from the bottom and
 

00:32:03.809 --> 00:32:06.450
slide the content in from the bottom and
as we saw before that this screen is and

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:06.460
as we saw before that this screen is and
 

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.250
as we saw before that this screen is and
some static content and then a recycler

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:08.260
some static content and then a recycler
 

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.590
some static content and then a recycler
view of items and so that led to this

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600
view of items and so that led to this
 

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.210
view of items and so that led to this
weird feeling where some of the content

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:12.220
weird feeling where some of the content
 

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.410
weird feeling where some of the content
would slide in and then the recycler

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:13.420
would slide in and then the recycler
 

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.270
would slide in and then the recycler
view you know there's a network request

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:15.280
view you know there's a network request
 

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.680
view you know there's a network request
gets the images and then they kind of

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:16.690
gets the images and then they kind of
 

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.590
gets the images and then they kind of
just load in which wasn't ideal so

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600
just load in which wasn't ideal so
 

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.310
just load in which wasn't ideal so
instead I wrote a custom item animator

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320
instead I wrote a custom item animator
 

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.710
instead I wrote a custom item animator
for the recyclerview which will then

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720
for the recyclerview which will then
 

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.470
for the recyclerview which will then
animate the items in upwards as they

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480
animate the items in upwards as they
 

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.200
animate the items in upwards as they
load so just extend the default item

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.210
load so just extend the default item
 

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.790
load so just extend the default item
animator that recyclerview gives you for

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:32.800
animator that recyclerview gives you for
 

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.400
animator that recyclerview gives you for
free and I overrode the anim add method

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:35.410
free and I overrode the anim add method
 

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.570
free and I overrode the anim add method
which we where you basically do some

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:36.580
which we where you basically do some
 

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.010
which we where you basically do some
setup you basically I translate it

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:38.020
setup you basically I translate it
 

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.110
setup you basically I translate it
downwards and set it to

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120
downwards and set it to
 

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.390
downwards and set it to
invisible and then when you run the

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:42.400
invisible and then when you run the
 

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.550
invisible and then when you run the
pending animations you animate those

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:44.560
pending animations you animate those
 

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.930
pending animations you animate those
properties back to the natural place so

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:45.940
properties back to the natural place so
 

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.640
properties back to the natural place so
you fade it in and animate it upwards

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:47.650
you fade it in and animate it upwards
 

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:51.720
you fade it in and animate it upwards
and do some stuff so that was one

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:51.730
and do some stuff so that was one
 

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.570
and do some stuff so that was one
transition another transition I want to

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:54.580
transition another transition I want to
 

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.630
transition another transition I want to
talk about is and the search view so

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:57.640
talk about is and the search view so
 

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.950
talk about is and the search view so
this is what searching looks like in

00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960
this is what searching looks like in
 

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.080
this is what searching looks like in
plaid and again there's quite a lot

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.090
plaid and again there's quite a lot
 

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.570
plaid and again there's quite a lot
going on here so let's slow it down and

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:06.580
going on here so let's slow it down and
 

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.240
going on here so let's slow it down and
step through it a little bit firstly

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:09.250
step through it a little bit firstly
 

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.840
step through it a little bit firstly
when you come into the screen I expand

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:12.850
when you come into the screen I expand
 

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.210
when you come into the screen I expand
out this scrim and then also do like an

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:15.220
out this scrim and then also do like an
 

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.740
out this scrim and then also do like an
animation on the icon itself to change

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:16.750
animation on the icon itself to change
 

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.080
animation on the icon itself to change
it from the search icon to the back and

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:19.090
it from the search icon to the back and
 

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.280
it from the search icon to the back and
then fade in the search field and then

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:23.290
then fade in the search field and then
 

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.230
then fade in the search field and then
once you've done a query we load in the

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240
once you've done a query we load in the
 

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.710
once you've done a query we load in the
results so the goal here was to is

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720
results so the goal here was to is
 

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.990
results so the goal here was to is
really about directing attention so when

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.000
really about directing attention so when
 

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.480
really about directing attention so when
you touch on the search thing and I want

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:33.490
you touch on the search thing and I want
 

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.130
you touch on the search thing and I want
it to feel like this transient kind of

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:35.140
it to feel like this transient kind of
 

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.450
it to feel like this transient kind of
experience so that it's just coming in

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:36.460
experience so that it's just coming in
 

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.770
experience so that it's just coming in
transiently over the top of the content

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:37.780
transiently over the top of the content
 

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.730
transiently over the top of the content
which is why I do that

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:38.740
which is why I do that
 

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.650
which is why I do that
scrim coming in slowly and gently and

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:40.660
scrim coming in slowly and gently and
 

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.780
scrim coming in slowly and gently and
but the next thing I want you to do is

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:42.790
but the next thing I want you to do is
 

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.250
but the next thing I want you to do is
to enter a search query in the search

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:44.260
to enter a search query in the search
 

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.020
to enter a search query in the search
field which is over on the left so

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.030
field which is over on the left so
 

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.850
field which is over on the left so
that's why I feel the animation over

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:47.860
that's why I feel the animation over
 

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.590
that's why I feel the animation over
from one side directs your attention to

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600
from one side directs your attention to
 

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.560
from one side directs your attention to
what you have to do next

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:51.570
what you have to do next
 

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.580
what you have to do next
similarly once you've entered your query

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:53.590
similarly once you've entered your query
 

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.330
similarly once you've entered your query
and you can see that the container

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340
and you can see that the container
 

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.980
and you can see that the container
expands downwards to make room for the

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:58.990
expands downwards to make room for the
 

00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.910
expands downwards to make room for the
search results to come in

00:33:59.910 --> 00:33:59.920
search results to come in
 

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.230
search results to come in
again that's priming you for the

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240
again that's priming you for the
 

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.970
again that's priming you for the
attention for you to say okay I've done

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:02.980
attention for you to say okay I've done
 

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.280
attention for you to say okay I've done
that now I'm looking down here to where

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:05.290
that now I'm looking down here to where
 

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:06.180
that now I'm looking down here to where
the content is going to be it's all

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:06.190
the content is going to be it's all
 

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:09.120
the content is going to be it's all
about directing your attention like the

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.130
about directing your attention like the
 

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.440
about directing your attention like the
previous screen and this is doing

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:10.450
previous screen and this is doing
 

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:12.060
previous screen and this is doing
obviously doing network phrase going out

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.070
obviously doing network phrase going out
 

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.980
obviously doing network phrase going out
hitting an API with search query and

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:13.990
hitting an API with search query and
 

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:15.150
hitting an API with search query and
getting content back and loading the

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:15.160
getting content back and loading the
 

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.920
getting content back and loading the
images I feel like this animation also

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:16.930
images I feel like this animation also
 

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.990
images I feel like this animation also
kind of helps hide some of that work

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000
kind of helps hide some of that work
 

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.790
kind of helps hide some of that work
going on it's kind of like distracting

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800
going on it's kind of like distracting
 

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.500
going on it's kind of like distracting
but the animation is stretching

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:22.510
but the animation is stretching
 

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.030
but the animation is stretching
downwards is kind of like buying time

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040
downwards is kind of like buying time
 

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.410
downwards is kind of like buying time
while I'm doing this networking and

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:25.420
while I'm doing this networking and
 

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.460
while I'm doing this networking and
coming back to make it feel more

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:26.470
coming back to make it feel more
 

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:28.350
coming back to make it feel more
responsive than it like perhaps

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:28.360
responsive than it like perhaps
 

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.140
responsive than it like perhaps
technically is now I'm not going to go

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:31.150
technically is now I'm not going to go
 

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.520
technically is now I'm not going to go
through every single step of this

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:32.530
through every single step of this
 

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:33.990
through every single step of this
animation because it's using a lot of

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000
animation because it's using a lot of
 

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.460
animation because it's using a lot of
the principles we've talked about before

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:35.470
the principles we've talked about before
 

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:37.530
the principles we've talked about before
using animators and so on one thing I

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:37.540
using animators and so on one thing I
 

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.120
using animators and so on one thing I
did want to focus on is on the icon

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.130
did want to focus on is on the icon
 

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.160
did want to focus on is on the icon
animation I feel like and doing the icon

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:41.170
animation I feel like and doing the icon
 

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.900
animation I feel like and doing the icon
animation as well as directing attention

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:42.910
animation as well as directing attention
 

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:45.090
animation as well as directing attention
also kind of and is a playful element it

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:45.100
also kind of and is a playful element it
 

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.860
also kind of and is a playful element it
kind of like and embody some kind of

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:46.870
kind of like and embody some kind of
 

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:50.280
kind of like and embody some kind of
character to the application I feel and

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.290
character to the application I feel and
 

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.170
character to the application I feel and
also have to call out some credit to my

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:52.180
also have to call out some credit to my
 

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.360
also have to call out some credit to my
founds it was inspired to build a son

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:54.370
founds it was inspired to build a son
 

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.700

Tsang also on dribble so it feels quite

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:56.710
Tsang also on dribble so it feels quite
 

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.590

anyway and how would we build an

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:01.210
anyway and how would we build an
 

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:03.870
anyway and how would we build an
animation like this so this is a

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880
animation like this so this is a
 

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.870
animation like this so this is a
animated vector drawable so hopefully if

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880
animated vector drawable so hopefully if
 

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.030
animated vector drawable so hopefully if
anyone here is wet with vectors you can

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040
anyone here is wet with vectors you can
 

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.860
anyone here is wet with vectors you can
know that you can basically draw lines

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:10.870
know that you can basically draw lines
 

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.990
know that you can basically draw lines
and fill paths and so on and so forth

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000
and fill paths and so on and so forth
 

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.730
and fill paths and so on and so forth
but not many people think no about their

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:14.740
but not many people think no about their
 

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.160
but not many people think no about their
trim properties you can set on a line so

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:17.170
trim properties you can set on a line so
 

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:20.100
trim properties you can set on a line so
here's a line which is stroked which

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:20.110
here's a line which is stroked which
 

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.990
here's a line which is stroked which
goes from left to right and you can set

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000
goes from left to right and you can set
 

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.970
goes from left to right and you can set
these trim properties which basically

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:23.980
these trim properties which basically
 

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.590
these trim properties which basically
say how much of what portion of the line

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:25.600
say how much of what portion of the line
 

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.320
say how much of what portion of the line
you draw so they set a trim end of not

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:28.330
you draw so they set a trim end of not
 

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.840
you draw so they set a trim end of not
point seven-five it means from 75% of

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:30.850
point seven-five it means from 75% of
 

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.080
point seven-five it means from 75% of
the way to the ends won't be drawn like

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:33.090
the way to the ends won't be drawn like
 

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.850
the way to the ends won't be drawn like
instantly if you set from trim start of

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:35.860
instantly if you set from trim start of
 

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.560
instantly if you set from trim start of
naught point five then the first half

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:37.570
naught point five then the first half
 

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.080
naught point five then the first half
won't get drawn peddling so knowing how

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.090
won't get drawn peddling so knowing how
 

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.850
won't get drawn peddling so knowing how
that works we can see this is actually

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:41.860
that works we can see this is actually
 

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.340
that works we can see this is actually
just four lines so there's one line

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:44.350
just four lines so there's one line
 

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.230
just four lines so there's one line
which joins up those kind of that stem

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240
which joins up those kind of that stem
 

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.940
which joins up those kind of that stem
as I call it and there's two lines the

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:47.950
as I call it and there's two lines the
 

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.620
as I call it and there's two lines the
Arrowhead and one line for the circle or

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:49.630
Arrowhead and one line for the circle or
 

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.290
Arrowhead and one line for the circle or
at the top and all we do is we animate

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:52.300
at the top and all we do is we animate
 

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.540
at the top and all we do is we animate
the trim star end values in order to get

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:54.550
the trim star end values in order to get
 

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.070
the trim star end values in order to get
it to kind of trace out this animation

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:56.080
it to kind of trace out this animation
 

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.070
it to kind of trace out this animation
so the arrowhead in the circles going to

00:35:59.070 --> 00:35:59.080
so the arrowhead in the circles going to
 

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.050
so the arrowhead in the circles going to
go completely clipping it to make it

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:01.060
go completely clipping it to make it
 

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.270
go completely clipping it to make it
hide whereas the stem thing has is

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280
hide whereas the stem thing has is
 

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.710
hide whereas the stem thing has is
always part of it's always on-screen so

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720
always part of it's always on-screen so
 

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.120
always part of it's always on-screen so
we never actually trimmed the whole

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.130
we never actually trimmed the whole
 

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.410
we never actually trimmed the whole
thing as it worth it just animates

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:07.420
thing as it worth it just animates
 

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.200
thing as it worth it just animates
between the two states notice also that

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:10.210
between the two states notice also that
 

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.540
between the two states notice also that
the stretching out of the line so as

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:12.550
the stretching out of the line so as
 

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.490
the stretching out of the line so as
it's kind of stretches out this is

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:14.500
it's kind of stretches out this is
 

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.780
it's kind of stretches out this is
really really easily achieved just by

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:15.790
really really easily achieved just by
 

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:16.890
really really easily achieved just by
setting different durations for

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:16.900
setting different durations for
 

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.890
setting different durations for
animating the start and end so here's

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:19.900
animating the start and end so here's
 

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.170
animating the start and end so here's
how you build it so this is one vector

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:22.180
how you build it so this is one vector
 

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.120
how you build it so this is one vector
drawable like I say there's four lines

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:24.130
drawable like I say there's four lines
 

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.280
drawable like I say there's four lines
so each of these path objects is aligned

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:26.290
so each of these path objects is aligned
 

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.170
so each of these path objects is aligned
so it has a name so you can identify it

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:28.180
so it has a name so you can identify it
 

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.150
so it has a name so you can identify it
later on and a couple of pro tips for

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160
later on and a couple of pro tips for
 

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.200
later on and a couple of pro tips for
building these things I found really

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:31.210
building these things I found really
 

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.590
building these things I found really
helpful is to create a resources far

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:34.600
helpful is to create a resources far
 

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.000
helpful is to create a resources far
like a regular resource as far like you

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.010
like a regular resource as far like you
 

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.440
like a regular resource as far like you
put your strings and ins and stuff in

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:37.450
put your strings and ins and stuff in
 

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.170
put your strings and ins and stuff in
and reference that for and put the paths

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:40.180
and reference that for and put the paths
 

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.030
and reference that for and put the paths
and the fraction of the trim values in

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040
and the fraction of the trim values in
 

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.320
and the fraction of the trim values in
that because you're going to refer to

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.330
that because you're going to refer to
 

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:44.730
that because you're going to refer to
these a few times it makes it easier to

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:44.740
these a few times it makes it easier to
 

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.910
these a few times it makes it easier to
only have it in one place and then you

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920
only have it in one place and then you
 

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.130
only have it in one place and then you
define object animators for animating

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:50.140
define object animators for animating
 

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.960
define object animators for animating
each of those properties so here's one

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:51.970
each of those properties so here's one
 

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.820
each of those properties so here's one
we're animating the trims start and end

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:53.830
we're animating the trims start and end
 

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.560
we're animating the trims start and end
and then here referencing out to those

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:55.570
and then here referencing out to those
 

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.060
and then here referencing out to those
fractions that I want to trim too and

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.070
fractions that I want to trim too and
 

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.070
fractions that I want to trim too and
again this is we're setting a different

00:36:59.070 --> 00:36:59.080
again this is we're setting a different
 

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.450
again this is we're setting a different
duration allows you to have that

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:00.460
duration allows you to have that
 

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.680
duration allows you to have that
stretching out and come back together

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:01.690
stretching out and come back together
 

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.980
stretching out and come back together
feel really really simply then the last

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:04.990
feel really really simply then the last
 

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.900
feel really really simply then the last
piece of puzzle is the animated vector

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:06.910
piece of puzzle is the animated vector
 

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.280
piece of puzzle is the animated vector
which pulls together the draw

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.290
which pulls together the draw
 

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.680
which pulls together the draw
robell and the animator and runs and

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:10.690
robell and the animator and runs and
 

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:12.330
robell and the animator and runs and
says what to run it on so here you

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:12.340
says what to run it on so here you
 

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.250
says what to run it on so here you
identify it by names on that stem run

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:14.260
identify it by names on that stem run
 

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.260
identify it by names on that stem run
this animator and then finally to use it

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.270
this animator and then finally to use it
 

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.150
this animator and then finally to use it
you just load it as a drawable set it on

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160
you just load it as a drawable set it on
 

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.540
you just load it as a drawable set it on
an image view and call start so I hope

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:24.550
an image view and call start so I hope
 

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:26.670
an image view and call start so I hope
you can see maybe a bit of effort but I

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680
you can see maybe a bit of effort but I
 

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.800
you can see maybe a bit of effort but I
think worth it for and you know the

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:28.810
think worth it for and you know the
 

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.510
think worth it for and you know the
quality like put some character to the

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520
quality like put some character to the
 

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.030
quality like put some character to the
application so I want to go out this is

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040
application so I want to go out this is
 

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.800
application so I want to go out this is
the way to run an abd for like a

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:34.810
the way to run an abd for like a
 

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:36.510
the way to run an abd for like a
one-shot type operation just to run the

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520
one-shot type operation just to run the
 

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.550
one-shot type operation just to run the
animation but a nice way you can do it

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560
animation but a nice way you can do it
 

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.240
animation but a nice way you can do it
is often to do state changes so for

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:42.250
is often to do state changes so for
 

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.850
is often to do state changes so for
example here is them when you like or

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:44.860
example here is them when you like or
 

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.000
example here is them when you like or
unlike a shot on dribble I basically

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.010
unlike a shot on dribble I basically
 

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.250
unlike a shot on dribble I basically
have animations between those two states

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:50.260
have animations between those two states
 

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.480
have animations between those two states
so when you like it it's basically this

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:54.490
so when you like it it's basically this
 

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:55.650
so when you like it it's basically this
two versions of heart there's a stroke

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:55.660
two versions of heart there's a stroke
 

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.420
two versions of heart there's a stroke
version with a filled version on top and

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:57.430
version with a filled version on top and
 

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.430
version with a filled version on top and
then you apply a clip which you animate

00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440
then you apply a clip which you animate
 

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.290
then you apply a clip which you animate
the clip up and down which gives you

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:01.300
the clip up and down which gives you
 

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.090
the clip up and down which gives you
this filling up and the unliking is

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:03.100
this filling up and the unliking is
 

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.220
this filling up and the unliking is
basically two paths and you just rotate

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:05.230
basically two paths and you just rotate
 

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.260
basically two paths and you just rotate
and fade them and then do this the trim

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:07.270
and fade them and then do this the trim
 

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.930
and fade them and then do this the trim
line thing to fun little animations you

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:09.940
line thing to fun little animations you
 

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.780
line thing to fun little animations you
can write but Android yet obviously this

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:12.790
can write but Android yet obviously this
 

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.340
can write but Android yet obviously this
animated selector which makes it way

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:14.350
animated selector which makes it way
 

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.470
animated selector which makes it way
easier you don't have to manually run

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480
easier you don't have to manually run
 

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.690
easier you don't have to manually run
all these animations all the time it's a

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:18.700
all these animations all the time it's a
 

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.510
all these animations all the time it's a
bit like a drawable selector so you know

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520
