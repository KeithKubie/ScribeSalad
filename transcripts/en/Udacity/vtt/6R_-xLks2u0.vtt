You're probably familiar with many of
the services that are offered by Google.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.010
And if you develop applications
your users likely are too.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.280
Perhaps they need to find a location or
see what's interesting nearby.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.440
They're using Google Maps.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.190
Maybe you want to monetize your apps so

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.140
that app usage is rewarded and your
users, they don't have to pay upfront.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.180
Google Ads is your friend.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.940

great APIs for you, storing files in

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.370
the cloud with Google Drive,
accessing Goggle Analytics.

Signing into your application,
integrating with Google Fit and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.180
much, much more.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.350
In this course, you'll learn how to
use these services in your apps.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.200

allowing you to build better apps.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.300
Before you can get started, let's take a
look at getting the tools that you need.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.600

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.970
