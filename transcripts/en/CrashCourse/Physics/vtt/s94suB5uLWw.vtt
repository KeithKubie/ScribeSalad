This episode is supported by Prudential.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.920
So it’s Friday, April 21, 1820.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.900
A physics professor in Denmark named Hans Christian Oersted is in the middle of a lecture, and he’s using a compass and an electric wire for a demonstration.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.840
He turns on the current that runs through the wire, and he notices that the needle in the compass starts to move.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.820
And when he turns the current off, the needle
moves back to where it was.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.460
Then, he runs the current through the wire in the opposite direction, and sees the needle move the other way.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.560
What Oersted demonstrated that day was a fundamental discovery: the connection between electricity and magnetism.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.840
And it changed the field of physics forever.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.720
The relationship between electricity and magnetism not only explains what Oersted and his students witnessed in 1820.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.860
It also makes possible much of the technology that’s used today – from hydroelectric dams to your smartphone.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.720
It even explains why Earth’s magnetic field is essentially keeping you from being cooked alive right now.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.760
And all you really need to understand the basics of magnetism and electricity is this. [waves hand]

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:11.080
[Theme Music]

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.840
You’re probably familiar with the basics
of magnets already:

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.380
They have a north pole and south pole.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.700
Two of the same pole will repel each other,
while opposites attract.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.590
Only certain materials, especially those that
contain iron, can be magnets.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.460
It depends on their molecular properties.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.260
And other metals, including cobalt, nickel, and iron, are attracted to magnets, even though they aren’t magnets themselves.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.000
Like the metal in your refrigerator door.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.780
And there’s a magnetic field around Earth, which is why you can use a compass to figure out which way is north.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.500
The magnet in the compass aligns itself with
Earth’s magnetic field.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.820
Just as we use electric field lines to represent the electric field created by charges, we can draw magnetic field lines to represent the magnetic field created by magnets.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.140
And as with electric fields, the more crowded
the lines are, the stronger the magnetic field.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.760
The lines point from the north pole to the south pole – like how electric field lines point from the positive to the negative charge.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.220
But there’s a key difference: you can have an electric field spreading outward from a single electric charge.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.640
But that can’t happen with magnets because
you can’t isolate one magnetic pole.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.040
If you chop a bar magnet in half, you don’t end up with one north magnet and one south magnet – you end up with two magnets, each with its own north pole and south pole.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.280
This means that the magnetic field lines surrounding
a magnet always form closed loops.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.080
We measure magnetic fields using a unit called
the tesla, which is one Newton per Ampere-meter.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.280
And 1 tesla is a very strong magnetic field – the fields from some of the strongest superconducting magnets in the world are only 10 teslas.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.740
Now, when Oersted was doing his demonstration on that fateful day in 1820, he was using a regular compass magnet.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:48.200
But when he brought the magnet close to a wire carrying a current, the magnetic field from that current exerted a force on the needle, moving it to point in a different direction.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.520
Oersted had discovered one of the fundamental
principles of electromagnetism:

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.110
An electric current produces a magnetic field.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.910
After a few more months of experimenting, Oersted figured out that when a current runs through a wire, the magnetic field that it produces surrounds the wire.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.070
Expressed with field lines, the magnetic field would
appear as circles, with the wire at their center.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.460
If the current was coming straight towards
you, the field lines would be pointing counterclockwise.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.080
And we use the vector B to represent the magnetic
field.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.680
The magnitude of the vector is the strength of the magnetic field, and the direction of the vector is the field’s direction.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.180
Now, there’s an easy way to remember how the direction of the electric current, and the direction of the magnetic field it produces, relate to each other.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.320
It’s called the first right-hand rule – because
there are actually three right-hand rules.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.000
Just take your right hand, and point your
thumb in the direction of the electric current.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.640
Now curl your fingers.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.340
The direction your fingers are curling?

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.580
That’s the way the magnetic field lines
are pointing.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.000
And likewise, if you know the direction of the magnetic field lines, you can use the rule to figure out the direction of the current in the wire.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.640
It really comes in, uh, handy.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.300
Now, if a current running through a wire exerts a force on a magnet, you might expect the opposite to be true as well:

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.910
That a magnet exerts a force on a current
running through a wire.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.760
And it does!

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.480
Which is good, because that’s what’s protecting us from harmful radiation from the Sun right now.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.980
The direction of the force from a magnetic field on a current running through a wire will be perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.300
Which brings us to the second right-hand rule!

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.360
This one helps you keep track of three directions: the direction of the magnetic field, the current, and the force.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.400
Here’s how to use the second right-hand
rule:

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.600
Point your arm in the direction of the current.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.540
Then bend your fingers so they’re perpendicular
to your palm.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.480
This represents the direction of the magnetic
field.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.280
Your thumb, which is perpendicular to your
fingers, is the direction of the force on the wire.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.080
But what about the strength of that force?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.919
You can use your hands to figure this out,
too!

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.120
But you’ll have to use them to do math.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.040
Sorry.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.020
The magnitude of the force from a magnetic
field on a wire is equal to I l B sin theta.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.740
This equation tells us that there are four
factors that affect the magnitude of the force.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.160
First, there’s the current in the wire – that’s I –
and the stronger it is, the stronger the force is.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.580
Second, there’s the length of the wire running
through the magnetic field – that’s l

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.320
– and the longer the wire is, the stronger
the force is.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.070
Third, there’s the magnetic field, B, and
the stronger B is, the stronger the force.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.250
Finally, the closer to perpendicular the current is with respect to the magnetic field’s direction, the stronger the force is.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.860
That’s where the sine theta comes in – its
maximum value is 1, when theta is 90 degrees.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.930
So the current is perpendicular to the magnetic
field lines.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.010
That’s when the force will be strongest.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:32.360
Similarly, the minimum value of sine theta is 0, when theta is 0 – so that means the current is parallel to the magnetic field lines.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.220
And in that case, there won’t be any force
on the wire at all.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.820
Now, all of this math can help us understand how we’re being protected right now from solar radiation!

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.120
The Sun is constantly shooting radiation towards
Earth, in the form of charged particles.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.820
But, luckily for us, Earth has a magnetic
field.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.780
Currents are made up of moving electric charges, so it makes sense that a magnetic field would also exert a force on single electric charges that pass through it.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.220
And this is exactly what the Earth’s magnetic field does to the charged particles coming from the Sun:

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.080
it deflects them, sending them spiraling away
and protecting us from the worst of the radiation.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.520
Let’s suppose you wanted to find the magnitude of the force of the magnetic field on a single charged particle from the Sun.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.540
All you’d have to do is change the equation we used for the force on the current, to account for the fact that we’re talking about a single charge.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.600
The equation for the force of a magnetic field
on a current says that:

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:29.060
the strength of the force is equal to the current, times the length of the wire, times the strength of the magnetic field, times the sine of the angle between the current and the magnetic field.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.820
Now, two of those variables don’t apply to
a single charge: the current, I, and the length, l.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:44.500
But current is just equal to the number of charged particles passing a given point over a certain amount of time – which we'll call N – times their charge, q, divided by that time, t.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.320
For a single charge, N is just 1.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.610
And length is just equal to velocity, v, multiplied
by time.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:57.210
So we can apply these two facts to our equation for force, which tells us that the force on an electric charge moving through a magnetic field, is equal to:

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:04.240
q divided by time, multiplied by velocity times time, times the strength of the magnetic field, times the sine of theta.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.880
Those two t’s cancel each other out, so
the equation simplifies to F = qvBsintheta.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.800
That means that, like the force on a current running through a wire, the force on a single electric charge depends on four factors.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.880
One is the same as with a current: The stronger
the magnetic field, the stronger the force.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.100
The other three factors are slightly different
from the case with a current:

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.600
First, the force is stronger, the closer to perpendicular the charge’s velocity is to the magnetic field lines.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.720
Which means that if the charge’s velocity is parallel to the magnetic field lines, there won’t be any force on whatsoever.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.100
Second, the more charge the particle has,
the stronger the force.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.500
And third, the faster the particle is moving,
the stronger the force.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.600
Finding the direction of this force is where
the third right-hand rule comes in:

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.140
So get your right hand out again!

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.500
Straighten your fingers with your thumb stretched
outward.

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:53.029
Then point your arm in the direction of the
particle’s velocity.

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:56.890
Then bend your fingers to make them point
in the direction of the magnetic field lines.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.540
This is where things get a little tricky:

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.920
If the charged particle is positive, your thumb is
pointing in the direction of the force.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.960
But if it’s negative, the force is pointing
in the direction opposite your thumb.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.500
So, electric currents create magnetic fields, and magnetic fields exert forces on electric currents and charges.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:19.580
Oersted’s experiment was simple, but his discovery linked two major fields of physics, and inspired other scientists to do a lot more experimenting.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.240
Today, you learned about magnetism, and the magnetic field created by a current running through a wire.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.830
We also talked about the force from a magnetic
field on a current running through a wire,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.850
and on a single charge moving through a magnetic
field.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.160
And we went through the three right-hand rules.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.829

Saving a little more today, even just 1% more of your annual income, can go a long way toward building a better retirement tomorrow.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.500
Let’s do a math equation.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.240
Say a 25 year old that earns $40,000 a year
is planning on retiring at 70.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.380
If they save an additional 1% of their salary
by deducting $33 from their monthly paycheck,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:09:02.660
and earn 6% compounding interest, they could increase their retirement savings by about $97,943.73.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.560
Math – it’s not just for physicists.
