00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.360
In the last video, we started to explore
the notion of an error function.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.120
Not to be confused with the expected value

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.000
because it really does reflect the same
notation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.810
But here E is for error.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.840
And we could also thought it will

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.180
some times here referred to as Reminder
function.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.750
And we saw it's really just the difference
as we,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.440
the difference between the function and
our approximation of the function.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.980
So for example, this, this distance right
over here, that is our error.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.680
That is our error at the x is equal to b.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.340
And what we really care about is the
absolute value of it.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.290
Because at some points f of x might be
larger than the polynomial.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.500
Sometimes the polynomial might be larger
than f of x.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.860
What we care is the absolute distance
between them.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.500
And so what I want to do in this video is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.430
try to bound, try to bound our error at
some b.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.560
Try to bound our error.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.640
So say it's less than or equal to some
constant value.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.840
Try to bound it at b for some b is greater
than a.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.070
We're just going to assume that b is
greater than a.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.620
And we saw some tantalizing, we, we got to
a bit of a tantalizing

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.519
result that seems like we might be able to
bound it in the last video.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.660
We saw that the n plus 1th derivative of
our error

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.060
function is equal to the n plus 1th
derivative of our function.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.760
Or their absolute values would also be
equal to.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.330
So if we could somehow bound the n plus
1th derivative

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.240
of our function over some interval, an
interval that matters to us.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.770
An interval that maybe has b in it.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.980
Then, we can, at least bound the n plus
1th derivative our error function.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.390
And then, maybe we can do a little bit of

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.120
integration to bound the error itself at
some value b.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.160
So, let's see if we can do that.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.060
Well, let's just assume, let's just assume
that we're in a reality where

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.300
we do know something about the n plus1
derivative of f of x.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.420
Let's say we do know that this.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.150
We do it in a color I that haven't used
yet.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.580
Well, I'll do it in white.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.400
So let's say that that thing over there
looks something like that.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.420
So that is f the n plus 1th derivative.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.500
The n plus 1th derivative.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.740
And I only care about it over this
interval right over here.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.140
Who cares what it does later, I just gotta
bound it over the interval

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.759
cuz at the end of the day I just wanna
balance b right over there.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.750
So let's say that the absolute value of
this.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.740
Let's say that we know.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.350
Let me write it over here, let's say that
we know.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.800
We know that the absolute value of the n
plus 1th derivative, the n plus 1th.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.520
And, I apologize I actually switch between
the capital N and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.120
the lower-case n and I did that in the
last video.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.690
I shouldn't have, but now that you know

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.078
that I did that hopefully it doesn't
confuse it.

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:35.090
N plus 1th, so let's say we know that the
n plus 1th

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.110
derivative of f of x, the absolute value
of it, let's say it's bounded.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.010
Let's say it's less than or equal to some
m

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.160
over the interval, cuz we only care about
the interval.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.540
It might not be bounded in general, but
all we

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.168
care is it takes some maximum value over
this interval.

00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:57.190
So over, over, over the interval x, I
could write it this way,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.190
over the interval x is a member between a
and b, so this includes both of them.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.330
It's a closed interval, x could be a, x

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.940
could be b, or x could be anything in
between.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.760
And we can say this generally that,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.230
that this derivative will have some
maximum value.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.060
So this is its, the absolute value,
maximum value, max value, m for max.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.980
We know that it will have a maximum value,
if this thing is continuous.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.620
So once again we're going to assume that
it is continuous,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.710
that it has some maximum value over this
interval right over here.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.796
Well this thing, this thing right over
here, we know is the

00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:38.978
same thing as the n plus 1 derivative of
the error function.

00:03:38.978 --> 00:03:46.220
So then we know, so then that, that
implies, that implies that,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.980
that implies that the, that's a new color,
let me do that in blue, or that green.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.720
That implies that the, the, the end plus
one derivative of the error function.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.270
The absolute value of it because these are
the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.570
same thing is also, is also bounded by m.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.500
So that's a little bit of an interesting
result but it gets us no where near there.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.450
It might look similar but this is the n
plus 1 derivative of the error function.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.000
And, and we'll have to think about how we
can get an m in the future.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.140
We're assuming that we some how know it
and maybe

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.589
we'll do some example problems where we
figure that out.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.160
But this is the m plus 1th derivative.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.750
We bounded it's absolute value but we

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.210
really want to bound the actual error
function.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.710
The 0 is the derivative, you could say,
the actual function itself.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.380
What we could try to integrate both sides
of this and see

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.960
if we can eventually get to e, to get to e
of x.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.095
To get our, to our error function or our
remainder function so let's do that.

00:04:38.095 --> 00:04:44.050
Let's take the integral, let's take the
integral of both sides of this.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.290
Now the integral on this left hand side,
it's a little interesting.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.930
We take the integral of the absolute
value.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.570
It would be easier if we were taking the
absolute value of the integral.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.220
And lucky for us, the way it's set up.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.480
So let me just write a little aside here.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.369
We know generally that if I take, and it's
something for you to think about.

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:03.029
If I take, so if I have two options, if I
have two

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:09.090
options, this option versus and I don't
know, they look the same right now.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.870
I know they look the same right now.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.810
So over here, I'm gonna have the integral
of the absolute value

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.690
and over here I'm going to have the
absolute value of the interval.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.310
Which of these is going to be, which of
these can be larger?

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.790
Well, you just have to think about the
scenarios.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.170
So, if f of x is always positive over the
interval that

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.470
you're taking the integration, then
they're going to be the same thing.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.990
They're, you're gonna get positive values.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.760
Take the absolute of a value of a positive
value.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.260
It doesn't make a difference.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.990
What matters is if f of x is negative.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.780
If f of x, if f of x is negative the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.170
entire time, so if this our x-axis, that
is our y-axis.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.070
If f of x is, well we saw if it's positive
the entire

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.310
time, you're taking the absolute value of
a positive, absolute value of positive.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.130
It's not going to matter.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.860
These two things are going to be equal.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.800
If f of x is negative the whole time, then
you're going

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.920
to get, then this integral going to
evaluate to a negative value.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.440
But then, you would take the absolute
value of it.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.090
And then over here, you're just going to,
this is, the integral going to

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.820
value to a positive value and it's still
going to be the same thing.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.300
The interesting case is when f of x is
both

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.970
positive and negative, so you can imagine
a situation like this.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.580
If f of x looks something like that, then

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.580
this right over here, the integral, you'd
have positive.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.560
This would be positive and then this would
be negative right over here.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.810
And so they would cancel each other out.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.230
So this would be a smaller value than

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.580
if you took the integral of the absolute
value.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.470
So the integral, the absolute value of f
would look something like this.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.260
So all of the areas are going to be, if
you view the

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.120
integral, if you view this it is

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.730
definitely going to be a definite
integral.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.380
All of the areas, all of the areas would
be positive.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.750
So when you it, you are going to get a

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.210
bigger value when you take the integral of
an absolute value.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.791
Then you will, especially when f of x

00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:57.038
goes both positive and negative over the
interval.

00:06:57.038 --> 00:07:02.005
Then you would if you took the integral
first and then the absolute value.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.090
Cuz once again, if you took the integral
first, for something like

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.020
this, you'd get a low value cause this
stuff would cancel out.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.500
Would cancel out with this stuff right
over here then you'd

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.470
take the absolute value of just a lower, a
lower magnitude number.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.880
And so in general, the integral, the

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.260
integral, sorry the absolute value of the
integral

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.870
is going to be less than or equal to the
integral of the absolute value.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.670
So we can say, so this right here is the
integral of

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.740
the absolute value which is going to be
greater than or equal.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.840
What we have written over here is just
this.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.910
That's going to be greater than or equal
to, and I

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.550
think you'll see why I'm why I'm doing
this in a second.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.670
Greater than or equal to the absolute
value, the absolute

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:45.920
value of the integral of, of the n plus
1th derivative.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.960
The n plus 1th derivative of, x, dx.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.490
And the reason why this is useful, is that
we can still

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.090
keep the inequality that, this is less
than, or equal to this.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.700
But now, this is a pretty straight forward
integral to evaluate.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.932
The indo, the anti-derivative of the n
plus

00:08:00.932 --> 00:08:04.240
1th derivative, is going to be the nth
derivative.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.510
So this business, right over here.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.960
Is just going to the absolute value of the
nth derivative.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:16.310
The absolute value of the nth derivative
of our error function.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.330
Did I say expected value?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.730
I shouldn't.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.820
See, it even confuses me.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.710
This is the error function.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.900
I should've used r, r for remainder.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.660
But this all error.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.170
The, noth, nothing about probability or
expected value in this video.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:25.850
This is.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.250
E for error.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.030
So anyway, this is going to be the nth
derivative of our

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.880
error function, which is going to be less
than or equal to this.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.230
Which is less than or equal to the
anti-derivative of M.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.760
Well, that's a constant.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.630
So that's going to be mx, mx.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.179
And since we're just taking indefinite
integrals.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.220
We can't forget the idea that we have a
constant over here.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.840
And in general, when you're trying to
create an upper

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.220
bound you want as low of an upper bound as
possible.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.640
So we wanna minimize, we wanna minimize
what this constant is.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.180
And lucky for us, we do have, we do know
what this,

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.410
what this function, what value this
function takes on at a point.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.430
We know that the nth derivative of our
error function at a is equal to 0.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.940
I think we wrote it over here.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.480
The nth derivative at a is equal to 0.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.370
And that's because the nth derivative of
the function and the

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.550
approximation at a are going to be the
same exact thing.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.860
And so, if we evaluate both sides of this
at a, I'll

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.010
do that over here on the side, we know
that the absolute value.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.560
We know the absolute value of the nth
derivative at a, we know

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.670
that this thing is going to be equal to
the absolute value of 0.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:35.400
Which is 0.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.820
Which needs to be less than or equal to
when you evaluate this

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:43.420
thing at a, which is less than or equal to
m a plus c.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.260
And so you can, if you look at this part

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.710
of the inequality, you subtract m a from
both sides.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.460
You get negative m a is less than or equal
to c.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.590
So our constant here, based on that little
condition

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.310
that we were able to get in the last
video.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.820
Our constant is going to be greater than
or equal to negative ma.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.880
So if we want to minimize the constant, if
we wanna get this as low

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.090
of a bound as possible, we would wanna
pick c is equal to negative Ma.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.250
That is the lowest possible c that will

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.170
meet these constraints that we know are
true.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.969
So, we will actually pick c to be negative
Ma.

00:10:16.969 --> 00:10:19.364
And then we can rewrite this whole thing
as the

00:10:19.364 --> 00:10:22.590
absolute value of the nth derivative of
the error function.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.640
The nth derivative of the error function.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.970
Not the expected value.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.010
I have a strange suspicion I might have
said expected value.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.790
But, this is the error function.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.440
The nth der.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.230
The absolute value of the nth derivative
of the error function

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:38.600
is less than or equal to M times x minus
a.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.820
And once again all of the constraints
hold.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.880
This is for, this is for x as part of the
interval.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.910
The closed interval between, the closed
interval between a and b.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.220
But looks like we're making progress.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.910
We at least went from the m plus 1
derivative to the n derivative.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.170
Lets see if we can keep going.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.750
So same general idea.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.090
This if we know this then we know that

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.740
we can take the integral of both sides of
this.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.850
So we can take the integral of both sides
of this

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.360
the anti derivative of both sides.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.740
And we know from what we figured out up
here

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.780
that something's that's even smaller than
this right over here.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.820
Is, is the absolute value of the integral
of the expected value.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.070
Now [LAUGH] see, I said it.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.900
Of the error function, not the expected
value.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.900
Of the error function.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.170
The nth derivative of the error function
of x.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.940
The nth derivative of the error function
of x dx.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.510
So we know that this is less than or equal
to based on the exact same logic there.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.450
And this is useful because this is just
going to be, this is just

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:42.640
going to be the nth minus 1 derivative of
our error function of x.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.160
And of course we have the absolute value
outside of it.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.650
And now this is going to be less than or
equal to.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.390
It's less than or equal to this, which is
less than or equal

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.940
to this, which is less than or equal to
this right over here.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.340
The anti-derivative of this right over
here is going

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.060
to be M times x minus a squared over 2.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.410
You could do U substitution if you want or
you could just say hey look.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.820
I have a little expression here, it's
derivative is 1.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.480
So it's implicitly there so I can just
treat it as kind of a U.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.320
So raise it to an exponent and then divide
that exponent.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.460
But once again I'm taking indefinite
integrals.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.350
So I'm going to say a plus C over here.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.600
But let's use that same exact logic.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.130
If we evaluate this at A, you're going to
have it.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.250
If you evaluate this while, let's evaluate
both sides of this at A.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.990
the left side, evaluated at A, we know, is
going to be zero.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.250
We figured that out, all, up here in the
last video.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.630
So you get, I'm gonna do it on the right
over here.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.130
You get zero, when you valued the left
side of a.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.820
The right side of a, if you, the right
side of the

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.850
value of a you get m times a menus a
square over 2.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:45.220
So you are gonna get 0 plus c, so you are
gonna get, 0 is less or equal to c.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.620
Once again we want to minimize our constant,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.800
we wanna minimize our upper boundary up
here.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.930
So we wanna pick the lowest possible c
that we talk constrains.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.440
So the lowest possible c that meets our
constraint is zero.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.070
And so the general idea here is that we
can keep doing this, we can

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:07.270
keep doing exactly what we're doing all
the way, all the way, all the way until.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.440
And so we keep integrating it at the exact
same, same way that I've

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.040
done it all the way that we get and using
this exact same property here.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.180
All the way until we get, the bound on the
error function of x.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.550
So you could view this as the 0th
derivative.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.740
You know, we're going all the way to the

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.360
0th derivative, which is really just the
error function.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.620
The bound on the error function of x is
going to

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.660
be less than or equal to, and what's it
going to be?

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.940
And you can already see the pattern here.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.270
Is that it's going to be m times x, minus
a.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.490
And the exponent, the one way to think
about it, this exponent

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.950
plus this derivative is going to be equal
to n plus 1.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.980
Now this derivative is zero so this
exponent is going to be n plus 1.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.210
And whatever the exponent is, you're going
to have,a nd maybe I should

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.280
have done it, you're going to have n plus
one factorial over here.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.950
And if say wait why, where does this n
plus 1 factorial come from?

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.370
I just had a two here.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.120
Well think about what happens when we
integrate this again.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.700
You're going to raise this to the third
power and then divide by three.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.050
So your denominator is going to have two
times three.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.540
Then when you integrate it again, you're
going to raise

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.800
it to the fourth power and then divide by
four.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.960
So then your denominator is going to be
two times three times four.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.140
Four factorial.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.530
So whatever power you're raising to, the

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.500
denominator is going to be that power
factorial.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.240
But what's really interesting now is if we
are

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.360
able to figure out that maximum value of
our function.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.510
If we're able to figure out that maximum
value of our function right there.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.800
We now have a way of bounding our error
function

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.500
over that interval, over that interval
between a and b.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.530
So for example, the error function at b.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.040
We can now bound it if we know what an m
is.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:49.190
We can say the error function at b is
going to be less than or equal to m times

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:57.190
b minus a to the n plus 1th power over n
plus 1 factorial.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.030
So that gets us a really powerful, I guess
you

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.720
could call it, result, kinda the, the math
behind it.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.849
And now we can show some examples where
this could actually be applied.
