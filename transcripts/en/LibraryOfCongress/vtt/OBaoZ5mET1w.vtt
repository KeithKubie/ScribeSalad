From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:16.410
The Library of Congress
receives hundreds of thousands

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.340
of questions each year from
curious minds around the world.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.710
Reference librarians
and subject specialists

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.090
from across the Library
are ready and waiting

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.290
to help you find the
information you need.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.110
This video will show
you the easiest way

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.980
to ask us a question,
through our online Ask a

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.860
Librarian service.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.250
This FREE service is
available to anyone, anywhere.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.380
Let's begin on the Library
homepage, at LOC.GOV Go

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.080
to the upper left
corner of the page

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.610
and click the three
horizontal bars.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.020
From the dropdown menu, select
the Ask a Librarian Link.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.750
This is the Ask a
Librarian Homepage.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.220
Let's get started by selecting
the "online form" located

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.270
at the top of the page.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.700
Here we are in the Ask
a Librarian General

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.480
Inquiries form.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.260
Sending us a question is as easy

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.210
as typing your question
in the box.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.620
I'll try: Is it true
Susan B. Anthony was known

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.920
for her red shawl?

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.210
I haven't been able to find
any information on this.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.520
Complete the form by
entering your question,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.820
and any additional details,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.200
such as where you've already
looked for information.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.290
Once you have filled
in the required fields,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.280
indicated by a red asterisk,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.330
click "Ask Your Question"
to finish.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.090
A confirmation page will appear

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.700
to indicate your
submission was successful.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.460
You will also get an
e-mail confirmation.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.210
A librarian will send a
full response generally

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.740
within five business
days or less.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.820
If you have a specific reading
room you would like to consult,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.250
you can choose it from the list
on the Ask a Librarian homepage.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.100
For example, if you
had a question

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.890
about civil war era
photographs, you may wish

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.860
to route your question to the
Prints and Photographs Division.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.330
If you are not quite sure which
link to choose, don't worry.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.800
Go ahead and select the
"online form" located

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.570
at the top of the page.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.380
No matter what, Librarians
will direct your question

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.610
where it needs to go.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.890
In addition to the Ask a
Librarian online request form,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.340
some areas of the library offer
chat during limited hours,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.870
indicated by the chat icon.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.650
Whatever your question, our
reference librarians are ready

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.750
and waiting to provide you
with the information you need,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.130
so go ahead and Ask a Librarian!

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.720
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
