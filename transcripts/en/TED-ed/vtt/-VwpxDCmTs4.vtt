00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you think of culture as an iceberg,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
only a small fraction of it is visible.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Food, flags, and festivals, which are often talked about in schools,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
are the visible parts that we rightly celebrate.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
However, only when we look deeper, under the water,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
are we able to focus on the common values that connect us.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In what seems to be an increasingly troubled world,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
where social and political systems are being stretched,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
conflict within and between countries is at times heightened,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
while human rights are being ignored,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
this desire for peace grows ever stronger.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Sometimes we see this common value emerging above the surface

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and becoming visible. For example, it is part of everyday language used

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
when people greet one another and welcome the new day.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In many parts of the Arab world and parts of south Asia,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
such as Bangladesh for example,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the greeting of "as-salamu alaykum" can be translated to "peace be with you."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The same is true as you walk through markets or into schools

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
each morning in India, or Nepal, or Bhutan,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
where greetings of "namaste," which has not only a strong message of peace

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
- "the spirit in me greets the spirit in you" -

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but also its physical gesture, the palms brought together slowly at the heart,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to honor a special place in each of us.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In Myanmar, greetings of "mingalarbar" are met by bowing monks

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
as they internalize a message where others add blessing

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to enhance the auspiciousness of the moment,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
or by giggling children as they scurry off to school.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
After many hours of hiking through the mountains of Lesotho,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
surrounded by the tranquility and rugged terrain,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
you are likely to meet a herdboy who has slept the night

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
in a vacant rondoval and bellows out greetings of "lumela"

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
or "khotso", which means "peace be with you."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If you took a moment to research further the meanings behind "shalom,"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
or the Korean greeting,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
you would find that they too have deeply-seated connections to peace.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
However, they have become quick comments

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
made to welcome, greet, and say hello, and in this overuse,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
have likely lost the focus that was originally intended

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
when put into practice hundreds or thousands of years ago.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In highlighting this simple evidence of ingrained behavior,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we can create the necessary shift in thinking

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.160
needed to incorporate flexibility and open-mindedness

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.215
in us all when looking at the globalization of the world.
