00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
it which might seem to be rather
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.890
it which might seem to be rather
hypocritical as it isn't like I've shied

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
hypocritical as it isn't like I've shied
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.229
hypocritical as it isn't like I've shied
away from exposing my views in public

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239
away from exposing my views in public

away from exposing my views in public
but I felt that I was driven to that by

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
but I felt that I was driven to that by
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.010
but I felt that I was driven to that by
necessity and also by my desire to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
necessity and also by my desire to
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.130
necessity and also by my desire to
educate people however I would say

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

despite the fact that I'm somewhat
uncomfortable with it I think that's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
uncomfortable with it I think that's
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069
uncomfortable with it I think that's
mostly because of the responsibility you

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079

although I'm not judging anybody for it
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.120
although I'm not judging anybody for it
it's just a strange thing to observe but

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130
it's just a strange thing to observe but
 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.620
it's just a strange thing to observe but
you know I can't complain about the fact

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
you know I can't complain about the fact
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.850
you know I can't complain about the fact
that people are are are are positively

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
that people are are are are positively
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.010
that people are are are are positively
predisposed to what I'm doing I mean

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
predisposed to what I'm doing I mean
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600
predisposed to what I'm doing I mean
it's such a privilege I can't imagine

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
it's such a privilege I can't imagine
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.639
it's such a privilege I can't imagine
what it would be like to be hated

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
what it would be like to be hated
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.710

publicly I think that would just kill me

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
publicly I think that would just kill me
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.569
publicly I think that would just kill me
I really think that but so I mean it's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
I really think that but so I mean it's
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.910
I really think that but so I mean it's
it's I suppose there's the possibility

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
it's I suppose there's the possibility
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350
it's I suppose there's the possibility
of having that sort of thing go to your

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
of having that sort of thing go to your
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.109
of having that sort of thing go to your
head and it's it and I mean that happens

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
head and it's it and I mean that happens
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.429
head and it's it and I mean that happens
to people but

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
to people but
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.290
to people but
I think I've said this before maybe on

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
I think I've said this before maybe on
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.790
I think I've said this before maybe on
the q and A's I have a pretty sensible

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
the q and A's I have a pretty sensible
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.199
the q and A's I have a pretty sensible
family and I have a pretty what would

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209
family and I have a pretty what would
 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.430
family and I have a pretty what would
you say I have a pretty good sense of my

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
you say I have a pretty good sense of my
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.130
you say I have a pretty good sense of my
limitations I would say let's we could

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
limitations I would say let's we could
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.740
limitations I would say let's we could
even call it an acute sense and so I'm

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
even call it an acute sense and so I'm
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.699
even call it an acute sense and so I'm
not particularly worried that this is

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709
not particularly worried that this is
 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.500
not particularly worried that this is
going to go to my head in some way that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510
going to go to my head in some way that
 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.750
going to go to my head in some way that
that would you know inflate my ego or

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
that would you know inflate my ego or
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.089
that would you know inflate my ego or
something like that huh I mean I think

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099
something like that huh I mean I think
 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.009
something like that huh I mean I think
one of the things I have noticed is that

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019
one of the things I have noticed is that
 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.690
one of the things I have noticed is that
I might be a little less patient with

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
I might be a little less patient with
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.100
I might be a little less patient with
people when I'm speaking because I'm

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
people when I'm speaking because I'm
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.589
people when I'm speaking because I'm
more used to that more use to them might

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599
more used to that more use to them might
 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.720
more used to that more use to them might
be good for me to be listened to and so

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
be good for me to be listened to and so
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.460
be good for me to be listened to and so
I have to watch that but I'm pretty I've

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470
I have to watch that but I'm pretty I've
 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.080
I have to watch that but I'm pretty I've
always been pretty noisy and talkative

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090
always been pretty noisy and talkative
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.910
always been pretty noisy and talkative
and so that's probably something that's

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920
and so that's probably something that's
 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.070
and so that's probably something that's
plagued me or being a characteristic of

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
plagued me or being a characteristic of
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.770
plagued me or being a characteristic of
me ever since I was a little tiny kid I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780
me ever since I was a little tiny kid I
 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.140
me ever since I was a little tiny kid I
mean I used to talk all the time when I

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
mean I used to talk all the time when I
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.500
mean I used to talk all the time when I
was a little little little guy I mean I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
was a little little little guy I mean I
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.660
was a little little little guy I mean I
think my cousin Eric poni --the he

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670
think my cousin Eric poni --the he
 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.550
think my cousin Eric poni --the he
probably listens to this he used to call

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560
probably listens to this he used to call
 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.500
probably listens to this he used to call
me motormouth and that was about exactly

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
me motormouth and that was about exactly
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.059
me motormouth and that was about exactly
right I was like a miniature Camille

right I was like a miniature Camille
 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.569
right I was like a miniature Camille

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.949
Paglia
so anyways I can't complain about having

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959
so anyways I can't complain about having
 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.110
so anyways I can't complain about having
let's say fans I people have been
