actually turned out to be the best use

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350
actually turned out to be the best use
 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.340
actually turned out to be the best use
of it but it hadn't occurred to people

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350
 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.250
I think there are

I think there are
 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.810
I think there are
a lot of tech solutions ways in which

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820
a lot of tech solutions ways in which
 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.760
a lot of tech solutions ways in which
the technologies will evolve to help us

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770
the technologies will evolve to help us

abandoned them but i think we are moving

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920
abandoned them but i think we are moving
 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.650

in a direction where the machines are

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660
in a direction where the machines are
 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.940
in a direction where the machines are
going to become that they're always

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
going to become that they're always
 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.560
going to become that they're always
becoming more intelligent let's face it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
becoming more intelligent let's face it
 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.060
becoming more intelligent let's face it
you know they're going to evolve in a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070
you know they're going to evolve in a
 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.100
you know they're going to evolve in a
direction where they help us but at the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110
direction where they help us but at the
 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.650
direction where they help us but at the
same time we can't just rely on the

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660
same time we can't just rely on the
 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.990
same time we can't just rely on the
machines to do the rethinking of the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000
machines to do the rethinking of the
 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.550
machines to do the rethinking of the
technology for us because after all

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560
technology for us because after all
 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.469
technology for us because after all
these are the technologies that were

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479
these are the technologies that were
 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.090
these are the technologies that were
concerned about and they don't have

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100
concerned about and they don't have
 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.609
concerned about and they don't have
brains as strong as ours it's up to us

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619
brains as strong as ours it's up to us
 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.680
brains as strong as ours it's up to us
to figure out how to design them for our

ourselves so I think it the most
 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.010
ourselves so I think it the most
important task we have now and this is

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020
important task we have now and this is
 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.240
important task we have now and this is
really what I argue in Hamlet's

blackberry is to change our own thinking
about the devices so we recognize that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350
about the devices so we recognize that
 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.620
about the devices so we recognize that
we need balance to get the most out of

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630
we need balance to get the most out of
 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.500
we need balance to get the most out of
them and that once we have that balance

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
them and that once we have that balance
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.120

actually become less urgent because we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290
actually become less urgent because we
 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.960
actually become less urgent because we
will have done the primary work of

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970
will have done the primary work of
 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.880
will have done the primary work of
repairing our own consciousness about

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890
repairing our own consciousness about
 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.830

yeah there's there's so many practical
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.759
yeah there's there's so many practical
steps that it's almost impossible to
