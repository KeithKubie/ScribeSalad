00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.236
Voiceover:The fundamental
theorem of algebra.

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:12.757
Fundamental, I'll write
it out, theorem of algebra

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:17.284
tells us that if we have
an nth-degree polynomial,

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:18.533
so let's write it out.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.670
So let's say I have the function p of x

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.197
and it's defined by an
nth-degree polynomial.

00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:32.929
So let's say it's a x to the
n plus b x to the n minus one

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:38.853
and you just go all the way to
some constant term at the end.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.829
So this is an nth-degree polynomial.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.618
The fundamental theorem
of algebra tells us

00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:48.174
that this nth-degree
polynomial is going to have

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:55.146
n exactly n roots, or another
way to think about it,

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:58.331
there are going to be
exactly n values for x,

00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:01.750
which will make this polynomial,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.810
make this expression on the
right, be equal to zero.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.800
So at first you might say,
"Okay, that makes sense."

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.628
You've seen second-degree polynomials,

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:15.980
whose graphs might look
something like this.

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:20.606
So, that's the y axis
and that's the x axis.

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.573
We know a second-degree polynomial
would define a parabola,

00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:28.512
so it might look something like
this and you could buy that.

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:33.961
Okay, this is a second-degree,
that's second degree,

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.960
and you see that this function

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.634
equals zero at exactly two places.

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:41.922
It has exactly two roots.

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:47.658
It has two roots, so that seems consistent

00:01:47.658 --> 00:01:50.762
with the fundamental theorem of algebra,

00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:51.870
and you could also imagine

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.249
a third-degree polynomial
looking like this.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:56.981
So that's my y axis.

00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.812
This is my x axis.

00:02:00.157 --> 00:02:01.642
You could imagine a
third-degree polynomial

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:03.311
looking something like this.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.711
Bam, bam, bam, and it just keeps going.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.432
And here you see it's a
third-degree polynomial,

00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:13.790
and you'll see it has
one, two, three roots.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.613
And I could have a
fourth-degree polynomial.

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:17.140
Maybe it looks something like this,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.380
where it goes something like this,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.673
and you say, "Okay, that makes sense."

00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:24.726
It will have one, two, three, four roots.

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:26.928
But then you might
start to remember things

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:29.387
that don't always behave in this way.

00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.788
For example, many, many, many times

00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:36.766
we've seen parabolas, we've
seen second-degree polynomials

00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:40.173
that look more like this, where they don't

00:02:40.173 --> 00:02:43.702
seem to intersect the x axis.

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:47.263
So this seems to conflict with

00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:49.468
the fundamental theorem of algebra.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:50.710
The fundamental theorem of algebra says

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.578
if we have a second-degree polynomial

00:02:54.578 --> 00:02:59.000
then we should have exactly two roots.

00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:01.400
Now, this is the key.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.657
The fundamental theorem of algebra,

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:05.773
it extends our number system.

00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:08.177
We're not just talking about real roots,

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:10.602
we're talking about complex roots,

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:13.710
and in particular, the
fundamental theorem of algebra

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.349
allows even these
coefficients to be complex.

00:03:16.787 --> 00:03:19.882
And so when we're looking
at these first examples,

00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:21.339
these were all real roots,

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.797
and real numbers are a
subset of complex numbers.

00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:26.963
So here you had two real roots.

00:03:26.963 --> 00:03:28.826
Here you had three real roots.

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:31.214
In this orange function,
you had four real roots.

00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:33.657
In this yellow function,

00:03:33.657 --> 00:03:35.531
this yellow parabola right over here,

00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:39.849
the second-degree polynomial,
we have no real roots.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.714
That's why you don't see
it intersecting the x axis,

00:03:42.714 --> 00:03:47.299
but we will have two complex roots.

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.154
So this one right over here
will have two complex roots.

00:03:54.154 --> 00:03:57.404
And the complex roots, the
non-real complex roots,

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:00.212
because really real numbers are
a subset of complex numbers,

00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:02.822
these always come in pairs,

00:04:02.822 --> 00:04:05.320
and we'll see that in future videos.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.290
So for example, if you have
a third-degree polynomial,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.157
It might look something like this.

00:04:11.992 --> 00:04:14.582
A third-degree polynomial
might look something like this,

00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:18.118
where it has one real root,

00:04:18.118 --> 00:04:20.423
but then the fundamental
theorem of algebra

00:04:20.423 --> 00:04:22.805
tell us it necessarily has two other roots

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:27.144
because it is a third degree, so we know

00:04:27.144 --> 00:04:33.219
that the other two roots must
be non-real, complex roots.

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.792
Now, could you have a
situation where you have a

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:39.834
third-degree polynomial
with three complex roots?

00:04:40.182 --> 00:04:49.275
So, can you have three
non-real complex roots?

00:04:49.275 --> 00:04:53.121
Is this possible for a
third-degree polynomial?

00:04:53.121 --> 00:04:56.887
Well, the answer is no
because complex roots,

00:04:56.887 --> 00:04:59.161
as we'll see in the next few videos,

00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:01.440
always come in pairs.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.634
They're coming in pairs

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:06.395
where they are conjugates of each other.

00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:13.352
So, you could have a
fourth-degree polynomial

00:05:13.352 --> 00:05:15.880
that has no real roots, for example.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.132
Something might look something like this.

00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:22.655
In this case, you would have
two pairs of complex roots

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:26.493
or you would have four
non-real complex roots

00:05:26.515 --> 00:05:28.127
and you could group them into two pairs

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.998
where in each pair you have conjugates,

00:05:29.998 --> 00:05:32.406
and we'll see that in the next video.
