00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.900
A network protocol defines the rules and
conventions for

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.310
communications between two parties.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.840
A security protocol defines
the rules and conventions for

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.040
secure work communications
between two parties.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.920
So what are these rules and
conventions for secure communications?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.770
That is, suppose Alice and Bob want to
communicate securely over the internet.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.010
What should they do?

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.130
They need to authenticate each other so
that Alice knows that she's

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.259
communicating with Bob and Bob knows
that he's communicating with Alice.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.340
Further, if they want to
communicate securely,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.140
most likely they want to
encrypt their messages.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.530
Therefore, they need to establish and
exchange keys, and

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.730
agree on what cryptographic
operations and algorithms to use.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.857
The basic tools, or the building
blocks of these security protocols,

00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:52.886
are the public-key and
secret-key algorithms and

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.250
hash functions that we have discussed.
