00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.270
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:05.700
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.780
March 19th,

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.520
2018 what's going on?
How,
why Ya?
Is that loud enough?

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.700
My ears shot.
Um,
what's going on?
I was really,

6
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.780
I'm super late.
I apologize.
I apologize to anybody.
I may have offended.

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.300
Uh,
um,
um,
Rolex Americans,
um,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.590
anybody indigenous to the clock world.
You know,
sorry.
Original.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.910
I learned that when I was up in Canada.
They do not want to be called indigenous.

10
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:39.870
They want to be called the original cog.
The ogs of this shit.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.540
That's what they want to be called.
Prairie provinces.
You white mother fuckers.

12
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.770
I believe that's what they said.
Except they said it with a drum.
Now they didn't,

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.420
did they [inaudible] the,
the originals up in Canada today.

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.450
Communicate through drums too.
You know,
it's so funny.

15
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.940
Once white people got their hands on it,
all of a sudden,
all communication,

16
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:03.060
just start
with that instrument.

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
Um,
all that's because we invented the fucking phone.

18
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:12.930
You dumb fuck eight.
Keep it fucking classy there.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.140
I'm
sorry.
I'm in a fucked up mood.

20
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:23.490
I flew back from Toronto late last night.
I was in Kitchener or Kitchener,

21
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.631
have no idea.

22
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:28.380
Came up with a great fucking touristy tee shirt for those people out there.

23
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.900
All right,
if he can't stand the heat,
get out of the Kitchener.
Ah,

24
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.721
they need something.

25
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.300
They need some swagger out there because everybody was giving me shit.

26
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:40.710
Why are you flood plain old?
There we go.

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.770
First of all,
I was just in Toronto.
And then secondly,

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.780
those people like entertainment too.

29
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:48.180
But now they got to drive an hour and a half all the way in.

30
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:49.380
They got to pay for parking.

31
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:52.680
If they're going to booze now they've got to get a room and all of a sudden

32
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:57.370
becomes this big fucking deal.
So I like going to places like Kitchener and uh,

33
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.990
Hamilton and that casino on the other side of Detroit.

34
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.210
And then there was that other one,
that Casino Rama,

35
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.780
that Gig where I left the rental car.
I ever tell you guys had fucking story.

36
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.040
I left a rental car there,
man.
Um,

37
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.990
we went out,
we did the show.
I'm not naming any names in this one.
Okay.

38
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.750
Me and some friends of mine.
Okay.
Not My usual friends.

39
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.010
These friends were readers,

40
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.870
these were big readers and they never predicted anything.
Okay.

41
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.650
Um,
they didn't predict someone was going to be a hall of Famer after one at bat.

42
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.880
It was not anybody like that.
Wink,
wink,
nudge,
nudge.
Anyways,

43
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.220
so we were up there,
Casino Rama and um,
we drove up from someplace else.

44
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:41.190
I can't remember.
We'd done a couple of gigs out there and um,

45
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.040
like march madness was going on or some sort of ladies hockey for some metal

46
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.260
Assam Shit.
I can't remember what.
And we went up,

47
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.630
did this show and we went out and got fucking hammered,

48
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.530
hammered knowing that we had an early flight and then I had her turn this rental

49
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:01.810
car.
So we keep looking at the watch guys.
You know,

50
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.290
we kinda gotta be up at 5:00 AM it's,
it's midnight,
it's five hours sleep.

51
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.280
One more,
one more blah,
blah,
blah.
Nexia.
We got it.
We got in,

52
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.970
I swear to God at like three in the fricking morning.

53
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.810
And I am hammered that I mentioned I was drunk.

54
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.650
I was fucking hammered.

55
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.780
So wake up like two hours later,
you know,

56
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.550
with a bunch of snacks open from the fucking hotel bar.
One of those nights,

57
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.500
you know,
tried to get down,

58
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.990
look another whiskey and maybe get one swig out of it.

59
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:35.230
Like Denzel in that movie where he fucking flies the plane upside down.

60
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.440
He Somehow overcomes losing his rear stabilizer

61
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.470
and the first guy ever in the history of aviation.
Um,

62
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.510
and then I,
uh,
you know,

63
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.520
open can of Pringles and a kit Kat.
I think so.
I stumbled downstairs right where,

64
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.413
you know,

65
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.050
<v 1>yeah.</v>

66
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.800
<v 0>And we get in the fucking car,
right.
I'm still fucking hammered.
I'm like,
guys,</v>

67
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:01.500
I'm too fucking drunk to drive.
And they're like,
dude,

68
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.310
the airports right down the street,

69
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.610
this is how every faith fatal drinking and driving story happens.

70
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.790
It's right down the street.
So we look at our fucking gps,
cause we're still,

71
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.560
we still on the hotels fucking thing there and we were trying to memorize it

72
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:17.590
because none of us got a plan when we were up there.
Well,
wouldn't,
you know,

73
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.950
we leave the hotel's fucking airspace and we can't figure out where we're going.

74
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:26.860
It's,
it's fucking low visibility.
It's still pitch black out.

75
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.230
And now we have no map.

76
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.680
I don't know where I'm at and we're all fucking hammered.
And I was just like,

77
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:33.760
dude,
I can't do this.

78
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.310
So we literally got like a fucking quarter mile down the street,

79
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.490
turned back around,
go back to the hotel and we say,
listen to,
cause we Kinda,

80
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.080
you know,
hit it off with the guy behind the fucking,
uh,

81
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.990
the counter that can do his favor.
You know,
what can you,

82
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.230
is there any way you can return this rental car?
And the guy goes,
no problem,

83
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:53.110
no problem.
We'll call you a cab.
I got my buddy,
he'll come down,

84
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.930
he'll return the fucking thing,
blah,
blah,
blah,
no problems.
And I was sweating it,

85
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:56.650
right?

86
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.340
But it turns out that the pilots and shit are also waiting for a car and we were

87
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.460
on their flight or whatever somehow.
So I can't run.
It's all fucking foggy.

88
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.800
So we ended up getting there.
We make the flight back

89
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.350
laughing our asses off.
Hey,
we did it.

90
00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:15.380
You know what a good shit that guy returns to fucking car.
What an awesome guy.

91
00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.880
Right.
And I,

92
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:22.380
I pass out on the plane and I wake up in la like nothing ever happened.
So,
um,

93
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.540
I fucking,
uh,

94
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.410
maybe like three weeks later I get this phone call from the rental company

95
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.110
and they will like,
uh,
yeah,
Mr Burra,
you ever going to return that rental car?

96
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.590
I told this story wrong.
I shouldn't told you that I left it to the hotel guy.

97
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.800
I had completely forgot.
I didn't even know that's how drunk I was.

98
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.020
I even remember that part where I said that I was going to fucking,

99
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.410
that I told the guy at the hotel and I was like,
yeah,
I returned,

100
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.410
it returned like three weeks ago and at this point I've done like three more

101
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.110
road gigs,
so I don't even remember it.
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
it did.

102
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.380
How did you get my number?
You keep my number.
I was all about me.

103
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.830
So they start badgering me in my fucking world and I'm just like,
you know,

104
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.700
have like the fourth or fifth phone call.
I was like,
listen,
stop calling me.

105
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:08.690
I returned the rental car.
Stop calling me on my cell phone,
I'm at work and blah,

106
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.690
blah,
blah.
And then just one time,
I don't know what happened,

107
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.110
like the sixth time they called me,
something just clicked.
I was like,

108
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.003
wait a minute.

109
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.550
Was that dead gig where I was hammered and there were clouds on the ground and I

110
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.550
,
the guy behind the counter said he was going to,
or some people called fog.

111
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.240
We're gonna fucking return the rental car.
Oh fuck.

112
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.090
So I had to call after yelling at these people had to call him and be like,
yeah,

113
00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:36.840
listen,
I'm the guy you called like six times ago.
Uh,

114
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.110
I got really drunk at a try to drive,
but I couldn't.
The guide,
the hotel Shah,

115
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.100
it was kind bring up,
Bam,
taking dope.
Ended up fucking going down to the car,

116
00:06:47.101 --> 00:06:47.934
was still sitting there.

117
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.450
I had to pay a month rental on that thing.

118
00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:58.560
I can't even fucking tell you how much money that it cost me.
Um,

119
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.050
but whatever,
that's not the big news.

120
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.190
The big news as announced by Barstool sports.

121
00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:08.140
Remember I was telling you rough and rowdy was going to be a juggernaut and,

122
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:09.660
and I would just blah,
blah,
blah.
That,

123
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.750
and I thought it was just the greatest frigging idea ever.
It's literally,

124
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.980
it's like American idol meets the UFC.

125
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.970
All those people that think they can fucking sing and want to prove it.

126
00:07:20.971 --> 00:07:21.900
And then look what happened.

127
00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:26.180
Some of them come out of there and they went grammys.
So who knows?

128
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:28.910
Maybe one of these people when there's rough and rowdy thing could actually

129
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.470
someday get in the UFC house,
right?
And then,
then next thing you know,

130
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.490
fucking a,
he's all,
he's on one of those pay per views,

131
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.800
but until then they're at the bar stool sports,

132
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.710
rough and rowdy number tree trois.
And uh,

133
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:46.250
I'm actually going to be ringside thrown in some jokes.

134
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.020
You guys got to get this man,
you have to get this fucking paper view.

135
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.430
I'm telling you,
I'm going to be making fun of people.

136
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.770
I'm going to be making fun of myself.
It's,
uh,

137
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.080
it's $15 and 99 cents to watch regular people beat the shit out of each other.

138
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.650
You know what I mean?
It's the greatest thing,

139
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.580
greatest singer of all time.
This is like,

140
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.920
there's certain things you just see coming,
you like,

141
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:16.160
this is going to be fucking huge.
I the second I saw this as like,

142
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:20.760
I'm going to watch every fucking one of these things and I'm,
I dunno,

143
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.480
I was just talking positively about it and then,
uh,

144
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.760
Barstow reached out to the email and they're like,
you want to do this?

145
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.560
So it was just like a,
yeah.
Fuck yeah,

146
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.240
absolutely.
So I'm going to be there.
So tuned in.
Um,

147
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.350
let me see if I can get you the date here.
I'm so fucking excited about this.

148
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.360
I can't even tell you.
Um,
when the hell is it going to be,

149
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.100
I'm the worst kid.
Does anybody promote shit worse than me?

150
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.160
I know that it's going to be in Charlotte,
North Carolina.

151
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.740
April 13th.

152
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:56.430
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

153
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.250
<v 2>it's going to be April 13th.
Charlotte,
North Carolina,</v>

154
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.910
former hometown of the nature.
Boy,
ric flair.
I mean,

155
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.710
everything's just a serendipity.
It's all fucking lining up.
I can't wait.
Um,

156
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.680
so please,
uh,
you and your friends,
or to the God damn fight,

157
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:14.070
get yourself some beers.
And who knows?
Maybe you watch,

158
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:18.750
you get inspired and the next time you'll be honest.
That's just that easy.

159
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.310
Your,
do you ever won't be on TV?
Try to knock somebody out.
Finally,

160
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:28.290
there's a vehicle for you.
So anyways,
uh,
why are you so late today,
bill?
Well,

161
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.760
I had a busy day.
I why?

162
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.790
I flew back from Toronto after raw two awesome shows and Kitchener.

163
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.550
Uh,
they're definitely,
they're on,
they're on the toilets now.

164
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.810
I'd have such awesome people there and a great venue and a,

165
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:47.330
so I flew back late at night cause I want to be,
you know,
get home late at night.

166
00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:50.000
So when my daughter woke up the next day,
I was going to be there.

167
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.930
You know what I mean?
Because of what I do.
You know,
I missed some days sometimes,

168
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:54.290
you know,

169
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.200
so like literally the ups guy comes walking up to walk and she's pointing

170
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.250
going.dot,
dot,
dot.
Like,
I can't handle it.
I have too much fucking guilt over it.

171
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:04.790
All right.
Um,
however,
I do have to provide for my family.

172
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.980
So anyways,
I,
um,

173
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.560
<v 1>yeah,</v>

174
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.380
<v 2>I hung out with my daughter in the morning and then I had this meeting from 10</v>

175
00:10:12.381 --> 00:10:14.150
to 12.
And then when I came back,

176
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.780
my wife told me that she was going to take our daughter to go see the Easter

177
00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:22.460
bunny.
And I was like,
well,
I don't want to miss that.
So I went over there and,
uh,

178
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.070
you know,
last year she was fine because she was only like,
you know,

179
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.090
four or five months old.
And this year she's like,
you know,

180
00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:32.930
coming up on a year and a half or whatever.
And uh,

181
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.250
you know,
I just felt this vibe.
It was just,

182
00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:42.251
she was looking at the fucking person in this outfit and I'm just looking at it

183
00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:46.160
like,
I don't know about this one.
Right.
So we're trying to be like,
hey,

184
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.080
and the bunnies fucking waving at her and shit.

185
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.040
And I went up and I'm shaking the rabbit's hand and stuff like,
see,
it's safe.

186
00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:55.400
It's not cutting my head off.
And she's just looking at the rabbit lake.

187
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:57.970
I don't know about this man.
She's like,
that dude and platoon,

188
00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.900
I got a bad feeling about this man.

189
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.520
So we bring her up there and immediately like I go to kind of hand it to the,

190
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.210
to the fucking dude in the bunny suit and I just feel her just grabbed two

191
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:11.540
handfuls of my t shirts.
I'm like,
oh no.

192
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.030
And then I was like,
she started screaming and then I handed it to my wife.

193
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.540
My wife ended up having to sit down with her with the rabbit.

194
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.850
She's totally crying,
totally freaked out and all that.

195
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.350
And the whole time I'm just sitting there going,
why do we do this to kids?

196
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.050
Why am I doing this in a freaking this kid out with a fucking person in a

197
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:37.280
goddamn buddy suit?
It makes no sense to the kid.
And at the end,

198
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.490
at the end of all of this horse shit,
it's a fucking lie.

199
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.100
The whole thing is a fucking lie.

200
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:45.680
And then one day you got to turn around and tell your kid it's not real.

201
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:52.290
And it's just a selfish adult thing because you love your kids so much.

202
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:54.180
You wanted to see them get excited.

203
00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.110
<v 0>You know,
when you grew up and you saw how Maine and cold hearted the world is,</v>

204
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.680
you just want to see him fucking believe in something.

205
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.420
And then just early on you're just break their trust by telling them that

206
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.050
there's,
he's fucking people that come by.
Some of them are animals and I all,

207
00:12:12.051 --> 00:12:16.080
I mean,
some of them are fairies and all of this shit.
Um,

208
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.280
but then what do you do?
Do you tell your kid that,
that they,

209
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:25.040
that they don't exist and then they go to school to come to school like some

210
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:29.540
grizzled fucking vet.
And let me tell you some kids,
it's all bullshit,
right?

211
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.570
Just tell all these kids at the bunny doesn't exist in Santa Claus.

212
00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:38.540
Doesn't exist to that.
Everybody's getting fucking mad at your kid.

213
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.120
It's a great life lesson actually for your kid.

214
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.290
That's what happens when you tell the truth.
Oh,

215
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.960
he's on his fucking stump right now.

216
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:52.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

217
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.660
<v 0>Yeah.
If you ever want to get yelled at that,
there you go.</v>

218
00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:58.590
Send your kid to school with the truth about Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.

219
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.220
And you just say your kid,
just say,
listen,

220
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.170
everybody talks about reading to your kid,

221
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:05.700
trying to give them a headstart and all that.

222
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:09.030
Why don't you fucking give my headstart and not fucking tell them about all of

223
00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:13.710
that shit?
What am I?
Relatives did that with one of my nephews,
you know,

224
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.510
and the kid grew up fine.
They just sat down.
We're like,
yeah,
listen,

225
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.280
it's all bullshit.
You know?

226
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.170
I remember when I found out,

227
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.160
my older brother told me and um,

228
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.460
he felt betrayed and uh,

229
00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:35.060
when he told me I felt like an adult,
I was like,

230
00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:37.100
no ways that what on thanks for the heads up.

231
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.690
Then I sat there and kept my mouth shut like an old school mobster.

232
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:46.620
I never told my,
my other brother never said Shit.
I just sat there like,

233
00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:50.160
oh yeah,
he's coming right down the fucking chimney now.
I sit there laughing,

234
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.020
listening to my younger brother's telling me stories.

235
00:13:52.021 --> 00:13:55.980
I saw his sleigh go right off the roof.
I'll digit you lying piece of Shit,

236
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.770
you know,
and let me know.
Let me know who they really were.

237
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.110
I learned who I could trust in my family.
Having that inside information.

238
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.900
I think that's why they're trying to get that Alexa and everybody's house so

239
00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:14.190
then they can tell you know who they can trust and who they can trust and not

240
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:18.390
really for a good reason either.
You know,
there is corrupt as I am,

241
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:22.770
except they're running shit.
I have no idea what I'm talking about right now.

242
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.080
Um,
I lied to you guys earlier.
I didn't have a meeting from 10 to 12.

243
00:14:28.081 --> 00:14:33.081
What I did was I went out and I flew out to camera Rio and then down the coast

244
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.770
along Malibu on one of the most perfect fucking days ever while the whales are

245
00:14:37.771 --> 00:14:41.520
migrating.
Okay.
I should have literally had like fucking Yoga,

246
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.820
Yoga music playing in my fucking a headset.

247
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.740
It was,
it was fucking unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.
Uh,

248
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.080
I dunno,
whatever.
Sorry.
I have gate.
You got me.
I apologize.

249
00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.271
And we were supposed to take,

250
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:02.000
our kid would be totally honest with you guys and I'm supposed to take the kids

251
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:05.390
to see the Easter bunny tomorrow and then my wife's schedule flip flopped
around.

252
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.430
And it was more convenient for her to go today.

253
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.240
It was more convenient for us to go to tomorrow,

254
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.320
but it's more convenient for her to go today.
So what do you think happened?

255
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.870
You know what happened?
God dammit,
you know exactly what happened.
Oh,

256
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.090
I went to a Toronto Raptors game by the way,

257
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.330
on the Sunday and I went to that Okc game.

258
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.870
That game was like fucking one 32 to one 26 something crazy like that.

259
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:30.290
It was almost like an all star game score and um,

260
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.490
we had great seats and all of that stuff.
It just was fucking awesome.

261
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:37.940
Great Fan base to Jesus Christ.
I knew you guys love the leafs,

262
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:40.790
but obviously Toronto's doing great this year,
but uh,

263
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.730
it's a really fun game to watch and um,
that knocked off.

264
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.000
I've seen every professional Canadian fucking team,

265
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:54.050
a home game of them except for the Goddamn fucking Ottawa senators.

266
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.190
And every time I schedule something to go see one of their games,

267
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:02.660
something comes up and I can't make it all right the first time.
Unfortunately,

268
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:06.800
one of my great friends in life passed away and I had to go to the funeral and

269
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:08.840
all that.
So that's understandable.
All right.

270
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:12.470
And the second time it was just like,
alright,
I'm flying in two days early.

271
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.060
I'm a dad now.

272
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:17.550
I'm going to miss 48 hours with my daughter to go to a fucking auto senators

273
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.240
game.
I couldn't justify it,
so I canceled that.

274
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:24.440
So it's really has nothing to do with Ottawa or their franchise or any of that

275
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:29.180
type of shit.
But um,
I believe that they actually making a new earth new arena,

276
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.480
isn't it?
Unbelievable?
It's like what is wrong with the other one?

277
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.450
The other one is totally fine.

278
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:37.130
That's like the Atlanta Braves moving out of there.

279
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:39.530
Totally perfectly fine baseball stadium.

280
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.170
The Atlanta Falcons moving out of their totally perfectly fine fucking dome.

281
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.690
Like what are we doing?
And then they take,
what do you,

282
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:49.070
what do they do with all of that material?

283
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:52.040
I want to stay not as someone should make a fucking documentary on that when

284
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:56.030
they knocked down a fucking stadium.
That works fine.

285
00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.580
<v 3>All right.
But the owners all like,</v>

286
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.700
<v 0>fucking move them.
You Fat.
Fuck,</v>

287
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:09.380
I'm sick of seeing cities being held hostage by these fucking crybaby owners,

288
00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:13.910
especially the fucking NFL.
Those fucking assholes.

289
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.810
Such a great game.
Such a crew,
a console that runs it.

290
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.730
How much more fucking money to those assholes need the meat need to make before

291
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:25.520
they'll pony up for a fucking stadium?
Well,
you know,

292
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.660
with without threatening everybody that they're going to walk out knowing full

293
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:33.020
well that most people are like me and they don't read.

294
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.560
They don't have any other passions.
They got nothing else going on in their life.

295
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.120
Knowing full well that if they,
the politicians would be like,
well,

296
00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:45.260
if we let this fucking thing go,
I'm not going to get voted into office.

297
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.440
I'm a Bob craft.
Even though he ponied up money for the stadium,

298
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:53.820
he was going a good burrito to,
to him and he's dumb fucking loafers.

299
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.880
I love the guy.
I,
there's two things with that happened in the plaza,

300
00:17:57.881 --> 00:18:00.900
a bunch of things that happen.
My history as a Patriot fan that bugged me.

301
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.470
Bill Parcells telling the team that he was allegedly,

302
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:08.520
that he was gonna he wasn't coming back the next year before we played the Green

303
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.360
Bay packers.
That's why I've still yet to watch the two bills.

304
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

305
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.620
<v 0>Because somebody who was not connected to the football team told me a long time</v>

306
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.020
ago that he did that and I believed it back then.

307
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.030
The way I believed that there was a Santa Claus Bill Parcells has the same body

308
00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:29.750
type as Santa Claus and the whole thing comes together and I've just never been

309
00:18:29.751 --> 00:18:33.650
able to fucking forgive the guy for something that I'm not even sure if he even

310
00:18:33.651 --> 00:18:34.484
did.

311
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:35.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

312
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:42.450
<v 0>Um,
what else?
But Bob Kraft said he was going to move into Connecticut.</v>

313
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:43.410
That was fucking annoying.

314
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.800
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

315
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.990
<v 0>we should have let them do it.
Go ahead.
Moving to Connecticut,</v>

316
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.990
moving to the fucking Hartford whalers old building.

317
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:56.080
See if you can make it work down there.
You can't make anything work in fucking

318
00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.390
<v 1>Connecticut.</v>

319
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.440
<v 0>The two divided.</v>

320
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.080
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

321
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.700
<v 0>Yeah,
so I'm a giant fan.
Some of Patriot fudge,
some are dirt poor.</v>

322
00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.780
The others are in the Illuminati and there's some Klan members.
I mean,

323
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.920
think about that.
What,

324
00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:16.921
what fucking product can you sell that's going to appeal to all of those people?

325
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.810
There's a reason why Connecticut lost the whaler state.
They deserved it.
No,

326
00:19:23.811 --> 00:19:24.644
I'm just kidding.

327
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.050
I was actually talking to somebody when I was up in Canada that like what was

328
00:19:27.051 --> 00:19:29.870
great about the fucking hockey divisions when I was a kid,

329
00:19:29.871 --> 00:19:33.620
when I was just the lad,
the Adams Division in the Patrick's division,

330
00:19:33.621 --> 00:19:34.700
if you had a fucking car,

331
00:19:34.701 --> 00:19:39.530
you could literally drive to every road game your team had within its division.

332
00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:42.170
You could probably get there within,
you know,

333
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.820
a couple of hours except for the quick buck nor detox.

334
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.990
They way the fuck up there did jumped on a plane.

335
00:19:47.991 --> 00:19:50.150
They were all just like fly to Montreal flight,

336
00:19:50.151 --> 00:19:53.360
a buffalo drive down to Hartford.

337
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.980
Then you had the Nordics,
the Nordics to Canadians.

338
00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.850
Disablers the way lists in the Bruins
that I'm,
I feel like I'm missing somebody.

339
00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:04.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

340
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.010
<v 0>Oh,
so long ago.
And then the Patrick Division.
Yeah,</v>

341
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.920
the islanders and the Rangers.
The devils,
the flyers in the capitals.

342
00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.470
All five of them were right there.
And then the road trip,

343
00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:17.450
the long one was Pittsburgh.

344
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

345
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.940
<v 0>All of them right fucking there.</v>

346
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

347
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.260
<v 0>It's like when you used to see like a,
those,
those things they do on like,
um,</v>

348
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:29.791
you know,

349
00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:32.970
back in the day when baseball was all on like the east coast essentially,

350
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.830
and they would just take trains and there was two teams in Boston,

351
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.350
three teams in New York,
two teams in Philly,

352
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.620
the Philadelphia Athletics,
Philadelphia Phillies,
the New York giants,
new,

353
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:50.260
the Brooklyn Dodgers,
the York Yankees,
formerly the New York Islanders,

354
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:52.570
formerly the original Baltimore Orioles.

355
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.630
Then the new Baltimore Orioles,
formerly the Saint Louis Browns is an amazing,

356
00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:01.960
I know all of this shit and can't do fucking simple math and have no idea what's

357
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:04.990
going on in the world.
I tried to get a little smarter than on the flight back.

358
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:05.890
I watched this,
uh,

359
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.330
Ken Burns did this whole thing on Vietnam and I want you to one that was

360
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:13.030
basically 1970 to 1971.

361
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:18.031
And what I loved about the documentary is he does not spare the horrors of all

362
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:22.720
of those people that just showing the dead bodies and all of that shit and just

363
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:23.554
like,

364
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.063
<v 4>mmm,</v>

365
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.370
<v 0>I just done.
So even handedly,
people who protested the war is won.</v>

366
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.340
Marine was saying like,
I had no problem with people protesting the war.

367
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.413
<v 4>MMM.</v>

368
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.920
<v 0>You know,</v>

369
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.410
that's one of the great things about this country and all that type of stuff.

370
00:21:40.411 --> 00:21:44.790
But like those people that will like yelling at him and punching his car and all

371
00:21:44.791 --> 00:21:49.110
that shit,
like they took it too far and I found that really interesting.

372
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.470
You know that you can,
you can.

373
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:53.920
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

374
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.310
<v 0>Because we're kind of,
I feel like we'll live in that right now to the left,</v>

375
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.700
except for some reason they're not protesting this never ending fucking war that

376
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:04.030
is bankrupting this country.
Uh,

377
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.030
because the people in power geniusly

378
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.070
I have sold this one that if you criticize it,

379
00:22:11.071 --> 00:22:15.630
you don't support troops and you're a socialist slash I think you're an isis.

380
00:22:15.631 --> 00:22:18.480
I think that's the way it goes.
If you're even just as an American going like,

381
00:22:18.481 --> 00:22:22.050
hey man,
like I'm down with this country and stuff,

382
00:22:22.051 --> 00:22:27.051
but we're spending $1 billion a month to fight 3,500 people on a jungle gym.

383
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.200
The train on a jungle chimp.
Like,

384
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.520
<v 4>okay,</v>

385
00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.250
<v 0>that's just from my business standpoint.</v>

386
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.280
How are we going to continue to sustain this?
If you could just even ask that,

387
00:22:37.281 --> 00:22:40.190
that's immediately put into the,
you don't support the troops.

388
00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.750
You don't appreciate people fighting for your freedom,
your piece of shit.
Uh,

389
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:45.860
let's ruin your career.

390
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:52.010
But I feel that they learned that in Vietnam when they kind of learned that if

391
00:22:52.011 --> 00:22:54.710
they lost the Po,
obviously you lose the public support.

392
00:22:54.711 --> 00:22:56.510
Eventually you're going to lose the fucking war.

393
00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.913
<v 4>MMM.</v>

394
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.870
<v 0>You're watching these people giving these speeches so we don't end up at another</v>

395
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:03.850
Vietnam and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

396
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.590
And then just seeing some of these hippies acting like me to people,
you know?

397
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.371
Totally.

398
00:23:10.371 --> 00:23:13.400
Just taking it too far that if somebody even looks like their whole life should

399
00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:16.220
just fuck it,
be destroyed.
You know what I mean?

400
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.570
One person tries to look up a skirt.
If somebody is walking up the stairs,

401
00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.800
you know,
flight of stairs,

402
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.200
all of a sudden they're doing jello shots with Harvey Weinstein out and some God

403
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.190
forsaken place in fucking Arizona.

404
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.073
<v 4>MMM.</v>

405
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.770
<v 0>I got a great reality show.
You have Harvey Weinstein and Oj Simpson,
you,</v>

406
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.360
they do a road trip,
right?
And they,
they got,

407
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.540
they got,
they start an la

408
00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.110
<v 4>okay.</v>

409
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.170
<v 0>And they got 36 hours to get to Atlanta to pick up Paula Deen.</v>

410
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.920
It's like the gumball rally,
you know,
and then she,

411
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:57.190
cause then she has to go into this big brother house and decide whether or not

412
00:23:57.301 --> 00:24:00.960
she wants to marry dog,
the bounty hunter.
I am just,

413
00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:03.280
I'm just throwing this out there like this is just a,
uh,

414
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.850
and I want to host it inevitably dumb events like fucking that guy in survivor

415
00:24:08.851 --> 00:24:12.530
that screams at everybody.
My wife always watches survivor and I just can't,

416
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.020
that's so fucking,
I get so much anxiety,
you know,

417
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.830
blow team slowing down.
They need to hurry up.
It's like shut the fuck up.

418
00:24:19.831 --> 00:24:24.650
We know we need to dough explained the game.
You fucking shredded current.

419
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.430
Um,
he is in great shape for the Mana,
you know,
he's gotta be sick of it though.

420
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.180
I feel like with that guy every,
I feel like for me,

421
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.240
I feel every fucking season he gets a little more angry

422
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:38.970
because at some point,

423
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:43.500
I mean it's just a finely oiled machine,

424
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:48.210
but like he sorta has stopped growing as a person because now he's stuck in

425
00:24:48.211 --> 00:24:49.500
groundhog day and it's just like,

426
00:24:49.501 --> 00:24:52.770
and they do like they've been on the air for like 18 years and they're like in

427
00:24:52.771 --> 00:24:53.850
their 50th season,

428
00:24:53.851 --> 00:24:57.870
like I don't know how many times this poor bastard has to fly to a fucking

429
00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:02.550
island in Fiji and yell at people about,
you know,

430
00:25:02.551 --> 00:25:06.330
how they need to bring a plate of fucking piece,
you know,

431
00:25:06.331 --> 00:25:09.150
while walking on some fire,
whatever the fuck it is that that guy does.

432
00:25:09.151 --> 00:25:12.510
Can you imagine just sitting there trying to think of another fucking thing that

433
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:13.344
they have to do?

434
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.900
I Dunno.
I have no idea.
It's like that American Ninja,

435
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.410
was it American Ninja Warrior,
which I love that show too,

436
00:25:25.411 --> 00:25:26.620
but it's just like every fighter.

437
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.240
I think somebody has got to sit there and think of something that requires even

438
00:25:30.241 --> 00:25:35.240
more grip strength.
I swear to God,
by the time they get in their 50 seasons,

439
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:36.740
you're gonna have to fucking be doing pull ups.

440
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.080
You're only holding on with your feet.

441
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.990
The people who train for that thing,
you know,

442
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:48.080
you're gonna have all generations are going to continue to train for that thing.

443
00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:48.890
I swear to God,

444
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.680
our big toe is going to start sliding down the left side of your foot to the

445
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:53.630
right side of your foot.
Depending on which one you're looking at,

446
00:25:53.631 --> 00:25:56.680
you're going to have thumbs again,
like a fucking ape.
Um,

447
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.870
by the way,
I sell one of the best fucking,
uh,
youtube videos.

448
00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:07.360
You're not going to do like those Mashups,
you know?
And a lot of times you just,

449
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.770
you just pick two songs that are the same tempo,
right?

450
00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:13.140
And you just fucking take the music out of one.
You can take the lyrics and Gail,

451
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.770
you slam it together.
I know,
you know,
maybe speed it up a little bit,

452
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:21.190
but somebody did a rat's round and round with Marvin Gaye.

453
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:24.830
I heard it through the grapevine,
a check on the Twitter page,

454
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.950
we just posted it or we have it posted by the time this is up.

455
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:33.230
And uh,
just the way it fits is incredible.

456
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:38.180
I can actually sounds right.
Um,
and then I was,

457
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.260
I dunno what the fuck I was just on youtube looking at a bunch of videos and I

458
00:26:42.261 --> 00:26:43.950
somehow found band

459
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.930
<v 2>with this guy,</v>

460
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:51.170
does this impression of Michael MacDonald and he's singing iron maiden's run to

461
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:54.990
the hills,
but it's totally sung.

462
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:59.991
Like Michael McDonald n the music that they wrote sounds like a Michael McDonald

463
00:27:01.121 --> 00:27:03.420
song.
Like it doesn't because I was sitting there listening going,
Huh.
Fuck.

464
00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.350
Do I know this song?

465
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:09.450
<v 6>Just like a wild man.
[inaudible]</v>

466
00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:15.140
he brought us per it beautiful Brie.

467
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.180
I won't torture you anymore.
Q luck.
Huh?

468
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.283
<v 5>Okay.</v>

469
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:26.380
<v 6>Two [inaudible] I said he took a,</v>

470
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.910
for his old news.

471
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.360
<v 2>You got to listen to music underneath it.</v>

472
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:35.510
It sounds like right around the time when he was working with a steely Dan doing

473
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:38.070
all that shit.
Um,

474
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.480
whoever would have thought that some bank could sit there and write some blue

475
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:46.650
eyed soul to fucking a iron maiden.
All right,
with that,

All right.

Wandering the aisles,

511
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:53.710
having tourettes like me hunting for raises,
shampoo and toothpaste kit.

512
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.640
Then having to play a at being a cashier,

513
00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.070

522
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.310
the US Postal Service is an important tool for any business.

stamps.com is the easiest way to access all the amazing services of the post

524

office.

525
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.060
I don't understand why the post office hasn't made an offer to buy stamps.com

526
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.930
and then they just sell their locations tournament to fucking buffalo wild wings

527
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.050
or you rent them out to a corporation.
That's what you do.

528
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:55.450
And then you still own the property.
That's what the fuck I would do.

529
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.740
Knocked down a little bit of the,
uh,

530

the deficit from flight in these fucking nitwits who don't even have uniforms,

531
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.960
right?
You knock it down a little bit.
Look at me solving problems like Gallagher.

532
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.860
Um,

00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:24.970

All right.

551
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.190
Oh my God.
Speaking of Vietnam,
speaking,

552
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:18.060
speaking of Vietnam bike mechanic from Vietnam,

553
00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:22.180
how fucking weird is that?
You know,
who would have thought?

554
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:26.320
Who would have thunk that?
I would talk about Ken Burns' Vietnam by the way.

555
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:28.420
I have to watch her.
You get Ken Burns.
I swear to God,

556
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.570
Ken Burns could do a fucking nine pint documentary.

557
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.560
Unclipping your Goddamn toenails.
And I would watch that.
All right.

558
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:40.040
Cause he would somehow,
it would be fascinating.
And speaking of,
uh,

559
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.980
<v 2>amazing television that I watched when I was on the plane.
Um,</v>

560
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.830
let me make sure I get the name of the show right.

561
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.120
I watched that new Mike Judge animated show.

562
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:56.360
Uh,
what is it?
Tour bus from the tour bus have,

563
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.040
has anybody watched that yet?

564
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.640
He basically talks to all these fucking lunatic outlaw country singers.

565
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.390
Okay.
And they tell stories about being out on the road.
I,
I don't,

566
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.100
I've yet to go.

567
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.880
I've yet to see one where somebody didn't pull a gun on somebody.

568
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.470
Three out of four that I watched the people involved actually shot the other

569
00:33:20.471 --> 00:33:23.770
person.
One got off,
one went to jail.

570
00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:25.863
I'm telling you.

571
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.610
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

572
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.850
<v 2>the ones I watched,
I watched the Jerry Lee Lewis,</v>

573
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:36.280
Johnny paycheck.
And then there was this guy Billy Joe something or rather,

574
00:33:36.281 --> 00:33:40.060
and there was one other one that I watched.
They were unbelievable.
And you know,

575
00:33:40.061 --> 00:33:40.990
if Mike Judge is doing,

576
00:33:40.991 --> 00:33:44.830
it's going to be quality may be pursued by head office space.

577
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.790
Uh,
um,
oh Christ,
what's the name of this?

578
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

579
00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.920
<v 2>Kicking the hell Jesus Christ.
My brain's gone.
I'm going to mush.</v>

580
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.480
Idiocracy which a lot of people didn't see.
Um,
cause it went straight to fucking,

581
00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:02.340
you know,
this is a little too accurate.
Um,
anyways,
I,

582
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.300
I cannot say enough about that show.
I have to watch every fucking one of those.

583
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:09.573
Um,

584
00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.820
and you're really seeing like basically an America that no longer exists half

585
00:34:16.441 --> 00:34:17.790
the shit that they do.
It's like,
dude,

586
00:34:17.791 --> 00:34:19.560
there's no fucking way you could do that now.

587
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.780
Just with all the cell phone cameras and all of that and um,

588
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:28.020
and you just peer into the way.

589
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

590
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.640
<v 2>Uh,
I dunno the way men,</v>

591
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.080
an extreme version of an American male thought back in the day,

592
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.970
the way they handled shit,
they've thought process.

593
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.590
It just was just,
I can't even like get on like 20 different fucking levels.

594
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:46.700
That show is unbelievable.

595
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:51.701
You have to watch the guys on his truck got one of these ruin one thing.

596
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:56.840
This guy is on trial for shooting this guy in the face.

597
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.510
Okay.
And the judge goes,
well,

598
00:35:01.511 --> 00:35:05.710
couldn't you just ran away or walked away saying he didn't have to do it

599
00:35:05.711 --> 00:35:10.180
basically.
And the guy looks at the judge,
he's like,
he's like,
buddy,

600
00:35:10.181 --> 00:35:14.950
I'm from Texas.
We don't run.
Said that in his own fucking trial.

601
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.250
Um,
anyways,
I don't know.
I'm butchering it.
You got to see it.

602
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.050
The part where fucking Jerry Lee Lewis considers driving over Liberace.

603
00:35:26.051 --> 00:35:29.920
So that'd be quote,
one less piano play in motherfucker that he had to compete,

604
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:34.300
compete with.
Just imagine that animated.

605
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:39.090
That's I,
I,
it's,
it's incredible show,
incredible show.

606
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.990
And I resent every podcast listener for not telling me that it existed.

607
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.280
You probably did.
I just miss the emails.
All right.
Okay.
Here we go.

608
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.450
Bike mechanic from Vietnam.
Hey there,

609
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.370
mister Billy oil rice ball.

610
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.570
I found your podcast last year and I've been listening ever since.

611
00:35:57.571 --> 00:36:01.140
I'm currently a bike mechanic at a local shop here in Hanoi,

612
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.710
Vietnamese born and raised.
Well,
I bet you get a ton of work.

613
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.390
Everybody rides bikes over there,
right?
Elite.

614
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.600
And I'm basing that on Hollywood movies that I've seen.
All right.

615
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.850
Um,
actually Tom Rhodes always does gigs over there and tells me how beautiful it

616
00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:20.220
is.
And Tom Rhodes is going to be in Vietnam.

617
00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:24.030
He was telling me and the next couple of months,
I believe,
at least this year,

618
00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:26.340
I forget what the date is.
Uh,
all right.

619
00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:30.480
I recently met the loveliest Colombian lady.
Oh,
they're beautiful,

620
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.320
beautiful women in the world at the shop.
And I am smitten.

621
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.610
I don't doubt it.

622
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.200
Problem is she's only gonna be here for one month before continuing to the next

623
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:44.160
destination on a world tour.
And what better time for you to get in there?

624
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:49.140
In between those guys?
Um,
I'm sorry.
Have a nice romance.

625
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:55.920
Uh,
she's covering for my fellow coworker who's on a trip of her own traveling

626
00:36:55.921 --> 00:36:59.070
across the country.
I'm happy enough to have a month to spend with her.

627
00:36:59.071 --> 00:37:01.500
I don't care if she's going to be gone forever afterwards.

628
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:06.060
I have no idea what to do though.
Always have been with women.
I've got no game.

629
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:10.410
I'm always a bit needy.
Oh,
that's a bad one.
Not knowing what to say is easy.

630
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.860
That's easy.
You just,
you got to start bombing like a comedian.

631
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.490
Like the way a person learns how to become a comedian.
You just write some shit.

632
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:21.390
You don't know if it's funny,
you go up there,
you fucking,
you know,

633
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.890
lose on nine out of 10.

634
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:27.030
But You keep that one and you build off of that and then eventually you have an

635
00:37:27.031 --> 00:37:31.440
act.
All right.
Needy.
He can't be needy.

636
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:37.140
I'm a bit needy and I'm constantly doubting myself.
Um,
all right,
well I'm,

637
00:37:37.141 --> 00:37:39.480
I'm with you on the second one.
Uh,

638
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.330
and whether or not she likes me.

639
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:47.670
I know it's a good thing to do and I should stop thinking that way,

640
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.320
but it's not easy for me.
I guess I need some words of advice and encouragement.

641
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.760
A stank you very much and go hug yourself.
Um,

642
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.950
uh,
I would just,
you just,
you just got to

643
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.890
the thing about doubting yourself and uh,

644
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:12.300
being needy and all of that and just being filled with doubt and no confidence

645
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.120
is that,
is,
am,

646
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.800
that's one of those things where when you're really young,

647
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:24.960
the sooner you address that,
the better your life is going to be.

648
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.023
Okay.

649
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:32.150
Because that is so young at this point that it's not,

650
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.770
I don't think it's,
it just doesn't have its myths in you.

651
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:40.140
Like if you try to deal with it in your late thirties,
the way I did.
So,
um,

652
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.180
and then you find out all this shit you were afraid of that you thought was,

653
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.970
I got to walk up this fucking mountain.
It's was these,

654
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.910
it was like stepping up onto a curb.

655
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:54.520
So first of all,
in a good way,
who gives a fuck?

656
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:59.620
If you asked this checkout and she shoots you down,
who gives a fuck you,

657
00:38:59.621 --> 00:39:02.410
all you have is a funny fucking story.
And in a,

658
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:07.630
in an experience asking a woman out,
especially if you think she's out of,

659
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.670
out of your league,
that's even better.
You know,
anything you want to do,

660
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.580
you got it.
You got to play with people that are better than you.

661
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.850
If you want to get better playing sports,
you know,

662
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:21.970
like I remember this guy was telling me about as far as like getting together,

663
00:39:21.971 --> 00:39:24.580
if you play an instrument jamming with people by when we were kids,

664
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.950
that was always to be like a,
hey we should jam.

665
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.440
Well how long have you been playing?
I've been playing for years,

666
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.230
I've only been playing a year.
I can't play a,
you can be too good.
It's like,
no,

667
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:35.530
you should go play with them cause they're gonna they're gonna pull you up.

668
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.460
All right,
so it's the same thing with this thing.

669
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.540
You've got this beautiful Columbia woman,
she's going to be leaving soon.
So,

670
00:39:43.541 --> 00:39:44.230
first of all,

671
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:49.150
the fact that this going to be no relationship beyond this is going to be no

672
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:53.140
pressure.
So the level of fun that you guys can have is going to be ridiculous.

673
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:54.400
So,
um,

674
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.830
<v 1>yeah,</v>

675
00:39:55.830 --> 00:40:00.090
<v 2>I would just start hitting on her personally.
Just make subtle comments.</v>

676
00:40:00.091 --> 00:40:04.230
Just tell us you whatever she's wearing,
tell her she looks good.
She has got,

677
00:40:04.231 --> 00:40:05.100
I don't know.
Should I wear this?

678
00:40:05.101 --> 00:40:07.910
I know you always feel you look good and everything.
Really.
Yeah.

679
00:40:07.911 --> 00:40:08.744
I think you're beautiful.

680
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.200
Just like that and fuck all these fucking women two are gonna be a good who

681
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.840
rents are at work?
Fuck off.
Okay.

682
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.990
He's a guy he ate at some point.

683
00:40:18.991 --> 00:40:23.310
He has to get off the wall and try and make something happen.
Okay?

684
00:40:23.311 --> 00:40:26.490
It'd be one thing of women hit on guys and we could sit there and be like,

685
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:31.430
don't talk about my pecs like that.
God stopped complimenting me.
Um,

686
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.820
I'm not saying to be a creep.
All right?

687
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.070
But you got to let her know that you like her.
So,
uh,

688
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:44.050
all right.
That's what I would do.
I would just compliment her,
make her laugh,

689
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:50.960
just be in a good,
just be a funny chill fucking person.

690
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.550
All right.
Don't be overly aggressive,
don't be fucking needy.

691
00:40:55.551 --> 00:40:59.090
All of that Shit freaks him the fuck out.
Just freaks him out.

692
00:40:59.091 --> 00:41:02.900
They run in the other fucking direction.
So,
um,
I dunno,

693
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.790
I dunno if you've got a sense of humor or whatever.

694
00:41:04.791 --> 00:41:08.540
It seems like you do the way you wrote this shit and a lot of people that are

695
00:41:08.541 --> 00:41:12.860
needy and,
and,
and doubt those cells are funny people.

696
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.510
Okay,
so I'll eat,
compliment her,
be a little self deprecating about yourself.

697
00:41:17.511 --> 00:41:19.820
Then she goes,
no,
I think he looked good,
blah,
blah,
blah.

698
00:41:19.821 --> 00:41:22.750
And then she takes a step in your direction and then just fucking go from there.

699
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:24.350
And I'm just one day just to look at and say,
hey listen,

700
00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.770
I know you're only going to be here for like a month,
but I really like you.

701
00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.740
I think you're beautiful and I'd love to go out with you.
Let's go hang out.

702
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:35.610
Let's go do something.
I'll fucking,
I'll see that pile of shit over there.
I'll,

703
00:41:35.611 --> 00:41:38.330
I'll turn it into a bicycle,
put you on the handlebars.
I'll drive around.

704
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.190
Go see a movie assumption.
Who gives a fuck what she says?

705
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.220
I'll tell you what you,
if she says no,

706
00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.950
that is going to hurt way less than for the rest of your fucking life.

707
00:41:49.951 --> 00:41:50.611
Sitting there going,

708
00:41:50.611 --> 00:41:54.150
you know what the fuck did I ever try to fucking ask that Colombian checkout

709
00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.970
that that lasts a lifetime.

710
00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.120
A woman shooting you down back all you gotta do get how long that lasts.

711
00:42:00.121 --> 00:42:05.121
That lasts as long as however long it takes to call one of your friends to tell

712
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:10.590
them.
The funny story
back when I started off as a comedian,

713
00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:15.620
I swear to God I was bombing so much that it got to the point while I was

714
00:42:15.661 --> 00:42:16.051
bombing,

715
00:42:16.051 --> 00:42:19.590
I was already thinking about calling Patrice and telling them the story and

716
00:42:19.591 --> 00:42:23.090
listening to him laugh at me cause it used to always make me feel better or Dana

717
00:42:23.091 --> 00:42:28.091
or Bobby or any of those other guys that I started out with and like all the

718
00:42:28.711 --> 00:42:31.080
humiliation.
It was almost like,
oh good on bombing.

719
00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:34.560
I have a funny story to tell those other guys and it stopped being like a

720
00:42:34.561 --> 00:42:37.260
negative thing.
Um,
so there you go.

721
00:42:37.261 --> 00:42:41.370
I don't want to fucking oversell you on this shit,
but a good for you.

722
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:42.691
You're young,

723
00:42:42.691 --> 00:42:45.330
you're in a beautiful country and a beautiful woman's going to be there for a

724
00:42:45.331 --> 00:42:49.980
month.
Fucking a,
you're supposed to have fun.
All right.
So there you go.

725
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.970
Good luck to you sir.
All right,

726
00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:58.440
Thelma and Louise.
All right.
I mentioned last,
uh,

727
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:01.580
last podcast that me and Nia sat down and watched that movie and how,

728
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:05.730
how incredible a movie that is.
How poignant it is.

729
00:43:05.731 --> 00:43:08.220
Now you can almost look at a Thelma and Louise,

730
00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:09.870
like it was warning all of these people.

731
00:43:09.871 --> 00:43:12.760
Now they've got these youtube fucking cases,
um,

732
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.610
that they had fucking had enough and that the,

733
00:43:14.611 --> 00:43:19.230
the sick because it's every literally every like straight of different types of

734
00:43:19.231 --> 00:43:23.940
creepy guy or lying or whatever the fuck you want to call it.
And uh,

735
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:27.030
held up really well.
And then I was talking about that Crystal Mcdonald,

736
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.300
who plays Darryl.
What?

737
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.830
<v 4>Quit that guy.
Um,</v>

738
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.970
<v 2>just blew me away.
All right.
You said Bill,</v>

739
00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:41.630
regarding your mention of feminine always on the March 12th Monday morning

740
00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:42.201
podcast.

741
00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:46.850
A couple of things I learned about that movie from the book off the cliff.

742
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:52.060
How the making of Fellman Louise drove Hollywood to the edge by Becky Aikman

743
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:58.480
drove it to the edge.
Uh,
you know,
I don't know about that.
Uh,

744
00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:02.810
that movie was almost made with Jodie foster and Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead

745
00:44:02.811 --> 00:44:05.120
roles.
Isn't that amazing?

746
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:09.120
After they cast it and then you try to picture new people in there and you like

747
00:44:09.121 --> 00:44:10.910
that one that worked,
you know,

748
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:13.920
both of them incredible actresses you'd like to add.
Why,

749
00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:15.260
why the fuck would you put them in there?

750
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:18.140
A crystal McDonald who played Thelma's husband.

751
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:23.620
Darryl has been engaged to Gina Davis at one time a few years before the movie.

752
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.810
Oh Wow.
He also nearly stole the movie by improvising a lot of his role,

753
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.600
much to the amusement of director Ridley Scott.
Yeah,
I thought he was.

754
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.660
If you watch Harvey Keitel,
he's literally just laughing

755
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.360
when watching the,
uh,
what's this guy's doing?
A three.

756
00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:46.740
The role of hunky cowboy originally went to Stephen Baldwin.

757
00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:50.490
I didn't know that.
Who backed out at the last second to be in backdraft.

758
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.580
That's understandable.
I'd probably get a bigger role.

759
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:58.581
Five actors were brought back to audition with Gina Davis for Brunettes and an

760
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:05.400
unknown blonde named Brad Pitt Davis love pit and he ended up getting the job

761
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.050
years later.
Davis found herself on a plane seated next to George Clooney.

762
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.910
Clooney made a comment about Pitt stealing a role from him when they were both

763
00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:19.170
getting started in the business.
Turns out it was the Thelma and Louise Park.

764
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.400
No Way.
I love this shit.
We should do more of this on the podcast.

765
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.960
George was one of the four brunettes and Davis had never known it.

766
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.200
Wow.
What the fuck airline is that.

767
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.570
It's definitely not southwest group B.
I can tell you that right now.
All right.

768
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.490
Also just saw the Ricky Gervais',
Netflix specials,
humanity in it.

769
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:45.360
He has a nice bit after the 40 minute mark about intolerance,

770
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.070
especially related to comedy.

771
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:51.660
There's another segment right after the one hour mark where he discusses rape

772
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:55.890
jokes and people's reactions to them would have crossed the border to see you in

773
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:59.730
Kitchener,
uh,
tonight.
But after all,

774
00:45:59.731 --> 00:46:04.731
it is Saint Patrick's day and there are bar crawls and drinking etiquettes to be

775
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:06.600
observed.
Aaron go bra.

776
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:11.580
You Elvina you albino fucking Leprechaun.
I fucked that up.
That's Aaron Go Bri,

777
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:14.170
you Al,
you albino Blippar con.

778
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.920
Uh,
anyways,
oh,
you know something.

779
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.920
I actually learned a lot about kitchen cause I was asked him,
I go,

780
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:25.410
what did you guys use to make here that just had that vibe?

781
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:27.930
And they all laughed and uh,
I guess they,

782
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:33.020
that was the place where they used to make crown royal to Seagram's family was

783
00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:36.390
from there.
And Joe Barton,
nick,
um,

784
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:40.170
who should be on their wall of fame has said,

785
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:44.010
he said he's thrown out at least 400 of those purple bags in his lifetime.

786
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.313
Um,

787
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.460
they also make the best striper,
striper,

788
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:57.510
the best sniper rifles in the world where you can basically be deadly accurate

789
00:46:58.681 --> 00:47:02.580
from two and a half miles away.
And I was joking about that,

790
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:07.530
like the power of that,
like how relaxed you could be,
you know what I mean?

791
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:12.480
You're two and a half miles away from the mercy.
You cell phones there.

792
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:17.070
So you just going be like,
yeah,
I wasn't there.
Check out my cell phone.
You know,

793
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.980
all you do is put a silencer on the end of the fucking thing and you just start

794
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:23.760
talking to one of your friends and then you just look in two and a half miles

795
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:26.510
down the road at this mother fucker is that son of a bitch,
right?

796
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.960
You got the gun half disassembled by the time he fucking hits the guy and you go

797
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.770
perfect fucking murder.
You know,
it's funny.

798
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:40.030
All these gun nuts you're going to write in.

799
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.710
Oh actually they'd be able to trace the bullet and they wouldn't,
you know,

800
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:46.720
whatever you do,
the sheer numbers on the gun,
shut up,
joking to fucking joke.

801
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:52.000
Um,
anyways,
you always great about Saint Patrick's Day was,

802
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:54.790
I wasn't even aware that was Saint Patrick's day when I did the kitchen and Gig

803
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:58.330
and we drove all the way back and then we partied at this place called the bill

804
00:47:58.331 --> 00:48:03.331
Hicks Bar and you go into the bathroom and all these quotes of uh,

805
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.980
you know,
Bill Hicks on the wall,
those,

806
00:48:05.981 --> 00:48:09.910
it was a bunch of standup comics hanging out there and we had a great time

807
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:11.770
because we reached out.

808
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.460
He would try to find a place where we could actually hang out and drink some

809
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:21.010
nonalcoholic beers.
And A,
we want to thank everybody there at the,
uh,

810
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:25.540
sober bill Hicks Bar for letting us act like gentlemen.
Um,

811
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.340
all right,
Bill.

812
00:48:27.341 --> 00:48:32.320
I'm a 20 year old and I lost my older girlfriend who has kids.

813
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.800
Ah,
congratulations.
This.

814
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.260
This is a fucking,
this is a problem.

815
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.270
Hey Bill,

816
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:47.200
I've been a fan for awhile and I know you have plenty of advice in that shiny

817
00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:51.460
head of yours.
Not saying any of you,
it's good or professional.

818
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:53.170
For the last four months,

819
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.790
I've really been beating myself up because I didn't,

820
00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:02.290
I didn't stand up for myself and I let the most amazing girl I've ever met go

821
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:05.830
back to her ex because I didn't think I could support her and her two kids.

822
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:11.760
I've had many girlfriends before to do 20 before her.

823
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:14.350
And I've been sad about a breakup,
but not like this.

824
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:16.780
I was drinking heavily and taking pain pills do.

825
00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:20.650
Don't do that because I know I can't have her back.

826
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.900
I don't know how to move forward from here.

827
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:27.280
I've gotten myself off the pills great.
And I've cut down the drinking,

828
00:49:27.281 --> 00:49:29.740
but I can't seem to feel anything for any other girl.

829
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.570
I just don't really have any drive without her.
What should I do now?
Thanks.

830
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:38.530
Even if you don't get around to this,
um,
first of all,
forgive yourself.

831
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.750
All right?
There's not a person out there.
All right?

832
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:49.060
That hasn't fucking fucked up a relationship unless you just marry the first

833
00:49:49.061 --> 00:49:52.060
person that you're with.
You know,

834
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.920
like they used to do back in the turn of last century.
Hey,
I do.
I mean,

835
00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.270
if I fucked up like three before I found here,
just,

836
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.640
just really fucked him up and thought I'd never get past.
I mean,

837
00:50:03.641 --> 00:50:07.530
you know what you do,
this is a great time for you,
okay.
Because you're,

838
00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:11.080
what you're learning to do is pick yourself up off the mat.

839
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.950
Do you remember what you ever see that George Foreman fight when he fights Ali

840
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:16.990
and he goes down in decades later,

841
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:21.850
they asked him about being down on the canvas and he said,
you know what?

842
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:24.580
You know what the truth is?
He goes,
I could have got up.

843
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:27.650
I just never been there before.
All right.

844
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.010
And after that we'll get him.

845
00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.650
The guy came back when he was like in his forties and won the fucking

846
00:50:32.651 --> 00:50:37.240
heavyweight title.
Um,
so look,

847
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:40.480
this is the first time he'd been knocked on your ass like this and this is
great.

848
00:50:40.481 --> 00:50:44.000
You're going to learn something from it.
And uh,

849
00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.090
you're single and you know what?

850
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:48.850
The fact that she can't feel anything about anybody else knew it was because

851
00:50:48.851 --> 00:50:51.730
you're a good person.
He actually had failed for this other person.

852
00:50:51.731 --> 00:50:56.080
So what you do is you just fucking go out,
hang with your friends,

853
00:50:56.081 --> 00:50:58.570
have a good time.
If you meet,
some chick asked you,

854
00:50:58.571 --> 00:51:01.810
she asked you what your deal is.
Say I just went through a bad breakup,

855
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.500
blah blah blah,
blah blah.
And I sweat it.
Gut they'll,

856
00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:06.070
they'll want to cheer you up so much.

857
00:51:06.071 --> 00:51:08.500
You probably get a fucking blow job out of it.
I'm telling you,

858
00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.600
they love a fucking fixer upper.
They love a little sad god damn face.

859
00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.880
Just say I've fucked up a relationship and I'm heartbroken about it.

860
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:23.930
What's going on with you
as opposed to fucking,
you know,

861
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:27.110
leading them on and acting like you like them and then they find out you're hung

862
00:51:27.111 --> 00:51:28.070
up on some other girl.

863
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:32.360
That's when they get mad and fucking do destruction of property and not get

864
00:51:32.361 --> 00:51:34.940
prosecuted for it.
You know,

865
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.390
is actually a commercial out right now with this woman's just breaking this guy

866
00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:42.020
shit thrown it out the window.
Like that's totally fucking fine.

867
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:46.490
You know,
I don't understand that at all.
So that's what I would say.
Okay Buddy.

868
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.980
I gotta be honest with you.
Okay.
I know she's great and everything,

869
00:51:48.981 --> 00:51:50.930
but she's older than you and she has kids.

870
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:54.470
That's a hell of a fucking thing to paratroop into.
All right?

871
00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.110
Just Sunday,
you're going to meet another one.

872
00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:02.320
You're going to find the real fucking thing,
all right?

873
00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.510
And you know there's not going to be,
oh,

874
00:52:04.511 --> 00:52:07.720
can you support me in all my fucking kids that I had with somebody else?

875
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.880
Or I'm going to go back to that guy that sounds like a fucking country song here

876
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.410
,
dude,
you don't need that shit.
You're going to find some fucking girl.

877
00:52:14.411 --> 00:52:17.710
You're going to see if who knows a year from now,
two years to now,
three,

878
00:52:17.711 --> 00:52:20.920
four years,
whatever.
You're going to find the fucking love of your life,
okay?

879
00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:21.550
And you know what?

880
00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:25.560
You're going to wish you did some day during the time before your matter is

881
00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:29.140
fucking went out and had a good time and banged everything you possibly fucking

882
00:52:29.141 --> 00:52:33.220
could,
but then fucking reason consensually with a condom there.

883
00:52:33.221 --> 00:52:37.120
Did I say it right?
Go out and have a great fucking time.

884
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.690
Enjoy your fucking life because someday you're going to make the girl your

885
00:52:42.691 --> 00:52:45.420
dreams.
The person you're supposed to be with,
all right?

886
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.700
And you're going to get married and you're going to have a kid.

887
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.890
And then even though you love all of them and everything,

888
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:52.920
you know your podcast is going to be late.

889
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.780
Cause you've got to go in and you got to go down to the east of buddy.

890
00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:56.430
You got to do what?

891
00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:59.070
You can't miss that shit and all your free time's going to be gone.

892
00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.650
It's not going to be a bad thing because you're going to love the kids so much.

893
00:53:01.651 --> 00:53:05.190
However you are going to think back to a lot of the free time yet,

894
00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.550
think of Jesus Christ.
Why the fuck did I do this and that?

895
00:53:08.551 --> 00:53:11.280
So all this woman did was give you a great opportunity to go out and fucking

896
00:53:11.281 --> 00:53:15.300
enjoy yourself,
all right?
And when nobody's looking,

897
00:53:15.301 --> 00:53:19.020
put your face in the pillow and fucking cry it out of you.
Do it every day.

898
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:21.480
That's what they do.
You gotta,
you gotta Cry Yourself.

899
00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:23.280
They never tell guys to do that,
right?

900
00:53:23.281 --> 00:53:27.810
Cry Yourself into forgive yourself and all of that shit.
And in the meantime,

901
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.180
have a great fucking time.
All right.
Go get a kegerator.

902
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.800
Watch a little march madness.
Go to the gym,
get great shape.

903
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:37.270
There's all kinds of positive things you can do.
All right.

904
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:41.910
Wife cheated on me night before our wedding.
Oh boy.

905
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:47.280
Oh boy.
The next one is fucked.
My roommate's sister,

906
00:53:47.281 --> 00:53:48.750
Jesus Christ.

907
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:54.550
Fucking animals that listen to this podcast.
Um,

908
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:59.290
it's almost like I attract them with my own ignorance.
All right.

909
00:53:59.291 --> 00:54:03.100
Wife cheated on me night before our wedding.
Dear Billy hotlips,

910
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:07.660
my wife and I had been happily married for 13 years.
We live in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.

911
00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.620
Well,
not to get selfish,
share with your extremely painful story,

912
00:54:11.621 --> 00:54:14.890
but I'm going to be in,
I'm going to be at the Brady theater and Tulsa,

913
00:54:14.891 --> 00:54:18.400
Oklahoma coming in the next few months.
Okay.
All right.
Well,

914
00:54:18.401 --> 00:54:21.400
we met at the University of,
I'm not going to say the university,
Kate,

915
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:24.460
that we have two children ages 10 and seven

916
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:28.140
and have a really comfortable life together.
The other night,

917
00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:31.860
it took my wife out for a date night,
dinner and bowling.
The bowling sounds lame,

918
00:54:31.861 --> 00:54:36.690
but remember it's Tulsa to bowling.
Is this shit?
Uh,
you get an a league.

919
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:38.520
It's fucking awesome.
Anyways,

920
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:42.120
my wife and I went up to the bar at the bowling alley and when the bartenders

921
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:46.380
saw her,
he gave her a weird looks,
sorta like,
haven't I met you before?

922
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:47.830
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

923
00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:52.630
<v 2>After taking our order,
he came back with drinks and said,
enjoy Mitzi.</v>

924
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.950
I was shocked when he knew her name and I gave my wife a puzzled look.

925
00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:01.360
We took the drinks and went back to our lane and I asked her how he could know

926
00:55:01.361 --> 00:55:02.194
her name.

927
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:07.440
She said she has no idea and checked her shirt as if for some reason she was

928
00:55:08.291 --> 00:55:09.700
wearing a name tag.

929
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:14.090
After a few minutes when she couldn't think of an excuse or a lie,

930
00:55:14.091 --> 00:55:15.590
she dropped a bomb on me.

931
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.720
She told me that he was the bartender from the hotel where we had our wedding

932
00:55:20.721 --> 00:55:25.670
reception.
She said the night before our wedding,
after our rehearsal dinner,

933
00:55:25.671 --> 00:55:29.990
her and her bridesmaids went to the hotel to sleep and stopped at the lobby bar

934
00:55:29.991 --> 00:55:34.220
for a couple of drinks.
Everyone then went up to bed.
But my wife,

935
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.490
I had good friends,
but Paul,
I went to Belmont,

936
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.730
but my wife snuck down to go talk to the bartender.
Oh wait a minute.

937
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:45.470
My apologies to her friends.
She told him that she's getting married tomorrow,

938
00:55:45.471 --> 00:55:49.310
but once one more night with another man before giving herself to me.

939
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:53.210
So she took him up to the honeymoon suite and had sex with them,

940
00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.321
which by the way,

941
00:55:54.321 --> 00:55:58.160
is the same bed that we consummated our marriage and the next night,

942
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.053
Oh God,

943
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:05.760
she told me she was never going to tell me because it meant nothing more than

944
00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:10.290
her wanting to end her single life with a bang,
not a whimper,
literally a bang.

945
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:14.730
She claims she has never had doubts about us and that she's sorry that I found

946
00:56:14.731 --> 00:56:15.480
out,

947
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:19.770
but she doesn't regret the cheating because it assured her that she had found

948
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:24.280
the guy
who she wants to be with forever.
Yeah,
buddy.

949
00:56:24.281 --> 00:56:27.280
You try the same thing and then tell her that,
hey,
it meant nothing.

950
00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:30.430
And when I was banging around,
I was like,
you know I,
yeah,
yeah.

951
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:33.250
I am with the right broad.
After hearing this,

952
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:38.110
I asked if she had cheated since we've been married and she said no,

953
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:42.160
which I believe we left the bowling alley and drove home and bitters.
Silence.

954
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:47.320
I've not spoken to her in about a week now other than when it pertains to the

955
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:49.000
kids and other important matters.

956
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.210
She's been sleeping in the guest room because she knows I don't want to be

957
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:55.390
around her.
However,
I know I need to confront her about this,

958
00:56:55.391 --> 00:56:57.820
but I am unsure how to go about it.

959
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.170
I think the only scenarios are divorced or basically accepting and forgiving,

960
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.730
neither of which I want to do at this moment.
What should she have fucking right.

961
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:11.200
I'm not telling any of my family or friends about this because I'm embarrassed,

962
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.920
so I'm hoping you can give advice.
Love the podcast and go fuck yourself.

963
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:16.540
I tell her exactly what you just told me.

964
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.210
Just say that the only two possible scenarios here or divorce or me accepting

965
00:57:23.211 --> 00:57:27.500
and forgiving,
but I'm not ready to do either one at this moment.
Okay.

966
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:31.370
And you're going to have to accept that and my mood around you because of your

967
00:57:31.371 --> 00:57:33.920
actions.
All right.
And by the way,

968
00:57:33.921 --> 00:57:36.800
I'm not telling any of my family and friends about this because I'm so

969
00:57:36.801 --> 00:57:40.920
embarrassed.
Okay.

970
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:42.900
And,
um,

971
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:46.860
then I would recommend going to some sort of couple's therapy.

972
00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:48.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

973
00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:51.940
<v 2>Because that is a mind fuck beyond,
um,</v>

974
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:57.950
any of my bar room fucking advice.
But,

975
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.220
uh,

976
00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:02.330
you seem pretty well emotionally where you know exactly what you're feeling and

977
00:58:02.331 --> 00:58:05.330
why you're failing it.
I would just communicate it to her.

978
00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:07.790
<v 4>MMM.</v>

979
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:09.590
<v 2>And she better not pull this shit of like,</v>

980
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.140
so you just not going to talk to me from make it about herself.

981
00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:15.243
<v 4>MMM.</v>

982
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:21.380
<v 2>I Dunno.
I think the only way,
how do you stay?
I mean,</v>

983
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.710
you got to stay cause the kids are there,
which is such a fucking situation.

984
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.540
And then,
um,

985
00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:31.270
<v 1>yeah.</v>

986
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:36.220
<v 2>All right.
The positive side is she actually fucking owned up to it.
Negative.</v>

987
00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.190
She waited 13 years and two kids.
All right.

988
00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:42.240
Let's not do the positive and negative because I feel like once this is going to

989
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:46.720
be like a fucking bad Superbowl here,
um,
yeah,
I dunno.

990
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:49.150
What is the solution you get to fuck somebody?

991
00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.450
<v 4>Um,
I don't know.</v>

992
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:57.510
<v 2>And it sounds to me like you didn't even want to do that,</v>

993
00:58:57.511 --> 00:58:59.880
so that's not going to be a fucking solution.
I don't know.

994
00:58:59.881 --> 00:59:03.820
I would get professional help when you're ready to sit down and talk about it.

995
00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:08.310
Uh,
listen,

996
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.090
it'd be one thing if you were fucking early on in your goddamn relationship,

997
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:15.600
but you were getting married the next day and then fucked in the own guy ill

998
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:20.010
that in literally that bed.
I have to be honest with you,
man.

999
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.233
That's pretty,

1000
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.780
that's like guy level piece of shit behavior.
Um,

1001
00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:30.370
although women are totally capable of,
that's just that,

1002
00:59:30.371 --> 00:59:34.330
that's not their emo because they're so good at being pieces of shit that

1003
00:59:34.331 --> 00:59:36.850
everybody thinks they're not.
We're guys,

1004
00:59:36.851 --> 00:59:40.240
we just constantly get caught with their fucking pants stuff.
Oh,

1005
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:41.800
you said you're going to be home lighter.

1006
00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:43.350
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1007
00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:46.410
<v 2>That's your fucking excuse.
Well,
I mean,</v>

1008
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.170
aren't you also being dishonest?

1009
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:56.340
All right.
Fuck my roommate's sister.
Oh boy.

1010
00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:58.210
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:01.590
<v 2>All right,
dear Billy
barnacles.</v>

1012
01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:05.580
A fuck my roommate's sister and I now need your help,

1013
01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.100
my roommate since this y'all man,

1014
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.140
I can get through these because he's so fucking said.

1015
01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:15.210
My roommate's sister was in town this weekend while he was out of town.

1016
01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.470
Uh,
she was going to the bars and some friends and crashing on her brother's bed,

1017
01:00:19.471 --> 01:00:21.000
my place or what have you.

1018
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.470
She invited me out with her and I said,
fuck yeah.
Oh,

1019
01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.630
I'm paraphrasing all this,
you know,
she is pretty much our same age,

1020
01:00:30.631 --> 01:00:35.140
mid twenties as I hung out with a lot of our with,
you know,

1021
01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.180
and it has hung out.

1022
01:00:36.181 --> 01:00:39.600
Allow with our group of friends that I've known her for five years now and

1023
01:00:39.601 --> 01:00:44.601
consider a friend outside of just my friend's sister is how I justify what the

1024
01:00:44.701 --> 01:00:47.640
fuck I did at the end of this ladder.
Uh,

1025
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:50.250
so I figured what the hell,

1026
01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:54.780
maybe she could be a good wing man.
I could hit it off with what?

1027
01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:57.720
With one of her friends.
Unfortunately that wasn't what happened.

1028
01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.640
Eight Nia just walked in.
Nia,

1029
01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:05.710
this guy just found out
he went,

1030
01:01:05.711 --> 01:01:08.830
he was at a bowling alleys in a bowling league with his wife or whatever.

1031
01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.260
Then they're out bullying.
Can I just ask the question,

1032
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:15.310
was that your attempt at a southern accent or what was that that you were just

1033
01:01:15.311 --> 01:01:17.140
doing?
Oh,
it's cause he's just so sad.

1034
01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:19.180
I just have to do it in a silly accident because I went here.

1035
01:01:19.181 --> 01:01:24.010
It was that a bad accent?
No,
it isn't.
That's a funny accent.
Okay.
I mean,

1036
01:01:24.011 --> 01:01:28.300
yeah.
Funny.
I'm not trying to like be like legitimately Jesus fucking Christ.

1037
01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:33.550
I can't even make it funny you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I did high

1038
01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:40.000
criticism.
It never ends.
Let's,
ah,
that's your idea of a,
yeah.

1039
01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.750
Yeah.
I'm giving you shit.
Okay.
I just seem like I'm on the podcast.

1040
01:01:43.751 --> 01:01:46.660
Why are you being so sensitive?
Because it sounded like you were serious.

1041
01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:50.110
I'll see.
Now you're on Instagram.
You're going to get all like weird about stuff,

1042
01:01:50.111 --> 01:01:53.500
man.
I don't even know what that,
I tell you right now,
I can't even,

1043
01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:57.700
I don't even understand Instagram.
What?
Where we're at all the whores.

1044
01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.490
What were all the Instagram whores?

1045
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.360
All I get is just shit from a people that I know it.

1046
01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:06.640
Do you want to be following Instagram model?
I want to see him.

1047
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:12.430
Well,
I'm sure after this people will send you loads of links or you have to,

1048
01:02:12.431 --> 01:02:15.730
once you look at what are they giving these shoes,
what are those shoes?

1049
01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:20.310
All of those tits hanging out.
Oh,
I'm so this,
he's out.
Bowling

1050
01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:24.450
<v 0>is Tanea.
Is Your fucking ice coffee big enough for you?</v>

1051
01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:28.240
<v 2>It's a smoothie and it's this.
This is a regular size.</v>

1052
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.370
<v 0>I love you all.
You guys who drink smoothies to lose weight,</v>

1053
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.060
that's like a giant chocolate shake.

1054
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.300
<v 2>I'm not,
this is not obviously to lose weight,
I just want,</v>

1055
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:40.020
I wanted a nice natural fucking dry.
Do we need to start again?

1056
01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:42.300
I guess we're getting off on the wrong.

1057
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:45.630
So this fucking guy goes out to Butler Boland.
I's been married 13 years.

1058
01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:46.381
He's got two kids,

1059
01:02:46.381 --> 01:02:49.290
like a 10 year old and a fucking seven or eight year old or something like that.

1060
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:53.550
Right.
So that Bolin and they go up to get some drinks.
Yeah.

1061
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:57.710
<v 0>And so when they went up there that the bartender kind of gave his wife a weird</v>

1062
01:02:57.711 --> 01:03:02.090
look.
And then when he gave the drinks to her,
he said,
hey,
I have a good night.

1063
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:05.690
Mitzi,
like newer name [inaudible].
So they go back over and he goes,

1064
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.390
how the fuck he know your name?

1065
01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.780
And she acted dumbfounded to the point of actually pretending to look for a name

1066
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.780
on his shirt.
I don't know.
And then she just couldn't come up with a good line.

1067
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:19.200
She finally just said,
the night before the wedding,
she banged the guy.

1068
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:21.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1069
01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:25.820
<v 0>Oh,
but hasn't banged any one sense.
She goes,</v>

1070
01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:30.230
oh my.
She said,
her and her friends were downstairs in the hotel lobby drinking.

1071
01:03:30.231 --> 01:03:31.500
They all went to bed at night.

1072
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.360
She snuck down and told the bartender she wanted one last bang,

1073
01:03:35.361 --> 01:03:38.930
literally before she got married and went up to the honeymoon suite where they

1074
01:03:38.931 --> 01:03:42.260
consummated the marriage the next night and fuck that guy in that bed.

1075
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.620
<v 2>Oh Miss.
See you are a dirty dog.</v>

1076
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.900
<v 0>And then claimed that she never did anything like that again.
I mean,</v>

1077
01:03:49.901 --> 01:03:53.180
that's pretty reptilian coldblooded behavior.

1078
01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.021
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1079
01:03:54.021 --> 01:03:59.021
And I like what's the fucking bartender Doa and like keep it on the fucking low

1080
01:03:59.301 --> 01:04:04.170
man.
Like what?
Yeah,
he's an asshole.
There you go.
Mid Sea.
Uh,

1081
01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.850
<v 0>and you know,
and you know he saw the wedding rings</v>

1082
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.020
<v 2>most like he can't be cool.
Like he just had to be that guy.
Wow.</v>

1083
01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.820
So what is he asking?
What do I do?

1084
01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.860
<v 0>Yeah.
Cause she's not sleeping in the thing.</v>

1085
01:04:15.861 --> 01:04:20.030
And he said the only solution is divorced or I forgive her sleeping in the thing

1086
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:23.280
in the bedroom with she's sleeping on the couch.
Yeah.

1087
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:26.750
No he hasn't talked to her in a week other than dealing with shit that they have

1088
01:04:26.751 --> 01:04:27.460
to talk about,

1089
01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.470
which is the kids cause he's not ready to and he's saying that the,

1090
01:04:30.471 --> 01:04:32.700
either they get fucking divorced or he forgives everyone.

1091
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:35.240
He hasn't told all his friends and family because he's so embarrassed.

1092
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.170
<v 2>I I understand that.
Yeah.
I mean</v>

1093
01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.830
you made this whole life of there you have kids with Erin.
I don't know.

1094
01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.710
Is that really a deal breaker?

1095
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:52.570
That's the thing though is she's still like messing around.
That's the thing.

1096
01:04:52.571 --> 01:04:57.490
That trust is broken.
So how do you repair the trust couples therapy?

1097
01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:01.350
Yeah,
that's the only way.
I mean is she interested in like my,

1098
01:05:01.351 --> 01:05:05.770
she was she apologizing profusely?
Was she like,
I'm so ashamed.

1099
01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:09.970
Like I should never have done it.
It was wrong.
You know,

1100
01:05:09.971 --> 01:05:12.250
I love you so much.
Like I love our family.

1101
01:05:12.251 --> 01:05:15.700
Like I'll do anything to like make this better.
Cause that's,

1102
01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.810
that's a hell of a thing to,
to do the night before your marriage,

1103
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:24.610
you're getting married in the bed that you then fuck your husband and you

1104
01:05:24.611 --> 01:05:28.480
believe that she's never done it again.
I don't know.
I don't,

1105
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:33.280
I believe it cause I feel like women can do that.
Like do that.

1106
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:36.730
Do you see what I'm saying?
How good they are at being pieces of shit.

1107
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:41.290
They all cover each other.
I think that women can do that.
Guys can't do that,

1108
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:46.360
but we can do that.
Yeah.
All right.
Get out what you're,
you're kicking me out.

1109
01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:49.750
I'm kicking you out.
I'm not saying that guys can't do that,
but yeah,

1110
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:53.200
I feel like she's capable of like,
why would you say that women can do that?

1111
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:57.220
Because I'm talking about women.
So why,
why wouldn't you say that?
Well,
I feel it.

1112
01:05:57.221 --> 01:06:01.180
Some people can do that cause I don't have to use your language to get like my

1113
01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:05.020
point across.
But you just totally made it just about women though.
I just,

1114
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:07.480
interesting.
I'm cross examining you right now.
It's kind of fun,

1115
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:10.570
but if you try to worm your way out of this bullshit,
trying to warm their way.

1116
01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:14.830
I have anything regal.
Yeah,
keep drinking.
You fucking drink there.

1117
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.670
So my roommate's sister was in town this weekend while he was out of town.

1118
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:21.970
She was going to the bars,
uh,

1119
01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:25.810
with some of France and crashing on a brother's bed and the place,

1120
01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.550
she invited me out with her and I said,
sure.

1121
01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:30.850
I figured she make a heck of a wing man and I could hit it off with one of her

1122
01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:33.070
friends.
Unfortunately that wasn't what happened.
Anyways,

1123
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:35.760
we came back to my apartment where she was going to stay in her brother's bed

1124
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:40.600
for,
I knew it.
One thing led to another and I was banging her let for nail what?

1125
01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.450
And all of a sudden the close fly off and she bends over.

1126
01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:46.420
It started with some making out and she was the one who said,

1127
01:06:46.421 --> 01:06:51.421
let's go to your bed before you start thinking this is going to turn into the

1128
01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:55.990
wrong side of a me too story.
Hilarious.
That even puts that in there.

1129
01:06:55.991 --> 01:07:00.570
I that sounded all cash tag me too.
All right.

1130
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.420
In the morning we both regretted it and she said it would probably be best not

1131
01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:07.240
to tell my roommate and her brother about the incident.
Unfortunately,

1132
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:12.480
she was able to leave and go back to your place five hours away while I have to

1133
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:19.360
see the guy every single day.
Oh,
okay.
I also did it with no condom,

1134
01:07:19.361 --> 01:07:20.440
like a drunken idiots.

1135
01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:24.490
I've been freaking out about STDs and pregnancy even though I'm 99% sure I

1136
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:28.990
didn't finish and made her get plan B the next night.

1137
01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:33.170
I'm pretty sure.
Excellent.
Careful.
He's probably an accountant.
Major pregnant.

1138
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.630
I'm pretty sure she'll never tell him,
but I'm kind of a pussy and feel like I,

1139
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:42.430
I'll be plagued with guilt every time I hang out with the guy.
What should I do?

1140
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:46.180
I'm sort of panicking and have a weight on my chest for the last week.

1141
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:50.230
Should I suck it up and go to the grave with this?
I told the guy,

1142
01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:53.590
a couple of friends about this to get it up by conscious and now I'm afraid one

1143
01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:56.710
of them might let it slow.
Dude,
you don't do that.
Let it slip.

1144
01:07:56.711 --> 01:07:58.660
One of these nights while we're all out drinking,

1145
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:03.310
should I get ahead of the story and just tell them and suffer the consequences?

1146
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:08.500
Or maybe I should stop being a con and worry about people with actual problems.

1147
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.390
I don't know.
Glad.
Uh,
you're okay.
Blah,
blah blah.
I would say this.

1148
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.680
I would say this.
Um,

1149
01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:22.210
you're like that guy that commits a fucking crime with somebody else and then

1150
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:24.680
you're the guy they have to whack because you're going to flip.

1151
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.030
And what you basically did was you flipped on yourself and you ratted yourself

1152
01:08:29.031 --> 01:08:32.630
out to two other fucking people.
All right,
so,

1153
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:36.830
um,
in the swirl of trash,
that's now going to happen,

1154
01:08:36.831 --> 01:08:39.710
I bet for upwards of 10 years or maybe never.

1155
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.350
Um,
if you do something like that and you both agree to keep your fucking mouth

1156
01:08:45.351 --> 01:08:49.610
shut,
that's what you should've done because this isn't just about you.

1157
01:08:49.611 --> 01:08:54.290
It's also about his relationship with his sister.
All right.

1158
01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.690
So I know you're both adults.
It was consensual.
You didn't want it to happen.

1159
01:08:59.691 --> 01:09:03.530
It happened then you both said that was a fucking mistake.
Nobody's married here.

1160
01:09:03.531 --> 01:09:07.070
There's no kid involved.
I wouldn't have said Shit.
Yeah.

1161
01:09:07.071 --> 01:09:11.780
I think he should just keep a tramp shut and just move on with your life.
Yeah.

1162
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:13.730
And you also have to go kill your two friends.

1163
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:20.920
You never watched those JFK conspiracies.
Um,

1164
01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.480
why did you tell the other two guys can he just felt so guilty about it?
Yes.

1165
01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:29.090
The tell tale heart.
It's up.
It's his ball bag.
Dick throbbing underneath.

1166
01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.230
It's really not answer.
Yeah.
It's not that big of a deal.
Yeah.

1167
01:09:34.231 --> 01:09:36.980
If she did turn out to be pregnant and kept it,
yes,

1168
01:09:36.981 --> 01:09:38.510
of course you'd have to come clean.

1169
01:09:38.511 --> 01:09:43.190
But you're even say go through with an abortion without,
he doesn't need to know.

1170
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:46.430
No,
I wasn't going to say that.
What are you talking about?
As you said,

1171
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:49.280
if she got pregnant,
she got pregnant and decided to keep it.

1172
01:09:49.281 --> 01:09:52.310
Then you say something,
but she got pregnant and didn't want to keep it.

1173
01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:56.430
You don't say shit?
No.
You know what I'm saying?
But she took the plan B's.

1174
01:09:56.431 --> 01:10:00.140
So is this like,
this feels like a fast times at Ridgemont high.

1175
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.810
I'm just picturing judge Reinhold and that big blue car.
I know,

1176
01:10:02.811 --> 01:10:06.600
but she didn't get an abortion.
She's like a plan B.
So it's,
it's,
it's fine sir.

1177
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:11.090
Do you sell stereos?
Um,
that's for old people would get that joke.

1178
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:15.460
She Bang that goes sold the stow.
Yeah.
She got got be bad.

1179
01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:20.080
He's bay tonight.
Really creepy song choice.

1180
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:25.490
Um,
only fangs are right on that fucking bench.

1181
01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:31.160
Horrible.
Yeah.
She's such a cutie pie that when she was that age,

1182
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.550
Jennifer,
Jason Leigh,
I liked that movie.
Ageism too.

1183
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.970
She's not a cutie pie now.
No,
she's a beautiful woman now.

1184
01:10:37.971 --> 01:10:42.920
But she was a cutie pie when she was younger.
Mm hmm.
When we return,

1185
01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:45.950
there's nothing there for you to dig out this,
I think.
Well,
that's,
well,

1186
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:47.970
that's the age we live in.
If there is nothing,
you're,

1187
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:49.820
if there's something there or there's nothing there,

1188
01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:54.140
you're still going to be punished.
Oh,
you look extra pretty today.

1189
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.790
What'd you do?
Since I left?
I Dunno.

1190
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:03.290
You fucking got a bowling alley.
Yup.
Yup.
I ain't gonna be like,
Hey,

1191
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.480

my code name.
Now,

1192
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.430
if I do step out on you,
I'm going by Mitzi.

1193
01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:18.540
<v 0>You know what new?
I'm so old.
That guy be doing me a favor.
Oh,</v>

1194
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:22.470
Phoebe doesn't happen in a anymore or Claremont top.

1195
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:26.900
I'm too old now.
You're just as much of a stallion.
How?

1196
01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.270
Ah,
boy the truth hurts.
The truth hurts.

1197
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.470
I tell you I'd rather take a nap at this point.
No,
you would not.

1198
01:11:37.471 --> 01:11:40.320
I would know you.
You'd rather take a nap then bang me.

1199
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:45.510
Oh No.
We gotta fix this.
See how that works?
Everybody.

1200
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:50.760
That's exactly how it's done.
He is son of a man.
All right.
That's it.

1201
01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.820
That's the best lesson I could have taught anybody.
All right.

1202
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.730
Have a great fucking weak your console.
Talk to you on Thursday.
