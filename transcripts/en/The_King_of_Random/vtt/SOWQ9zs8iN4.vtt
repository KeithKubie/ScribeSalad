[Captions by Y Translator]
There's no better feeling
than taking ordinary items,

00:00:02.172 --> 00:00:04.601
and reorganizing them into
something completely different.

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.942
So for this video,
we're taking Lego Technic sets,

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:10.545
and converting them into
powerful high-speed racing drones.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:18.040
[Music]

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.600
Now, you might be wondering
where Nate is today.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.700
He is off prototyping.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.300
So for this video,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.900
it's just going
to be you and me,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.333
and I do have
a confession to share.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.620
When I was young and growing up,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.289
I never got a chance
to play with Lego.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.520
Honestly, the very first time
I ever played with Lego was

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.959
to make the Lego Gummy video

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.623
that is now the currently the
number one video on our Channel.

00:00:33.623 --> 00:00:34.942
But that is all
changed this year.

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:36.200
We've teamed up with Lego.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.820
They reached out to us,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.040
and said, what kind of cool
things could you do with Lego?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.514
So this gave us a fantastic opportunity
to put our minds into gear,

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:43.714
and play with some Lego.

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:45.614
And I have been playing
with a lot of Lego.

00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:46.890
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.470
Lego started sending
us all these kits,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.706
and my very first experience
with Lego was actually

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:52.450
on the floor with
my seven-year-old son,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.273
where we spent

00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:56.360
an afternoon putting together
this Lego Ninjago Ice Tank

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.900
that I believe belongs to Zane.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.500
And that was really
cool experience.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.060
There were so many
different parts of this

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.200
that we're a complicated build

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.042
that taught me more
about engineering, mechanics,

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:05.130
and things of that nature.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.274
If you take a look at it,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.160
there's a lot of parts
that move, it disassemble,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.034
and when the tank tracks move,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.460
it actually throws
a transmission to gear that kind

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.140
of cycles this giant
whatever it is in the back.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.260
And my favorite part is
that it's got a little cannon

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.880
that actually shoots.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.000
This semi tractor-trailer unit
was really fun one to build.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.440
I learned a lot
about mechanical engineering,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.320
especially in the back.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.277
There's a dual
axle differential,

00:01:27.277 --> 00:01:28.650
which allows the four tires

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.097
to turn independently
with each other.

00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:31.830
I thought that was
a pretty clever system,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.960
and you can see there's all
kinds of knobs on this thing.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.040
You can steer the front tires,
the doors open and close,

00:01:37.048 --> 00:01:38.800
the seats in the
front will recline,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.568
and the back here,

00:01:39.568 --> 00:01:42.220
we've got two lifting cranes
that take this cargo container,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.854
and can actually lift it up,
and set it down on the ground.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.942
There's also a place
for the fifth wheel to attach,

00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:48.596
and you can raise
and lower the trailer

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:50.363
using this other little
knob on the side.

00:01:50.363 --> 00:01:51.635
Taking a look under the hood,

00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:53.582
you can see the engine
actually has pistons

00:01:53.582 --> 00:01:55.450
that move up and down
as you drive it.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.840
And perhaps the biggest project

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.880
yet is this 4000 piece
industrial Digger that I made.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.172
It's super complex,
a lot of moving parts,

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:03.900
and it looks absolutely insane.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:14.200
[Music]

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.260
So after countless days playing
with Lego Technics,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.780
building all of
these different projects,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.012
I would consider myself
fairly well acquainted with

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.300
how these parts work.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.600
So when Lego came to me
and said what can we do

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.450
that's really cool,
unique, and out-of-the-box.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.450
One of the first things

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.550
that came to my mind
was building a Lego drone.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.520
Now, we don't want to just
build any kind of drone.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.840
No sirree.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.060
We want to build
high-speed racing drones,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.740
which means these things
not only need to be able

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:36.750
to look cool, they need
to be extremely stable,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.300
and withstand vibrational forces
of brushless motors

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.250
spinning over 30,000
rotations per minute.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.183
Here's the basic idea.

00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:43.040
We're going to start

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.240
by building for identical
legs for the drone,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.233
then sandwich them
between two Lego plates.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.954
We're going to add
motors, propellers,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.180
and FPV camera,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.740
and then drop in this thing
we call the brain

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.800
that connects everything up
and makes it all work.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.050
Now, these drone
prototypes actually work,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.672
Lego Corporation is going
to fly us over to Rhode Island

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.080
to get together with the host
of the Rebrickulous Channel,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.420
Tyler and Dimitri,

00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:03.600
and pit them together one

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.880
on one in an actual high-speed
drone race in an indoor arena.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.840
And through the magic
of editing,

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:09.055
that video is already happened.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:11.007
There's a link down
in the description right now.

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.280
You can go and see the results
of whether or not those drones

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.420
actually worked.

00:03:14.422 --> 00:03:15.257
Go check it out.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.080
Now we've got two main
parts of this build,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.739
one is the actual build,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.580
which is 100% Lego Technics,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.140
and the second are all
the drone components

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.114
that were going to bring in,
and lay on top of it.

00:03:24.114 --> 00:03:24.835
We're gonna be doing

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:26.873
that in collaboration
with a real drone racing pilot.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.145
I'll introduce you
to in a minute.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:30.297
But first, let me show you
how to get started on the legs.

00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:32.160
We're going to be making
four different legs

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.856
for this platform.

00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:34.250
All of them are
absolutely identical.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.132
I'm not going to list all
the names of the parts here,

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.330
because there's too
many of them.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.456
But if you go to our website,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.020
we do have a PDF
that you can download

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.300
that will take you step-by-step
through the rest of this build.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.000
In the meantime,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.348
just take a really good look
at the pieces we got here,

00:03:45.348 --> 00:03:46.652
and let's click them together.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:56.640
[Music]

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.500
Now, you notice we got

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.300
four different arms here
that are absolutely identical.

00:03:59.313 --> 00:04:00.732
Now you can have fun with these.

00:04:00.732 --> 00:04:02.950
You can change the color
of the main support beams.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.820
You can change the color
of the inside beams.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.378
We went ahead and did orange
and gray and white here,

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:08.176
because to us this

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:10.350
is going to end up looking
kind of like an X-Wing.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.500
On the end here,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.960
which is going to be
the center part,

00:04:12.968 --> 00:04:14.482
you can see we put
these blue posts,

00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:15.217
and we need those

00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:17.900
because that's going to help us
connect them to the frame next.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.550
Now, the frames were using
our 5x7 open frames.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.315
We're going to using
two of them,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.140
and I prep this one already
by taking four little posts,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.940
and using the single side,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.250
pushing down into
the base there.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.450
There's a little ridge so you
can't push it any further.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.140
With four of those poking up,
we're ready to add the arms.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.980
Because these are completely
symmetrical in either side,

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:36.658
it doesn't matter which way
you click them in.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.880
You can literally click them
in upside-down, right-side up.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.880
It doesn't matter
because really,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.640
it's the same on both sides.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.032
With the two parts
of our plate assembled,

00:04:44.032 --> 00:04:45.445
you can see this resembles an X.

00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:46.492
Now because these posts

00:04:46.492 --> 00:04:49.288
in the middle, you can see these
can open freely to the center,

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:50.904
but they won't go
any further outward,

00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:52.161
because the post
gets in the way,

00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:53.418
and that's exactly what we want.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.500
The next thing to do is
to be able to reinforce these,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.200
so there's not much wobble,
and no play to them at all.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.100
So for that,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.140
we're going to be building
a sandwich to compress

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:02.050
the legs together.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.759
Then use to M15 support beams
to build a friction fit,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.620
and lock the beams in place.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.350
These two pieces are the parts
we want to build next.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.361
We'll show you what they're made
of in just a second,

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.250
but I just want to focus
attention on this one.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.850
You can see we actually built
a little camera mount into this,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.763
where our FPV camera
is going to sit.

00:05:16.763 --> 00:05:18.800
FPV stands for
first person view,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.540
and those are like the eyes

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.717
of the drone pilot as
their racing down the track.

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:23.983
That's going to be sitting
right here on these brackets.

00:05:23.983 --> 00:05:25.550
For the top and bottom
sandwich plates,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.537
we're going to actually build
in three different pieces.

00:05:27.537 --> 00:05:28.994
We're going to build
the top plate first.

00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:30.463
Then we're going to build
the camera mount,

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.199
and then we're going
to build the bottom plate,

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.450
and these are the different
pieces we're going to be using.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.540
This is how they go together.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.260
[Music]

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.340
All right, with a few snaps,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.520
a few clicks, we've got
our top piece finished.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.300
You can see we've got

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.688
corner brackets holding
everything together,

00:05:45.688 --> 00:05:47.280
and the reason we want
the corner brackets is

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.060
because that's going
to be our friction point

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.920
for pushing the arms together
and creating tension.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.780
Let's do the camera mount next.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.360
[Music]

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.960
So right there,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.260
we have our support beam
and our camera mount complete.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.720
All we have left to do is finish
our lower support brace.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.200
[Music]

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.440
There's our lower support frame,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.880
and you can see it's got
two pegs sticking up,

00:06:13.898 --> 00:06:17.216
which will marry perfectly into
base of our camera mount here.

00:06:17.216 --> 00:06:20.100
When those click together,
we now have assembled unit.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.100
Our camera assembly

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.850
and our lower frame
will be one piece.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.240
Now, we're just going to put
this together like a sandwich.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.146
We start with the top piece,
we take the X,

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:29.046
and place it in the center,
making sure

00:06:29.046 --> 00:06:31.392
that our corner brackets
are facing down toward it.

00:06:31.392 --> 00:06:34.042
Then we take our bottom piece
with the corner brackets

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:35.242
facing upward toward it,

00:06:35.242 --> 00:06:36.850
and we're going
to put those in place.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.920
And this is the part
where now we determine

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.140
which is front
and which is back.

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:43.250
Because the camera mount
is facing forward.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.389
Now, if you look closely,
you can see this M15 beam

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:46.930
doesn't quite line
up with the holes,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.300
and that's exactly what we want.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.200
We have to stretch

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.400
the X apart to get
these the lock into place,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.250
which creates a friction fit,
and reduces the vibration.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.640
That's a good thing.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.831
We want to do the same
thing on the back.

00:06:56.831 --> 00:06:58.731
So we're going to take
another M15 beam

00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.749
with two black pegs,

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:01.541
and pop those
into position as well,

00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:02.547
and just like that,

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.673
we've got the basic frame
for our stretch

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.360
X racing drone complete.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.240
Now, there are a couple things
we need to do before moving on.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.017
First of all, this
is just sandwiched together.

00:07:10.017 --> 00:07:11.315
It's literally going
to fall apart.

00:07:11.315 --> 00:07:13.724
So we are going to have
to bend the rules a little bit,

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:15.950
and use some fasteners
to clamp everything together.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.576
Now, the holes

00:07:16.576 --> 00:07:18.630
in the Technic beams are
actually the perfect size

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.350
for accommodating number
10 machine bolts.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.932
So I went down
to the local hardware store,

00:07:21.932 --> 00:07:24.765
I picked up 1 and 1/4 inch machine bolts
that pop all the way through,

00:07:24.765 --> 00:07:27.261
and the hex nuts are just big
enough that you can screw them

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:28.150
down from the bottom,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
and they will line
up almost flush,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.400
which is going to be
really good thing for us.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.622
I got 3/4 inch M4

00:07:33.622 --> 00:07:37.050
that pop through these holes
almost seamlessly and support beams,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.540
and that just make sure
nothing is going to come apart.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.480
It's completely optional.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.468
It will work without it.

00:07:41.468 --> 00:07:44.462
But if you want to just be extra sure
and actually race these things,

00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:45.442
we would recommend it.

00:07:45.442 --> 00:07:47.000
All the essentials
are now in place,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
so it's time to add
the drone components,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.723
and for that,

00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:53.340
I'm bringing in my friend
Spencer AKA Drone Pilot Spuder.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.240
So I'm Spencer,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.120
I've been flying drones
for about two years.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.140
I fly into the handle of Spuder,

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.415
and drone racing is one
of the fastest growing sports

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.840
with over 30,000 people
flying every year.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.540
I've been to some of
the largest drone racing events,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.582
and flown with some
of the top Pilots in the world.

00:08:06.582 --> 00:08:08.894
I got together with Spencer
because up to this point,

00:08:08.894 --> 00:08:10.049
I really had no experience

00:08:10.049 --> 00:08:12.150
with disassembling drones
and putting them together.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.300
At first, I was looking

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.000
at using some other companies
parts and putting together.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.900
But then, Spencer,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.450
you came over with some
of your equipment,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.300
your actual Pro
drone racing drones,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.740
which made it a lot
easier to figure out

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.040
how we're going to make it work
with this Lego base.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.280
Let's take a look at some
of your components,

00:08:24.282 --> 00:08:26.350
and tell us about what they are
and how they work.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.150
On a drone,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.477
there's a couple
of main components.

00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:29.428
They all work together.

00:08:29.428 --> 00:08:31.950
They're interchangeable, kind
of like computer parts would be.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.500
You start here with the camera.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.175
This is what the pilot
actually sees.

00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:37.585
It sends an analog video signal
up to these goggles

00:08:37.585 --> 00:08:38.480
that I can see.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.240
It's kind of like Real
World virtual reality.

00:08:40.244 --> 00:08:41.933
Yeah, very much
like playing a video game.

00:08:41.933 --> 00:08:42.840
Down inside the drone,

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.250
there's a couple other parts
to help me communicate

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.950
with the drone
with my transmitter,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.600
and also gives me
this video feed.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.850
There are six main components

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.250
that are absolutely essential
to making a racing drone work.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.079
First of all,
we've got the flight controller.

00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:55.950
The flight controller is
like a little computer

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.972
that knows what
the orientation is of the drone.

00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:59.772
The next thing you
need are the ESCs.

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:00.949
The ESC are the part

00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:02.872
that actually give
power to the motors,

00:09:02.872 --> 00:09:05.172
and tell which motor
to spin faster and slower.

00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:06.712
The third thing is the motors.

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.202
These motors are lightweight.

00:09:08.202 --> 00:09:09.669
Those spin a 30,000 RPM,

00:09:09.669 --> 00:09:12.600
and up to a 15 to
1 thrust-to-weight ratio.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.140
The camera here
in the front transmits

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.450
these goggles so I can see
what the drone sees.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.977
It's like being
inside the cockpit.

00:09:17.977 --> 00:09:19.616
And this camera
transmits in analog,

00:09:19.616 --> 00:09:21.350
which is actually
an older technology,

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.940
but it's faster to the goggles.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.540
If it was transmitting
digitally,

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.875
the latency would be so much
of a gap that the drone

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:28.916
could actually crash
before you see it happen.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.760
Along with the camera, the Drone
has a video transmitter,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.950
which is basically just to send
the signals back to these goggles.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.300
The transmitter antenna
actually receives a signal

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.660
from your remote control.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.980
So whichever way you turn it,
that's the way the drone goes,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.160
and you do it with one
of these things.

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.615
There's a couple different
protocols of these use.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.175
This is probably
the most popular one.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.220
Now, essentially,

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.020
what we've done is we've taken
all those components,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.580
and in the spirit of Lego
we want to make this

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.397
as plug and play as possible.

00:09:52.397 --> 00:09:53.613
So we developed this thing.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.020
We call it the Squiddy.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.300
We're actually really
impressive about this.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.420
We used a 5x7 open frame,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.850
and we were able
to find circuit boards

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:00.787
that stack together,

00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:02.765
and fit nicely right down
through the center.

00:10:02.765 --> 00:10:05.113
You see all the wiring flows
down through the bottom,

00:10:05.113 --> 00:10:07.550
and we've designed
with banana connectors

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.927
so that we can plug
into each individual motor,

00:10:09.927 --> 00:10:11.440
and the camera as well.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.500
These red and black wires
on the back will connect

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.824
to the LiPo battery
that powers this.

00:10:14.824 --> 00:10:16.480
It doesn't get a lot
of time in flight.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.140
Really only will last
for about two to three minutes

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.720
when you're really
powering these things out.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.540
The batteries themselves are
about just under 15 volts,

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.417
but can pump out up
to a hundred amps,

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:25.770
which is absolutely insane.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.860
Because weight is
so important when racing,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.789
all the smart electronics

00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:31.439
that would add safety features
are removed from these.

00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:32.492
These are just raw batteries.

00:10:32.492 --> 00:10:34.023
You need to be careful
when you charge them.

00:10:34.023 --> 00:10:36.207
The thing I love about this
is you just take the top panel

00:10:36.207 --> 00:10:37.070
off your drone frame,

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.700
pop this into place,
connect everything up,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.603
and it's ready to fly.

00:10:39.603 --> 00:10:41.468
But right, now let's
just take this top plate,

00:10:41.468 --> 00:10:42.650
replace it with our Squiddy,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.500
and move on to adding
the motors next.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.800
These little cameras are
only about 20 to 30 bucks.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.920
It's really cool because if you
put the screws in beforehand,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.620
they actually just snuggle right
into these brackets perfectly.

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:54.750
You can literally just
pop them into place,

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.965
and they stay in place,

00:10:55.965 --> 00:10:58.120
but the camera itself
is still adjustable.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:05.620
[Music]

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.280
So we just dropped
the fasteners into place here.

00:11:07.286 --> 00:11:09.007
We've got everything
pretty well assembled,

00:11:09.007 --> 00:11:09.960
and we've routed the wire

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.895
so that it looks pretty clean
from the underside.

00:11:11.895 --> 00:11:14.350
We've got three different cables
for each motor running out

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.550
to each respective area.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.150
We have two little wires here
that will run to our LEDs,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.152
that we have just going
through the center at the back.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.460
That little tail
sticking out the back

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.600
that looks like a turtle tail

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.880
is actually the transmitter
for the video transmitter,

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.580
the VTX.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.180
And then we also took
the receiver wires.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.220
They're very thin.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.350
They look like bug antenna.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.225
This puts the wires
at a near 90 degree angle,

00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:33.042
which means we have

00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:35.194
the best chance of being able
to control the drone.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.740
We also took a velcro strap,

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.520
and drill through these two
holes so we can take a battery,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.600
and attach it to the bottom.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.603
That way if you don't feel
like building a landing gear for this thing,

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:43.868
you can actually just
wrap the battery,

00:11:43.868 --> 00:11:44.686
and your good to go.

00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:45.750
Keeps it very lightweight.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.384
The little pieces
that are in the ends

00:11:47.384 --> 00:11:49.900
of the arms here are these
little H-shape pin connectors.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.300
They have two holes in them,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.711
which we found are
absolutely perfect

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.080
for attaching the motors.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.200
Now, I've still got
them attached in here,

00:11:55.213 --> 00:11:56.623
so you could just
touch the motor,

00:11:56.623 --> 00:11:58.014
but the reason I
like this design so much

00:11:58.014 --> 00:11:59.319
is you can have multiple motors,

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:01.656
and if one of them fails,
you can just click this out,

00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:03.950
click the new one into place,
plug the wires back in,

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.750
and you're good
to go within seconds.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.438
Most motors use
standard connectors,

00:12:07.438 --> 00:12:09.849
which just happens to be
the exact same dimension as

00:12:09.849 --> 00:12:11.076
this Lego Technic part.

00:12:11.076 --> 00:12:13.050
Just happens to be
absolutely perfect.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.389
Exactly 16 millimeters.

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:17.567
So this just connects right here
on these motor mounts,

00:12:17.567 --> 00:12:19.922
and then we put
two screws right through.

00:12:20.082 --> 00:12:22.232
On these motors,
I've added these connectors

00:12:22.232 --> 00:12:23.850
so you can swap them
out very quickly.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.967
Now, all we have to do
is make three more of these,

00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:27.831
swap them out with
their existing connectors,

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:29.102
and we're just about finished.

00:12:30.552 --> 00:12:32.651
So we have all the motors
connected and attached.

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.618
Now, I just went ahead
and randomly plugged all

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.880
these different cables in.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.656
So we don't actually know

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:38.552
if the motors are spinning
the right way or not.

00:12:38.552 --> 00:12:40.750
The direction the motor
is spinning is very important

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.450
to actually getting
the drone to fly.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.522
These drones run in open source
software called BetaFlight.

00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:46.596
We just plug it in,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.380
and then we can change
motor directions.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.740
This is called a smoke stopper.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.079
If there's any short circuits
in our electronics,

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:57.900
this will prevent
them from frying.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:05.160
[Music]

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.080
Now, when you are
attaching the propellers,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.460
here's the only thing
that you need to know.

00:13:08.466 --> 00:13:10.314
You want these things
to cut away from you.

00:13:10.314 --> 00:13:12.159
So when you line up
the two propeller blades,

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:14.550
it almost look like to knife
blades cutting away from you.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.221
One is going to rotate
counterclockwise.

00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:17.821
The other one's going
to rotate clockwise.

00:13:17.821 --> 00:13:19.772
So if you look at them,
and you line up the blades,

00:13:19.772 --> 00:13:21.491
you just want them
both to be pointing away.

00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:23.950
And of course on the back,
they cut the opposite direction.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.350
They cut away to the back,
they cut away to the front.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.942
If you got those on correctly,
it's time to add the nuts.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.440
Oh, by the way,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.200
I also put together some
of these cross beams

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.786
that we can put on top
for two reasons.

00:13:34.786 --> 00:13:37.453
One, it will help protect some
of the circuitry if we do crash,

00:13:37.453 --> 00:13:38.199
and number two,

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:41.200
because we actually use them
when we went and filmed with Lego.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.720
And if you've already forgot,
we have a link down

00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:45.100
in the description where you
can go see that video right now,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.600
and check it out for yourself.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.100
There were some unanticipated
events that happened.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.250
There may or may not have been
a mid-air collision.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.945
You're gonna have
to go see for yourself.

00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:53.840
It was a great event.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.792
Put a really fun twist
on this whole project,

00:13:55.792 --> 00:13:57.763
so links in the description,
go check it out.

00:13:57.763 --> 00:13:58.599
There you go guys.

00:13:58.599 --> 00:13:59.514
Our drone is finished,

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.520
and ready for what we
call a hover test.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.060
This means we get
to hook up the battery,

00:14:03.068 --> 00:14:03.650
take it outside,

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.055
and let our expert drone pilot
fly it around a little bit,

00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:08.250
just to see if we made all
the connections correctly.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.422
Shall we proceed outside,
and see what this thing can do?

00:14:11.422 --> 00:14:17.760
[Music]

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.980
Very nice.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.600
I'm gonna do a little punch out.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160
3, 2, 1.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.240
That's awesome.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.740
All right, next Olympic
sport right here.

00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:32.775
Drone flipping.

00:14:33.758 --> 00:14:35.296
Lego drone flipping.

00:14:38.132 --> 00:14:39.500
Yes!
Nailed it.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.300
That was awesome.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.600
That drone flies fantastic.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.300
It flies exactly
like a real drone.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.012
I could hardly even
tell the difference.

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:50.297
Racing drones are typically made
out of carbon fiber,

00:14:50.297 --> 00:14:51.749
because it's so
strong and light.

00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:53.770
This Lego drone is only
a little bit heavier

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.295
than carbon fiber racing drones
that I normally race with.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:56.954
It flies great.

00:14:56.954 --> 00:14:59.751
And when Spencer mentioned
these propellers went about 30,000 RPMs,

00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:01.356
he said, don't get
your fingers near it,

00:15:01.356 --> 00:15:03.452
because that can actually
slice down to the bone.

00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:05.061
So just for fun,
I went and picked up

00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:07.700
some hotdogs to kind of simulate
what would actually happen.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.850
We tied this thing
to a 2x4 so we can get

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.750
this thing spinning
as full throttle,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.000
and then I'm just going
to dip a hotdog down into it,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.040
and see what it does.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.640
Whoa.
What the heck?

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.180
What?

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.760
No way.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.218
Okay, so our support beam,
the 2x4, actually lift it up.

00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:29.691
That thing has got
a lot of thrust.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.360
So now we got two more support
beams that I'm standing on,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.640
and the idea is we're just going
to come in at a safe distance

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.122
and bring the hotdog in here.

00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:36.760
Let's fire it up.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.800
1, 2, 3.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:39.980
Whoa.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.820
Look at that.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.332
That is clean.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.840
That was a lot less gruesome,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.140
a lot more crisp
than I expected.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.180
It was, which means
those are sharp.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.000
Well, I feel like we've
learned something new.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.350
These things are not kids toys.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.900
Here's a fun fact for you.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.480
These Lego drones
that we've made can achieve

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.773
speeds anywhere between
60 to 100 miles per hour.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.800
All right, we're out
here at the track.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.860
You can see we have

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.020
some professional Pilots
racing behind us.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.620
We're going to put our Lego
drone up in the air,

00:16:07.627 --> 00:16:09.100
let it compete,
and see how it does.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.789
We've made some
modifications to this.

00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:13.389
You can see it has a base,
so it looks nice and mean.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:15.748
For actual racing,
we might want to take this off,

00:16:15.748 --> 00:16:17.000
but we'll see how it goes.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.890
We put a 3D printed GoPro mount
on top of this drone,

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.320
so you can see what it's
like first person view.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.700
3, 2, 1.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:54.500
[Music]

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.850
All right.
We got the radar gun.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.180
We're going to see
how fast these things go.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.860
86.

00:17:00.862 --> 00:17:01.742
Woo.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.300
81.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.100
83 miles an hour.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.380
That is fast.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:20.420
[Music]

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.780
Hey guys, the fun
doesn't end here.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.940
