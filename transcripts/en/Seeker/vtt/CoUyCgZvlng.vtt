00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.390
Tear gas.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.120
Is it an effective method for crowd control
or a toxic chemical weapon?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.320
Hi everyone, I’m Reina, guest hosting on
DNews.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.080
Tear gas, most commonly used for dispersing
unruly crowds is potentially more dangerous

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.080
than you think.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.820
The key active ingredient, called 2 CHLOROBENZAL
MILONO NITRIL is a chemical that activates

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
large amounts of pain receptors in the eyes
and respiratory system by irritating the membranes.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.730
This causes the eyes to start tearing and
closing involuntarily along with causing breathing

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.269
complications, which instantly incapacitates
you.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.269
But that’s not all.

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.730
It can even cause chemical burns to exposed
skin, the breathing complications can mimic

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.840
a choking sensation which can lead to panic,
and that panic can lead to confusion and disorientation.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.070
Most individuals that were hit with tear gas
used the word “pain” to describe their

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.070
experience.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.600
An effective defense against tear gas is a
gas mask, but those aren’t easy to come

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
by.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.989
Some protesters suggest making a make-shift
mask by soaking a bandana in lemon juice or

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:53.989
cider vinegar.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.850
The acidified cloth supposedly helps block
the gas and should give you enough time to

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.850
flee the area.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.410
But be aware that it’s not proven that this
method will work.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.710
The worst part about tear gas is that treatment
after being exposed is virtually non-existent.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.350
The best you can do is wash your eyes out
thoroughly, spit, cough, blow your nose, do

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.220
anything and everything to expel the chemicals
out of your body.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.110
Medical experts also suggest taking a cold
shower because warm water can open your pores

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
and allow for the toxic particles to seep
further into your body.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.350
Some suggest using saline solutions or milk
to counteract the acidity in the tear gas,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.409
but the only truly effective rinse is with
diphoterine, which is a solution used to decontaminate

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.509
chemical splashes by neutralizing acids.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.170
But who has access to THAT?

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.390
Another alarming issue with the use of tear
gas is that toxicology data is particularly

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.969
limited because much of the research being
done on it is military-based and therefore

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:40.969
classified.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:41.969
Yikes!

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.220
Not only that, long term effects of exposure
is practically unknown.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.649
There have been a some studies done to measure
short term and long term effects, but the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.610
sample population in the experiments have
been rather small, which can lead to potential

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.049
systematic bias and error in measuring the
results.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.189
However, the study did find that even after
ten months post exposure many reported that

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.010
they experienced respiratory issues like coughing
fits and worsening of asthma, decreased exercise

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.850
tolerance, and even ocular ulcers.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.890
How do you feel about the over usage of tear
gas for crowd control?
