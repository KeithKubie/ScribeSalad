00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.200
BOTTLE OF WINE, A SHOE,
AND A WALL

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.801
AND START BANGING.

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:11.334
THIS IS WINE EXPERT
STEPHEN CRONK.

00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:16.734
HIS VIDEO RACKED UP
AN INCREDIBLE 11 MILLION VIEWS.

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:19.767
CORK BEGINS TO POP UP.
DO THE REST BY HAND.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.067
ET VOILà.

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:24.434
THIS IS SO INGENIOUS.

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:26.934
Narrator: HOW IS STEPHEN
USING THIS CORKSHOE?

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:27.934
ET VOILà.

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:29.467
STEPHEN MOVES THE BOTTLE
THROUGH THE AIR,

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:30.567
GIVING IT MOMENTUM.

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:31.934
AND START BANGING.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:34.234
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
IS APPLY A FORCE ON THE BOTTLE

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.767
THAT WILL BE TRANSFERRED
TO THE CORK

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:37.601
AND MOVE THE CORK
OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:39.734
IF THE FORCE IS TOO GREAT,
THE BOTTLE WILL BREAK.

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.367
AND SO HE USES A SHOE,
WHICH SOFTENS THE BLOW

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.200
AND EXTENDS THE TIME
OF THE IMPACT.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000
IT'S THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER EFFECT

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.868
MIGHT BE
HELPING STEPHEN AS WELL.

00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:49.834
AND THIS IS THE EFFECT
OF CAVITATION.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.133
WHEN THE BOTTLE MAKES
CONTACT WITH THE WALL,

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.934
THE WINE NOW MOVES FORWARD
WITH A HIGH VELOCITY.

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:57.033
THIS COMPRESSES AN AIR POCKET,

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.701
CREATING AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE
IN THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE,

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:04.834
WHERE BUBBLES OF VACUUM FORM
CALLED CAVITATION BUBBLES.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:07.434
AND AS THESE CAVITATION BUBBLES
IMPLODE,

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.534
A LARGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY
IS RELEASED.

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:12.133
AND THIS MEANS THAT IT APPLES
A PRESSURE TO THE CORK,

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:15.000
AND WITH EACH STRIKE, THE CORK
GETS PUSHED OUT A LITTLE BIT.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.133
ET VOILà.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.467
Narrator: BUT THIS TECHNIQUE
ISN'T A SHOO-IN.

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:19.834
GET IT WRONG AND...

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:21.100
[ WOMAN SHOUTS ]

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.467
ALL THAT WINE.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.200
Narrator: SO UNLESS YOU WANT TO
RISK YOUR ROSé,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.634
DON'T TRY THIS ONE AT HOME.
