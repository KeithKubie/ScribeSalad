haroche and his collaborators have been

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790
haroche and his collaborators have been
 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.420
haroche and his collaborators have been
able to capture light particles that

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430
able to capture light particles that
 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.409
able to capture light particles that
means photons and they've used atoms to

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419
means photons and they've used atoms to
 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.500
means photons and they've used atoms to
probe the state of the photons so how do

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510
probe the state of the photons so how do
 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.320
probe the state of the photons so how do
you capture light imagine yourself

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330
you capture light imagine yourself
 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.810

standing in an elevator with two mirrors

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820
standing in an elevator with two mirrors
 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.750
standing in an elevator with two mirrors
if you hold up your finger you will

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760
if you hold up your finger you will
 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.850
if you hold up your finger you will
actually see many fingers in the mirror

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860
actually see many fingers in the mirror
 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.280
actually see many fingers in the mirror
that's because the photons are bouncing

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290
that's because the photons are bouncing
 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.440
that's because the photons are bouncing
back and forth between the mirrors

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450
back and forth between the mirrors
 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.409
back and forth between the mirrors
before they reach your eyes many times

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419
 
 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.440
 
so this so this means that you can

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450
so this so this means that you can
 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.159
so this so this means that you can
actually if you have two mirrors like

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169
actually if you have two mirrors like
 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.830
actually if you have two mirrors like
this you can actually capture light

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840
this you can actually capture light
 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.770
this you can actually capture light
between the mirrors and you can send in

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780
between the mirrors and you can send in
 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.730
between the mirrors and you can send in
atoms between the mirrors to control or

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740
atoms between the mirrors to control or
 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.210
atoms between the mirrors to control or
to to measure what the photons are doing

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220
to to measure what the photons are doing
 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.540
to to measure what the photons are doing
this is an idea that has been perfected

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550
this is an idea that has been perfected
 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.990
this is an idea that has been perfected
by Sir Charles group like this so they

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000
by Sir Charles group like this so they
 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.589
by Sir Charles group like this so they
they have done this for microwaves and

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599
they have done this for microwaves and
 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.760
they have done this for microwaves and
and this they can do this they can

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770
and this they can do this they can
 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.510
and this they can do this they can
actually

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520
actually
 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.999
actually
capture just a single photon and they

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009
capture just a single photon and they
 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.040
capture just a single photon and they
can also do it for a sufficiently long

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050
can also do it for a sufficiently long
 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.980
can also do it for a sufficiently long
time so that they have time to study the

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990
time so that they have time to study the
 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:25.070
time so that they have time to study the
photons in this cavity so one of the

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080
photons in this cavity so one of the
 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.839
photons in this cavity so one of the
things they've done is that they have

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:26.849
things they've done is that they have
 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:29.360
things they've done is that they have
been able to detect photons without

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370
been able to detect photons without
 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.430
been able to detect photons without
destroying them this is actually very

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440
destroying them this is actually very
 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.369
destroying them this is actually very
hard to do for instance when I look at

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:34.379
hard to do for instance when I look at
 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.710
hard to do for instance when I look at
the people in this room right now the

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720
the people in this room right now the
 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.719
the people in this room right now the
photons that reaches my eyes are

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729
photons that reaches my eyes are
 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:41.029
photons that reaches my eyes are
absorbed by my eyes and therefore

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039
absorbed by my eyes and therefore
 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.939
absorbed by my eyes and therefore
destroyed but it is actually possible to

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:43.949
destroyed but it is actually possible to
 

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:45.950
destroyed but it is actually possible to
detect photons without destroying them

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960
detect photons without destroying them
 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.700
detect photons without destroying them
if you take atoms specially prepared

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:49.710
if you take atoms specially prepared
 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.249
if you take atoms specially prepared
atoms which are actually there are

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259
atoms which are actually there are
 

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:54.589
atoms which are actually there are
usually large and they're also doughnut

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599
usually large and they're also doughnut
 

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.920
usually large and they're also doughnut
shaped and send it into this cavity you

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:57.930
shaped and send it into this cavity you
 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.930
shaped and send it into this cavity you
can interact with the photons that are

00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940
can interact with the photons that are
 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.510
can interact with the photons that are
there and that will change the state of

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520
there and that will change the state of
 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.659
there and that will change the state of
the atom that comes out so by measuring

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:05.669
the atom that comes out so by measuring
 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:07.939
the atom that comes out so by measuring
the atom when it comes out you can tell

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:07.949
the atom when it comes out you can tell
 

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:10.730
the atom when it comes out you can tell
whether there was a photon in the cavity

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740
whether there was a photon in the cavity
 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.180
whether there was a photon in the cavity
or not when you measured this is a

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.190
or not when you measured this is a
 

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.370
or not when you measured this is a
little bit like eating the cake and

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380
little bit like eating the cake and
 

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.770

quantum world particles can take on two
 

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:40.459
quantum world particles can take on two
states at the same time but in our

for the first time decoherence is very

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:49.660
for the first time decoherence is very
 

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.160
for the first time decoherence is very
important because it allows us to

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.170
important because it allows us to
 

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.019
important because it allows us to

here will give us the second part of the

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120
here will give us the second part of the
 

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:28.860
here will give us the second part of the
more detailed presentation please

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:28.870
 
 

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.880
 
so I'm going to describe the work of

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:32.890
so I'm going to describe the work of
 

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.120
so I'm going to describe the work of
living Weiland and his group so this is

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.130
living Weiland and his group so this is
 

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.240
living Weiland and his group so this is
about ions hi how do you capture an ions

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.250
about ions hi how do you capture an ions
 

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.690
about ions hi how do you capture an ions
ions are atoms in an electric charge so

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:42.700
ions are atoms in an electric charge so
 

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.900
ions are atoms in an electric charge so
to capture an eye on you you use

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:44.910
to capture an eye on you you use
 

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.970
to capture an eye on you you use
electrodes electric fields as is

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:47.980
electrodes electric fields as is
 

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.440
electrodes electric fields as is
represented here how do you observe ions

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:51.450
represented here how do you observe ions
 

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.860
represented here how do you observe ions
you use photons and more specifically

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:55.870
you use photons and more specifically
 

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.770
you use photons and more specifically
laser light to excite these atoms and

00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:58.780
laser light to excite these atoms and
 

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.610
laser light to excite these atoms and
these atoms these ions decay by emitting

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:02.620
these atoms these ions decay by emitting
 

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.800
these atoms these ions decay by emitting
night so you look at the fluorescence

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:04.810
night so you look at the fluorescence
 

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.200
night so you look at the fluorescence
that is emitted by by these ions and

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:09.210
that is emitted by by these ions and
 

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.450
that is emitted by by these ions and
this shows this is a photograph of

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:12.460
this shows this is a photograph of
 

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.880
this shows this is a photograph of
actually not the ions themselves but the

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:14.890
actually not the ions themselves but the
 

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.550
actually not the ions themselves but the
light that is emitted by three beryllium

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560
light that is emitted by three beryllium
 

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:24.080

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.160
states of an iron and iron can have
different internal states which means

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.170
different internal states which means
 

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.170
