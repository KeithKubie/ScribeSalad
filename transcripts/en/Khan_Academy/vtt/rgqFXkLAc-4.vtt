00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.440
Let's a review a little bit
of what we've gone over.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.880
And I think it helps to see the
whole process again, just

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.140
so it really sinks into your
brain and I've drawn the banks

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.770
in a different arrangement
this time.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.880
But just as a review, this
is a bank with a

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.070
little bit less reserves.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.930
The green right here
is their reserves.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.590
It could either be deposits at
the federal reserve or these

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.660
could actually be federal
reserve notes-- and we all

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.810
know that as dollars or cash.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.000
This is another bank with
slightly more reserves.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.920
And just like I said in the last
video, I'm drawing the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.740
reserves at the top of the asset
side now so that we can

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.760
compare it directly with the
demand deposits or the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.900
liabilities of this bank.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.850
Most banks have other
liabilities, but I've just

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.690
assumed that all of them
are demand deposit.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.020
That's this magenta
square here.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.440
And of course their equity
is the blue right there.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.780
Let me make sure I have it.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.290
That's their equity.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.900
And of course if these are
either federal reserve notes

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.880
or these are deposits within the
reserve bank, those are of

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.880
course liabilities for the
reserve bank itself.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.099
So let me draw a line
from there to there.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.430
This is a liability for
the reserve bank.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.230
If these were deposits, if these
were essentially demand

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.680
accounts with the reserve
bank, then we could even

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.790
divide them up a little bit and
separate-- OK, this guy

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.840
has this much-- I don't know
if you can see that.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.640
That color's not so good.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.700
This guy has this much.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.620
This guy has this much, but if
these are all federal reserve

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.930
notes, they kind of all come
out of the same bucket.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.090
What we learned in the last
video is that the federal

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.720
reserve-- they don't say,
we want the money

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.630
supply to be X or Y.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.140
They always talk about in
terms of interest rates.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.160
They always say, our target
interest rate or the federal

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.005
reserve rate is now
going to be X.

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.650
Let's go over our mechanics a
little bit more on how open

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.900
market transactions help to
make those rates happen.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.100
So let's say that on day one
or before the fed does

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.000
anything, this bank has a little
bit extra reserves,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300
this bank has a little
bit less reserves.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.980
So there's a couple things that
this bank could do with

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.320
these extra reserves.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.400
It could either do some more
lending-- so it could

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.440
actually-- because it's
reserve-- let's say it's at a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.180
20% reserve ratio.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.460
This ratio to this is 20%.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.670
And it can be as low as-- it
would feel comfortable being

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.060
at a 15% reserve ratio.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.330
So roughly a fourth of its
reserves could be used for

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.260
doing something else.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.470
And what could it be used for?

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.180
So let's say this portion of its
reserves could be used for

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.260
something else.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.920
Well, it could lend them
to another bank

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.220
who maybe needs reserves.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.820
So that could be this
right here.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.980
This bank maybe wants some
reserves and then it would add

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.130
it up on here.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.250
The last video, I filled in the
reserves down here, but

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.470
actually they're not replacing
other assets.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.130
They would have actually just
been added to the balance

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.570
sheet of the bank.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.960
So I should have drawn them on
top and I'll do that a second.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.880
But the other option that this
bank could do is that they

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.720
could actually do
more lending.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.860
Since the reserve ratio is
higher than they want, they

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.860
can actually create checking
accounts like we saw on the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.610
last couple of videos.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.810
With that said, let's say that
this guy wants to borrow some.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.620
This guy's willing to lend some,
although that's not his

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.010
only alternative.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.830
He could create checking
accounts essentially with it

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.190
and do some more lending
with it.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.600
And let's say in this reality
right now given how much

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.100
reserves are on the banking
system at the current rate--

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.650
let me write that right here.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.510
The current rate is 6%.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.015
Now the federal reserve
says, you know what?

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.680
I would like to expand
the money supply.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.920
And they don't say
it directly.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.740
They don't tell us in
our newspapers.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.450
They don't make a press release
saying, we would like

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.210
the official M1 value of the
money supply to go from $15

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.870
trillion to $20 trillion.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.990
They don't say that.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.920
They say, we are going
to lower the federal

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.850
funds rate to 5%.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:03.350
So let's say they want a federal
funds rate-- they are

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.010
setting to be 5%.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.370
The governors of the federal
reserve bank sit together and

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.680
Bernanke comes out and says,
we're lowering the federal

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.440
funds rate to 5%.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.310
So what that 5% percent
means is that their

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.240
target rate is now 5%.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.490
So this is a target.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.940
So what they're saying is, we
are going to perform open

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.760
market transactions in such a
way that now when this bank

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.040
offers money to this bank it's
going to reduce its rate from

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.550
6% to 5%-- or another way to
put it, they're going to do

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.730
open market transactions or
operations in such a way that

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.210
the demand might also go down
for the reserves so this guy

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.680
might be willing to pay less for
borrowing from this guy;

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.260
instead of being willing
to pay 6%, he'll be

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.660
willing to pay 5%.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.180
Remember, on any transaction,
both people

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.180
have to agree on it.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.140
So how do they do that?

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.370
And I think we've we're
reasonably familiar with the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.050
mechanics now.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.980
So what the federal reserve
could do is they can print

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.230
some notes.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.620
Those are assets because
they haven't done

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.870
anything with them yet.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.990
And then there's a corresponding
liability.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.040
I'll do that in a slightly
different shade of green.

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:19.780
These are notes outstanding,
right?

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.120
See, I should've done all this
in this darker shade of green.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.570
These are the liabilities.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.290
The light green are the assets,
the notes themselves.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.720
And what the federal reserve
does-- because they don't want

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.850
to become an insolvent bank.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.960
They want to buy the most
liquid, safest assets out

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.080
there and it actually makes a
lot of sense and we'll touch

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.820
on this in a lot of
different ways.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.875
What they say is, we're going to
take this money and inject

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:44.820
it into the system by buying
treasuries with it.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.640
And they could be buying those
treasuries from your

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.040
grandmother, they could be
buying it from China, they

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.890
could be buying it from Russia,
they could be buying

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.030
it from me, they could be
buying it from my uncle.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.280
Regardless of who they buy it
from-- let's say they buy it

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.820
from someone in the U.S.
so that we don't get

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.160
confused right now.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.380
Let's say they buy
it from my uncle.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.940
So this is my uncle.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.230
Let me see if I can draw him.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.740
He's holding a treasury right
now-- an IOU from the

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.790
government.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.870
That's what he has.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.620
He wasn't willing to sell it
before, but let's say the

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.850
federal reserve has printed
more money and he's like,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.840
well, I'm not going to sell it
now, but if someone's willing

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.160
to offer me a little bit more
money for it, maybe I'm

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.050
willing to part with
my treasury bill.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.130
So the federal reserve-- and
he doesn't know that he's

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.150
selling it to the
federal reserve.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.600
He just sees selling it to
market, the same way that when

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.380
you buy a stock, you don't know
who you're buying it from

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.400
or who you're selling
it to and all that.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.660
So all of a sudden someone goes
out there and is willing

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.380
to pay a slightly higher price
for these treasury bills,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.130
these IOUs from the government
and he's like, oh, fine.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.280
Yeah, that's a good price.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.850
I'm going to sell them to
whoever's buying it.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.390
It turns out that it's actually
the federal reserve

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.410
that's buying it.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.430
So the federal reserve all of a
sudden has-- my uncle would

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.270
be a big time operator if
the federal reserve

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.930
only bought from him.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.700
He would have to have hundreds
of billions of dollars of

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.710
these things.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.810
And he doesn't have
his IOU anymore.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.530
What does he have right now?

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:17.010
That IOU is now exchanged for
a dollar bill or hundreds of

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.940
billions of dollar bills or
reserve deposits at the

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.910
federal reserve-- all the same,
but just to keep the

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.280
abstraction solid for right now,
we'll keep it in terms of

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.780
dollar bills.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.300
So his IOUs he's sold
in exchange for

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.870
these dollar bills.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.150
And what does he do with them?

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.490
This is hundreds of billions
of dollars.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.150
He's not going to stuff it
all into his mattress.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.050
He's going to deposit it into
the banking system.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.830
So maybe he gives a little
bit to this bank up here.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.310
This is a slight mistake that
I did in the last video.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.060
I was adding it below,
but it's not

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.700
replacing other assets.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.460
It's new assets.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.230
So let's say he put some of it
here-- my uncle after he sold

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.080
his treasuries.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.060
Let's say he put some of it in
this bank-- or maybe it's a

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.400
bunch of people's uncles
and they all don't

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.720
go to the same bank.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.900
Let me do that in a slightly
different shade of green, just

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.370
so you know this is--
I'll do in blue.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.150
Just so you know, this is a new
deposit, but it's close

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.560
enough to green that I think
you get the idea.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.980
And of course, he has an off
setting-- his checking account

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.390
if he didn't have one already.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.150
Now he has one so their
liabilities

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.400
increase a little bit.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.620
So a couple of things
will happen.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.160
Just in terms of how does this
affect the rate that they're

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.060
charging to each other?

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.570
Well, now all of a sudden, this
bank's reserve ratio's

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.560
gotten a little bit better.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.929
His assets and his liabilities
increased, right?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.400
His assets increased by the
amount of my uncle's deposit,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.460
but so did the liabilities
because he's

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.690
had the demand deposit.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.090
But it came in a ratio
of reserves to

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.490
demand deposit 100%.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.050
So this would have improved
his reserve ratio.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:51.760
If you now take the ratio of
this height to this height,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.220
it's not going to improve
a little bit, right?

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.480
So now he doesn't need money--
this bank doesn't need money

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.030
as bad in order to improve
its reserve ratio.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.850
And likewise, this bank now
even has an even better

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.460
reserve ratio.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.520
He already had more reserves
than he needed and

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.570
now he got even more.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.950
He has an even better
reserve ratio.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.610
So now this guy's demand for
reserves is a little bit lower

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.400
and this guy's supply
of reserves is

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.630
a little bit higher.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.190
So this guy's only going to be
willing to pay a little bit

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.190
less for new reserves
from this bank.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.500
And this guy, he's willing
to charge less now

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.300
because he has more.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.430
He doesn't know what
to do with it.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.750
He doesn't know enough people
who want to borrow more money

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.060
so he wants actually lend off
some of his reserves.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.230
So just by increasing the
supply of reserves and

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.210
decreasing the demand of
reserve, the current rate-- if

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.960
the fed does this
appropriately-- will go to 5%.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.340
And let's say it only went to
5-1/2%, then the fed will keep

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.440
doing this and then
it'll go to 5%.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.860
If it goes too far, if it goes
to 4-1/2%, maybe the fed will

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.690
reverse the transaction.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.170
The fed will actually go
out there and sell

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.240
these treasury notes.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.160
But I also want to make it clear
that the point of this--

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.990
although it does affect the
interest rates and that's what

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.610
the federal reserve always talks
about in terms of their

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.870
target rates-- the net effect
of injecting more reserves

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.750
into the system is it increases
the lending

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.790
power of the bank.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.300
And if we have, let's say, a
10% reserve ratio, every

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:22.780
dollar that is injected into
the banking system right

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.800
there, that bank can then
do $10 worth of lending.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.220
Let's say that bank lent
it all to this bank.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.700
Let's say he lends all of that--
so now this turns to an

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.490
asset, which is a loan
to this bank.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.220
So this bank then has--
this isn't a

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.290
demand deposit anymore.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.250
This is now a loan
from this bank.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.970
He has more reserves now.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.880
That's his reserves.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.360
I shouldn't be doing it
in that purple color.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.730
I should be sticking to green.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.330
But the bottom line is, wherever
those reserves are,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.920
doesn't matter which banks they
sit in, but every dollar

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.700
of that increased reserves
enables $10 of lending, right?

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:06.570
This bank now can create $10 of
checking accounts through

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:12.160
lending and so even though the
federal reserve talks in terms

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
of interest rates-- and I'll
talk a lot about why they're

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.990
more focused on interest rates
than absolute measures of the

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.510
money supply-- even though they
talk in terms of interest

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:25.630
rates, by performing these open
market transactions that

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.150
in effect lower the interest
rate by increasing the amount

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.980
of reserves out there, they're
actually increasing banks'

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.130
lending capacity.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.610
So the amount of reserves--
that's base money-- or you

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.670
could almost view it as the
liability side of the federal

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.420
funds, the reserve deposits.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.200
That's base money.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.730
That's M0.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.450
And you get a multiplier effect
for M1, which is the

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.490
amount of demand deposits
because in this bank it got

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.430
more reserves and then it can
create a bunch of demand

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.320
deposits like we learned
earlier.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.650
So by saying that they're
lowering the rates, they're

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.320
essentially saying that they're
going to perform open

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.490
market transactions that will
inject reserves into the

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.510
banking system, which will
allow them to keep their

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.460
reserve ratios in line, but
make a lot more loans.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.380
So significantly increase the M1
and then the other, looser,

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.700
the broader definitions
of money supply.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.500
I will see you in
the next video.
