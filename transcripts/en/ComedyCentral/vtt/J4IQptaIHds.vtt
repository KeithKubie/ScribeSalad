00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:02.135
IS THE FACT THAT

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.671
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA
HAVE WORK OFF TOMORROW.

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:06.139
- WHOA, I DIDN'T
EVEN THINK OF THAT.

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:07.608
- YES, OF COURSE WE ARE!
- THAT'S AWESOME.

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.276
- OF COURSE WE ARE,
IT'S A DEATH DAY.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.911
IT'S LIKE A SNOW DAY,
BUT IT'S A DEATH DAY.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.412
- AND CHECK THIS OUT.
I GOT A SWEDISH PEN PAL IN TOWN.

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:13.680
SHE'S IN VEGAS RIGHT NOW.

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:14.915
WANTS TO COME TO HOLLYWOOD,

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.216
WHICH IS WHERE
I TOLD HER WE LIVE.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.951
- WE DON'T.
- SMART, VERY SMART.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.786
- I KNOW.
I CAN'T SAY RANCHO CUCAMONGA.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.488
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
THEY'RE FROM SWEDEN!

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.856
THEY'RE NOT GONNA KNOW.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.091
- YEAH,
SWEDES DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.859
- YEAH, YOU GOTTA
SAY HOLLYWOOD.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:27.561
- HEY, DERS, IS THIS THE SAME
CHICK THAT YOU TOLD US ABOUT

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.396
WHERE YOU SQUEEZED HER BOOB
THROUGH HER SLEEVE

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.831
WHILE WATCHING <i>GLADIATOR</i>
IN YOUR FRIEND'S BASEMENT?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.533
- OH, YEAH.
- YEAH.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.234
AND IT WAS A LONG SLEEVE SHIRT,
SO WHERE'S MY DAP AT?

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.536
- DUDE, I NEED
SOME SLEEVE BOOB MYSELF.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.237
I'M TAKING
THE OTHER CHICK, TOO,

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.907
AND I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE
FOR MARRYING HER.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.775
WHOO, YES.
- NICE. QUICK ON THE DRAW.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.076
DAP ON THE DIBSTER MAN.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.078
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT DAP,
ACTUALLY.

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:47.014
- BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO,
BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE PURE

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.983
FAIR WAY TO DECIDE WHO'S GONNA
BE MY BRO-PILOT ON THIS ONE.

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.489
- 87. 87!

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.058
- 87?
- I'M MAXED OUT. 87.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.227
- OKAY. OKAY, THAT'S--THAT'S
A PRETTY HIGH BAR, BLAZER.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.896
SO THAT MEANS YOU ONLY HAVE
TO PUT ON...

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.898
NONE,
BECAUSE I'M CHOOSING YOU.

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.934
- NO. NO!
- YOU--YOU SERIOUS?

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.402
- YEAH, I'M SERIOUS, DUDE.
YOU LOOK LIKE A PROFESSIONAL

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.870
SKATING CELEBRITY.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.338
THE SWEDISH CHICKS
WILL DIG THAT.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.740
- YEAH, MAN!
PRO SKATER, I CAN DO THAT.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.609
NO PROBLEM.
BLAKER HAS A DEATH WISH.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.477
- NO, NO, NO.
ADAM HAS A DEATH WISH.

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:18.946
- WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU WERE PUTTING

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.515
SPERMICIDE
ON MY FRENCH CRULLER.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:24.084
O'DERS RULES!

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.420
BLAKE, LET'S DAP OUT OF HERE.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.756

OH!
