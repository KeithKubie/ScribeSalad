00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.749
Let's go through and figure out what each 
of the composite functions for every pair

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:06.810
here would be. 
Then we can answer whether or not they're

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.850
the same. 
For this first pair we have f of x equals

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.558
x squared, and g of x equals x plus 1. 
That means that f composed with g would

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:19.770
give us x plus 1 squared. 
But if we have g composed with f, then

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.780
instead, we get x squared, plus 1. 
These are not the same, so let's check no.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.560
For the next one we have f of x, equals x 
plus 1, and g of x equals x plus 2, and

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.210
in this case both of our compositions are 
the same.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.928
It doesn't matter. 
Whether we add 2 and then 1, or 1 and

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:41.970
then 2 to x. 
In both cases, we end up with x plus 3.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.120
So, let's check yes for this one. 
Interesting, and now for the fun part.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.305
Is putting on your left shoe, and then 
putting on your right shoe, going to give

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:55.410
you the same outcome as putting on your 
right shoe, and then putting on your left shoe?

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.340
Well in both cases, you're going to end 
up with both shoes on your feet.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.580
So, yes. 
F of g, and g of f, are the same.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.090
Now, we have one function, as putting on 
your shoes, and the other as putting on

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.200
your socks. 
So, is putting on your socks and then

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.340
your shoes, the same as putting on your 
shoes and then your socks?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.270
Well, in one case, we end up with a 
pretty normal situation, socks underneath shoes.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.625
In the other case, though, when we have 
shoes underneath our socks, You'd

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:25.750
probably be pretty uncomfortable. 
Your socks might not even fit over your shoes.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.490
Either ways, socks underneath shoes or 
shoes underneath socks, are not the same thing.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.330
So we're going to have to check no on 
this one.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.990
And last but not least, we have two 
functions that are getting dressed and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.398
taking a shower. 
Now, one of these seems to produce a

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:44.190
pretty normal everyday activity. 
You take a shower and then you get dressed.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.140
But, what if we did things the other way 
around?

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.794
I, for one, would be pretty sad if I put 
on my favorite dress and then got in the

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:54.640
shower and got myself soaking wet. 
That would not be a great start to my day.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.288
So I think we can safely say that taking 
a shower, and then getting dressed, is

00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:02.740
very different from getting dressed, and 
then taking a shower.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.619
So no, the two compositions of these 
functions that we could do are not the same.
