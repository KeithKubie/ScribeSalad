00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
JAMES GRIME: As an antipathian,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.440
how big is a billion?

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.230
TONY PADILLA: No, I'm not even
going to go there, man.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.550
JAMES GRIME: Well, what
were you taught?

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.220
What were you taught
at school?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.990
TONY PADILLA: OK.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.965
So there's basically two
ways of interpreting

00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:14.000
what a billion is.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.690
There is the correct
English way.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.810
And there's the incorrect
American way.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.510
I think I was taught a billion
is 1,000 million.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.830
JAMES GRIME: Right, exactly.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.920
Now, that's what I was taught
at school as well.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.220
Although in Britain the older
generation would say a billion

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950
is not 1,000 million.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.605
They would say it was
a million million.

00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:36.730
TONY PADILLA: There's a
beautiful mathematical logic

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.700
to the old way of doing and it,
which I just don't see in

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.170
the new way.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.600
JAMES GRIME: If we ask our
viewers, I reckon about half

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.380
of them will answer a billion
has nine zeroes.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.560
That's 1,000 million.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.300
And I reckon the rest of them
will say a billion has 12

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.230
zeroes, which is a
million million.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.450
And it depends on how old
you are and where in

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.700
the world you live.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.850
Let's be honest.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.640
Real mathematicians and real
scientists, if they've got a

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.590
large number, they're not really
going to use billions

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.450
and trillions.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.470
They actually use
standard form.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.650
So if I want to say something
with 27 zeroes, you'd write

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.345
something like this.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:22.230
You'd be 5 times
10 to the 27th.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.470
But if you're reading articles
in the newspapers, on BBC

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.030
website, they're going
to use words like

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.700
billions and trillions.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.790
Now, there is dispute.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.280
There are two systems.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.025
There's the short system
and the long system.

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:43.200
So let's have a look at the
short system first.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.230
So the short system is based
on powers of 1,000.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.480
Let's start off with
the number 1.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.340
Now, it is a power of 1,000.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.750
It's 1,000 to the power
0, So that's 1.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.930
What's the next step up?

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.770
Well, you get 1,000,
don't you?

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.330
That is 1,000 to the power 1.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.690
That's three zeroes.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.910
I'll put that over here.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.050
We've got three zeroes there.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.840
What's the next step up?

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.580
It's a million.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.940
Right, let's do a million.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.950
1,000 squared, that's six
zeroes we've got.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.440
What's next up, after that?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.400
Well, in the short system, the
next one is a billion.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.520
So a billion, that's
1,000 cubed.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.490
And that's 10 to the power
9, nine zeroes.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.011
After that, you get a trillion,
which is 1,000 to

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:37.670
the power 4.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.240
And that's 10 to the power 12.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.700
That 12 zeroes.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.460
And we can keep going
after that.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.350
So let's see, million,
billion, trillion.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.465
The next one is quad,
quintillion, sextillion,

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:54.820
septillion.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.130
This is what America uses.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.560
And it's what Britain uses.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.100
And it's what the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.690
English-speaking world now uses.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.630
Britain adopted this
officially--

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.390
the government officially
adopted the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.670
short system in 1974.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.500
So there is a generation gap for
people who are used to the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.540
long system.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.680
You are aware that the UK
has adopted 10 to the 9.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.260
TONY PADILLA: Yeah, you know,
the UK has been on the slide

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.220
for a while, right?

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.300
So they should have stuck to
their guns because the 10 to

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.650
the 12 version makes
loads more sense.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.430
JAMES GRIME: The thing that
annoys me with this, though,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.890
is, you see, bi means
two, like bicycle.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.670
But it's not 1,000
to the power 2.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.150
It's 1,000 to the power 3.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.930
It's horrible, isn't it?

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.570
TONY PADILLA: Well, maybe it's
just someone wanted to say,

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.910
oh, we could say a
billion, right?

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.370
We can say someone's
a billionaire.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.290
And we can say it more quickly
if we use this different

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.690
definition of a billion.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.550
But, you know.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.340
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, it's
pretty horrible.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.850
A trillion, which should be
a three then, is 1,000

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.820
to the power 4.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.130
Not very nice, because, if you
ask me, the long system is

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.660
more logical.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.150
TONY PADILLA: I can't
understand it.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.780
I suspect somebody--

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.710
I could be wrong about this.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.620
But I expect somebody
just got it wrong.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.830
And it sort of caught on.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.830
JAMES GRIME: So the long system
is used by most of

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.910
continental Europe and the
non-English-speaking world.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.230
And it's based on powers
of 1 million.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.400
So let's start off in the same
place we started before, with

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.630
the number one.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.620
That is a million to the power
0, so same as before.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.530
The next power is going
to be here, a million.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.810
So that's a million--

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.920
let's write it down--

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.060
to the power of 1.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.150
Now, the next power of a million
will be-- and in the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.300
long system, it is called
a billion, which

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.700
is 1 million squared.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.740
It is a bi-million.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.290
And that's where the word
billion comes from.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.070
So it's a million
to the power 2.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.385
So let's just join those up.

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:02.500
So 1 is 1.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.100
That's fine.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.640
Million and million
are the same.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.020
But here 12 zeroes
was called in the

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.130
short system a trillion.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.280
I actually prefer billion
in the long system.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.595
The next power up is now
called a trillion, a

00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:21.730
tri-million.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.780
It's a million cubed, 3
powers of a million.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.145
So that would line up with
what's called a quintillion.

00:05:30.145 --> 00:05:31.980
TONY PADILLA: Well, I've
always thought the only

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.050
dispute was between a billion.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.060
But they all fall out.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.600
JAMES GRIME: They all
fall out of order.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.620
You're absolutely right.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.520
The long system, though,
is more logical.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.480
The naming of the numbers
are more logical.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.000
Billion, trillion has meaning,
whereas they lose their

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.820
meaning in the short system.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.120
OK.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.840
And you can carry
on like this.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.990
A quadrillion--

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.480
I mean, I could go on for a
long time with this if you

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.820
want me to--

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.210
is 1 million.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.690
What is it?

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.810
1 million, Well, quad is
4, 1 million to the 4.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.650
OK, and you can really
extend it.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.480
Let's go right the way down.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.660
OK, what's a centillion?

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.562
According to this logic,
1 centillion--

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:23.270
well cent, so that's 1 million
to the power of 100, which is

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.300
10 to the 600.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.050
So that, incidentally, if
you do it that way, is

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.215
bigger than a googol.

00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:32.536
Well, you do have
some gaps now.

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:35.510
And it might be useful to have
a name for these gaps.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:41.550
It might be useful to have
a name for 1,000 million.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.020
We don't seem to have one now.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.220
Well we do.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.600
The name for 1,000 million
in the long system--

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.290
and I love this word.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.040
It's called a milliard.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.780
A milliard, that's
1,000 million.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.100
It's fallen out of
favor, that word.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.730
It's still used, I think,
in continental Europe.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.460
But in Britain when we use
the long system, it

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.540
kind fell out of favor.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.750
I think it's a great word.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.230
I want to bring back
the milliard.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.030
TONY PADILLA: So what
have we got?

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.350
Have we also got a billiard?

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.020
JAMES GRIME: Exactly.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.620
We've got a billiard
right there.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.990
That's called a billiard, like a
posh person playing snooker,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.510
yeah, a billiard.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.860
In the financial world,
they actually have a

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.420
term called a yard.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.555
And it actually comes from
the word milliard.

00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:29.430
And it means 1,000 million.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:35.190
And they use the word yard
instead of saying billion, or

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.350
1,000 million, because
it's unambiguous.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.910
TONY PADILLA: This is great.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.740
Why have we gone to this silly
system that has no

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.430
mathematical logic
to it, which--

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.420
it's just because somebody
didn't really understand

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.120
numbers that it got created.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.730
And we should have gone back
to the old English way.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.740
And I think to celebrate the
Queen's 60th Jubilee, this is

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.200
what we should do.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.150
We should all go back
to old English

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.700
way of writing numbers.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.670
JAMES GRIME: I prefer the
long system, but I

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.960
won't be using it.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.340
I won't be using the
long system.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.320
I'll be using the
short system.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.480
It's the standard in the
English-speaking world.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.880
Asia don't really use
these systems.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.870
They have their own systems.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.420
Countries like Canada,
bilingual countries--

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.890
even more confusing--

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.490
will use both, one for
each language.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.000
So they'll be using short system
in one language and

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.880
then long system in the other.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.991
But you're shaking your head,
like that's not true.

00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:30.320
TONY PADILLA: No, it's
just disgusting.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.000
JAMES GRIME: You're
amazed aren't you?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.900
Imagine, imagine.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.559
The Greeks have an interesting
system because what they do--

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.450
TONY PADILLA: They need
it with the kind

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.630
of money they owe.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.210
JAMES GRIME: Oh, don't get
me started, right.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.780
They don't use the
word million.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.140
Here's an interesting
story as well.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.680
Million means large 1,000.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.740
Mil means 1,000.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.960
Million means a large 1,000.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.990
Now, what the Greeks use
is a word called--

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.720
I'll put it here--

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.850
myriad.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:03.390
Now, myriad, in English, means
many, uncountably many, lots.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.680
It actually originally
means 10,000.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.640
Myriad means 10,000.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.990
So instead of million, they
don't say million.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:17.610
They call that 100-myriad.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.990
And the Greeks use
the long system.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.690
But instead of million,
we have this word--

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.850
100-myriad.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.360
So they'll now have, not a
bi-million, not a billion, but

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.660
a bi-100-myriad.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.250
TONY PADILLA: Oh, it
just annoys me.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.230
I just think it's rubbish.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.400
The way everyone has started to
do it, it makes no sense.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.060
At least I can't see
the sense in it.
