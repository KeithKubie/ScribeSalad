&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I will just say
that this morning I was reflecting

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.230
on lectures we had had previously,
and I remembered that probably

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.050
about 2003 we had the
author of this book,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.490
The Seashell on the Mountaintop,
Alan Cutler, who's a geologist,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.760
works at the Smithsonian, local
guy, so he came and talked

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.120
about pretty much the
beginnings of geology.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.370
And there was an Italian person
who ultimately became a saint,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.590
and that was Nicholas Steno,
which I don't know if people learn

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.370
about that in geology classes, but
he was one of the Medici darlings.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.180 position:56%
And people were always wondering why

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.960
on a mountaintop would
you find a seashell?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.910
So he worked on this
and found out why.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:15.210
And now, of course, three or so
centuries later, we have people

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.900
who are going to planets and
doing the same sort of thing,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.380
getting the rocks and other
debris and studying it.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.560
In fact, I was just reading that
we still have the lunar rocks

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.700
from the '70s and people
are still studying them

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120
and finding out new things.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.500
So today we are very excited
to have a planetary geologist.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.800
We've had so many astrophysicists.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.100
So this is our second
planetary geologist.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.350
We had one of her colleagues,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.290
Dr. Bleacher [assumed
spelling], back in 2012.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.880
And he talked about the
Desert RATS missions,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.520
which we'll hear about again today.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.340
So Kelsey Young is
pretty new at NASA.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.300
She's been a postdoc
there and now full-time,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.760
and she's got some other
affiliations that she can mention.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.760
So I will just tell you
where she went to school.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.370
People always want to know.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.590
And she had her B.S. in
environmental geosciences

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.190
from Notre Dame, an M.S.
in geological sciences

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.940
from Arizona State
University, and also her Ph.D.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.700
from Arizona State University
in geological sciences.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.430
So we'll get started right away

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.510
and hear what Dr. Kelsey
Young has to say.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.440
[ Applause ]

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.270
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah,
okay so I work --

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.570 position:56%
I have a dual affiliation with the
NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.190
and the NASA Goddard Space Flight
Center here in the D.C. area.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.980
And I basically work
between the centers and sort

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.280
of at the intersection
of the science

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.270
and human exploration communities.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.850
I'm a planetary field geologist,
so I study methods and techniques

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.310
for conducting field
geology on other planets.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.060
So who I am, what I do, I sort

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.560
of just gave you a spoiler
alert on that first bullet.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.130 position:56%
So I did my Bachelor's at Notre Dame
studying analog features in Iceland,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.740
so volcanic features
in Iceland that look

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.300
like similar features we
see on the surface of Mars.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.490
Then I got my Masters and my Ph.D.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.420
at ASU before coming
here to Goddard.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.490
And I recently transitioned
to being full-time,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.370
split between the Goddard
Space Flight Center

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.670
and the Johnson Space Center.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.260
So I'm going to be talking a little
about solar system exploration,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.020
the methods by which we do this,
both robotic and man's space flight

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.320
to explore our solar system.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.190
I'm going to be talking a
little bit about analog testing.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.160
So integrated field
campaigns meant to prepare us

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.700
for sending humans back to
other planetary surfaces.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.970
I'm going to talk about
field portable instruments,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.600
so high resolution tools and
techniques that we use in the field

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.220
to tell us about the
geology of an area.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.900
And then I'm going to look forward
to sort of where we're going next

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.470
as a human spaceflight community.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.060
So solar system, obviously plants
are to scale, distances are not.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.830 position:56%
So NASA has been working for
decades to explore the solar system.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.390
We've sent orbiters, rovers,
and we've even sent humans

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.690
out into the solar system

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.280
to investigate all these
planetary bodies here.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.190
And I just -- I had to leave
Pluto on there [laughter].

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.260
And we've even sent an orbiter

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.330
out past the end of
the solar system now.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.540
So we've sent orbiters to
every single planet shown here

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.840
in this image.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.150
But now we're starting to get a
higher resolution look at some

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.740
of the surfaces of these planets
through rovers and, again,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.340
hopefully through sending
humans to Mars and beyond.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.880
So here are all of the planetary
missions that are either

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.220
in operation right now or in
development for the future.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.830
Definitely won't go through all of
these, but in the inset in the --

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.840
in the box there you see
the orbiters and rovers,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.360 position:56%
specifically on the Martian surface.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.660
You know, missions that I'll talk

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.010
about later are the lunar
reconnaissance orbiter,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.850 position:56%
which is an orbiter around the moon.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.150
Rosetta actually just ended.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.260
It was a European space
agency mission that just --

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.060
that just ended a couple weeks ago.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.400
OSIRIS-REx just launched actually
about a month and a half ago to go

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.280
and collect a sample and bring
it back from an asteroid.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.720
So lots of exciting missions right
now that NASA is currently running

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.470
and that we have planned
for the future.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.940 position:56%
Actually, I think about half an
hour ago ExoMars entered Mars' orbit

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.360
and actually sent a lander to
the surface, I mean literally

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.270
at 11 o'clock this morning.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.620
So there are a lot of really
exciting things happening.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.560
What I work on specifically
is sending humans

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.870
out beyond our planet.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.820
So that's what I'm
going to focus on today.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.150
So, of course, we have one example
of sending humans beyond the Earth

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.650
to conduct a field geology
and another planetary body.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.040
We have six surface
missions that sent 12 people

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.880
to the moon from 1969 to '72.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.520
They were collecting samples
with tools like you see here.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.860
That's Apollo 17 astronaut Jack
Schmidt collecting a sample

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.250
of the lunar regolith with a rake.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.990
They actually deployed
surface science experiments.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.040
So, for example, they
deployed seismometers

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.670
on the lunar surface
to study moon quakes.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.050
And they used a lunar roving
vehicle, which you can see here

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.540
in the bottom of the picture, that
enabled them on Apollo 15, 16,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.500
and 17 to travel even farther
out from the lunar lander.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.880
So I'm going to be talking
a lot about the intersection

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.180
of science and exploration.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.580
And I just wanted to
highlight at the beginning,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.140 position:56%
one mission that I mentioned earlier

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.390
that is a prime example
of doing this.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.910
So the lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
has been in orbit around the moon

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.470
for the past several years.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.680
It was initially funded
as a joint project

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.070 position:56%
between the Human Exploration Office
and the Science Mission Directorate.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.860
So it was -- it was intentionally
funded by both programs

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.700
to initially select landing
sites for future human missions

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.360
to the moon, and then the human
community was going to transfer it

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.170
over to the scientists to allow
them to conduct new lunar science.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.160
So I won't go over
all the instruments,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.510
but they're listed here.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.780
But they were -- this instrument
was specifically selected to allow

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.820
for this blend of science
and exploration.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.300
So an example here is the
Apollo 17 landing site.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.550
If you look close you can
actually see the tracks

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.420
that the Apollo 17 astronauts
made on the lunar surface.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.550
This is the lander that they
actually did their EVA's from,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.360
or extra vehicular activities.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.310
Then, for example, right on the
left is that seismometer experiment

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.610
that I told you they deployed.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.910
So you can actually see this

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.090
in really high resolution
detail with the LRO mission.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.480
This is an interesting story for
any engineers in the audience.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.920
When the Apollo astronauts
traveled to lunar surface

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.230
that actually jet ascend
boosters that crashed

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.340
into lunar surface
before they landed.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.410
We had found almost all of them,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.340
could not find the
Apollo 16 boosters.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.880
And through the LRO instrument
package we were actually able

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.400
to find the impact crater made

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.580
by the booster impacting
into the lunar surface.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.870
So the types of data
products that we're generating

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.710
with this mission are something
like what's given on the right.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.450 position:56%
This is a paper published this year.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.120
And basically this image shows
a blend of multiple LRO datasets

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.700
that were blended together
to create a traverse path

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.500
for a lunar polar rover that's
going to search for volatiles

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.440
in the lunar polar region.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.150
So this right down here is a
permanently shadowed region.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.530
It never sees the sunlight.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.830
We're going to send a rover in

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.840
and around those PSR's
to look for volatiles.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.190
And this instrument
package will allow us

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.930
to traverse plan [inaudible]
missions like this

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.510
that will benefit human expiration.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.340
But again, we always
have scientific drivers

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.260
for planetary exploration missions.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.920
These are three missions in
particular that highlight missions

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.790
to bodies that humans could one
day go and sample in person.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.010 position:56%
Of course, we've already been to the
moon, and I talked a lot about LRO.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.310
This is the Mars science lab,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.210 position:56%
the Curiosity rover that's currently
operating on the Martian surface.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.910
And then like I mentioned earlier,
OSIRIS-REx launched to an asteroid

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.900
in September, and it's
going to bring a sample

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.490
of an asteroid back to Earth.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.090
So we've made massive
advancement since Apollo

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.890
in terms of lunar science.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.640 position:56%
Like you mentioned, lunar samples
are still being studied to this day.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.690
There's actually a fraction
of the Apollo samples

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.300
that we haven't even touched yet.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.790
So we're still getting a lot
of really robust lunar science

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.620
out of them, but they've also
raised new science questions

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.850
about the history of the moon
and how it evolves in conjunction

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.930
with our planet, as well
as the rest of the planets

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.230
in our inner solar system.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.720
So the areas of interest
that we're looking at here,

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.830
and that human beings
will look at regardless

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.360
of the destination they eventually
go to, geology, geophysics,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.750
geochemistry, atmospheric
science, life-related chemistry,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.670
and the search for life on Mars,

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.120
and all of these require varying
levels of human interaction.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.840
But all of them would benefit from
the inclusion of a human being

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.230
on whatever planet that we
eventually end up going toward.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.930
So like I said, the destinations

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.840
for future human missions
include small bodies, the moon,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.680
going back to the moon, and
eventually the journey to Mars.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.050
All of these destinations come
with varying levels of complexity.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.300
For example, the moon is
relatively close by, of course,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.140
and the communications
delays associated

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.470
with a mission control center here
in Houston talking to astronauts

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.370 position:56%
on the lunar surface are negligible.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.310
However, when you go to
Mars you can have up to

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.760
about a 30 minute round-trip
communication delay.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.930
So it's really important that we as
scientists, engineers, operators,

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.130
learn how to operate under
that 30 minute time delay.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.110
Of course, they have varying
atmospheric and gravity conditions.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.130
You see an artist's concept

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.090
of a human being operating
around an asteroid.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.380
You would need to stabilize the
astronauts somehow while they were

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.470
collecting samples
from that asteroid.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.470
So varying atmospheric and gravity
conditions really have an impact

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.150
on how you conduct
science at that body.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.890
And; therefore, developing
flexible technology now in advance

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.190
of these missions is crucial

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.490
to understanding how you would
even work in these environments.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.550
And at NASA we have a lot
of platforms that allow us

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.380
to investigate all three of these
different destination classes

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.880
and how you would operate
in them scientifically.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.150
So the journey to Mars.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.550
NASA is all about the
journey to Mars right now.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.030
This is a pretty complicated
sketch that sort of funnels

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.580
into how we're going
to get from here

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.090
on Earth to the surface of Mars.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.790
So, of course, we have the
International Space Station

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.140
in orbit around Earth right now.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.340
I'll talk about it a
little bit more later.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.720
And eventually we're going to move

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.420
out to the moon with
the Orion capsule.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.900
Then we're going to use the space
launch system, a heavy rocket,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.200
to get a lot of mass and
payload to the Martian surface

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.770
and the Martian atmosphere.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.860
NASA also has the asteroid redirect
mission on the books to go to a --

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.200
to go to an asteroid,
bring a boulder back

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.600
into lunar orbit, and
sample that boulder.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.800
We also have many orbiters
and landers,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.550
rovers around Mars right now,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.200
including the Shiaparelli
lander from today.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.600
And eventually all this is going
to give us an orbit around Mars

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.900
and on the surface to Mars.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.790
And that includes the Mars'
moons, Phobos and Deimos.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.460
That's part of NASA's
journey to Mars right now.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.010
And this whole construct
shows how we're going to build

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.590
from Earth to the surface of Mars.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.240
So this shows it in sort of
a different way that I like.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.110
So basically the Earth Reliant
system here, that's ISS, right,

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.410
these missions last
from six to 12 months.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.490
Actually three men
launched this morning

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.900
to the International Space Station.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.380
So we had one NASA astronaut and
two Russian cosmonauts launch

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.610
at about four a.m. to go to
International Space Station.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.130 position:56%
So these missions can range from six
months right now it's up to year.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.190
Scott Kelly just got back
from his year in space.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.310
So we describe this as
an Earth Reliant system.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.650
Houston, mission control,
is constantly in the loop,

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.380
as well as mission control centers
from the other space agencies

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.480
that form the International
Space Station.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.940
But eventually we want
to move out, right.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.740
We want to move to
the proving ground.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.920
And these missions can -- were
conceptualized and can last

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.930
between one and 12 months and
it's going to lunar orbit.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.570
It's going to complete this
asteroid redirect mission,

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.710
and it's all to get us ready
for the Mars ready systems

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.330
which will take us
to Mars on the order

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.210 position:56%
of missions from two to three years.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.200
So we need to learn how humans
can survive in space that long,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.480
how we can land on and launch
off of the Martian surface?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.690 position:56%
And specifically what I'm interested
in is, how you conduct science

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.850
from the Martian surface or in
orbit around the Martian surface?

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.580
We want to move forward
from Apollo, right.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.360
And right now NASA
is heavily involved

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.110
in the International Space Station.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.090
So the International Space
Station is shown here.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.500
It's the size of a football field

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.120
and it orbits Earth
every 90 minutes.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.870
So these -- the crew members
on board ISS get a, you know,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.990
front row seats to the
Earth surface processes

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.640 position:56%
that are shaping our planet, and the
processes that shape other planets.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.190
So they're learning
a lot scientifically

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.580
about how the world works, how
Earth's surface processes work.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.830
They're observing volcanic
eruptions in real time.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.640 position:56%
They're observing hurricanes hitting
the coast of the U.S. in real time.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.610
They can see all of this
happening, and what's important,

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.630
and what I'll talk about
later is to train them

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.880
to observe these processes
and send back lessons learned

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.250
to the scientist here on
Earth that study them.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.610
So they're observing Earth.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.440
They're conducting
science experiments.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.030
And they're learning how to survive
in space for long periods of time.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.010
So they study macular degeneration.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.140
How are your eyes affected from
being in low gravity for so --

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.340
for so long on the way
to Mars and coming back?

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.310
How is your bone density affected?

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.610
How's your balance affected?

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.410
And what's going to happen when
you land on the surface of Mars

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.010
after traveling for
months and need to put

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.310
on a spacesuit and go outside?

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.410
How is your body going to respond?

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.450
And, of course, we're
also heavily involved

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.130
in private partnerships
with private companies.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.490
So here's Kate Rubins and Jeff
Williams capturing a Dragon

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.790
from SpaceX.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.480
So all of the activities
that are going

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.460
on in ISS right now are crucial
in preparing us to operate

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.270
in this Mars system and
the journey to Mars.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.570
But the rest of the talk
I'm going to the focus

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.890
on actually conducting
science on other planets,

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.720
planetary surface exploration.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.340
So the question I think about
every day is, what do we need to do

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.960
to get ready to send humans
to these destinations?

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.640
And, of course, the big part
of this is test, test, test.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.450
You've got to test, go
back to the drawing board,

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.300
redesign, and test again.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.100 position:56%
So this requires an ongoing
integrated approach between science,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.670
operations, and technology

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.500
to understand how we're
going to operate in this way.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.160
So moving forward, I'm going to --
and the things I'm going to talk

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.900
about today are integrated
testing and analog,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.260
so these operational
field tests that allow us

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.530
to test multiple components
of a system in one place.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.840
Then we move forward to actually
one year on EVA on a spacewalk,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.140
what instruments you need
to collect scientific data?

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.390
And then how does a crew need to be
trained to use those instruments?

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.740
How are they trained to actually
be our proxy as geologists,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.330
as scientists, to get the
data that we need on Mars.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.040
And all this will hopefully feed
forward into an exploration mission

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.490
and eventually NASA's
journey to Mars,

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.100
which you've heard me
say already 10 times,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.550
and you can expect it 10 more.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.150
So this is an eye chart.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.700
Don't worry about reading it.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.480
But this is sort of just an
example of the analog projects

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.450
that NASA's relying on in the past

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.540
and currently moving
forward to get ready.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.300
So, of course, we have
the Apollo missions.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.930
That taught us a lot about how to
conduct science on other planets.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.270
It was with no communication
delay, which were going to need

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.680
to test moving forward to Mars,
but it's a really robust way for us

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.700
to test science operations,
procedures,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.750
and planetary surface expiration.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.770 position:56%
We've got the Mars robotic missions.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.090
While those don't have
human beings on the surface

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.020
of Mars it's teaching us
a lot about how to operate

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.640
under a communications delay,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.780
what kind of scientific
instruments are going to be useful

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.800
on the Martian surface,
and how to operate on Mars

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.930
with the Mission Control
Room in the loop?

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.070
We have the NEEMO missions,
which I'll talk about,

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.950
NASA Extreme Environment Mission
Operations, and that's a mission --

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.580
do you like how they build
an acronym into the --

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.650
it's the most NASA thing ever.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.010 position:56%
So you have human crewmembers living
underwater for weeks at a time

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.350
and operating under
varying communication delays

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.650
with the back room.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.800
You've got the Desert RATS mission,
which I'll talk about as well,

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.990
and that's a technology development
platform for spacesuits and rovers

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.210
that will allow astronauts to
travel farther than ever before

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.170
from the landers they use to
get to the surface of Mars.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.250
We have scientific field campaigns.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.070
What scientific instruments
do we need

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.470
when operating on the
surface of Mars?

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.770
How do we use them?

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.960
These are scientifically
motivated campaigns.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.720
And you also have other
campaigns, like for example ISRU

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.610
to learn how -- what technology
you would need to mine resources

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.370
in [inaudible] on the
surface of Mars.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.350
So I'll talk about a lot of these
for the remainder of the talk.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.500 position:56%
Terrestrial field testing in advance

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.940
of the planetary exploration
mission is nothing new.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.580
I love -- this one of
my favorite pictures.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.680
This is the Apollo 17 crew,
Jack Schmidt, the only geologist

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.780
to ever go to another
planetary surface,

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.170
and Jean [inaudible] testing

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.290
out in the San Francisco
volcanic field north of Flagstaff,

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.160
Arizona where we tested the
Desert RATS rovers right here.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.940
This is just a few miles
away from each other.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.710
So this is nothing new.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.750 position:56%
We need to actually go in and analog
in a relevant analog environment

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.170
to test these technologies
and operational protocols

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.430
to get us ready for when we're
really doing the real thing.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.770
So, again, eye chart, but this
is just to show these are all

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.800
of the analog projects
that NASA's involved

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.080
in right now moving forward
toward the surface of Mars,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.550
or the exploration of Mars.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.330
I'll talk about a few
of these right now,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.350
but each one of these analogs
test something different, right.

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:18.850
There's one, HERA, that's a habitat
on site at NASA Johnson in Houston.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.070
That's actually testing
human factors.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.770
So how do you -- how do you figure
out how a human crew is doing

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.070
on a long duration spaceflight.

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.740
It's evaluating -- it's for the
behavioral analysis folks and NASA

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.350
to understand how human beings
will react to a situation.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.810
HI-SEAS is another one.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.310
That's a habitat on the
flanks of Mauna Loa in Hawaii.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.090
They just finished their year-long
mission where a crew was living

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.770
in this habitat for a year and
figuring out how they're going

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.440
to react in this environment.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.250
Desert RATS and [inaudible]
are on here.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.110
But each one of these analog
missions test something different

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:55.090
that we'll need as a community to
get ready for crew spaceflight.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.630
So what is analog?

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.970
What do I mean when
I see an analog test?

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.780
This is a multidisciplinary
field test.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.950
So science operations technology
that allows for end-to-end testing

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.570
of operational concepts and
hardware technology software

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.710
in a real operational environment.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.070
So something where
scientists, engineers,

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.920
technology developers
can work together

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.910
in this integrated
environment to understand how

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.180
to play off one another and
how to develop technology

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.110
that fits the needs
of the community.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.820
And what we do, as a community,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.600
and we do it in the
scientific community,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.630 position:56%
and we do it in the crew spaceflight
community, is to evaluate objectives

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.050
that map to specific needs and
technology gaps in the community.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.530
So if a spacesuit engineer
wants understand how

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.240
to build a suit that's going
to allow a field geologist

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.620
on another planet to bend
down and pick up a sample,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.920
we need understand that, right.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.420
We need to speak each other's
language and talk to each other.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.640
So these analog missions are
designed to meet those knowledge

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.830
and technology gaps
in crew spaceflight.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.790
And this has benefits
across crew spaceflight.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:58.040
So ISS, what we're doing now has
direct benefits to the crew --

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.870
the six crew that are
on ISS right now.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.180
And then, of course,
this has direct benefits

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.860
to moving forward to
exploration EVA.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.520
So Desert RATS, this is the
first analog mission I'm going

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.820
to talk about.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.260
Here's the Desert RATS
2010 family photo.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.780
So you've got two habitat
rovers that link

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.510 position:56%
up to a habitat laboratory, assuming
that you have a long duration stay

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.940
on another planetary surface.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.530
So Desert RATS are the
research and technology studies.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.830
We love our acronyms.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.830
Consist of an integrated team
of engineers and scientists,

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.730
including a lot of NASA centers,
other agencies, military academia,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.440 position:56%
private partners, students that came
together for a couple weeks a year

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.370
in the desert to test
technology like this.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.330
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about the technology and sort

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.560
of lessons learned moving
forward from these D RATS tests.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.260
So we have this habitat rover.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.960 position:56%
These are designed to support a crew
of two for long duration traverses

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.370
on other planetary surface.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.940 position:56%
So specifically in the Desert RATS
missions each rover contained a crew

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.290
of two, one astronaut
and one field geologist,

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.650
again trying to teach each other,

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.660
how to talk to each other,
how to work together.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.000
Here's a view from the front seat.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.610
The astronaut would sit here,
the geologist would sit here,

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.910
and they would drive the rover

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.380
with this panel controls
using a joystick.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.680
And then we do EVA.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.520
So here I am with Stephanie
Wilson from JFC.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.450
We'd go out and we'd three
or four EVA's per day,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.310
designed to collect samples and
interrogate the geologic history

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.480
of the San Francisco
volcanic field in Arizona.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.190
We had sample collection
technologies.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.730
So believe it or not, these tools
that were mounted on the back

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.540
of the rover were modeled
directly from the Apollo tools.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.840
They started there, right.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.140
It worked for them, right.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.270 position:56%
So we're going to build forward from
this Apollo sample collection suite

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.460
and learn what's needed,
what do we need to change.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.520
We're actually doing this on Mars,
going back to the moon asteroids.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.700
And then the final
thing that we tested,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.300
specifically in 2010,
was the habitat lab.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.770
So you could actually dock
to the side of this lab.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.480
You could -- this sort of popcorn
top on the top is where we slept.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.600
So you -- there was also a
geologic glovebox in there.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.590 position:56%
So they had scientific instruments
in the glovebox that you could reach

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.450
in and manipulate the
samples that you collected

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.060 position:56%
on traverse inside that habitat lab.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.630
And so the test, test, test,
test, redesign, test again,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.010
that whole philosophy really
came through in Desert RATS.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.310
So you would test one.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.040
You would meet all year
to discuss how you --

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.110
what modifications you needed
to make to the hardware,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.490
and you would come back with
a new iteration to test.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.400
And in this way we really
made these giant strides

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.150
because we were working together
as scientists and engineers

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.260
to understand what the
other community needed.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.770
And if I'm a scientist and I want
to moon, right, I want it all,

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.330
the engineer is going to say
that's just never going to happen.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.630 position:56%
You need to come to grips with that.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.000
So it's learning how to interact
with each other and build forward

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.020
from the previous year's iteration.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.780
We also tested operation.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.130
So integrated EVA science
operations.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.640
That's something I think
a lot about, right.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.060
And that's the same idea
we've been talking about.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.810
Scientists want to accomplish a set
of scientific objectives on EVA.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.700
The EVA engineers and
operators are responsible

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.190
for keeping their astronauts safe.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.570
So it's understanding how to
work together in that framework

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.390
to accomplish your
scientific objectives.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.300
So in RATS we were examining
the operational concept --

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.590
the operational concepts to
understand that interaction.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.410
How does mission control, working
through a science back room,

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.380
and the astronaut crew
interact together

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.920
to accomplish your
scientific objectives.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.450
We modify procedures
for sample collection.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.770
This is a screen grab from one
of the interfaces we had as crew.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.000
One of the cameras is mounted on
our shoulder to understand how --

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.630
once you say I want that rock over
there, how do you go from getting

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.800
that rock over there to
a rock that's packaged

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.450
and curated for return to Earth.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.750
There's a lot of steps.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.560 position:56%
I can tell you it's a big time every
time you want to collect a sample.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.160
So it's understanding how to
streamline those procedures.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.900
So sample collection
doesn't take so long

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.270
and fits into that EVA timeline.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.100
We have crew training, too.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.970
A real benefit of this was bringing
these astronauts out in the field,

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.610
sticking them in a box for a week
with a geologist and forcing them

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.450
to listen to us talk
about rocks, right.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.400
So it's a really good way to
train the crew to get excited

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.100
about geology, to understand
geology, because they're the ones

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.070
that are going to be
doing it one day.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.530
So, of course, we have
science objectives.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.050
So, like I said, we were operating

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.760
in a volcanic field
north of Arizona.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.150
Here's a geologic map produced
by the science team for RATS

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.040
in the weeks leading
up to the mission.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.490
They use this geologic map
created from aerial images

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.360
to develop the traverse
plants for the rovers.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.690
And then, of course, we get
there, we go boots on the ground,

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.310
and we say, no, no, no,
and it's all about refining

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.590
that geologic map created from
data that's just not as good

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.160
as what's available
to you on the ground.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.490
And again, we picked this area

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.870
because it's a really
good analog site

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.780 position:56%
to sites we see on the moon in Mars.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.120 position:56%
So understanding more about how this
volcanic process shaped the region

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.550
will inform us about similar
processes on the moon and Mars.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.670
And, of course, we were
collecting samples.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.100
We were geologic mapping.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.170
We were answering terrestrial
science questions

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.310
about how the area formed and
in what area were these flows

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.880
and cones placed on
top of one another.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.380
And then this, you know, all these
Desert RATS missions didn't just --

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.680
I mean, they did end.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.130
We're not taking the rovers
out to the desert anymore,

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.180
but we're still getting a
lot of really robust science

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.050
and operational information
out of them.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.350
So new follow-up science.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.360
I got back just this
weekend from a trip

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.050
to the Desert RATS
field sites designed

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.690
to understand the geophysical
properties of the area.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.460
So we're still using what we
learned years ago to move forward

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.570
to understanding surface processes.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:13.480
Moving on to NEEMO, NASA Extreme
Environments Mission Operations,

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.810
conducted in the Aquarius Reef Base
sunk several miles off the coast

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.110
of the Florida Keys.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:23.440
A crew of six lives underneath the
water in ARB and conducts a series

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.440
of EVA's every day for, in
this case, a 16 day mission.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.550
We just completed NEEMO 2.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.200
So we've run -- we've
run 21 of the things.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.150
NEEMO 21 was run in July
and August of this year

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.460
and we completed a variety

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.090
of exploration EVA
as well as ISS tasks.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.810
We had an international crew.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.110
We had people from NASA.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:46.060
We had two NASA astronauts as well
as ESA, European Space Agency,

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.370
participation, as well science
PI's who served on the crew

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.730
to help the crew understand how

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.120
to conduct those scientific
experiments.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.930
And so we had back room support
from, you know, across NASA,

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.330
across European Space Agency,
DOD research institutions,

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.920
as well as university
and industry partners.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.390
One of the -- one of the pictures
I like from this mission is Matias.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.600 position:56%
He's from the European Space Agency.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.370
And what you see him doing there is
working with the mini DNA sequencer

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.910
that Kate Rubins just ran on
International Space Station.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.500
So they were finding
the procedures and ISS

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.650
that Kate would eventually
use on ISS

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.060
to sequence the first DNA in space.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.930
So science objectives.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.990
We were conducting coral nurseries.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.130
Actually the EVA and one of the --

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.010
in the first week of NEEMO
we can constructed --

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.220
the astronaut crew constructed
the deepest ever choral nursery

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.520
in the world.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.410
So they conducted -- they
constructed coral nurseries at 50

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.980
and 90 feet where they basically
would put these tiny little cards

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.600
with coral samples on them

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.220
to understand how these
different species of corals grow

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.920
at different depths so we
can repopulate damaged reefs

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.220
around the world.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.850 position:56%
We were doing follow-up science from
NEEMO 20, which happened last year.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.260
So we were understanding how
these corals have evolved

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.560
in the year since we last saw them.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.900
And we're doing new science.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:05.380
We are exploring new areas in the
area around the Aquarius Reef Base.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.080
Operations, again, this
is a complicated chart

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.740
but it's one I spend a lot
of time thinking about.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.550
So integrated EVA science
operations.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.600
How do you work with
astronauts on EVA, any astronauts

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.970
who might be the habitat and not on
EVA who are there to support them,

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.850
any sort of mission control
room focused on astronaut safety

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.690
and mission operations, as well
as the science back room who wants

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.290
to accomplish science objectives?

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.210
It's a very complicated
communication pathway,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.100
and we need to understand who needs
to talk to who and when and how.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.240
So that's one of the sort
of operational constructs

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.950
that we specifically
were testing at NEEMO

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.420
and we learned a lot this year.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.040
We still have a ways to go.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.950
So we were testing
operational concepts

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.970
of navigation, traverse planning.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.930
What if you're an astronaut,
you see the traverse plan

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.810
that someone drew up, and
they get there and they say,

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.350
this is not where we
want to go at all.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:53.430
You told me to go left,
but this coral colony

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.920
that looks really interesting
is over to the right.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.680
How do you react to that real time?

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.080
Is mission control going to be okay

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.380
with you going right
instead of left?

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.490
We need to understand
how that framework works.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.780
We tested a couple other
things that I won't dwell on,

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.830
but we tested a new version of
optical communications as well

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.840
as actually using a remotely
operated vehicle underwater while

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.140
on EVA.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.430
We also tested new technology.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.380
So this is a cue card
with an underwater iPad

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.650 position:56%
that the crew could use to
navigate while they were underwater.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.910
We tested an IV support
system, inter vehicular.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.570
So if you're the crew member
supporting your crewmates while

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.270
they're on EVA, what do you need?

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.080
What architecture do you
need to help them out?

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.480
And we're also building
new science sampling tools

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.890
and this geology sampling kit.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.600 position:56%
We tested this over a series of
NEEMO missions and how do you sample

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.750
in this sort of lower
gravity environment?

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.670
So next thing, now that I've talked
about analogs, I want to sort

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.600
of narrow the focus
to talk specifically

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.540
about scientific instruments.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.320 position:56%
So if you're a scientist astronaut
on EVA, you want to collect samples,

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.230
you want to interrogate the
landscape, what do you need

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.110
in your hands to do that?

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.410
So Apollo astronauts, of course,

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.300
had basic sample collection
technologies,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.960
like the rake I mentioned earlier.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.910
But in the several decades since
Apollo we've come a long way

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.380
with In-Situ analytical
technologies.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.740 position:56%
One instrument I spent a lot of time
with is this portable spectrometer,

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.270
an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.080
that in 60 seconds can give you
the chemical composition of a rock

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.160
that you're pointing it at.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.660
So the goal of any instrument
that we're talking about here is

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.760
to maximize the science return
of the mission and to increase,

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.280
or at least not detract
from, the efficiency

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.190
of real-time service operations.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.360
So every time you pull out that
instrument it takes time to decide,

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.710
I want to use it, I want to open
the box, I want to pull it out,

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.320
I want to it turn on,
I want to calibrate it,

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.720
I want to take the analysis.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.230
So every time you're getting
that science value added

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.330
to the mission, it's
an operational hit.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.540
So understanding and developing
instruments that fit this need

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:51.000
of increasing science and adding
science to your mission detracts

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.310
from your operational timeline.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.540
So we really need to
understand this interplay

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.280
and understand what instruments
are worth to include on EVA.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.010
And these instruments, they
influence sample collection.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.860 position:56%
So if I have 10 rocks in front of me

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.530
and mission control is telling
me I can only bring five back,

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.440
I need a way to high grade that
sample suite and select five

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.160
of those 10 samples to bring back.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.070
These instruments can
help us do that.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.880 position:56%
And they can also help us understand
real-time In-Situ what we're seeing

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.180
in front of us.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.480
As a geologist,

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.450
having high-resolution information
real-time is incredibly helpful

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.620
to me to understand the
geologic history of the region.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.550
And I can pretty much guarantee
you that that's going to inform --

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.320
instead of going over there
this data is telling me

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.680
that maybe I actually
want to go look

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.070
at this problem over here instead.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.340
So it influences sample collection,

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.350
as well as your real-time
traverse they are conducting.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.840
So that way that we're doing
this, that I'm participating

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.130
in these activities, is through the
SSERVI Institute, more acronyms.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.710
I spelled it out for you here.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.560
So it through the Solar System
Exploration Research Virtual

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.920 position:56%
Institute, and that's jointly
funded through the human exploration

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.740 position:56%
and the science communities, because
they recognize that there's a lot

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:58.280
of overplay here and we need
to understand each other

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.720
to develop these types
of instruments

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.350
and operational concepts.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.850
So they fund -- one of the teams

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.350
that they fund is the RIS4E
Team that I'm funded under.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.450
The Remote In-Situ and
Synchrotron Studies

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.940
for Science and Exploration Team.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.750
And so RIS4E has a really big
scope, and it's basically focused

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.680
on what do humans need
in general to get us

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.360
to conduct surface
exploration on other planets?

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.860
I work on a piece of RIS4E

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.200
and that's understanding
field portable instruments.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.730
So I'm going to talk to you about
what RIS4E team is doing in terms

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.600
of this portable technology idea.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.230
So here's sort of our
mission statement.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.230
Here are the methodologies
that we use.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.530
You start with a science question.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:34.830
Of course, right.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.130
I'm a geologist.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.430
I like to start with
the science question.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:41.840 position:56%
So you go to a field site, in this
case this is the December 1974 flow,

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.400
the Kilauea Volcano on
the big Island of Hawaii.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.350 position:56%
You start with the science question,
and then you identify, hey,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.470
what are the portable instruments
that in an ideal world I would have

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.600
with me when I go do
fieldwork here on Earth

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.340
that will help me answer
this question?

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.640
Are there any?

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.510
Is this a question you even
need instruments to answer?

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.340
But if it is, what are
the right instruments?

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.400
So we evaluate, we answer
that science question.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.590
We evaluate what role
those instruments played

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.440
in helping us answer that question.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.320
And then we -- and in the spirit
of the human exploration side

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.780
of the house, feed
recommendations forward for how

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.210
to operate these instruments
and what technology needs

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.180
to be developed for planetary
surface exploration designed

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.610
to answer science questions
like these.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:24.290
So here's our sort of operational
strategy that we used last year.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:25.730
We're actually going out
again in a few months,

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.320
but this was from a May
2015 deployment next

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.050
to the December 1974 flow.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.840
So we have a crew of three.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.330
We had two geologists and one
astronaut on our crew that year.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.770
We had a variety of
instrument teams.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.310
I'll show you the instruments
on the next slide,

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.720
but each of them were responsible
for a specific instrument.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.150
And then the unique thing about
RIS4E is that one of our goals is

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.500
to work with science
journalism programs.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.560
So Stony Brook University actually
has a science journalism program

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.600
where they educate
undergraduate students

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.990
about how to report about science.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.020
So we actually in the semester
leading up to the field deployment,

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.760
we had them down at NASA Goddard

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.760
so they could see what a
NASA center looks like.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.520
I went up to Stony Brook and gave
a couple lectures to their classes

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.930
about what it's like to do
fieldwork, what the goals

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.230
of our field project were.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.270
And then they came out in
the field with us and we --

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.700
each team, each instrument team

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.820
in the crew had a science
journalism student embedded with us

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.060
that followed us around with a
video camera and asked us lots

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.690
of questions and learned
what it was to do science.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.480
So that was -- that was a
really interesting aspect

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.780
of the RIS4E project.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.320
So here's our field site.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.020
This is the big Island of Hawaii.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.320
The five volcanos that make

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.360
up the big island are
highlighted here in yellow.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.180 position:56%
Our field site is right down here in
the southwest rift zone of Kilauea.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.430
You can see the December
1974 flow here.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.550 position:56%
It was erupted from these little red
lines that represent the fissures

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.930
that dumped out all of the -- all
of the magma that made this flow.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.230
And you can see the flow flowing

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.630
down here toward the
ocean, which is down here.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.660
One of the interesting
things about this site is

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.250
that if you see this sort of
hazy, white plume right here,

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.720
that's actually the active plume

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.740
from the Kilauea called
[inaudible] on the big island.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.630
So the plume is floating, you
know, right above your head

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.870
and when it rains it sort of pushes
that plume down on top of the flow.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:04.760
So it creates some really
interesting alteration products

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.590
that we were looking
at with the RIS4E team

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.740
and with field [inaudible]
instruments.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:13.110
So here's a view from the ground
on the December 1974 flow.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:16.120
You're standing looking up
slope toward the caldera,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.610
so that sort of reddish-brownish
smoke is actually

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.090
that plume coming up
out of the caldera.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.530
And this is what the
flow looks like.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.560
So it's a great analog environment.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.210
It's actually in the Kahu Desert.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.890
It's a desert environment that has
brief damp periods when it rains.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.270
There's alteration on that flow.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:36.590
You can kind of see sort of whiter
products on this darker flow,

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.580
those are actually
alteration products that result

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.780
when this plume interacts
with the surface of the flow.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.120
And it's a -- and it's a great
analog for other planetary surfaces

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.590 position:56%
because you have these traditional
basaltic lava flows that intersperse

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.410
with basaltic ash,
basaltic sediment,

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:54.520 position:56%
that's reworked lava flows, sort of
scattered in and amongst each other.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.420
And it's got this really
low slope flow morphology,

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:02.300
which is pretty similar to a
lot of areas we see on Mars.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.280
So here are the instruments
we had out with us.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.810
I won't dwell on them.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.220
We had sort of a broad
field of view instruments.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.910
So if you, you can imagine
you're an astronaut driving

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:14.920 position:56%
up to your EVA site in a rover and
you have cameras and different types

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.440
of field-of-view instruments
that you're going

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.720
to initiate from inside the rover.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.490
And that includes multispectral
imaging, which tells us

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:23.220
about the composition of the
surface of the [inaudible].

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.070
You have LIDAR, which is
an instrument designed

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.390
to map surface texture.

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.230
Then we had ground
penetrating radar,

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.040
which probes the subsurface
of the lava flows.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.970
We had this handheld spectrometer,
that I mentioned earlier,

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:37.820
as well as a different
type of spectrometer

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.400
that gives you mineralogy
or other information

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.990
about what builds the rock,
what the rock is made out of.

00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:46.930
And then we actually had a kite out
with us to provide airborne images.

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:49.190
That image I showed a couple
slides ago actually was taken

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.530
from a camera mounted on a kite.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.370
And the reason we did that is

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:56.450
because it's really hard fly UAVs
right now in National Parks, right.

00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:58.210
So a kite is a good way to say --

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.140
to sort of work with the park
service a little bit and, you know,

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.040
it's a way for both of
us to get what we want,

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.160
and we got some really
spectacular images with it.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.530
So I bet you thought you were
going to make out of this topic

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.480
with no squiggly lines, no can do.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.380
I'm a geologist so I have to
show at least one squiggly line.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.890
And I won't dwell on it.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.210
The purpose is just to show the
types of data that we're getting

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.410
in the field so you can
understand what I'm talking

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.610
about when I'm talking about
data from these instruments.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.510
So we looked at things like the
alteration coatings on the rock.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.420
What are these sort of
whitish coatings made

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.900
out of and do they vary at all?

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.900
Are they the same across
the whole flow?

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.460
If they vary, how do they vary?

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.760
How do they change?

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.420
And why? We looked at this area,
this -- it's called a solfatara,

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.280
a site of hydrothermal alterations.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.890
So if there's any heat
that's sort of left

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:46.290
over from this continuous volcanic
activity it can alter the rock

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.270
and change the composition
and the texture.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.050
We also looked at flow
morphology and emplacement.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.620 position:56%
I love this image taken with a kite.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.070
And this is actually, this
little dot right here of sort

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:59.860 position:56%
of lighter material, is actually the
flow that's underneath the December

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.380
1974 flow.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.240
So it shows you how
shallow this flow is.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.180
It actually flowed in and around
the preexisting topography,

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.940 position:56%
and you can still see islands there.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.530
And we see this all over
the Martian surface as well.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.430
So these instruments are
helping us to understand --

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:17.020
these are how the -- this is how
these processes work on our planet

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.150
to understand how they're probably
working on the Martian surface.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.010
But like I said, there are
operational considerations

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:25.790
of using these instruments.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.990
Going back to the Desert RATS
example, like I said earlier,

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.130
while increased science
value is important,

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.250
what effects is actually
using these instruments

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.160
on EVA have on your timeline?

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.570
So the RIS4E experiment is actually
building off these desert rock

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.260
timelines understand
how this might work.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.360
So, again, just a quick example.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.530
Again, you just have one
more scientific plot to get

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.940
out of the way and
then we can move on.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.960
Here's a geologic map, like I
said, of the Desert RATS test area.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.510
Each one of these black
dots represents a place

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.200
where I conducted an EVA
and picked up a sample.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.810
So I didn't take -- these aren't
all the locations we visited

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:02.630 position:56%
but I just wanted to sort of isolate
the problem to show you example

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.090 position:56%
of how these instruments might work.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.140
So all these places we drove
rover, we got out of the rover,

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.400
we picked up a rock, and put it on
the rover to take back to Earth.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.460
So you can see that this flow
right here, this is a really,

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.670 position:56%
really young lava flow, relatively
young, and it looks really different

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:18.970
from everything else around it.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.270
It's a lot darker.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.570
It outcrops differently.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.360
It's bigger and forms these
sort of like big cliff faces.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.600
It's really dark in color.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.900
So you can tell that when
you're a geologist astronaut

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.130
on the ground this is
different than anything else.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.960
However, the samples around that
flow look pretty homogenous.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.890
It was kind of hard when you're
on an EVA with limited time,

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:40.670
and we were on the
ground for 25 minutes.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.140
There's just not a lot of time
to stop and think and look

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.440
at the rock in front of you.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.740
If you had infinite time

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.360
in this area you're probably
sitting in pretty good shape.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.180
But for us we just
didn't have a lot of time.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.860
So what do we need to maximize
that amount of time and tell us

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.210
about the volcanic
history of this region.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.270
So the samples around
this younger flow, as crew

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.460
and the other crews said the same
thing, they weren't really able

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.040
to identify any differences
in these rocks just

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.340
in the limited time you had.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.910
And then once you got back into
the rover you lose your access,

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.520
you can't see the rocks
anymore, right.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.510
So even if you saw a rock two days
later they are like, you know,

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:15.050
this could be similar to
what I saw the other day,

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.140
you can't go back and look, right.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.400
So I went and I took all these
samples that we collected

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.840
on our traverse and ran them

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.260
through with this x-ray
fluorescent spectrometer

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.890
that gives you chemistry.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.950
So, again, I don't need to dwell
on the plots here, but suffice it

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.590
to say that the samples
actually cluster themselves

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.890
into three distinct groups.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:35.210
And when you go back and
plot them on the map, hey,

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.110
you're able to [inaudible]
three distinct flows.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.610
So you have one flow that flows
over to the west of SP flow,

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.910
which is this darker flow.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:45.300
And then you have a younger one
that comes off to the east here.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.940
And so this is something that
we were not able to identify

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.930
in the field just because of the
limited amount of time we had.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:54.090
But this instrument gave us the
ability to see those differences.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.170
And if we had known that
in the field, who knows,

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.250
it might have altered what we
wanted to do with the traverse.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.260
We might've spent more time looking
for more samples from this flow

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.880
because we only ended
up getting two of them.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.060
So it might've altered
what we did real-time.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.640
And the hit, the operational hit
to that, every time I decided

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.290
to take an analysis with this
instrument it's a two minute hit.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:16.040
It's a 60 second analysis time plus
whatever documentation, pictures,

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.640
I need to do to make sure I
remember where this data came from.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.180
So this just helps you understand,
you know, every time you decide

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.000
to use an instrument, and this is
actually one of the lower cost hits

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.300
of an instrument that we use.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.970
Some of these instruments can
take an hour and a half to deploy.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.350
So you need to understand how much
science value you get from one

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.990
of these instruments based
on the hit to your timeline.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.860
And two minutes, you're
sitting there being like,

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.640 position:56%
she's crazy, two minutes is nothing.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.990
When you're in an EVA suit
and you have, for example,

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:44.010
eight hours to explore this
big area, two minutes can --

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.920
they really start to add up.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.460
And the other operational
consideration is

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.810
that if you're an astronaut
in a pressurized spacesuit

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:52.140
and you're trying to hold a
spectrometer up to a rock,

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.390
that has to maintain constant
contact with the service

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.800
of the rock, and you're tired,
you also want to look around.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.100
You're on Mars.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.400
You want to see what's around.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.110
And you're moving your body
when you're doing this.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:04.890
So 60 seconds is a long time to
-- for me to go up to an astronaut

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.450
and say, can you just
hold still for 60 seconds.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.260
So there's a lot at play here.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.980
There's a lot operationally at
play that we need to understand.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.060
So just to sort of sum up
the instrument section.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.120
We know that field portable
instruments are highly beneficial

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.750
in both sample high grading,
figuring out what samples you want

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:25.500
to bring back to Earth, and
gaining this real-time insight.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.690
Selecting an instrument
suite is nontrivial.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:28.990
What instruments do
you want to bring?

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.450
I mean, you have this whole host
of instruments available to you.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:32.750
What's your priority?

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.080 position:56%
What information do you really,
really need and what are you willing

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.780
to sacrifice to get
that information?

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.400
But selecting this valuable
instrument suite should be a

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.350
priority regardless
of target destination.

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.290
And whatever destination
we end up going to,

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:48.350
you want to tailor your instrument
suite specifically toward

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:50.060
that landing site area.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.360
And we're still working

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.110 position:56%
to investigate how we'll effectively
integrate these instruments

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.880
into future EVA's, but we
need to continue to test

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.150
in these relevant analog
environments.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.070
What's also important
to continue to develop,

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.070
and this is the last
short little section,

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.140
is we need to train the
people who are going

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.010
to be holding these
in their hands, right.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.650
This is not the answer
to science, right.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:10.950
You're not ever going to say --

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:12.810
you're not ever going to have
an instrument that flashes green

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.640 position:56%
for yes, you should return a sample,
or red for no, you shouldn't.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.130
You need to have a crew that
understands how to use them,

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.190
understands the data, and geology.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.480
So we're working on
training the astronauts

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.620
who will eventually be flying
some of these missions,

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.290
and that started back
in the Apollo days.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:30.530
We say that the Apollo
astronauts had the equivalent

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.270
of a Master's degree in geology
by the time they flew to the moon.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.030
They had hundreds and hundreds
of hours of geology training.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.330
They went out on the field.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:38.630
They were in the classroom.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.510
They worked with the
geology traverse planners

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.220
to understand their
specific landing site to know

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.990
about the geology they
were going to see.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.270
And we certainly want to do the
same thing with today's astronauts.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.780
So what we do, we sort of
gear our astronaut training

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.280
in three specific areas.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.540
We have astronaut candidate
training.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.890
So there's a class astronauts being
selected right now as we speak.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.230
They'll report to the Johnson
Space Center next summer

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.420
and will start astronaut
candidate training.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.240
So for two years they're getting
all the training they need to know

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.930
to be a certified astronaut
to fly in space.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.840
And one of the modules that we --
that we train them on is geology.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.300
So we go to the classroom.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.750
This is a classroom at Johnson
Space Center where he taught them

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.310
about chemistry, mineralogy.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.230
We took them to the
Apollo Lunar Lab.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:24.590
We took them to the other curation
labs at on Johnson Space Center.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.950
Then we take them in the field.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:27.840
We teach them how to geologic map.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.530
We take them to a place
in New Mexico

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.490
where astronauts have been going
ever since the Apollo days.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:34.950
Once they graduate from
astronaut candidacy

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.140
and they're now a certified
astronaut that's assignable

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.130 position:56%
to flight, we still -- we don't
stop geology training at that point.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:44.140 position:56%
So like I said, I just got back
this weekend from a trip to Arizona.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.600
We had Don Pettit out with us
to swing a big hammer and look

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.900
at the seismic structure
of this volcanic field.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.010
So we'll embed astronauts from
the office that aren't assigned

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.870
to a mission yet within our teams

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:58.240
to teach them how we actually do
geology real-time in the field.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.760
And for, you know, RIS4E campaigns
that I help coordinate, they are --

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.140
they are part of the
planning process.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.800
They help us refine our simulated
EVA plans before even get

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.100
to the field site.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.370
And we also can have them be
crewmembers on these analog tests.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.300
So this is Kjell Lindgren back
in the 2011 Desert RATS mission,

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.600
and he later flew to Space
Station for six months.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.960
So we had him out as a crew
member in RATS embedded

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.100
in our science team as well.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.960
So what do we get when we
train astronauts how to --

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.740
how to do geology and how
to be interested in geology?

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.040
We get pictures like this.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.600
This is a picture of an
erupting volcano in Russia taken

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.460
from the International
Space Station.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.390
And it's eruptions like this that
-- this is on a remote island chain

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.530 position:56%
in the Pacific Ocean, we would not
have known this volcano was erupting

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.490
if an astronaut hadn't seen it
from International Space Station

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.640
and said, wait a minute,
there's -- what's that?

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.540 position:56%
And called down to Houston and we --

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.490
because of the pictures that
they took they were ready

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.470 position:56%
for the next orbit when they came
back around, they took this picture.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.570
And scientists are able to infer
a lot about the eruption dynamics

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.080
of a specific volcano
with pictures like this.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.220
And it's because we
get them excited.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.010
We get them familiar
with Earth's geography,

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.340
and what volcanic features
are in which part of the world

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.160
so that they are able to identify
active surface processes like this.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.140
And it's images like this that I

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.020
like to think really
get the public excited

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.620
about science and excited
about space.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.600
So when we think about this sort
of integrated testing approach

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.100
from the analogs, down to
the instrument development,

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.540
down to make sure the crew
is trained to conduct science

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.700
and [inaudible] on other
planetary surfaces,

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.100 position:56%
all leading us toward an exploration
mission, there are public benefits

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.800
as well, not just to the
scientific community at large.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.020
And, you know, a perfect
example of this is, you know,

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.040
the Apollo 11 mission, which was
the first time we landed a person

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.340
on the surface of the moon.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.290
Here's thousands of people watching
in Central Park in New York,

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.040
the parade when they
got back, the excitement

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.340
of watching a landing on TV.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.860
And if you talk to anyone

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.650 position:56%
who remembers 1969 I can guarantee
they'll know exactly where they were

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.000
when somebody landed on the moon.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.990
And it really incites a lot of
public excitement to be able

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.260
to do -- to do things like this.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:02.850
So another example is just from
October 17, from earlier this week,

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.280
we orbital launched
a Cygnus resupply

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.310
to the International Space Station.

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.630
So here's the picture from
the Wallops Flight Facility

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:10.930
out in Maryland.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:12.900
Here's a picture I
took with my iPhone

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.170
from the balcony of my building.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:18.080
And I -- you know, I was -- I was
running really late for the launch.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.790
I was really nervous I
was going to miss it.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.010
I was sort in my pajamas
because I didn't expect there

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.500
to be anybody else out there,
and I ran up to the roof

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.670
and there was a ton of people
up there watching the launch.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:28.970
It was amazing.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:31.790
And so just, you know,
people are excited about it.

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:35.890 position:56%
And I was ashamed that I was shocked
that there were so many people

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:37.190
up there watching the launch.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:40.140 position:56%
And, you know, we opened the door to
the roof and we could hear the audio

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.420
from NASA TV, because everybody
had it up on their phones.

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.720
So people are excited.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.940
And this is -- this is a
resupply going to the station.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.730
I think it's docking with
the station this weekend.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.900
And it's giving them,
you know, what they need

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.970
to continue their science
experiments on ISS.

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:55.990
So there's public excitement,
and even more so with all

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:59.390
of the SpaceX announcements about
Elon Musk and SpaceX going to Mars.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.770
So here's a graphic
of the Dragon capsule

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.060
that Elon wants to
send to Mars in 2018.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.600
So a lot of these private companies
have also helped incite public

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.390
excitement about all of these types

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.090
of exciting exploration
opportunities.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:15.250
So I think -- I'm excited about it.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.880
I think the public
is excited about it.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.020
And it's an exciting
time to work for NASA.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.210
So for that I'll take questions.

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.010
&gt;&gt; I'm excited, too.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:27.040
[ Applause ]

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.730
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I
think we're all excited,

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:30.150
and what a fun job you have.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.620
I'm so glad that you
could come and talk to us.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.090
I want to mention that
our last lecture

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.950
of the year is the Lunar
Reconnaissance Observer,

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:39.570
so you can hear more about that.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.980
And maybe next year
we'll do NEEMO or some

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.150
of these other missions
that we've talked about.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.930
So, yes, we'll have questions,
and we ask you to repeat them

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.520
so everyone can hear the question.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.800
&gt;&gt; I was wonder how the nursery
was doing one year later.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.110
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah, how the
nursery is doing a year later?

00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:00.300 position:56%
So we actually only constructed the
nurseries in late July of this year.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.610
So they've only been up
for about three months.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.570
And they're going down,
so I actually was a member

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.000
of the science team
for NEEMO so I worked

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.480
with the coral scientists
who built the nurseries.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.150
And I got my hands on
building these little cards

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.710
that you sink underwater.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.160
Coral is sharp by the way.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.310
So they actually go down every
three months to check on them.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:21.740
So they went down there about
a month ago and they were --

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.150
they were thriving and doing great.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:26.940 position:56%
So what they're interested in
looking at is some species do better

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.240
than others at certain depths.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.670 position:56%
So they'll go down there and
they'll sort of note down which seem

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:33.380
to be thriving, which
seem to be struggling,

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.570
and that's the science lesson
learned moving forward.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.870
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:41.250
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Going
on easy on me.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:42.550
Yeah?

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.470
&gt;&gt; So part of the goal for the
private industry is mineral wealth.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:50.600
Do we know anything about what's
on Mars that could be sold here?

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.940
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah,
so like what's valuable

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.900 position:56%
on Mars essentially and how to tell?

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.070
So a lot of the private companies
aren't really focusing on Mars

00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:59.700
for mining, they're
focusing on asteroids.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.820
So they're looking at, you
know, trace elements that are

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.570
in really high abundances
on specific small bodies.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.360
On Mars we're focusing more on
In-Situ resource utilization.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.800
So what's there that
humans can capitalize

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.090
on to help them survive there
for long periods of time,

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.390
and even to sort of like
start to manufacture fuel

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:17.780
to launch back off the
surface and go back to Earth.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:21.640
So from a mining standpoint Mars
isn't as popular of a target,

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.280
especially because there are
planetary protection constraints

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.580
to worry about, too.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.990
So we think there could have
once been, or might currently be,

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.690
life on Mars, and so the
Planetary Protection Office

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:32.850
at NASA headquarters down the
street is pretty stringent

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.930
about what's even going to
be possible in that respect.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:38.510
So with Mars specifically,
we're focused on capitalizing

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.510
on the resources there
to help humans survive,

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.090
not as much about mining.

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:43.870
But there certainly
are private companies

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:47.230
who are really excited
mining small bodies.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:52.160
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I think
you were too comprehensive.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.740
I wanted to ask, what
did I want to ask?

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.310
These people who were
in the training,

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.930
are they going to be
going to the moon?

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:04.030
I mean, they might -- we might not
be going to Mars in time for them?

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.530
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: So the
current NASA plan has humans

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.430
to Mars in the 2030's.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:10.770
So some of the astronauts who
are currently in the office

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.880
and that are being selected right
now could potentially be the people

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.140
who are going to Mars
if the plan holds.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.790
Was there one in the
back, over there?

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.590
Yeah.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:25.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.770
It just takes a long time for
that signal to get back and forth.

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.930
And to boost it faster
you need a lot more power,

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:33.060
a lot more bandwidth available on
the orbiters in orbit around Mars.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.880
So just all of the
dynamics involved,

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.560
and the engineering involved
at the orbiter end, mean --

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.000
make it so that there's quite an
extensive communications delay.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.300
Yeah?

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.600
&gt;&gt; This might be a
linguists questions,

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.700
but is it still called geology?

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.860
Shouldn't it be [inaudible]
something?

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.160
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: No, I like that.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.300
Should it still be called geology
instead of [inaudible] something?

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.880
So like for [inaudible] are
essentially things that are

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.430
from far away that are there that
you're wondering how they got there

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:00.730
and what -- and why they're there?

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:03.540
So, for example, [inaudible] from
the Earth's mantle get brought

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.510
up to the Earth's surface and --

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:08.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:12.510
Yeah, I mean astrobiology is the
common word, or astrogeology.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:16.380
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.720
Yeah, true, true, true.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.900
&gt;&gt; What about the Chinese?

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.710
How are they doing?

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah, so China just
had a big launch earlier this week

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.740
to go to their space station.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.600
Yeah, so we don't know a lot
about their sort of long-term plan

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.760
to get humans beyond
low Earth orbit.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.410
We know there is one, but there's
not a lot that's really, you know,

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:44.640
we don't work pretty closely
with the Chinese like we do

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.940
with other space agencies.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.480
So they are definitely -- they are
definitely hoping to put humans

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:54.000
on the lunar surface sometime very
soon in the next couple years.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.710
And this launch, I think,
proves that for sure.

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.100
It was really exciting,
a great launch.

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.400
Yeah?

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:04.460
&gt;&gt; Up to now the probes that
have landed on Mars have tended

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:08.450
to avoid the volcanic
regions of Mars.

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:10.150
Now you've been going

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:15.440
to San Francisco mountains
[inaudible] is there any plan --

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:21.160
are there any plans to
send a probe, a lander,

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.950
to one of the volcanic regions
of Mars, especially maybe to look

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:28.200 position:56%
at possible lava tubes and the like?

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.610
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah, a couple --
a couple point about that question.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:32.910
Great question.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.010
So, you know, we -- his
question was, we've been going

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:38.200
to volcanic areas on Earth, but
most of the landers and rovers

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.340
on Mars have gone to
non-volcanic areas.

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.700
So how do you sort of
remedy that divide?

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.100
So we actually do see a
lot of volcanic material

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.870
with the Mars landers and rovers.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.430
There's volcanic material
pretty much distributed

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.740
over the entire Martian surface.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.810
So it's sort of hard to get
there and not see something

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:54.110
that was eventually -- you know,

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.960
at some point derived
from a volcanic event.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.900
But, and also, sort of I
focused for the talk today

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.570
on volcanic environments, but I've
also done a lot of field work,

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:04.170
and there are a lot of people
doing fieldwork and other terrains

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:08.430
that we, you know, train
and shape by processes

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:09.730
like what we see on our planet.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:12.350
Like impact craters, fluvial areas.

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:15.200
So there -- I focused today
on volcanic environments,

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.730
but there's a lot of other
work going on to fieldwork

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.260
in other relevant terrains.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.000
But in terms of sending something

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.780
to a more volcanically dominated
terrain on Mars, some of them --

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.090
you know, some of the really big
volcanoes are pretty challenging

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:30.690
logistically to work in,
Olympus Mons for example.

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:33.770
It would really be challenging
from an engineering standpoint

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:36.010
to get a rover or lander there,

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.560
but it's certainly a
high-interest target certainly

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.370
for future Mars exploration.

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:44.510
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Is that everybody?

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:45.830
I guess we can conclude then.

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.130
Thank you so much.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:49.080
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Thanks [applause].

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.780

of the Library of Congress.
