00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.140
Welcome back guys I am Nate with the King of Random

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.680
We recently made a video with a gummy heart and today

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.040
We're gonna try and make one more fun

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.080
Halloween treat

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.440
Grant made these two silicone molds off of actual brains and in previous videos has made a zombie brain using green and purple versions of his

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.240
gummy candy

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.010
today We're going to try and make a new kind of zombie brain using some green and white chocolate and some watermelon flavored gummy candy

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.750
We're going to try to have a few different layers the outside layer will be green so the whole thing will look like a zombie

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.229
Brain old and molding and gross after the green layer

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.640
We'll have a white layer of chocolate and then our watermelon flavored and colored gummy candy

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.940
Hopefully that means that when we crack open our zombie brain. We'll have nice slices of candy watermelon as a fun little bonus

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.680
We've got these little licorice pieces

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.799
And we're gonna cut them up to be used as watermelon seeds

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.819
The first step is to melt our green chocolate and coat the inside of our brain molds

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.549
All right, we've got a bag of chocolate

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.419
That's been microwaved and is nice and liquid feeling so I'm just gonna cut off the corner

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.229
Squirt it into the mold and then rotate the mold around to try and get a nice even coating

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.940
So the difficulty I'm running into is that while the chocolate does get considerably more liquid than when it starts

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.239
It doesn't exactly end up running so trying to get it to flow around

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.719
Evenly inside all the crevices of the mold is a little bit tricky

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.910
Putting a little bit of chocolate right on my finger and spreading it around to a couple spots that I see some gaps

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.049
Just to try and get a little bit of coverage, I think it's actually working pretty well, though

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.780
That stuff gets you messy almost immediately, but I'm liking the color it's good for both watermelon rind and zombie brains

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.120
Our green chocolate has started to cool, so let's move on to the white chocolate

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.250
White chocolate seems to be a little runnier than the green chocolate was so yeah, it's definitely flowing better

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.510
Maybe all that green dye kind of solidifies it or something. I don't know

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.210
The heat from the white chocolate. I think has melted a little bit of the green chocolate with it

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.340
You can see it's got some green in it as it pours out

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.829
I think that means it'll just be bonded together really well

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.760
Yeah

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.249
That looks really a lot better coated this time than it did the first time so I don't think I have to go and spread

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.250
Any in there, I think it's nice and evenly done

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600
Alright now for the next one

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.079
This isn't as entertaining as I'm making it look

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.519
Unless you really like shaking chocolate in this case

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520
This is more entertaining than I'm making it look

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.709
Pour out the extra same thing little bits of green coming out with it heat from the white chocolate melted some of the green chocolate

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.450
That's good there

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.560
You have it the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.589
green chocolate and the white chocolate are both poured into the molds and separate layers now

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.649
We just have to let those cool down a little bit before we add our gummy mixture

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.170
And it's just got swirls of green and white chocolate

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.490
I'll take these two molds and pop them in the freezer for about 10 minutes

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.740
Which is about how long it takes to make our gummy mixture?

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.179
Our chocolate in the mold is cooling off in the freezer and while it is. Let's start mixing up our gummy mixture

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.849
We'll start with two cups of cold water and one cup of corn syrup

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.949
Stir the corn syrup until it's evenly dissolved into the water with our corn syrup

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.310
Evenly mixed in will add eight packets of gelatin and four boxes of jell-o

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.760
Now our gelatin is mixed in let's throw our pot on the stove

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.419
We'll let this heat up for about 10 minutes stirring it every minute or two

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.789
Our gummy mixture has started to cool down just a little bit

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.028
So I'm going to pull the bubbles off of the surface of it, so we have a nice clean cast

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.289
Let's grab the brain molds out of the freezer and start pouring in our gummy mixture

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:04.919
What I'm going to try and do is pour our gummy mixture into the molds

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.498
Let it cool down for a minute and then pour it back out

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:11.428
I'm hoping this will help form a layer of the gummy mix on the inside of the chocolate

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:17.339
Then I'm going to use our black licorice seeds mix that into the rest of the gummy mixture and pour it back in my goal

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:22.199
Is for the black licorice seeds to stay evenly suspended in the gummy mixture and not just all fall to the bottom

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.800
Now we just gotta wait for a few minutes

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.689
Our molds have had a few minutes to cool down and hopefully form a nice layer of gummy candy on the inside of the chocolate

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.160
I'm going to pour out what's left of the gummy candy, mix in our watermelon seeds and pour it back in

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.919
Got a little bit of chocolate going out with that

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.939
I hope it hasn't melted our chocolate layer too much after all this is an experiment

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.200
I haven't done it before it doesn't look like it's formed much of a layer in there

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.809
So it might have been too warm when I poured it in

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.369
We'll see. I'm gonna give it just a little bit more time to cool down and thicken up

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.789
Hopefully our watermelon seeds will stay suspended in the middle of it

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.350
For at least in the pot

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.570
It looks kind of like watermelon so that's something

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.399
It seemed like it was cooling off a little unevenly so I think parts of it are kind of lumpy now

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.440
I'm not sure how well this is going to go into the mold

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.380
It's working it's going in

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.860
Kind of

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.580
Go in, go in

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.660
Alright this I started to set a little bit too much

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.940
So I'm just gonna throw it on the stove on really low heat to get it a little bit softer and then pour it back in

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.360
Trying to get it at just the right stage so that things stay suspended in the middle of it

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.080
But you can still pour it is pretty tricky

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.440
I'm trying to keep this stirring around as it cools off a little bit, so it won't get so clumpy like it did before

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.689
All right, I've been stirring this as it cools down and you can see it's turned very gelatinous

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.080
And the seeds are now

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.450
Suspended in it so before it cools down so much that it can't pour I'm gonna try and fill the molds

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.500
Man it's cooling really fast come on fill fill fill the mold

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.330
Okay that got pretty messy in there as you can see it's sticking to my hands. It's sticking to the mold

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.889
it's really tough to get a consistency that both suspends the watermelon seed pieces and

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.629
Can still pour into the mold and it goes from one to the other in just a matter of seconds

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.130
I do think I got most of the mold full and I also have a hope that all of the mixing around

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.469
Added some bubbles into it which will give it sort of more of the look and texture of the inside of watermelon

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.810
So here's hoping that worked in our favor now

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.349
We just need to let these cool for a while then we can take them out of the mold and check our result

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.560
Our zombie brains have now had a chance to cool down completely so it's time to de-mold them and see how they turned out

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.670
It's starting to peel this away

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:29.300
Brain molds are surprisingly complicated like there's a lot of different ins and outs of them

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.049
So I don't want it to grip too much onto the candy

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.600
Think everything else that we've molded in this brain mold was actually like flexible and gummy

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:43.699
So this might be the most rigid piece that we've ever tried to take out of it. It's a little tricky

00:08:48.749 --> 00:08:51.829
We're gonna have a couple small bits of silicone

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.249
left over stuck in the cracks, but that

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.610
That is one gross looking zombie brain

00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:04.188
On and then we got like the watermelon colored brain stem coming out over here

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:12.768
Brainy. okay, let's try and get our second brain out too

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:16.849
ooh. Chocolate is cracking on this one

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.479
Few IQ points down every time something breaks off

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:27.889
Zombie might not be very bright. Yeah, that's really sticking to the silicone in places apparently I should not be a brain surgeon I

00:09:28.589 --> 00:09:30.589
Think his insurance is gonna cover this

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:35.928
Well there's part of it

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:43.459
Yeah, this is like after the zombie got hit in the head with a shotgun or something

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:48.139
I Don't know the apocalypse was not kind to this one there you have it

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:51.169
There's our two separate brains the first one came out pretty well

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:54.739
You can see some of the gummy down at the bottom the second one for some reason

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:59.928
The gummy wasn't stuck very well to the chocolate and the chocolate was stuck really well to the silicone

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:02.628
So it kind of broke into more pieces when it came out

00:10:02.629 --> 00:10:08.089
I still have one main largest piece, but a lot of the exterior brain didn't survive the operation

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:13.279
Well this brain is already cracked so I say let's cut it down in half and see if we've got that

00:10:13.439 --> 00:10:15.439
watermelon look we were hoping for

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:25.909
There you go, there is our watermelon chocolate brain

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.989
Someplace this is weird like it's oh my gosh the whole thing. I think you're just gonna slide right out

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.580
That's gross that kind of reminds me of a hermit crab coming out of its shell

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:43.070
Look at this letting it cool off for a while might have messed with it pouring, but like you can see the seeds

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.609
Suspended in the watermelon gummy, and that worked pretty well

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:51.380
And I said that I hope that the air would actually make it look more like watermelon. I think that worked too

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.000
there it is oh

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.860
man and somehow we got

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.860
Green, then white then green again. I don't know how that happened. I'm trying to go pretty slow

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.860
Cause I don't want to crack the chocolate

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.220
Well I cracked a little bit on that side and on that side, let's just cut down through see what we get

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.540
Well there we go look at that

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.920
That is beautiful look at that watermelon look

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:29.089
Got the green. You got the white you got the fruit and you got the seeds all suspended in there. I turned out wonderful

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.409
There we go two candy zombie brains that are watermelon on the inside

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.920
We've got layers of green and white then watermelon with seeds in it

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.670
I think this turned out pretty great if you want you can just take the whole green brains put them on display

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.260
And make a great Halloween decoration then when it's time to eat you can crack them open. You've got white chocolate

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.539
You've got the watermelon if you like black licorice

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.120
You can eat the seeds as well this has been a great project

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.940
And I'm really happy with the result we got thanks for joining us for this video

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.940
And I look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.420
That just shatters right off, and then you just have like smooshed zombie brains

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.180
brains

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.250
Here's our brain

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.060
Now it's a watermelon brain

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.200
Watermelon and white chocolate not bad also zombie brains not bad
