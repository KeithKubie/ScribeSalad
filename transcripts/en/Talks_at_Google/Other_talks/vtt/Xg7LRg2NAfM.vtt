00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.800
MALE SPEAKER: He's the
writer and sole custodian

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.590
of the popular blog
ListsOfNote.com.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.710
And he spent a lot
of time hunting

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.100
down letters that people
have written over the years,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.820
back when people wrote letters.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.520
Some people here
remember that at least.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.210
I won't embarrass anyone.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.420
So last night, he comes from
an event in Southern California

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.332
with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, BJ
Novak, Dave Eggers, and Thandie

00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:28.290
Newton, who were reading
some of these letters.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.460
This was a charity event.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.670
And Sean lives in
Manchester, England,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.130
with his wife and children.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.058
So let's give a warm
welcome to Shaun Usher.

00:00:37.058 --> 00:00:40.962
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.430
So, Shaun, do you want to talk
about the event last night?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.640
SHAUN USHER: Yeah, so this
is Letters Live, which

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.240
is a series of live events that
started when Letters of Note

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.340
first came out in the UK.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.270
It's crazy.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.290
So just famous people, these
really talented performers,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.530
musicians, authors,
they get up on stage,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.930
and they read out letters
from this book, as some of you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.340
are about to do, I think.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.750
And we've done about
12 of them in the UK.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.490
And we've had people
like Benedict Cumberbatch

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.630
and Gillian Anderson, Nick Cave,
just these incredible people

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.189
just bringing these
letters to life.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.230
And it's just been the
most rewarding experience.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.045
So last night, we did the
first one outside of the UK

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:27.590
and in LA.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.020
JJ Abrams read a letter.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.250
Thandie Newton read a
couple, Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:36.380
And it's just the
most amazing night.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.546
And then I got really drunk.

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:39.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.670
And I'm feeling quite
rough at the minute.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.380
But it's great to be here.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.310
And this is just
the latest chapter

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.596
of this strange existence.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.909
MALE SPEAKER: So how did
you start doing this?

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.700
SHAUN USHER: I started
the website in 2009.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.100
But if we go back 13
years when I first

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.270
met the lady who is now my
wife, two weeks after we started

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.470
dating, she moved away
to Spain for a year

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.822
as part of a university
course, which

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:14.030
should be the worst possible
start to a relationship.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.000
But we decided to keep
in touch by letter.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.390
So we wrote to each
other for 10, 11 months,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.560
and we fell in love by
letter, really sickening.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.930
But it was the best possible
start we could have had.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.220
MALE SPEAKER: So none of
those letters are in the book,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.804
though, right?

00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:30.011
SHAUN USHER: I would never
publish those letters, no.

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:30.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.370
They're terrible.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.110
But we learned so
much about each other,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.110
far more than we would
have learned had we

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.830
been face to face, or
particularly communicating

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.262
by email or text message.

00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:43.470
Because when you sit down
to write a letter, at least

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.560
with me and my wife
it's certainly the case,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.700
you're far more willing
to be honest and open.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.116
You'd say things
that you wouldn't

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:52.690
say in any other setting.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.940
So by the end of that 10
months, we were best friends.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.150
We'd fallen in love.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.290
We were set up for life.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.260
So that's when I was
bitten by the bug.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.380
And I knew that I was going
to look into letter writing

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.730
as an art form at some point.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.477
And then 2009 I
started the website,

00:03:11.477 --> 00:03:13.310
and it just took off
really, really quickly,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.610
such a simple idea.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.161
The best ideas are.

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:18.285
I couldn't believe that no
one had done it already.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.480
And yeah, I didn't really make
much effort to market the blog

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.040
or push it out there.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.600
It did that by itself, thanks
to these amazing letters.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.630
And then 2013, the book came
out after three years of slog.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.990
Making a book like this
is a logistical nightmare,

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.930
because you have to get
so many permissions.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.642
It's something
like 300 permission

00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:42.600
we had to get for this.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.230
And a lot of these people
that wrote these letters

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.530
are now dead, so you have
to deal with their estates,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.270
and it's an absolute nightmare
getting decisions from people.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.060
So I was so, so
proud of this book.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.400
It's a beautiful thing.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.584
It's been translated
into 18 languages.

00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:01.000
The appeal of these
letters really

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.110
is universal and the
stories with them.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.410
And just today, I've signed off.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.910
We've just finished the second
"Letters of Note" book, which

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.690
will be out in the UK at the
end of this year and in the US--

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.401
I don't know when.

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.442
FEMALE SPEAKER: In April.

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:17.233
SHAUN USHER: April.

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:21.070
Thank you. [CHUCKLES]
So, yeah, my life

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.418
is dedicated to these letters.

00:04:23.418 --> 00:04:25.576
And I couldn't be happier.

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:26.950
MALE SPEAKER: So
it's interesting

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.500
that you were writing letters
even though the internet was

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.930
around then and people
could text or email.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.282
But what made you choose not to?

00:04:36.282 --> 00:04:37.490
SHAUN USHER: It was exciting.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.615
It was something different.

00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:41.670
At this point, and this was
2000 and-- I don't know.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.400
It was like 13 years ago.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.020
So people were
emailing, obviously,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.920
but not to the extent
that they are now.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.970
We weren't using Twitter.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.134
And just the idea of writing
letters to each other

00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:51.675
was romantic.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.060
So we just did,
and it was great.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.500
And also, when
you email someone,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.180
there's an expectation
that you're

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.289
going to reply within a
couple of days at the most.

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.080
If you don't reply
within a couple of days,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.970
you're deemed rude.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.665
But with a letter, you
can take anything up

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:14.560
to like a few weeks to reply,
and it's seemed acceptable.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.100
And during those two weeks,
you can really, really

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.430
consider what
you're writing down.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.310
It's a far more considered
form of correspondence.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.340
And it brings out the best
in people and the worst.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.430
MALE SPEAKER: Do you
find that other people

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.760
are willing to do
that as well nowadays?

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.010
SHAUN USHER: To write letters?

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.260
MALE SPEAKER: To
write letters, yeah.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.570
SHAUN USHER: Well, I'm
probably not the best person

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.090
to ask, because I just speak
to people who love letters.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.230
But since the blog started
and the book came out,

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.485
I'm contacted by loads of
people who love letter writing.

00:05:47.485 --> 00:05:50.580
And this has kind of reignited
a passion they once had.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.480
And I get contacted by loads of
teachers saying that they use

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.069
this book as a
teaching aid in school

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:57.860
either to teach about
letter writing itself

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.420
or to teach about
historical moments

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.980
that we wouldn't know about
were it not for these letters.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.050
Reading letters
by someone who was

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.040
in the midst of these
historical events is,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.150
I think, the most enjoyable
way to learn about history

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.820
from the front seat.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.550
MALE SPEAKER:
Which are your-- we

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.512
have five people, counting me,
who are going to read letters.

00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:22.220
Did you want to bring
them up, or did you

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.554
want to talk about some
of your favorites first?

00:06:24.554 --> 00:06:25.470
SHAUN USHER: I'm easy.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.840
Should I read one out?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.866
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:29.740
SHAUN USHER: This is
the one I always choose.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.410
It's a bit boring,
really, but this

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.660
is one of my favorite letters.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.860
MALE SPEAKER: "I Like
Words," is that the one?

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.240
SHAUN USHER: It's
"I Like Words."

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.739
Should I read a
different one, then?

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:38.569
MALE SPEAKER: No, that's good.

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.360
SHAUN USHER: It's a
job application letter.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.232
This was 1934.

00:06:41.232 --> 00:06:42.690
There's a guy called
Robert Pirosh.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.710
He was a copywriter.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.230
When I first started Letters
of Note, I was a copywriter.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.605
So I think that
kind of-- there's

00:06:48.605 --> 00:06:50.700
a parallel there
that attracts me.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.620
So 1934, he wanted to
become a screenwriter.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.830
So he wrote this standard
form job application letter

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.130
and sent it to all the
movie studios and directors

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.870
he could find addresses for.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.790
And this got him a job with MGM.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.710
And he went on to
an Academy Award.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.780
It's the perfect story.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.460
And standard form job
application letters

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.050
aren't an easy letter to
make sexy, but he's done it.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.650
And it was so successful.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.910
It's quite compact.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.040
"Dear Sir, I like words.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.360
I like fat, buttery
words, such as ooze,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.665
turpitude, gluttonous, toady.

00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:29.780
I like solemn,
angular, creaky words,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.390
such as straight-laced,
cantankerous, pecunious,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.720
valedictory.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.680
I like spurious, black-is-white
words, such as mortician,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.380
liquidates,
tonsorial, demimonde.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.140
I like suave, V-words,
such as Svengali,

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.580
svelte, bravura, verve.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.080
I like crunchy, brittle,
crackly words, such as splinter,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.390
grapple, jostle, crusty.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.500
I like sullen,
crab-scowling words,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.080
such as skulk,
glower, scabby, churl.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.490
I like, oh-heavens,
my-gracious, land's-sake words,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.190
such as trixie, tucker,
gentile, horrid.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.200
I like elegant, flowery
words, such as estivates,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.080
peregrinates, elysium, halcyon.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.980
I like wormy, squirmy, mealy
words, such as crawl, blubber,

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.610
squeal, drip.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.800
I like sniggly, chuckling
words, such as cowlick,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.350
gurgle, bubble, and burp.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.020
I like the word screenwriter
better than copywriter,

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.802
so I decided to quit my
job in a New York ad agency

00:08:25.802 --> 00:08:27.010
and try my luck in Hollywood.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.020
But before taking the
plunge, I went to Europe

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.340
for a year of study,
contemplation,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.600
and horsing around.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.140
I've just returned,
and I still like words.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.039
May I have a few with you?

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.900
Robert Pirosh."

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.390
It's the perfect letter.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.470
I absolutely adore it.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.440
MALE SPEAKER: He got quite a
few responses to that, right?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.980
SHAUN USHER: He did, yeah.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.105
He got quite a few interviews
at different studios,

00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:49.290
and he took a job with MGM.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.580
And the rest is history.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.780
I found that letter
in a really old book

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.200
that hardly anyone read.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.010
So it was published
in 1970-something.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.180
So yeah, quite a find.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.510
MALE SPEAKER: How
about our readers?

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:04.947
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:05.384
SHAUN USHER: Hi.

00:09:05.384 --> 00:09:06.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm Kate.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.321
SHAUN USHER: So I was contacted
in 2011, I think it was,

00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:13.320
by a lady who said, I've
got this amazing letter

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.350
written by Iggy Pop.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.940
Do you want to see it?

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.856
An I'd seen a couple of
Iggy's letters before,

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.570
and they were great
but nothing special.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.530
So she sent it to me and said
that, when I was a teenager,

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.210
I was having a terrible time.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.490
My parents were splitting up.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.680
We had bailiffs on the door.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.940
I was really depressed.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.180
I was near the end.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.310
And at the time, Iggy
Pop on one of his albums

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.070
had printed his
address on the inlay

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.942
of this album for some
strange reason and said,

00:09:41.942 --> 00:09:43.650
if you want to get in
touch, write to me,

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.716
and I'll try and
get back to you.

00:09:45.716 --> 00:09:48.090
So she wrote to him and said,
I'm having a terrible time.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.792
And he wrote this amazing,
really lovely letter back.

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: "Dear
Laurence, Thank you

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.540
for your gorgeous
and charming letter.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.310
You brighten up my dim life.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.340
I read the whole
fucking thing, dear.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.620
Of course I'd love to see
you in your black dress

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.260
and your white socks, too.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.670
But most of all, I want to
see you take a deep breath

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.470
and do whatever you must to
survive and find something

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.320
to be that you can love.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.070
You're obviously a bright
fucking chick with a big heart,

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.640
too.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.610
And I want to issue a belated
happy, happy, happy 21st b-day

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.350
and happy spirit.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.050
I was miserable and fighting
hard on my 21st b-day, too.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.840
People booed me on
the stage, and I

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.800
was staying in someone else's
house, and I was scared.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.320
It's been a long
road since then,

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.750
but pressure never
ends in this life.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.020
Perforation
problems, by the way,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.190
means to me also the holes
that will exist in any story

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.110
we try to make of our lives.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.580
So hang on, my love.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.420
Grow big and strong, and take
your hits and keep going.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.170
All my love to a really
beautiful girl-- that's you,

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.110
Laurence.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.734
Iggy Pop."

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:53.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:56.150
SHAUN USHER: Thank you.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.150
It's a lovely letter.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.150
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.751
Gloria.

00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:01.250
SHAUN USHER: And
you're doing the--?

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.249
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm doing
the letter about Elvis

00:11:03.249 --> 00:11:05.880
to President Eisenhower from
the teenagers in Montana.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.730
SHAUN USHER: Oh, that one, yeah.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.420
Yeah, brilliant.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:13.810
So when he was called
up for service, Elvis,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.260
the White House received
loads and loads of letters

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.470
from fans of Elvis
distraught that he was

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.430
about to be killed in battle.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.610
But this particular letters
is one of my favorites,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.860
because it's about something
slightly different.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.110
MALE SPEAKER: Not just killed.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.560
SHAUN USHER: Having
his head shaved, yeah.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: "Dear President
Eisenhower, My girlfriends

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.670
and I are writing all
the way from Montana.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.660
We think it's bad enough to
send Elvis Presley in the Army.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.210
But if you cut his sideburns
off, we will just die.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.765
You don't know how
we feel about him.

00:11:44.765 --> 00:11:47.390
I really don't see why you have
to send him to the Army of all,

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.840
but we beg you, please, please
don't give him a GI haircut.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.320
Oh, please, please don't.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.950
If you do, we will
just about die.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.260
Elvis Presley lovers,
Linda Kelly, Sherry Bane,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.740
Mickie Mattson.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.805
Presley, Presley is our
cry, P-R-E-S-L-E-Y."

00:12:05.805 --> 00:12:07.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.555
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.810
SHAUN USHER: Who's next?

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.930
Samuel Barber, is it?

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.750
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.282
This is-- Shaun?

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.740
SHAUN USHER: So
this Samuel Barber,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.670
one of the greatest
musicians, composers,

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.551
wrote this letter to his mum.

00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:29.800
Was it his mum or his parents?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.100
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.450
SHAUN USHER: It was
his mum, wasn't it?

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.830
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.730
At the age of 9.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.216
SHAUN USHER: Yeah,
at the age of 9.

00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:36.876
It was quite
heartbreaking, I think.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.890
MALE SPEAKER: "Notice to
Mother and nobody else.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.500
Dear Mother, I have written this
to tell you my worrying secret.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.670
Now, don't cry when
you read it, because it

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.340
is neither yours nor
my fault. I suppose

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.050
I will have to tell it
now without any nonsense.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.330
To begin with, I was not
meant to be an athlete.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.090
I was meant to be a composer
and will be, I'm sure.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.830
I'll ask you one more thing.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.850
Don't ask me to try to
forget this unpleasant thing

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.336
and go play football, please.

00:13:08.336 --> 00:13:09.960
Sometimes I've been
worrying about this

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.770
so much that it makes
me mad-- not very.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.246
Love, Sam Barber II."

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:21.847
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:23.680
MALE SPEAKER: The
question is, would he have

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.362
been a good football player?

00:13:26.362 --> 00:13:28.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.880
SHAUN USHER: That was in the
book of his letters, I think.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.150
There's a collection
of his letters, yeah.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.860
So this was written by Elvis.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.630
It was strange.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.150
Well, his whole
life was strange,

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.180
but this was a particularly
stressful time in his life.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.767
Elvis Presley used to
collect police badges,

00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:50.100
and he wanted a police badge
from every different police

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.990
force in the US.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.850
And the one badge
he couldn't get

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.682
was a badge from the FBI's
department of-- oh, my God,

00:13:59.682 --> 00:14:00.390
what's it called?

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.854
The Narcotics--

00:14:02.854 --> 00:14:04.270
MALE SPEAKER:
Bureau of Narcotics?

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.644
SHAUN USHER: Bureau
of Narcotics.

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:09.330
So the way he tried to get
one-- he successfully got one.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.470
He travelled to the White
House on his personal jet.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.080
And while he was
on the jet, he hand

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.945
wrote this letter
to Nixon, saying

00:14:16.945 --> 00:14:19.570
I will be a federal
agent at large.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.490
I will fight in the war
against drugs for you

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.330
so long as he could get a badge.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.550
So he hand-delivered the
letter to the White House,

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.930
got a meeting with
Nixon, gave him a gun,

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.640
and got the badge
he'd always wanted.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.040
And there's a very famous
photograph of Nixon and Elvis

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.350
in the Oval Office, I think.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.130
And it's the most
requested photo.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.670
MALE SPEAKER: Most requested
photo in the National Archives.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.560
SHAUN USHER: In the history
of the National Archives,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.970
all thanks to this crazy letter.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.545
MALE SPEAKER: So let's see.

00:14:48.545 --> 00:14:50.170
It says, "Dear Mr.
President"-- I'm not

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.982
going to do my Elvis
voice, by the way.

00:14:51.982 --> 00:14:52.940
SHAUN USHER: Oh, go on.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.960
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry if
you were counting on that.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.180
"Dear Mr. President, First I
would like to introduce myself.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.260
I am Elvis Presley and
admire you and have

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.080
great respect for your office.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.485
I talked to Vice President Agnew
in Palm Springs three weeks ago

00:15:06.485 --> 00:15:09.870
and expressed my
concerns for our country.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.700
The drug culture, the
hippie elements, the SDS,

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.130
the Black Panthers,
et cetera, do not

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.820
consider me as their
enemy or, as they call it,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.430
the Establishment.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.840
I call it America,
and I love it.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.060
Sir, I can and will
be of any service

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.240
that I can to help
the country out.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.860
I have no concerns and motive
other than helping the country

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.010
out.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.510
So I wish not to be given a
title or an appointed position.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:38.070
I can and will do more if I were
made a federal agent at large.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.750
And I will help out by doing it
my way through communications

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.840
with people of all ages.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.900
First and foremost,
I am an entertainer.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.850
But all I need is the
federal credentials.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.184
I am on the plane with
Senator George Murphy,

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.850
and we have been
discussing the problems

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.110
that our country is faced with.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.720
Sir, I am staying at the
Washington Hotel, Room 505,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.580
506, and 507.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.820
I have two men who work
with me by the name of Jerry

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.890
Shilling and Sunny West.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.627
I am registered under the
name of John Burroughs.

00:16:10.627 --> 00:16:12.210
I will be here for
as long as it takes

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.670
to get the credentials
of a federal agent.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.960
I have done an in-depth
study of drug abuse

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.460
and communist
brainwashing techniques,

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.946
and I am right in the middle
of the whole thing, where I

00:16:23.946 --> 00:16:25.410
can and will do the most good.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.920
I'm glad to help, just as long
as it is kept very private.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.130
You can have your staff or
whomever call me anytime

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.900
today, tonight, or tomorrow.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.070
I was nominated this coming
year, one of America's 10 Most

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.950
Outstanding Young Men.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.290
That would be in January
18 in my hometown

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.210
of Memphis, Tennessee.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.650
I'm sending you a short
autobiography about myself

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.310
so you can better
understand this approach.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.060
I would love to meet
you just to say hello

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.310
if you're not too busy.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.580
Respectfully, Elvis Presley.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.710
PS-- I believe
that you, Sir, were

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.370
one of the top 10 Outstanding
Men of America, also.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.130
I have a personal
gift for you, also,

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.440
which I would like to present
to you, and you can accept it,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.060
or I will keep it for you
until you can take it."

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.599
That was the Colt .45
that John mentioned.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:15.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.839
So we have a letter from Elvis
and a letter about Elvis.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:18.950
SHAUN USHER: Yeah.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.783
MALE SPEAKER: Were there
other Elvis letters

00:17:20.783 --> 00:17:22.494
that didn't make the cut?

00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:23.660
SHAUN USHER: Not really, no.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.099
There are load from
fans, obviously.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.540
He had so many fans
it's ridiculous.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.490
Stephanie's going to read the
John Steinbeck letter to his--

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.406
STEPHANIE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.170
MALE SPEAKER: --to
his 14-year-old son,

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.460
who was off at boarding school,
who said that he fell in

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.680
love with someone.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.130
SHAUN USHER: Yeah, he
was lovesick and needed

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:44.992
some advice.

00:17:44.992 --> 00:17:46.450
This is one of my
favorite letters.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.140
STEPHANIE: So this
was my introduction

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.010
to Letters of Note on
Facebook, and I fell in love

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.430
with Letters of Note after that.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.130
So it's from John
Steinbeck to Tom Steinbeck,

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:03.280
dated November 10, 1958.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.950
"Dear Tom, We had your
letter this morning.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.840
I will answer it from my
point of view and, of course,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.750
Ellen from hers.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.990
First, if you are in
love, that's a good thing.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.950
That's about the best thing
that can happen to anyone.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.300
Don't let anyone make it
small or light to you.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.080
Second, there are
several kinds of love.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.240
One is a selfish, mean,
grasping, egotistical thing,

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.020
which uses love for
self-importance.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.340
This is the ugly
and crippling kind.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.810
The other is an outpouring
of everything good in you,

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.450
of kindness and
consideration and respect,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.390
not only the social
respect of manners,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.240
but the greater
respect, which is

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.220
recognition of another person
as unique and valuable.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.590
The first kind can make you
sick and small and weak,

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.510
but the second
can release in you

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.300
strength and
courage and goodness

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.100
and even wisdom you
didn't know you had.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.080
You say this is not puppy love.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.760
If you feel so deeply, of
course it isn't puppy love.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.850
But I don't think you were
asking me what you feel.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.700
You know better than anyone.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.280
What you wanted me to help you
with is what to do about it.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.190
And that, I can tell you.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.590
Glory in it, for one thing,
and be very glad and grateful

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.560
for it.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.710
The object of love is the
best and most beautiful.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.690
Try to live up to it.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.110
If you love someone, there is
no possible harm in saying so.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.100
Only you must remember that
some people are very shy,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.849
and sometimes the saying
must take that shyness

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:44.640
into consideration.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.280
Girls have a way of knowing
or feeling what you feel,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.650
but they usually
like to hear it also.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:20:00.460
It sometimes happens
that what you feel

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.030
is not returned for
one reason or another.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.900
But that does not make your
feeling less valuable and good.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.140
Lastly, I know your
feeling, because I have it,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.850
and I'm glad you have it.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.770
We will be glad to meet Susan.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.610
She will be very welcome.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.250
But Elaine will make
all such arrangements,

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.970
because that is her province,
and she will be very glad to.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.100
She knows about love,
too, and maybe she

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.900
can give you more
help than I can.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.830
And don't worry about losing.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.270
If it's right, it happens.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.160
The main thing is not to hurry.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.070
Nothing good gets away.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.410
Love, Fa."

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.875
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:49.620
MALE SPEAKER: Let's see, we
talked about your favorites

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:49.740
already.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.210
Have you found
anything especially

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:56.200
surprising or interesting
in going over this?

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.930
SHAUN USHER: Loads, yeah.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.670
The Iggy Pop one was one
of the most surprising.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.190
Not that I thought Iggy
Pop was a terrible person,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.435
but I never thought
he would take his time

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.460
to respond to fans'
letters like that

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.740
at a time when he must have been
incredibly busy, presumably,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.544
or wasted.

00:21:16.544 --> 00:21:17.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.000
I didn't think he'd reply
to letters like that.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.430
So that really surprised me.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.470
There's a letter in the
book from Francis Crick, who

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.920
wrote to his son just
after he co-discovered

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.800
the structure of DNA before
it had been announced.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.475
And he writes to his son and
he draws in a picture of the--

00:21:34.475 --> 00:21:36.100
MALE SPEAKER: I
thought about that one,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.460
but it was too long to read.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.560
SHAUN USHER: Yeah, it's
not the best one to read,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.150
but it's just such an
incredible letter, kind

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.450
of a monumental moment in time.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.330
And that's the most
expensive letter ever sold.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.550
And it sold just after I managed
to get it cleared for the book,

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.545
and it sold for 5 million pounds
at Christie's Auction House.

00:21:55.545 --> 00:21:57.920
MALE SPEAKER: The Crick letter
is the most expensive one?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.766
SHAUN USHER: Crick, yeah.

00:21:58.766 --> 00:21:59.580
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.670
SHAUN USHER: Yeah, the most
expensive letter ever sold.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.170
But it's an incredible thing.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.150
And his family was
so pleased that it

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.230
was going to be in this book,
which is lovely when you speak

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.590
to someone's family
or estate and they're

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.224
pleased for the letter to go in.

00:22:15.224 --> 00:22:16.765
MALE SPEAKER: Is
the son still alive,

00:22:16.765 --> 00:22:19.660
the one that he wrote it to?

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.746
SHAUN USHER: Oh,
God, I don't know.

00:22:21.746 --> 00:22:24.150
I think he is, yeah.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.170
MALE SPEAKER: So this letter,
by the way, if you get the book,

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.530
it's about four pages,
and he describes

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.490
what he found about DNA.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.950
And it's full of diagrams and
chemical descriptions of it.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.860
And it's amazingly
accurate even now, I mean,

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.530
because they nailed it, right?

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:41.280
SHAUN USHER: Yeah.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.340
MALE SPEAKER: We started late,
but we have a question here

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.830
from Scott.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.280
SCOTT: Have you found
letters and then

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.884
as you worked with them found
them to be fake or hoaxes?

00:22:53.884 --> 00:22:55.050
SHAUN USHER: Not really, no.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.360
I've been lucky.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.570
I've been lucky.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:58.070
Who knows?

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.486
Maybe there's some letters in
there that aren't actually--

00:23:00.486 --> 00:23:01.602
maybe they are fake.

00:23:01.602 --> 00:23:03.310
But I've not really
come across many, no.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.589
SCOTT: That's more
of an internet thing.

00:23:05.589 --> 00:23:06.880
SHAUN USHER: Yeah, it is, yeah.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.854
I do, I take a lot of
time kind of verifying

00:23:09.854 --> 00:23:11.270
the authenticity
of these letters,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.650
because there are so many
fake ones flying around.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:20.299
There's one by Stanley
Kubrick in which he supposedly

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:22.090
writes-- I can't remember
who he writes to,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.230
but he lets off a lot of steam.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.540
And that gets
circulated all the time.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:32.150
There's another one supposedly
from Sean Connery to Steve

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:37.220
Jobs, I think it
was, which circulates

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.660
every couple of months.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.660
And millions of people
probably think it's real.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.118
MALE SPEAKER: That
one's fake, too?

00:23:42.118 --> 00:23:43.660
SHAUN USHER: Yeah,
that's fake, yeah.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.784
MALE SPEAKER: That was the
Kurt Vonnegut graduation

00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:46.960
speech that never happened?

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.910
But I guess that
wasn't a letter.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.410
But there was a letter from
Kurt Vonnegut in here, right?

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:50.960
SHAUN USHER: Yeah,
there's one in there.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.096
There's one in the new
book as well, yeah.

00:23:53.096 --> 00:23:55.470
His collection of letters that
came out a couple of years

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.360
ago is one of the best
books I've ever read.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.745
STEPHANIE: Are there any
fascinating letters that you

00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:03.060
were like, this should
be read by everybody,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.580
but the estate has not
agreed to let you publish?

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.620
SHAUN USHER: Yeah, loads.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.100
STEPHANIE: Tell us about it
even though we can't read them.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.620
SHAUN USHER: Well, this
isn't really the same thing,

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:26.290
but there's a Frank Lloyd
Wright letter, the architect.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.770
A little kid wrote to Frank
Lloyd Wright and said,

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.600
can you build a
house for my dog?

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.480
Can you design a
house for my dog?

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.030
Because Frank Loyd Wright had
built a house for the family

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.480
years and years before.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.900
And Frank Lloyd Wright wrote
back and said, yes, I'll

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.650
design your house.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:44.733
So he designs him a house.

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:49.570
You can see a photo of
the doghouse in there.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.639
But in the intro to the letter--
so I applied for permission

00:24:52.639 --> 00:24:53.930
to use the letters in the book.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.270
And the Frank Lloyd
Wright's estate said,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.605
you can use it as long as
you take this one line out

00:24:58.605 --> 00:25:02.620
of the intro, which was--
the dog hated the doghouse,

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.765
basically.

00:25:03.765 --> 00:25:04.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.680
And he refused to
sleep in the doghouse.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.450
And the last line in
the intro originality

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:14.525
was, the sting in the tail is
the dog hated the doghouse.

00:25:14.525 --> 00:25:16.150
And the Frank Lloyd
Wright estate said,

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.870
you've got to take that
out, because we don't--

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.911
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:18.911 --> 00:25:22.137
SHAUN USHER: It reflects
badly on Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:25:22.137 --> 00:25:23.720
So now whenever I
talk about the book,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.282
I make a point of telling
everyone about the dog.

00:25:26.282 --> 00:25:28.740
MALE SPEAKER: If any of you
have been to Frank Lloyd Wright

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.390
houses or places like that,
this is a pretty funny picture,

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.794
because it looks just
like one of them. [LAUGHS]

00:25:34.794 --> 00:25:36.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm the
publicist on the book,

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.310
but I do have a question
that has been in my mind.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:44.190
So "Letters of Note," letters
are destined for someone else

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.610
to read, but in your new
book "Lists of Note,"

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.210
I'm guessing a lot of those
aren't meant for someone else

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.180
to read.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.052
So how do you see the
difference between those two?

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.980
SHAUN USHER: Yeah, lists are
definitely more personal,

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.620
I think, than letters.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.940
But I think they're
less precious.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.150
I have less-- when I was
making "Letters of Note,"

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.820
I spent a lot of time
wondering whether I

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.330
should publish these letters,
even if I have permission.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.560
A lot of them are sometimes a
bit too personal to publish.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.370
But I've never had that
problem with lists.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.800
I've never stopped and
thought, oh, my God,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.080
should I publish this?

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.665
Although lists are
far more personal,

00:26:26.665 --> 00:26:30.630
they're not as--
does that make sense?

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.135
They're not as
precious I don't think.

00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:35.510
MALE SPEAKER: I
think we're done.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.930
I'm just going to read
this very short list

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:42.590
by Preston Sturges of the 11
rules for box office appeal.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.360
Since this is kind
of box office.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.950
"Number one, a pretty girl
is better than an ugly one.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.350
Two, a leg is
better than an arm.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.340
Three, a bedroom is
better than a living room.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.730
Four, an arrival is
better than a departure.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.970
A birth is better than a death.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.540
A chase is better than a chat.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.580
A dog is better
than a landscape.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.940
But a kitten is
better than a dog.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.280
And a baby is better
than a kitten.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.900
A kiss is better than a baby.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.460
And a pratfall"-- I'm
not going to do one--

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.460
"is better than anything."

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.870
SHAUN USHER: So when I was
researching "Letters of Note,"

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.744
I was looking through
the archives and papers

00:27:20.744 --> 00:27:22.300
of all these incredible people.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.500
And I kept finding
lists, amazing lists,

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.190
along with these letters.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.280
So that's how "Lists
of Note" came about.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.430
And the first one I ever found
was the first list in the book

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.880
is a to-do list by Johnny Cash.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.320
And he writes all these things
he has to do in the day,

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:43.460
like drink, eat, go for a
pee, kiss June, his wife, not

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.280
kiss anyone else.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.709
And then the last thing
is "don't make lists."

00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:49.250
MALE SPEAKER: "Number
one, not smoke.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.380
Two, Kiss June.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.640
Three, not Kiss anyone else.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.960
Four, Cough.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.480
Pee.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.312
Eat.

00:27:56.312 --> 00:27:57.910
Not eat too much.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.130
Worry.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.620
Go see Mama.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.380
Practice piano.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.330
And for notes, not write notes."

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.520
With that, let's thank
Shaun for coming.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:10.720
SHAUN USHER: Thank you.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.550
MALE SPEAKER: We
have books for sale,

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.049
and he'll be available
to sign them.

00:28:13.049 --> 00:28:15.220
Thanks for coming, everybody.
