00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Norvig] Okay, now let's go on to the straight and flush functions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first thing to do, of course, is to add more tests.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In this case, I won't make you write them. I'm going to write them myself.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I've written 4 tests here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I should be much more exhaustive than this, but I wanted to have 1 true

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and 1 false for each of the 2 cases.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Remember a straight takes as input a list of ranks, not a hand or list of cards.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And so 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, yes, that is a straight.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
9, 8, 8, 6, 5. That's got a pair; it's not a straight, and so that should be false.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
As for flushes, the straight flush which had all clubs, that should be true.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That should be a flush.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And the 4 of a kind which had all 4 different suits should not be a flush.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I've written the tests. Now it's your turn to write the code.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I want you to write straight, which should return True

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
if the ordered ranks form a 5-card straight and False otherwise,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and flush, which should return True if all the cards in the hand have the same suit

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and False otherwise.
