00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.536
(upbeat music)

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:05.938
- My name is Mike Perry,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.180
I've been with Broad
City since the beginning,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.160
drawing crazy typography and seeing

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.840
what kind of animation explosions

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.120
I can make for the show.

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:16.682
- He also has kind of
become our visual brand.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.920
- When I think about mushrooms,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.560
it fills you with warmth and positivity

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.200
- We were thinking about
the texture of tripping,

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:25.925
the experience of what
it feels like to trip.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.695
(ethereal music)

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:30.897
- [Mike] So the first thing
that popped into my head

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.260
was them walking through
this magenta, pink canyon

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.440
with just really warm, glowing light.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.760
That was kind of like, "Okay, this is what

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:38.905
"it's gonna look like."

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.506
- That's comic book shit!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.440
- Even in the B-roll animations,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.900
there's like, there's a guy
skateboarding along the street,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.640
but it's like pancakes.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.815
- Yeah, he's on a pad of butter,

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.383
you know, skating on a pancake.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.451
- You know, Abbi and Ilana,

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.752
they communicate with everybody.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.821
"We trust you, we believe in you,

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:55.655
"do you work."

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.857
And that's a rare, creative relationship

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.492
and it's pretty damn special.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.060
- Is it weird my nipples are sore?

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.562
- No that is perfectly normal.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.663
Mine are bleeding.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:06.032
(cat screeching)

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.034
I really think that watching this episode,

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.636
you really feel like you're with the girls

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.538
tripping with them, increasing the trip,

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.739
decreasing and then like,

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:16.175
doing the stupid thing
of adding weed too early.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.044
- It's like, it's just sorta li-

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:18.978
No, it's just--

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:20.279
- Cool!
- Yes!

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:22.415
- Something about our dynamic feels

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.817
it needs to be captured!

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.120
- Well, people are doing
some cool stuff online.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.288
- What, like a web series?

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.058
(hip hop music)
