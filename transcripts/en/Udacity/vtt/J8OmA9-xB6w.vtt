00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.650
Recall that the power in a computing
system has, roughly speaking, two parts.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.040
The first is constant power, which is
what you pay just to keep the system on.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.400
The other part is dynamic power.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.540
That's what you pay above and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.650
beyond constant power while
the program is running.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.925
Let's take a quick look at some of
the basic circuits 101 drivers underlie

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:21.290
dynamic power.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.950
Imagine a simple logic gate,
taken out of a larger circuit.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.250
This gate has a certain
amount of physical energy.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.710
It is both right and natural to
represent that energy by analogy

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.250
to a snifter of mighty fine
Atlanta-based beverage.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
Quick extra credit if you
can name this brewery.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.620
Now suppose a gate input changes.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.180
Then the energy dissipates and also,
quite naturally, has to be refilled.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.970
But differently when the circuit
switches there will be some energy loss.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.590
This energy loss then
has to be restored.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.950
Let's first ask how
much energy that is and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.800
then ask how frequently
this switching happens.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.090
Let's see how to compute dynamic power.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.310
Start with the amount of energy consumed
by this gate during a state change.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.680
In electrical engineering terms
C is the gate's capacitance.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.190
Capacitance is a function of
the material properties and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.280
geometry of the gate.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.420
V is the supply voltage.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.830
Supply voltage is part
of a circuit design.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.290
it can, for some circuits,
be tuned over some range.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.860
More importantly is how V
enters into the equation.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.760
It enters as the square.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.000
Now for our class, it's not too
important to understand exactly where

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.680
this relationship comes from.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.850
But do remember that the product
CV squared quantifies energy.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.000
So how often does switching happen?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.380
Well there are two factors.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.410
The first is the frequency or
clock rate of the circuit.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.980
It has units of cycles per unit time.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.420
The clock rate determines the maximum
number of times that the circuit can

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.820
switch or change states per unit time.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.950
Now the gate doesn't necessarily
switch on every cycle.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.930
Depending on what
the computation is doing,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.610
the switches might happen
only once ever few cycles.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.010
That brings us to the second factor,
which is the activity factor.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.290
It's the number of switches per cycle.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.318
If you think about how a clock works,
it has a maximum value of one.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:13.270
In general, it will depend on
what the computation is doing.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.360
Taken together, these parameters tell
us how to compute dynamic power.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.330
It's basically the energy per gate, or

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.490
CV squared,
times the switching frequency.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.560
Which is a times F.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.450
This formula is sometimes called
the Dynamic Power Equation.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.620
Before moving on, let me give you
one more quick fact about it.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.060
The clock rate, F and
the supply voltage,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.340
V usually need to be kept in
proportion to one another.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.710
That is, suppose you've cut F in half.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.870
Then you also need to cut V in half.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.740
Increases are the same.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.010
Suppose you increase F by two.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.780
Then you also need to double V.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.310
So why do F and
V need to change together?

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.470
The short story is that it has to do
with maintaining the stability and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.290
reliability of the circuit.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.390
In particular, its Its reliability in
the presence of environmental noise.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.319
Okay, now's a good time to pause and

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.117
see if you can understand what this
this formula implies can be done if you

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.937
want to increase performance
while reducing power.
