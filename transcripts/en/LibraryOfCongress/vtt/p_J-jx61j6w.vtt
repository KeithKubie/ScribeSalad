&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.670
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Welcome
Tyler Elementary School.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.970
It's so good to have you guys.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.830
So, welcome to the Library of
Congress, Young Readers Center.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.900
We have two really awesome
guests for you today.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.850 position:56%
So, the first person is on my right.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.190
He is Illustrator, Brian Biggs,
and he collaborated on this book,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.280
"Noisy Night", and you might know
him for a series of book called,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.680
"Everything Goes" and "Tinyville."

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.570
And, on my left we have Author, Mac
Barnett and he has written a lot

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.230
of books that you might have heard
of as well, such as "Extra Yarn"

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.740
or maybe you know "Leo,
A ghost story"

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.050
and I'm sure every single public
library in school library has books

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.050
by these awesome in individuals.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.580 position:56%
So, without further ado, I just want

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.860
to introduce and welcome
our authors.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.010
So, everybody say,
welcome [welcome].

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Ah, thank you.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.610
Thank you.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.910
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.940
How about a huge round of
applause for us [applause]?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yes.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.170
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Oh,
please, please, please.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.760
No, please, more applause,
please, please [applause].

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.230
Ah, that feels good.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.720
Oh, we're going to need
that for the walk home.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.020
Good morning.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.320
How are you?

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.620
&gt;&gt; Classroom: Good.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.050
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: My
name is Mac Barnett.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: My
name is Brian Biggs.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.250
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: I'm an author.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: I'm an illustrator.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.940
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: What's my job?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.240
What does that mean
if I'm an author?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.540
Yeah, what does an author do?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600
&gt;&gt; Student: He writes down books.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.080
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: That's
exactly right.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.380
I write books.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.680
Yeah, how about an illustrator?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.980
What does an illustrator do?

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Does anybody
know what an illustrator does?

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.790
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Yeah?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.090
&gt;&gt; Student: Writes pictures.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.390
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Yaay.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Writes the pictures.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.160
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: That's
exactly right.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.390
So, Brian is actually
an author/illustrator.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.840
He's really good at
writing words and pictures,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.310
so sometimes he makes his books and
he puts the pictures inside them,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.690
and puts the words inside them,
and he does it all himself.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.280
Me, I'm just an author.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.810
I'm not very good at
drawing pictures at all.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.120
But, luckily, I have friends,
like Brian, so when I write a book

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.160 position:56%
and need some pictures Brian and I
can work together and make the book.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.660
So, this is actually a book we
just made called, "Noisy Night."

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.620
This book is so new, it just
came out three days ago.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.670
That was the first day that you
could find this book at a library.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.910
That was the first day that
you could find this book

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.210
at a book store.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.840
That was, what is known in
the publishing business,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.550
as this books "book Birthday"
and I know what you're thinking.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.290
I didn't buy your book a
Birthday present [laughter].

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.540
I didn't send your
book a Birthday card.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.070
I never even sang happy
Birthday to your book.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.370
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: No.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.670
Oh, my goodness.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.970
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: I know, I know.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.270
And, our book knows too, trust me.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.570
We were driving over
here this morning

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.090
and we were listening to the radio.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.390
It was fun.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.690
We were having some good music on.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.390
I like to listen to the radio
really loud when I drive,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.850
and our book was like, "Hey,
Brian and Mac, hey Brian and Mac,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.150
can I turn down the radio?"

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.450
We talk to our books
sometimes, it's not crazy.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.540
And, our book was like, "Hey
Brian and Mac, where we going?"

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.450
I said, the Library of Congress.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.070
The book was like,
"That's really exciting.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.110
Who are we going to see there?"

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.310
I was like, we are going to see
the kids from Tyler Elementary.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.220
Yeah, that was exciting for me, our
book though did not say whoo whoo,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.010
our book was like,
"Tyler Elementary, pshhh."

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.310
[laughter].

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.710
Those are the kids who forgot about
my Birthday, and it was awkward.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: It was awkward.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.690
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: But,
we can fix this.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.660
Now, I don't know if you've
ever sung happy Birthday

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.820 position:56%
to a book before, but you don't just
get to say happy Birthday dear book.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.500
No, you have to say
the books full title.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.490

written by Mac Barnett [laughter]

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.420

I know that was a lot.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.840
I know that was alot.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.140

We're warmed up, ready to go.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.870
I don't know what could go wrong.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Nothing.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.470

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.910
Let's do this.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.210
Here we go.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.510
Noisy Nights.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.650
You can see here, is
a kid, asleep, in bed.

&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Me.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.690
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: The kid says, "What
is going la la la above my head?"

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.260
Yeah, what do you think
is making that noise?

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.830
What do you think is
going, la la la?

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.870
Yeah, what do you think?

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.740
&gt;&gt; Student: People
stomping on the roof.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.360
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: People
stomping around the roof?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.660
Let's see, let's see.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.960
That's a good guess.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.260
That's what happens at
my house all the time.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.380
I'll tell you that.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:51.310
A man is singing opera above my
head, and he says, "La, la, laaaa."

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.610
Can you do that for me?

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.910
One, two, three.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.840
&gt;&gt; Classroom: La, la, laaa.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.140
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Nice.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.440
Yeah, are you classically trained?

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.740
That was amazing.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: That's the best yet.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.340
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: That was amazing.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.960
And, now the opera man
says, "What is going,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.380
ma ma ma ma above my head?"

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.980
What do you think is going
ma ma ma above his head?

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.870
What do you think is
making that noise?

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.470
Who would make a noise like that?

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.770
Does anyone have a guess?

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.380
What do you think?

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.680
Yeah?

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.980
&gt;&gt; Student: Maybe a scooter.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.280
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Oh, a scooter.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.580
Yeah, because we have some wheels.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.880
Yeah right?

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.180
It could be a scooter.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.480
Let's see.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.690
A baby, is cooing above my head,
and the baby says, "Ma, ma, ma."

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.990
[laughter].

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.290
Can you do that [laughter]?

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.970
Yeah, let's do it all at once.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.270
One, two, three.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.780
&gt;&gt; Classroom: Ma, ma, ma.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.080
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: That's good.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.820
You guys sound like
a bunch of babies.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.120
That's amazing.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.420
That was amazing.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.130
And, now the baby says, "What is
going ba ba ba above my head?"

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.480
What do you think it is?

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.050
What's going ba ba ba?

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.350
A sheep.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: What?

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.950
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: This is
an apartment building.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: That
doesn't make any sense.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.550
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: A sheep living
in an apartment building?

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.850
I don't think so.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.150
That's just crazy.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.450
It's a sheep.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.750
You were right.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.050
You were right.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.350
You were right.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.650
You were right.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.950
You were right.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.250
You were right.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Get a
little fist pump there.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.850
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: A sheep
is speaking above my head,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.150
and the sheep goes,
"Maa, maa, maaa."

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.450
[laughter].

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.750
Let's do that.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.050
One, two, three.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.350
&gt;&gt; Classroom: Maa, maa, maa.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.650
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: That's good,
that's good, that's good.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:30.230
And now, the sheep says, "What is
going on ha ha ha above my head?"

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.040
What would make that noise?

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.340
Ha, ha, ha.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.640
We have a little clue there.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.940
What do you think?

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.240
&gt;&gt; Student: It's a cowboy.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.540
&gt;&gt; Mac Burnett: Cowboy.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.840
Let's see [class chatter].

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Cowboy.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.480
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Cowboys
are laughing above my head.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.870
And, they go, hah hah hah.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.170
Can we do that?

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.470
One, two, three.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.780
&gt;&gt; Classroom: Hah hah hah

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.080
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: That's good.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.500
And, they say, "What is going
wah wah wah above our heads?"

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.800
[classroom chatter].

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.160
What would make that noise?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.430
What would do that?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.770
Anybody have a guess?

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.070
Here's the picture.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.370
What do you think?

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.670
&gt;&gt; Student: A girl.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.970
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: A girl.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.270
Let's see.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.410
A girl is playing trumpet
above our head.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Nice work.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.540
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: You got it.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.640
Yeah, and the trumpet goes,
wah wah wah [laughter].

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.620
Let's do that.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.920
One, two, three.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.210
&gt;&gt; Classroom: Wah, wah, wah.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.330
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Nice, yeah.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.760
And, the girls say, "What is
going caw caw caw above my head?"

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.400
You have a guess?

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.700
&gt;&gt; Student: A crow.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.000
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnet: A crow.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.530
A crow is squawking above my head.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:49.110
And, the crow goes, caw caw caw.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.410
Let's do that.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.710
One, two, three.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.800
&gt;&gt; Classroom: Caw, caw, caw.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.100
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Fantastic.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:01.420
And, now the crow says, "What is
going rah rah rah above my head?"

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.720
[classroom chatter].

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.020
What do we think?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.320
What is going rah rah rah?

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.620
Any guesses?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.920
Yeah? Do you have a guess?

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.220
&gt;&gt; Student: Rah, rah, rah.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.350
Maybe it's just a man
with funny shoes.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.790
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Maybe it's
just a man with funny shoes.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.840
That looks like a good guess to me.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.140
Let's see.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:24.840 position:56%
Cheerleaders, are cheering above my
head, and they say, "Rah, rah, rah."

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.140
Let's do that.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.440
One, two, three.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.740
&gt;&gt; Everybody: Rah, rah, rah.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.040
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: There they are.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:36.800
And, they say, "What is going
cha, cha, cha above our heads?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.770
What is going cha, cha, cha?

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.070
&gt;&gt; Student: The dancers.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.370
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Dancers.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:49.110
A couple is dancing above our
heads, and it goes cha, cha, cha.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.410
Let's do that.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.710
One, two, three.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.010

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yeah.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.910
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: That was
smooth [classroom chatter].

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:03.770
And, they say, "What is going
blah, blah, blah above our heads?"

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.110
What do you think [inaudible
comment]?

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.410
Let's see.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.720
An old man is hollering,
"Go to bed."

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.670
Let's all try to holler
that at once.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.070
One, two, three.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.660
&gt;&gt; Everyone: Go to bed.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.960
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Click.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.550
The lights all turn off below him,
and then he turns off the light.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.850
&gt;&gt; Student: What?

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: And, he goes to bed.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.490
And, that is the end
-- of Noisy Nights.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yeah.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.640
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Give yourself a big
round of applause for those noises.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.200
Oh, you guys.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yeah, those
sound effects were good.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.800
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: That's fantastic.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.100
Brian, can you show us a little bit

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.400
about how you made
all those pictures?

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: I would love
to show you a little bit

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.740
about how I made those,
what were they?

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.040
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Great pictures.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Great pictures.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.640
Thank you, Mac.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.690
Hey, guys, does anybody
here like to draw?

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.080
Nobody likes to draw?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.740
Not a single person in this
room likes -- you like to draw?

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.100
Give me five on that one.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.510
Alright, because I like to draw.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:08.470
[ Classroom Chatter ]

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Ooops.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.570
So, this is an amazing,
behind the scenes look

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:19.110
at how I illustrated Noisy
Night, by Brian Biggs.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.460
So, I like to think that
authors actually draw.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.230
You know, they sit around and they
draw and they think of good ideas

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.850
for books, and then they
write the words with them.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.190
But, what I always
see is just the words.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.070
So, you guys -- the
authors write the story,

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.010
and in this case the sound effects
as well, and then the illustrator,

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.160
me, I put the words for
the pictures to the words.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.080
So, here. Oh, I'm going to
show you first some other books

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.380
I've illustrated.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.010
I forget the order of
this thing sometimes.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.570
It's gotten carried
away as well, the --

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.470 position:56%
we're going to try to do this again.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.280
Alright, stay there this time.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.480
Alright. So, these are
the books I illustrated.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.780
Some of them I wrote as well.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.810
Here are some books
I did not illustrate.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.160
These were written by Mac,
and they were illustrated

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.720
by other fine illustrators,
Jon Klassen.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.120
Jon Klassen, Christian
Robinson, Matt Myers.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.330
So, this was what I saw.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.770
This was the book the way it
existed before I illustrated it.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.070
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Look at that.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.370
That's the whole book.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: That's the
whole book right there.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.780
So, my favorite part about
it was this part right here.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.210
I focused on what words I really
liked, and that was it right there.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.510
The word noisy.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.810
You guys like the word noisy?

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.110
&gt;&gt; Student: Yes.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: When I
first saw this manuscript,

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.120
I was really afraid it was going
to be called something like,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.870
"Quiet Night" or "Really
Silent People

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.540
in an Apartment Building Night."

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.310
But, instead it was
called, "Noisy Night"

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.650
and it got me really
excited about that.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:43.950
And, I thought about it and I said,

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.470
how can I illustrate
the word "noisy?"

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.040 position:56%
So, I started thinking about how I
would do that, and we have wah, wah,

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.260
wah, and la la la, and that
was the first thing I thought

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.290
about with the cha, cha, cha, and
ma, ma, ma, and caw, caw, caw,

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:00.920
and ha, ha ha, and I don't
remember all the other.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.220
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Blah, blah, blah.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yep, there ya go.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.820
&gt;&gt; Student: Baa, baa, baa.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yep.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.420
I memorized the book already.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.720
Now, I could see [inaudible].

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.020
So, this is some of the sketches I
did for some of the sound effects.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.380 position:56%
You can see the caw caw caw, the wah
wah wah, and this is on just pieces

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.950
of paper with a pen or a pencil,

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.180
and that's the way I start
thinking about a book a first.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.680
It's just what's kind
of my favorite parts

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.380
about it, drawing little sketches.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.880
You guys know what a sketch is?

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.380
Anybody thought about a sketch?

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.460
What's a sketch?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.760
You?

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:33.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Student: A sketch is kind of like
a -- writing with a pen or a pencil.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yeah.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.040
I think you're exactly right.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.340
It's like practice drawing.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.690
So, before I make the
final paintings

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.480
for the book I do a little practice
drawings with a pen or a pencil.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.780
You're exactly right.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.130
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Something I like
about these, I think is so cool is,

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.750
you made these words
look like they sound.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: That's important.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.350
You're right.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.650
Speaking of sounds and.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.950
Yeah, can everyone please
turn off your cell phones,

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.250
including the author [laughter].

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.550
Thank you very much.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.720
You can see, like there's
a ha ha in the far right,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.240
because it's very different
from the way it ended up being.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.900
And, so that's actually
really a good point.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.140
I started thinking about what
does the word la la la look like.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.970
So, this is the la la
la in a sketch here,

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.800
when really it turned
out very different.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.660
The way the caw looked was very --

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.690
was right on from the
very beginning,

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.470
and so that was really
interesting to me.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.220
And, so here's the la la
la the way it turned out.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.700
Here's some of the text.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.380
A girl is playing trumpet
above our heads.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.680
It looks like cowboy type.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.980
So, cowboys were talking.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.080
It just comes from, maybe old
posters I've seen or if you go

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.810 position:56%
to a western saloon, I'm sure you've
all been to western saloons a lot,

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.730
you can see that kind
of type on the menu.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.070
So, I'm going to show
you some sketches.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.370
That's what the sketches are.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.840
These are the practice drawings,
and what you're going to see is,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.810
this is a sketch of the cha cha
dancers, how they looked at first.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.490
I have a mirror in my studio, and
the way I get my ideas is I dance

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.020
in front of the mirror and
then I draw what I see.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.000
I'm a really, really fine cha
cha dancer too [laughter].

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.800
I'm not going to show you.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.410
You're all just going
to have to believe me.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.890
So, here's some sketches
of a cha cha dancer.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.610
And, then this is how the
finished drawing looks here.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.280
So, you can see it's
a little different.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.390
But, for the most part it's
kind of pretty close, right?

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.080 position:56%
Oops, there's my opera singer there.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.360 position:56%
Some pencil drawings with the la la.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.280
Here's another sketch there.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.820
And, then we go to
the finished drawing.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.570
Ooops. Come on.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.870
Technology.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.470
This is the finished drawing here.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.060
It's a black and white drawing,
on paper, and then it goes

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.590
in to the computer and gets
colored in the computer here,

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.670
and these are the finished
pages there.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.970
So, here's some cowboys.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.270
You guys ever draw cowboys?

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.570
Does anybody ever -- .

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.870
What's the most important
part of a cowboy to draw,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.330
you think [background comments]?

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.520
The hat? You like cowboy hats?

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.180
Do you guys have a cowboy hat?

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.480
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: What'd you think?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.780
What was the most important part?

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.080
&gt;&gt; Student: Cowboy hat.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Cowboy hat.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.680
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Yep,
she's just saying that.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.860
Okay, I'm going to go
with it [laughter].

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.370
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: More cowboys.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.330
Sometimes cowboys have
big glasses, right?

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.020
Do you think cowboys
might have big glasses on?

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.320 position:56%
They think something's really funny.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.610
This was my favorite stuff to
draw, because it was the idea

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.790
that something is so
funny, and you have --

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.100
the best part, it wasn't just
one cowboy, like we had one crow.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:16.310
We had one trumpet player, but
he had cowboys in the text,

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.350
and cheerleaders in the
text, so it was plural

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.910
and I really liked the
idea of having two cowboys,

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.280
and it's the idea that they
just hold a good joke, you know,

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.610
and we get them just as
the joke has been told

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.190
and they think it's really funny.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.450
In fact, why did you have not
just cheerleader and cowboy,

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.750
but you had two plurals there?

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.050
I was curious.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.710
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Why do I
do the things I do, Brian?

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: That's a good
answer Mac [background chatter].

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.920
Thanks for that illuminating
reply [laughter].

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.850
Now, you may be surprised that
over the three or four years

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.350
since we started this
book I've never asked him

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.180
that question before,
but it's just never --

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.030
we don't talk about the
book as I'm doing it,

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.580
and it hasn't come
up until just now.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.740
So, here's a sketch for
that with four cowboys

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.340
and we ended up just doing the two.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.430
It just doesn't like
to stay on one slide.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.730
There we go.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.030
&gt;&gt; Students: Eww, eww.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: And,
then here's the crows.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.630
You guys ever seen
a crow with a hat?

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.930
&gt;&gt; Students: No.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Well, Mac didn't
write that the crow has a hat,

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.740
but in my imagination
crows have hats [laughter].

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.790
I think it's important that you
give the crow a nice little hat.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.090
So, there he was.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.390
His feather fell off.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.080
He's pretty upset about it.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.550
And, then here's the
baby [classroom chatter].

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:26.000
And, there's the two babies
in the book [chatter].

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.180
So, the cover's the
most important part.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.800
Does anybody here judge
a book by its cover?

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.100
Has anybody done that before?

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.200
You walk in to the book
store and you see two books

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.440
about Theodore Roosevelt, and one
of them has a really ugly cover

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.740
and one's an amazing cover.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.120
We are probably going to get
the amazing cover one, right?

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.610
That's what I'd do, at least.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.630
That's how I buy my
records, in fact.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.450
So, this is the cover of
the book and I knew I had

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.950
to make it something that was
like really gets your attention.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.320 position:56%
So, it was going to have a building.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.380
It takes place in an
apartment building.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.320
This is the most important
part of the text,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.270
is the part that you
guys didn't see.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.090
The action takes place in an
apartment building in the city.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:06.220
What you don't see is, with a sheep
in it, but there was a sheep in it.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.910
So, we have a couple
of tall buildings.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.280
These old apartment buildings,
and I love the way they look.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.760
I'm a big fan of cities.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.170
I'm a big fan of the way buildings
look, and the way cities work,

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.200
and streets and that sort of thing.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.160
So, I also like these old neon
lights that go top of buildings.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.950
This is one here on
Brooklynn, on the right,

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.510
that I took from the subway.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.240
They just pulled that Kent Tile
floor sign down a couple of --

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.900
about a year ago or so, very sad.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.780
So, you have the hotel signs
here, and putting it together,

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.420
that's kind of the way I
thought this would look,

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.020
the cover would look,
is this building

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.130
with a big neon light on top.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.430 position:56%
So, there's some sketches with that.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.200
Noisy Night, noisy night,
and just trying to think --

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.600
even those these almost
all look exactly the same,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.300
you can see the difference
in the windows,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.600
the difference in the angles.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.920
Is it a light background
with a dark building,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.610
or a dark background
with a light building?

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.280
And, there's a lot of
different choices I had

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.900
in putting this together.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.880
So, here's a good sketch
that we ended up liking,

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.300
had to have all the
stories in the thing.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.930 position:56%
And, then this is a picture I took
about 12 years ago in New York City,

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.900
and this is kind of
the mood that I wanted.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.840
It's a photo I took from, actually
from the Workman Publishing office

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.090
in lower Manhattan, and that feel,

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.520
that kind of almost nighttime feel
is exactly what I was trying to go

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.100 position:56%
for with the coloring, and so that's
kind of what we ended up with there.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.950
And, it's important if you look

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.480
at the bottom you'll
see the boy yelling up,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.660
then you see the upper man with the
purple, and then you see the baby

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.120
in the green, the sheep,
the cowboys, the trumpet,

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.040
and you have a crow, and
you have cheerleaders.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.750
You have cha cha dancers, and
then you have the old man,

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.870
and do you guys remember
what the old man is saying?

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.400
&gt;&gt; Students: Go to bed.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Go to bed.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.340
There he is right there.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.640
So, thank you very much you guys.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.940
I appreciate it.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.740
Alright.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.460
[ Applause ]

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.330
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Now, we have
something else we want to show you,

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.640
but before we do that we
just want to make sure

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.700
that we answered any questions
you had about this book,

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.170
about being an author,
or being an illustrator,

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.370
about making books, about anything.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.530
If you have a question, ask it
and we will try to answer it.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:10.830
Yes?

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.810
&gt;&gt; Jill: I'm going to come
out with a microphone.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.490
&gt;&gt; Student: Why did you
feel like being an author.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.790
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Good.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.950 position:56%
Why did I feel like being an author?

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.250
Three reasons.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.550
I love reading books.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:26.120
I love telling stories, and I love
sleeping in really late [laughter].

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.600
And, authors get to do
all three of those things.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.900
I read books every day.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.070
That's the best way to get
better at writing is to read.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.950
I get to tell stories, not just
to people who can hear my voice,

words, but I don't do pictures.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.580 position:56%
And, the reason for that is, when I
draw pictures they're not very good.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.180
I would love it if my pictures
could come out in a book.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.970
In fact, I have one book where
I did get to draw some pictures,

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.100
because in the middle of the
book I fired the illustrator.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.400

taking this book over myself.

And, then I draw all the pictures,
and all the pictures are really bad,

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.970
so I have to re-hire the
illustrator, and rescue him

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.630
from lion's belly, because I
also made him get swallowed

with it, and you go back and you
try to fix all the things again,

and again, and you go
back and you rewrite it,

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.300

with it, and you rewrite it,

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.820
until finally you say,
this is really good

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.940
and then you put the
book out and even then,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.270
you'll usually find
something wrong with it.

&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: That's a
better answer than a circle.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.570
But, I'm going to give you
one more hint with this.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.070
It's getting complicated now.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.190
How about that [inaudible comment]?

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:40.530
Okay, I'm going to
give you one more hint.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.830
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Great.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.130
I think I heard it [laughter].

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Alright, is anybody
starting to recognize it now?

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.620
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Yes, go for it.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yes?

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.220
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Go for it.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.520
&gt;&gt; Student: It's an arm.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: No.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.260
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: I think
we have it back here.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.040
&gt;&gt; Student: It's a pancake.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: It's
a donut [laughter].

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.650
Come on. I'm a pro.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.950
I've won awards.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.280
I'm a New York Times
Best-Selling illustrator.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.110
Alright, so we're going to start
getting a little crazy here.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.910
This is where it gets tough.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.120
He's -- This is.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.050
Now, you might think this is
just a backwards letter C,

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.370
but it's not [classroom comments].

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.120
This old man's doing something.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.110
Alright, alright, alright.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.140
He's excited about
this, what was it again?

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.530
&gt;&gt; Student: A donut.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Yeah, he's excited

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.280
about this donut [background
comments].

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:37.140
Oh my gosh, circle.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.510
Alright, so old men have
thick glasses, right?

[ Classroom Chatter ]

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.600
I know one who does.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.900
Yeah. I'm going to take this
opportunity to tell everybody

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.450
that yesterday was my Birthday,
and I turned 49 years old

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.820
and so I think I fit in to
the old man category now.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.640 position:56%
And, my daughter, last night pointed

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.000
out that even my moustache
was starting to turn gray.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:08.040
So, this morning I almost shaved
it off before I left the house.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.480
Alright, so here's this.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.560
Mac, you didn't know it was my
Birthday, yesterday did you?

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.250
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: No, you
never mentioned it before.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Never
mentioned it yesterday.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:22.680
Alright, so old men also have a
lot of wrinkles on their faces,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:27.410
and they have these big
moustaches here, and it's going

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:32.300
to have scribbles in it here,
and they've got no hair,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.390
so I'm not that old, because
I've got lots of hair.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.510
And, then they wear ties.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:43.080
Okay? Ties.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.580
Okay, so this old man, and
what was the word again?

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.440
Anybody remember?

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.000
I think the word was da da da.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.510
Yeah, ah, he wants a donut.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:03.360
[ Classroom Chatter ]

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.180
I forgot what the second
word was [chatter].

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.640
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: What
was the next word?

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.940
&gt;&gt; Student: Da.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Da [chatter].

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.760
Am I spelling it correctly?

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.780
What was the third word?

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.050
&gt;&gt; Student: Da [laughter].

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Okay, I believe you.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.080 position:56%
and, then the second most important
part of the Noisy Night drawings is,

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:34.210
you have to have this shape
here that points to his head,

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.910
so that you know who's saying it,

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:38.860
and that is called
the "voice balloon."

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.240
It's a technical term.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.960
You may have never heard it before.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.140
We're trained in college to
know what these things are.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.730
So, there's our old man yelling, da
da da, because he wants that donut,

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.570
and he's obviously missing an arm.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:52.870
I cannot believe this.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.170

a big round of applause?

you [applause].

an even huger round of applause

for me, for just sitting there.

you, thank you, thank you.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.020
Now, before we go I want to
show you something kind of cool.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.100
I've never seen this
before in my life.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.100
Something that you can really --

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.650
it was made here, and
maybe can only see here.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:19.330
This is a book I wrote called, "The
Skunk" but, it's a special version

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.320
that got made here, I
know, it's a little gross.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:27.070
Yeah. It's about a man who gets
followed around by a skunk.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.650
But, inside of this book has
something that's very cool.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.410
This book is a braille
edition of the book.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:35.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Biggs: Wow.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:37.010
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Does
anybody know what Braille is?

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Riggs: That's pretty cool.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.610
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: Braille
is an alphabet

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.910
that you -- yeah, did you know?

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.210

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:52.610
This one is just me and
somebody named Patrick MacDonald.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:56.460
So, Brian is just going to sit
here while I talk about this.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.560
So, this book is in braille,
and braille is an alphabet

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.180
that you can feel instead of see.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:09.190 position:56%
So, if you can't see you could still
read the book just by feeling it.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:14.970
So, if you touch this right here,
you can feel the cover and this,

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:22.220
in braille, says, "The Skunk" by
Mac Barnett, and Patrick MacDonald.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.820
So, do you want to feel
a skunk, right here?

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.120
&gt;&gt; Student: No.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.420
&gt;&gt; Mac Barnett: No, sorry.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.720
The word, the skunk.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.020
The word, the skunk.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.410
You want to feel that?

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.620
Put your finger right there.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.500
You want to feel it?

Put your finger right there.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.480
Isn't that cool?

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.780
Yeah [comments].

it's like dots, right?

upset the skunk either.

here, put it right there.

a chance we'll make sure you pet him

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.170
on your way out.

surprise which is that everybody

what is going on right
next door to me.
