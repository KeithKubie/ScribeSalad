00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.930
Many videos ago we introduced
the idea of a projection.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.210
And in that case we dealt more
particularly with projections

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.430
onto lines that went
through the origin.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.950
So if we had some line-- let's
say L-- and let's say L is

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.090
equal to the span of
some vector v.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.760
Or you could say, alternately,
that L is equal to the set of

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.290
all multiples of v, such that
the scalar factors are just

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.760
any real numbers.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.090
These are both representations
of lines that

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.440
go through the origin.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.840
We defined a projection of any
vector onto that line.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.820
Let me just draw it real
fast. So let me see,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.160
we draw some axes.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.710
So that is my-- I want to draw
it a little bit straighter

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.790
than that-- that is my vertical
axis and that is my

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.210
horizontal axis.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.920
Just like that and let's say
I have some line that goes

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.520
through the origin.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.950
Let's say-- that doesn't go
through the origin-- let's say

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.210
that that line right there
goes through the origin.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.180
So that is L.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.560
We knew visually that a
projection of some vector x

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.680
onto L-- so let's say that
that is a vector x.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.570
Visually, if you were to draw--
if you have some light

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.790
coming straight down it would
be the shadow of x onto L.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.220
So this right here, that right
there, was the projection onto

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.980
the line L of the vector x.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.510
And we defined it
more formally.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.670
We kind of took a
perpendicular.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.850
We said that x minus the
projection of x onto L is

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.420
perpendicular to the line
L, or perpendicular to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.210
everything-- orthogonal to
everything-- on the line L.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.900
But this is how at least
I visualize this.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.870
It's kind of the shadow as you
go down onto the line L.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.890
And this was a special case,
in general, of projections.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.580
You might notice that L is going
to be a valid subspace.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.710
You could prove it
to yourself.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.050
It contains the zero vector.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.570
It goes through the origin.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.680
It's closed under addition--
any member of it plus any

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.740
other member of it is going to
be another member of it.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.480
It's closed under scalar
multiplication-- you can take

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600
any member of it and scale it
up or down, it's still going

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.340
to be an L.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.970
So this was a subspace
when we defined this.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.380
And just as a bit of a reminder
of what it was, we

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.980
were able to figure out what
this projection is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.960
for some line L.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.060
If you have some spanning
vector, the projection onto

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.620
this line L that goes through
the origin of the vector x, we

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.330
figured out was x dot your
spanning vector for your line,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.070
so x dot v over v dot v,
which is really just

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.290
the length of v squared.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.270
So all of this was a number and
you want it to be in the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.480
same direction as your line.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.525
It's going to be another
vector in your line.

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:00.930
So it's going to be times
the vector v.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.800
So it's just going to be a
scaled up or scaled down

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.720
version of your spanning
vector.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.890
Maybe your spanning vector
is like that.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.470
And really any vector
in your line could

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.280
be a spanning vector.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.440
Any vector other than
the zero vector.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.340
Now that was a projection onto
a line which was a special

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.940
kind of subspace.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.390
But now we're going to broaden
our definition of a projection

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.480
to any subspace.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.180
So we already know that if-- let
me draw a little dividing

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.540
line to show that we're doing
something slightly different--

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:51.040
if v is a subspace of Rn then
v complement is also a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.130
subspace space of Rn.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.550
So the orthogonal complement
of v is also a subspace.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.770
And let's say we have some
members, or let me

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.870
write it this way.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.740
If we have these two subspaces--
you have a

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.160
subspace and you have this
orthogonal complement-- we

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.670
already learned that if you
have any member of Rn-- so

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.079
let's say that x is a member
of our Rn-- then x can be

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:25.170
represented as a sum of a member
of v and a member of

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.710
the orthogonal complement
of v.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.490
Where-- let me write this-- the
vector v is a member of

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.670
the subspace v and the vector
w is a member of the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.780
orthogonal complement
of the subspace v.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.450
Just like that.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.390
We saw this several
videos ago.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.500
We proved that this was true
for any member Rn.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.650
Now given that, we can define
the projection of x onto the

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:05.930
subspace v as being equal to,
just the part of x -- these

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.530
are two orthogonal parts of x--
we define the projection

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.500
onto v as a part of x
that came from v.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.730
It's equal to just
that vector v.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:22.710
Alternately you could say that
the projection of x onto the

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.260
orthogonal complement of-- sorry
I wrote transpose-- the

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.960
orthogonal complement of v is
going to be equal to w.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.590
So this piece right here
is a projection onto

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.980
the subspace v.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.920
This piece right here is a
projection onto the orthogonal

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.710
complement of the subspace v.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.000
Now what I want to do in this
video is show you that these

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.060
two definitions-- that this
definition right here which is

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.490
then in conjunction with this
right here-- this is the

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.800
equivalent to what we learned up
here if the subspace v that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.450
we're dealing with is a line.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.000
Because this was a
valid subspace.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.950
But not all subspaces are
going to be lines.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.490
And to see this we can revisit
an example that we saw several

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.050
videos ago.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.140
Several videos ago we had
this matrix here A.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.580
This 2 by 2 matrix.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.100
And then we had this other
vector b that was a member of

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.770
the column space of A.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.810
We did this problem to show you
that the shortest solution

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.880
to this right here was a unique

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.030
member of the row space.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.600
Hopefully that gets your memory
on track for this

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.050
problem when we first did it.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.070
But let me graph it and show you
that for the solution of

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.110
that problem we could have
just as easily taken a

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.240
projection onto a subspace.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.870
Let me graph everything
in this problem.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.885
This might help you remember
also about the problem.

00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:54.370
So let me draw my axes
just like that.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.060
So the first thing we learned--
you know you could

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.785
solve this but I already
did this in a video.

00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:00.135
I think it was two or three
videos ago-- the null space of

00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:04.090
A, or all of the x's that
satisfy Ax is equal to zero,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.630
is a span of the vector 2, 3.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.230
So you go 2 to the right.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.900
1, 2.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.040
And then you go 3 up.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.600
1, 2, 3.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.590
And so it's the span
of this vector.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.430
And so the span of that vector
is just all the points.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.530
Well that vector specifies
that point.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.570
But if you scale this vector
up and down you're going to

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.850
specify all of the point
on this line.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.240
All the points on that line.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.210
Let me draw it like that.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.940
That's good enough.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.750
It shouldn't curve down
like that at the end.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.480
So let me draw that a
little straighter.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.860
So this is the null space.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.480
That is our null space of
that matrix right there.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.730
And then the row space was a
span of the vector 3, minus 2.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.830
You see that right here.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.660
3, minus 2 is the first row.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.350
This guy is just a multiple
of that one.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.020
That's why we don't have
this guy right here

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.530
in the span as well.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.520
And if we were to graph
it, 3, minus 2.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.290
You go out 3, then
you go down 1, 2.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.360
it would be the span of this
vector right there.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.635
Let me draw it like that.

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:08.930
Now you take all of the scalar
multiples of that vector and

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.160
you put those vectors in
standard position.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.220
They're going to specify, or
their tips are going to be on

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.535
points along this line
right there.

00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:18.520
Along that line right there.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.060
I'm trying to make sure I
draw them orthogonally.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.940
So this right here
is the row space.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.040
That right there is the row
space of A which is the same

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.410
thing as a column space
of A transpose.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.929
And we know that these guys are
each other's orthogonal

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:33.880
complements.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.150
We know, we've seen this in
multiple videos, that the null

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.580
space of A is the orthogonal
complement of the row space.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.990
And we also know that the
orthogonal complement of the

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.280
null space is equal
to the row space.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.830
Everything in this
is orthogonal to

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.910
everything in that.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.470
Everything in that
is orthogonal to

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.340
everything in this.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.310
You can see it here
in this graph.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.720
That these two spaces, which are
represented by these lines

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.140
that go through the origin,
are orthogonal.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.250
And it makes sense that any--
we said at really the

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.930
beginning of the video-- that
anything in R2 in this

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:16.860
situation, can be represented as
some sum of a unique member

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.470
of our row space and a unique
member of its orthogonal

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.970
complement.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.330
Let's say I have that
point right there.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.740
How could I represent it as a
sum of a member of this and a

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.010
member of that?

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:33.120
Well if I go along this guy, I
have this vector right here.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.380
I have that vector right
there along that line.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.860
And then I have this
vector right here.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.780
If I were to shift it-- this is
drawn in standard position,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.530
but I can draw a vector
wherever I want.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.795
These lines are just all of the
vectors drawn in standard

00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:50.780
position with their tails
at the origin.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.910
But we learned, in really, I
think, the first or second

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.030
vector videos, that I can draw
them wherever I want.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.500
So if I add this vector and that
vector, I can shift this

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.840
vector over and this vector
will be right there.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.550
And there you have it.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.690
I took an arbitrary point in R2
and I can represent it as a

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.900
sum of a member of my row space
and a member of the row

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.570
space's orthogonal complement
or the null space.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.740
But just to review, what we
originally did in that problem

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.910
is we looked at the solution
set of this.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.190
We said the solution set of
this looks like this.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.000
It has a particular solution
plus members of your null

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.820
space, plus homogeneous
solutions.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.870
We've seen that multiple
videos ago.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.190
So 3, 0-- it looks
like this-- plus

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.540
members of the null space.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.690
So your solution set is going
to be parallel to this but

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.970
shifted to the right by 3.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:42.010
So it looks-- let me draw it a
little neater than that-- Let

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.040
me draw it like that.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.960
And then it goes down like,
the second part I didn't

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.630
draw-- there you go.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.840
Oh that's not good either.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.620
Maybe I'm being too picky.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.635
OK, so this is your
solution set.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.740
And if you remember in that
video we said, hey there's

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.040
some member of this solution set
that is also a member of

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.280
our row space and that member of
the solution set that is a

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.560
member of our row space
is going to be

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.360
the shortest solution.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.170
And we saw that.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.910
You can see it visually
right here.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:13.210
Right?

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.730
This vector right here.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.160
It is in our row space.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.990
It is a member of
our row space.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.510
And it also specifies a point
on our solution set.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.950
And you could see visually
that it's going to be the

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.610
shortest solution.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.930
And one way you could think
about it is, this is the

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:35.470
projection-- let me pick a good,
different, new color--

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.140
any solution on our solution
set-- let me see right there--

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.370
let's say that that is some
arbitrary solution on our

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.620
solution set.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.210
Right?

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.230
That's going to be a point in R2
and any point in R2 can be

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.320
represented as a sum of some
vector in our row space and

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.420
some vector in our null space.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.560
And so if I have this vector
right here, how can I do that?

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.980
Well, I could represent it as
a sum of this guy right here

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.340
and then this vector
right here.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.180
That vector right here.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.350
And this vector right
here is clearly a

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.550
member of my null space.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.540
I just shifted over.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.040
This line is only when I draw
in standard position.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.670
This vector right here-- I'm
just showing it heads to

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.430
tails-- if I add this member of
my row space to this member

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.970
of my null space, I get an
arbitrary solution to my

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.070
solution set.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.330
And if you think about it, the
projection of my arbitrary

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:32.350
solution onto my row space will
be this guy right here.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.680
And that just comes from our--
well there are two ways to

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.030
think about it-- we could say
that this is the solution

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.110
right here.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.480
We could say our solution right
here is equal to some

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.595
member of my row space plus some
member of my null space.

00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:48.820
This is the row space.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.370
That is the null space.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.050
And so by the definition of a
projection onto a subspace I

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.740
just gave you, we know that
the projection of this

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.510
solution onto my-- let me write
a little bit-- onto my

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:09.260
row space of my solution,
is just equal

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.330
to this first thing.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.640
It's equal to the component of
it that's in my row space.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.800
It's other component, we could
call it, is in the orthogonal

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.290
complement of my row space.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.310
Or it's in my null space.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.600
So this is just going to be
equal to the R vector.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.220
Now, I want to show you that
that is essentially equal to

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.760
the definition that
we did before.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.100
That this is completely
identical to the definition of

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.750
a projection onto a line because
in this case the

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.900
subspace is a line.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.090
So let's find a solution set.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.820
And the easiest one, the easiest
solution that we could

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.370
find is if we set C as
equal to 0 here.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.973
We know that x equals 3, 0 is
one of these solutions.

00:13:48.973 --> 00:13:52.000
So x equals 3, 0 looks
like that.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.560
So we know x equals 3,
0 is a solution.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.020
And what we want to do
is we want to find

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.530
the shortest solution.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.450
Or we want to find the
projection of x

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.490
onto the row space.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.930
Or if we wanted, we could also
think of it is a projection of

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.190
x onto this line.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.240
This line is equal
to the row space.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.130
So let's do that.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.580
And I'm doing this to show you
that this definition of a

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.790
projection onto a subspace that
I've just introduced you

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.790
to in this video, it is
completely identical to the

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.500
definition, or it's not
identical, it's consistent

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.660
with the definition of a
projection onto a line.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.400
Although this is more general
because a subspace doesn't

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.150
have to be a line.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.270
But in this case it is a line.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.350
So let's do that.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:45.930
So the projection of the vector
3, 0 onto our row

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.610
space, which is a line so we
can use that formula, it is

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:56.320
equal to 3, 0 dot the
spanning vector for

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.950
our row space, right?

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.780
Dot the spanning vector
for our row space.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.600
So it's 3, minus 2.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.620
There's a bunch of spanning
vectors for your row space.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.460
This is just the one we
happened to pick.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:12.160
So dot 3, minus 2 all
over the spanning

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.920
vector dotted with itself.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.410
3, minus 2 dot 3, minus 2.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.770
And then this is just going to
be one big scalar and then we

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.220
want to multiply that-- or
essentially scale up-- our

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.140
actual spanning vector
by that.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.070
So this is a projection of
this solution onto my row

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.010
space, which should give me
this vector right here.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.250
Because we're just taking a
projection onto a line,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.780
because a row space in this
subspace is a line.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.380
And so we used the linear
projections that we first got

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.170
introduced to, I think, when I
first started doing linear

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.560
transformations.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:53.640
So let's see this is 3 times
3 plus 0 times minus 2.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.230
This right here is equal to 9.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:03.090
This is 3 times 3 plus minus
2 times minus 2.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.840
So that's 9 plus 4.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.180
That's 13.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.960
So it's 9/13 times this
vector right here.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.160
So it's going to be equal
to 9/13 times the

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.230
vector 3, minus 2.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:24.590
Which is equal to the vector
27/13 and then minus 18/13,

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.830
which is this vector
right here.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.910
We got this exact answer when
we first did it, although we

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.230
just didn't use the projection
onto a line.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.410
But now we see that this is
exactly consistent with what

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.500
we did before.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.480
We just used the projection
onto a line.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.560
And we see that this is
consistent with our new,

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.655
broader definition
of a projection.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.040
Here we were able to do it
because we did it onto a line.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:56.350
But here I'm calling a
projection onto any subspace.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.800
We know how to do it if it's a
line, but so far I've just

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.310
kind of defined it onto
an arbitrary subspace.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.300
But I haven't giving you a nice
mathematical, I guess, or

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.280
computational way to figure out
what this is going to be

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.010
if this isn't a line.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.140
In fact, I haven't even shown
you when this is general,

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.770
whether this is definitely
a linear transformation.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.849
We know that when you take the
projection onto the line it's

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:17.760
a linear transformation.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.810
But I haven't shown you that
when we take a projection onto

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.490
an arbitrary subspace that it
is a linear projection.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.630
I'll do that in the
next video.
