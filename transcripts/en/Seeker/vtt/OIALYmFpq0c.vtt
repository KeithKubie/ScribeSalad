00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.229
A bartender once asked a patron, hey What
is the matter

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:06.959
The guy at the bar replied: matter is anything
which has mass and occupies space

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:11.750
haha no but seriously what is matter?

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.750
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.620
It’s one of the basic things you learn about
in science class.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.010
The difference between solid, liquid, and
gas.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.090
Objects can move through different states
of matter depending on the density of their

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.090
particles.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.630
Solids exist when their particles become so
densely packed together they don’t move

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.810
around so much.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.340
And their atoms don’t move at all, they’re
in a fixed position.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.059
Solids don’t change shape based on what
container their in.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.670
In liquid atoms can move freely, but they
remain touching.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.879
These particles are held together by weak
intermolecular attraction.

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.290
You might remember that it takes the shape
of whatever container it’s in, but still

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.239
retains a consistent density, like a subway
car during rush hour.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.839
Gases on the other have have no volume or
real shape.

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.469
Their molecules are too far apart.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.960
But they bounce against each other a lot so
a gas will expand indefinitely.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.850
Because of this bouncing, gases have a high
kinetic energy.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.760
Plasma, while not so common here on Earth,
is found throughout the Universe and might

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.369
even be the most abundant form of matter in
the universe!

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.770
You might recognize plasma in that glowing
gas that makes Neon signs glow.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.170
Or maybe from our sun!

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.490
Which is just big ball of burning gas roiling
into a plasma.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.530
When gas gets energized, electrons get freed
from atoms and makes ions, turning the gas

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.530
into a plasma.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.560
Plasmas, like gas, take the shape of whatever
contain they’re in and are really good conductors

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.920
for magnetic fields and electricity.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.500
So that’s the big four of states of matter.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.340
But is that all there is to the story?

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.109
Just like the recent additions to the periodic
table were made in a lab, so were these new

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.799
states of matter: Bose-Einstein condensates,
degenerate matter, supersolids and superfluids,

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.590
and quark-gluon plasma, which is created inside
of particle accelerators.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.689
And the latest edition: Jahn–Teller metals.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.909
An international team of researchers published
their findings the journal Science Advances.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.930
The researchers created a new type of material
that could change the way we make electronics.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.700
A Jahn-Teller metal does all kind of things,
it acts like insulator, superconductor, metal,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.700
magnet.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.749
But its superconducting properties are the
most interesting.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:59.900
Superconductors are super exciting.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.969
They’re currently used in MRI machines,
making digital circuits, and in highly sensitive

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.689
scientific equipment like particle detectors.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.060
These materials can transfer electricity without
resistance or losing any energy through heat

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.060
or sound.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.140
Unfortunately, these materials only work when
it’s super cold, like -405 degrees fahrenheit.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.940
Which costs a lot of money to cool down.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.351
But this discovery can conduct at a “high”
critical temperature, -211 degrees, which

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.790
could be cheaper and more versatile.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.440
The material is composed of buckyballs, which
are a type of round molecule made up of carbon.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.640
Rubidium atoms put pressure on these molecules
and control the distance between them, changing

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.440
the phases the material goes through.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.660
It can shift from an insulator to a metal.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.230
Let me put that in English, by changing the
pressure on the material, it can change the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.880
way it conducts electricity.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.551
It doesn’t conduct well at low pressure,
and basically acts like an insulator, but

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.380
at high pressure becomes a metal.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.990
But during this transition, it’s in a state
that’s never been seen before!

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.380
It still looks like an insulator, but the
electrons can move around just like in a conductor.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.260
While we’re still a long way off from using
this material practically, it’s still really

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.260
cool.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.450
It could be one step on the way to high-temperature
superconductivity.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.360
Speaking of what’s the matter… what about
dark matter?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.480
We may have evidence that it exists!

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:26.490
Julian breaks down subatomic particles and
explains why 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.130
in this video.
