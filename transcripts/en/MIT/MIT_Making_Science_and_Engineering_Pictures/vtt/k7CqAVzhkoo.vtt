PROFESSOR: In our
tutorials, published

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.540
on MIT'S OpenCourseWare,
we're going

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.040
to take a look at how you can
use a flatbed scanner to create

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.410
images of
three-dimensional objects,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.610
like microfluidics devices,
Petri dishes, and other sorts

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.660
of material you're creating
or working with in your lab.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.510
We want to encourage you
to capture your material

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.400
in a number of ways and
probably most important to learn

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.350
to see in the process.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.710
You'll see lots more
when you go to the site,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.830
and that's a promise.
