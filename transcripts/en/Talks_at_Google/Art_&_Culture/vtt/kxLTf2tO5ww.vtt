00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.192
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:08.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.760
BRENDAN COLLINS: Hi everyone.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.890
Welcome.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.940
I'm Brendan Collins.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.060
This is special Talks At event
that we have for you today.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.270
Pleased to be welcoming
some folks from the show

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.970
"Natasha, Pierre, and
the Great Comet of 1812."

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.460
It's a fantastic, incredible
musical unlike anything

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.310
you've ever seen.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.670
So just to quickly
intro the four guests--

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.240
Dave Malloy.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.070
He's the writer and
composer of the show.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.870
Rachel Chavkin is the director.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.460
Brittain Ashford plays Sonya.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.680
And Josh Groban plays the
title character of Pierre.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.810
So please join me in
welcoming Dave, Rachel,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.078
Brittain, and Josh.

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:40.518
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.210
Welcome.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.900
Welcome.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.691
JOSH GROBAN: Oh no.

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:53.420
I'm going to blend
into the curtain.

00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:57.050
BRENDAN COLLINS:
Google camouflage.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.300
We're working on it.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.850
So welcome.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.600
Thanks for coming.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.640
So just to quickly--

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.473
I know a bunch of people
have seen the show.

00:01:03.473 --> 00:01:06.200
But for those of you
who haven't, the show

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.660
is an adaptation of a small
chunk of "War and Peace," which

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.990
might not strike you as Broadway
material right off the bat.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.640
But it basically
tells the story--

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.912
it's a complicated
Robert Altman-esque

00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:17.870
weaving of a lot of story
lines and characters.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.620
But it basically tracks Natasha
and Pierre and their two lives

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.540
as they intersect in 19th
century aristocrat Russia.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.860
But as you saw in the clip, it's
a pretty incredible experience.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.370
It's a genre-bending
kind of whirlwind

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.252
that never comes up for air.

00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:37.460
And it's an incredible thing.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.043
And one of the best
descriptions of it

00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:42.410
comes from Anthony Tommasini
from the "New York Times."

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.810
And forgive me when I
flatter you to your faces,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.210
but Mr. Malloy especially.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.010
The show lifts styles
with such abandon,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.810
making willful shifts
from punk rifts

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.400
to agitated Broadway
ballads, mock pompous

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.030
recitative to gritty
Russian folk songs,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.020
or drinking Corson's
with klezmer clarinets.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.520
You eventually lose track of
what is being appropriated

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.040
and you stop caring.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.620
So the result is almost like--

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.160
you know, it's a pastiche,
like a Tarantino, almost,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.660
experience.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.400
So the first
question is for Dave.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.230
So you're the
creator of the show.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.980
DAVE MALLOY: Sure.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.602
BRENDAN COLLINS:
Thank you I know

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:15.810
you've told the story before.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.185
But how did you come up with
the idea for a musical based

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:19.035
on "War and Peace."

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:20.660
DAVE MALLOY: I mean,
it was really just

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.679
upon reading the novel
for the first time.

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:24.470
For whatever reason
this particular section

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.551
immediately sang out to me.

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:27.050
Yeah.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.640
I famously was working on
a cruise ship at the time.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.150
So I was in a very
particular mental space.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.404
And I was actually feeling
very, very much a social misfit

00:02:36.404 --> 00:02:37.070
aboard the ship.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.060
I was working on the ship.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.809
And it just wasn't
really my social scene.

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.360
So I really related
to Pierre, who

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.175
is this character who was just
a profoundly awkward person.

00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:46.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.470
And yeah.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.340
I just really related
to his sense of kind

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.250
of being kind of
lost in this society

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.400
and not quite knowing how
to act, and really also just

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.930
super searching, and having--

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.550
Pierre is this deeply
philosophical, spiritually

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.290
lost character.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.456
And throughout the entire
novel he's just searching.

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:05.030
So when I read this particular--
when I was reading the novel

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.196
I was so relating to Pierre.

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:08.349
And then I got to this
particular 70-page section.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.890
And there was
something about the way

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.750
that Tolstoy wove
the two stories

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.560
of Pierre's existential
crisis, and then Natasha

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.360
having this first romantic
disaster of her young life,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.567
and the way that these
two stories kind of ran

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:24.650
in parallel for a while,
and then intersected just

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.250
at the very end.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.208
And it really just reminded
me of the structure

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:28.710
of a classic musical--

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.890
the kind of two couple
structure of two stories

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.380
kind of running in parallel
that intersect at one point.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.880
And I loved how it
kind of subverted

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.754
that, in that it wasn't
too romantic couples.

00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:39.830
It was one romantic couple
and one spiritual couple.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.617
You know, Pierre and God, or
Pierre and existence, or Pierre

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:43.700
and the rest of the world.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.658
BRENDAN COLLINS: Right.

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.820
So you take that seed from the--

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.200
whatever cruise ship you're on.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.890
How do you get it to the first
staging, which was at Ars Nova?

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.491
Any Ars Nova fans in the house?

00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:52.990
Whoo!

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.489
Cool.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.087
Anyways, how do you take that
idea and bring it on stage?

00:03:57.087 --> 00:03:58.170
DAVE MALLOY: I mean, yeah.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.044
The terrifying thing-- the
thing about the Ars Nova is they

00:04:02.044 --> 00:04:03.710
had seen another show
of mine, "Beowulf,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.335
A Thousand Years of
Baggage," which was

00:04:05.335 --> 00:04:06.620
a rock opera based on Beowulf.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.130
And based on the
strength of that,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.580
they invited me to be their
composer in residence one year.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.559
And so being a
composer in residence,

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:14.850
you get a commission from them.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.070
So they're like, you know,
what do you want to do?

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.390
What's your dream project to do?

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.973
And so I had had this "War and
Peace" idea kind of tucked away

00:04:19.973 --> 00:04:21.290
in the back of my head.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.790
And I very sheepishly-- like
thoroughly expecting to be shot

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.280
down--

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.190
offered this idea.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.420
Like, well, what
if we did a musical

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.170
based on a little bit
of "War and Peace"?

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.720
And this is like a 90-seat
theater, a very, very small

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.220
theater.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.020
So I thought they'd be like,
why don't we try something that

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.270
maybe just has two characters?

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.320
You know, something very small.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.520
But much to my-- yeah.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.592
Much to my surprise and horror,
they enthusiastically said yes.

00:04:44.592 --> 00:04:45.800
And then I was like, oh, god.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.280
So now I have to write it?

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.680
BRENDAN COLLINS:
Well, you know, it's

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.290
just amazing how it's
evolved over the years.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.590
Because when-- it premiered at
Ars Nova in 2012, I believe.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.510
So Rachel, actually,
you've also been

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.360
involved with the show since
its inception at Ars Nova.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.040
And you've been right
there alongside Dave

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.450
as you've sort of helped it
evolve into the amazing thing

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.410
that it's become.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.550
So over the years--

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.660
and the set itself.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.350
You caught a glimpse
of it in the clip.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.780
But it looks like if Tolstoy
had a mansion in Palm Springs,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.840
basically.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.730
It's this amazing throwback.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.690
But it's also a little run down.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.660
And it's just-- it's
such a visceral thing.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.770
JOSH GROBAN: It is now.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.100
RACHEL CHAVKIN: We're
trying to maintain it.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.290
BRENDAN COLLINS: Yeah.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.248
A lot of wear and tear.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.770
But there's some
amazing statistics

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.010
about the actual set.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.440
So there's 262
individual light bulbs

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.490
in 31 chandeliers on the set.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.480
And there's 126,000 Swarovski
crystals in the costumes.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.530
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.430
BRENDAN COLLINS: How
do you maintain--

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.160
but from starting in
a 90-person theater,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.534
how do you maintain
that intimacy

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:50.855
as you go to 1,400 seats?

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:51.730
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.060
I mean, I think the really
wonderful thing about how

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.930
the show developed and
moved to Broadway--

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.090
because all four of us made our
Broadway debuts with this show,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.370
as did almost the entirety
of our creative team

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.910
and almost the
entirety of our cast.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.890
So this is really a show that
has come from the pavement

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.930
to Broadway.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.150
And what's been wonderful
about that journey

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.330
is that it grew slowly.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.290
So starting with
87 seats, we really

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.320
figured out, in the poorest
theater sense of the word,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.230
what was essential and what
was the DNA of the show.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.500
Which very much-- there
is a huge amount of--

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.670
there is no fourth wall.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.490
And there literally can't be,
because the set is everywhere.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.420
The actors are constantly
swirling around the audience

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.530
and behind the audience.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.980
And that was the case
even at Ars Nova.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.100
And one of the big reasons for
that was because, you know,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.020
when you're reading a novel, you
have this incredibly intimate

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.780
experience.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.390
It's a one-on-one experience.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.820
And either the character
is talking directly

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.860
to you, or in the
case of Tolstoy,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.050
that narration is
directly to you.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.350
So getting that DNA
in place at Ars Nova,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.510
which forced such intimacy--

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.220
I mean, we were exploding
out that theater space--

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.960
meant that when the
time came to get bigger,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.960
it was never a question
of what the DNA was.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.610
It was never a
question as to what

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.670
we would be enlarging, just
how we were going to do it.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.250
And so along the
way, that's been--

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.590
we went from 10 performers--

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.950
10 actors, I should
say-- and a band of six

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.380
at Ars Nova, just
the 10 principals,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.780
to adding an ensemble of six.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.180
And then when we transferred
to ART, which was slightly

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.150
over 500 seats, that grew to an
ensemble, full, onstage, of 24.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.090
And then now on Broadway
it's 30 people on stage.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.280
And one of the
reasons for that is

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.770
to make sure that we
have enough actors

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.790
to take care of as many
audience sections as we have.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.932
But the look of
the show has been

00:07:57.932 --> 00:07:59.140
the same since the beginning.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.340
It's red velvet curtains.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.160
And Mimi calls it being
inside a Faberge egg,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.660
or like a dream of Russia--

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.270
Mimi Lien who is our scenic
designer, has been obviously

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.790
a huge partner in this.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.740
BRENDAN COLLINS: And
it's really amazing.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.512
You kind of just
hit it on the head.

00:08:12.512 --> 00:08:14.470
I was trying to figure
out how you translate it

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.500
as it gets bigger and bigger.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.124
And as you have, you
mentioned, the DNA

00:08:17.124 --> 00:08:19.867
of the show, that can
scale sort of endlessly.

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:20.700
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yes.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.649
Exactly.

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:24.190
BRENDAN COLLINS: But at the same
time as all of this stuff is

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.020
happening, you mentioned it's--

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.680
not chaotic.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.300
But it's a swirl all the time.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.930
But the story itself
is really grounded.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.710
And it's a pretty universal
experience of, you know,

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:42.070
first crush, heartache,
loss, jealousy, power.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.549
How do you keep the story as
the focus the whole time amidst

00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:46.840
all this other stuff happening?

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.715
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:50.110
I mean, I love-- that chaos
that you're talking about

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.480
is definitely my favorite
thing to see onstage.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.020
And I can say confidently there
are moments in the production

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.270
now that I still
have never seen,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.580
that are like tiny
moments where--

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.110
like at one time,
I was sitting--

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.790
and this was staged.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.860
I mean, all of it's
staged in some way.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.350
But during the duel
scene, which takes place

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.070
in a modern nightclub
setting within that space,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.210
two people came over and
snorted lines off my table.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.410
And you're like, oh, wow!

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.340
I saw that.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.490
And the person right next
to me probably didn't.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.540
But I think in terms of
the story being grounded,

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.260
it goes back to Dave's
initial question and response,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.280
which is it's very pure
what the work is doing.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.870
These two strands--

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.100
Natasha's rise and
downfall and Pierre's

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.010
spiritual resurrection.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.940
And so when you have an
environment where everyone

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.470
knows what story
they're telling,

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.340
that actually allows for a huge
amount of individual freedom

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.100
within the larger structure.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.400
And so I think
constantly as a cast,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.430
we would just check in about
what the central story was

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.720
of a given scene, and how all
elements of the choreography--

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.230
which Sam Pinkelton has
been a huge partner in--

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.590
how all elements are
driving towards telling

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:19.390
the story of Pierre's
nightmare party, or almost

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.010
like Natasha's
bar mitzvah or bat

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.650
mitzvah during the
[INAUDIBLE] sequence.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.270
So it's just staying grounded in
the really simple human action

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.040
that's at the center
of any moment.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.590
BRENDAN COLLINS: So related
to watching the show grow

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.270
into what it's become,
Brittain, you've

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.090
also been involved with the
show since its early days.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.160
So aside from the venue,
what's changed the most?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.790
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Oh.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.140
I mean, it's crazy to me.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.780
Because it's the venue
that has changed the most.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.900
To me it's like the
story remains the same.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.450
To me, the intimacy--

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.230
despite any reservations
I initially had--

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.720
ultimately is very
similar to me.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.970
So it's kind of the size and
the scope of the audience

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.320
that we're able to reach.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.730
Obviously our audience
itself is different.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.230
You know, the type of people
who are willing to venture over

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.160
to 10th Avenue to Ars Nova
to an 88-seat cabaret theater

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.770
is different than
the average audience

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.220
goer who might be really
excited to come see Josh.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.590
It's ultimately a
different audience.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.280
I mean, there are folks
who come see the show who

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.440
know very little of Broadway,
but love Josh's work,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.080
so they want to see it, or
know very little of Josh's work

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.140
and just know Broadway shows,
so they want to see it.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.370
And then there's some people
who are just, like, I've

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.495
heard this is a great show.

00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:41.320
So I want to see it.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.310
It's a much wider net
than we ever had before,

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.700
which is very exciting.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.020
But the thing that I'm
most proud about the show,

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.280
like from start to
where we are now,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.400
is maintaining that intimacy.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.350
In part because I
love the show so much.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.609
And I never would have
thought, at the beginning--

00:12:02.609 --> 00:12:04.650
you know, when Dave
approached me with this idea,

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.290
I thought, oh, well,
that sounds great.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.667
I-- I don't know.

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:10.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.100
You know?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.516
Like, oh, that
sounds really cool.

00:12:12.516 --> 00:12:13.350
Really?

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.410
BRENDAN COLLINS: Yeah.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.290
Did he call you from the cruise
ship to pitch you his idea?

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.220
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: No.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.750
JOSH GROBAN: [INAUDIBLE] flare.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.458
DAVE MALLOY: I had to
ply her with a beer

00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:21.750
to convince her to do it.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.550
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: This is true.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.250
It was like, hey,
meet me at this bar.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.390
I was like, cool.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.660
Uh-- and he was like, OK,
I've got this great idea.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.520
And I was like, oh.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.599
Um, no, I don't think I'm
the person you want for that.

00:12:33.599 --> 00:12:35.140
And he was like,
here's another beer.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.090
And I was like, I'm pretty sure
I'm still not the person you

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.690
want for this.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.953
And he was like, how
about one more beer.

00:12:41.953 --> 00:12:42.800
RACHEL CHAVKIN: How
about a whiskey?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.010
JOSH GROBAN: That's kind of
what I did to Dave to get

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.180
him to hire me, actually.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.806
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:48.180
BRENDAN COLLINS:
I was actually--

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.638
because I've heard, Josh, in
other interviews you mentioned

00:12:50.638 --> 00:12:53.010
that story of over
a drink or five,

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.830
you hashed out the
arrangement to join the show.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.330
So, I mean, you're
obviously used

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.820
to performing consistently
and regularly.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.367
But acting with other people
onstage was a new thing.

00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:04.200
JOSH GROBAN: It was.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.320
I hadn't done proper
theater since senior year

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.050
of high school.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.540
So I had some concert
versions of shows.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.470
I had been a part of
some really wonderful

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.520
Broadway-themed
musical experiences.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.130
But this was something that
was altogether new for me,

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.080
and something that was
an opportunity for me

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.830
to get scared again, to
really learn a great deal,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.780
to be a cog in a
really beautiful wheel,

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:33.000
instead of spending 15
years in a solo spotlight.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.250
To be a part of an ensemble,
to be part of a show

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.060
where everybody has
each other's back

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.520
and is equally responsible for
telling this beautiful story

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.201
every night was something that
was really, really appealing

00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:44.700
to me.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.910
And I always loved this show.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.370
I was a fan of it since
I saw it in the tent

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.470
when it was in the
Meatpacking District.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.570
Loved the character.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:59.490
Found every character in the
show to be very relatable even

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.710
in a contemporary environment.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.022
And just-- I had read
a blurb that they

00:14:04.022 --> 00:14:05.980
were thinking of bringing
this to a proscenium,

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.950
that they were thinking
of transforming a Broadway

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.450
theater.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.304
And I think for those
of us that had loved

00:14:10.304 --> 00:14:11.970
the show for a long
time, we all kind of

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.610
were equally excited and maybe
a little skeptical about,

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.230
is that going to work?

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.360
But I was so intrigued.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.740
And I thought, this is a chance
to really take a risk here

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.180
and try something that would be
a creative masterclass for me.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.650
And so I did.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.430
I reached out.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.950
And it turned into drinks
with Rachel and Dave.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.350
And it really was just
a creative conversation

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.800
about what we believed, how
we believed in the show,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.465
and what we saw in the show,
and whether or not it would fit.

00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:42.840
And then I wound up singing
some of the material for Dave

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.630
at my apartment.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.350
And it just wound up
being a natural fit.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.030
I in no way, shape,
or form ever wanted

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.720
to nudge my way into
something like this.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.430
This was a show that was very
special for me, too, as a fan.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.480
And so it had to
be the right fit.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.950
But thankfully, through
Dave and Rachel's belief

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.860
that it could work, and
our hard work, it paid off.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.520
BRENDAN COLLINS: So Josh, you
and Brittain-- separately,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.322
your kind of day
jobs are singers

00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:11.280
and performers and
musicians in your own right.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:11.790
So--

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.660
BRITTAIN ASHFORD:
Day job is a stretch.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.490
Because Josh actually gets paid.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.364
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:16.364 --> 00:15:18.030
BRENDAN COLLINS: But
the principle-- for

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.375
love of the game, right?

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:20.250
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: OK.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.850
BRENDAN COLLINS: You
moonlight as Broadway stars,

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.780
is what I'm saying.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.490
So do you find it
interesting or challenging

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.580
to go from your onstage
persona during the show back

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.780
to your own music?

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.827
Has that been interesting?

00:15:33.827 --> 00:15:34.910
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Uh, yes?

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.640
Yes and no.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.300
Honestly, I don't have a ton
of time to do my own stuff.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.760
But I found-- I went on
a tour over the summer.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.460
And it's like, this is
actually more my scene.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.370
Like, when I play a show,
this is the kind of room

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.809
I'm used to playing.

00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:49.350
So it's nice.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.266
Because I can be like,
hey, I like your shirt.

00:15:51.266 --> 00:15:51.810
Oh, Michigan.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.660
Yeah!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.640
You know?

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.600
I can do that.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.210
Whereas, you can't
do that on Broadway.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.430
That's not cool.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.180
JOSH GROBAN: But the
eye to eye connection

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.285
is probably pretty similar.

00:16:02.285 --> 00:16:02.430
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Yes.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.180
It's very similar.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.730
So in that aspect, I think I
was well prepared for that.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.480
But I think it might
be different for you.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.610
JOSH GROBAN: It was.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.940
One of the things Rachel
and I really had to work on

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.560
was getting used to
that kind of intimacy

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.994
that I had not been used to,
especially on the tour that I

00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:20.910
had just come off of,
where you're looking out

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.020
at kind of an abyss of people.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.620
And it's very easy, if you're
feeling nervous or feeling

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.250
whatever, to just kind of
zone out and look at the mass.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.140
And you've got,
usually, the front row

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.750
of people who paid a lot and
are just kind of over it,

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.260
and then like--

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.740
and you can't really see
the superfans way out

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.060
in the back seats.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.820
So it was a little
jarring, I think, at first,

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:48.900
especially singing a show
during my concert tour which

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.050
was very much in a style that
I've been doing for 15 years,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.730
and then taking
on a role which we

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.580
knew I'd have to kind of rough
up the edges a little bit,

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.080
vocally and emotionally,
to get into.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.500
But in the rehearsals,
Rachel really

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.010
made sure that we had people
to look at every time,

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.535
and to not be afraid to
be kept honest by people

00:17:08.535 --> 00:17:10.410
that were right in front
of you at all times.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.079
And that was a different
experience for me.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:17.460
But it's one that has been
rewarding, and one that--

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.607
I will now bother the
people in my front row

00:17:19.607 --> 00:17:20.690
when I do my concerts now.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.824
Because it's too much fun.

00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:22.740
BRENDAN COLLINS: Yeah.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.230
Related to that,
it's interesting.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.730
Because you can't sit in the
front row of this show and just

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.694
be over it.

00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:28.860
The show happens around you.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.600
JOSH GROBAN: Oh, you still can.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.552
BRITTAIN ASHFORD:
You definitely can.

00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:31.030
JOSH GROBAN: You definitely can.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.220
Yeah.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.344
There is some stink eye
during the bows where we're

00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:35.744
just like, you [MUTTERING]

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:36.839
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:38.130
BRENDAN COLLINS: But there is--

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.950
I mean, granted, that's true.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.950
But--

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.825
JOSH GROBAN: Like, why
did you buy that seat?

00:17:42.825 --> 00:17:44.651
Sir, why did you buy
that seat if you're

00:17:44.651 --> 00:17:45.900
gonna to look at us that way--

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.175
BRITTAIN ASHFORD:
My wife bought it.

00:17:46.175 --> 00:17:47.010
My wife bought it.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.970
JOSH GROBAN: My wife bought it.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.826
My wife bought this seat.

00:17:48.826 --> 00:17:50.201
BRITTAIN ASHFORD:
I hate theater.

00:17:50.201 --> 00:17:51.010
Ugh.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.634
RACHEL CHAVKIN: But
you also never know

00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:54.200
who's receiving something.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.550
JOSH GROBAN: That's true.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:54.810
People--

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.184
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Like actually,
it's sort of extraordinary

00:17:57.184 --> 00:17:59.700
how individual--

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.280
I mean, it's something that
Dave has talked about a lot.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.927
But how much the setting
feels like Tolstoy, in that--

00:18:08.927 --> 00:18:10.510
one of the reasons
the book is so long

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.600
is because Tolstoy's ambition
is to talk about all of Russia,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.630
from the low to the high,
from the young to the old.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:21.130
And so we have done that by
casting 1,200 plus people

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.590
in our show, which
is the audience.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.730
And so you get this incredible
mixture of humanity.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.430
And one of the best
things in the world

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:35.590
is to watch someone receive
Natasha during her area,

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.670
during "No One Else."

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.580
And she leans over and
is like, dear diary,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.390
I'm in love for the first time,
and I'm looking at the moon.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:46.030
And that's absolutely a
one-on-one relationship

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.230
with a single person who's
with this 19-year-old,

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:52.180
and in her brain.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.000
And that's an incredibly
romantic thing.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.690
And it's very special
to be that person.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.080
But it's also equally
wonderful to watch

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.450
that person receive,
and sort of blossom

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.891
if they're open to the contact.

00:19:03.891 --> 00:19:05.890
JOSH GROBAN: You can tell
a lot about the person

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.350
by how they respond to
especially that scene.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.926
There's the people that look
at Natasha and go, been there,

00:19:11.926 --> 00:19:12.900
yeah.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.316
And then there's the people
who are just, like, I've never

00:19:15.316 --> 00:19:17.260
felt love in my life.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.510
Be gone, child.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.010
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: One of the
things I really enjoy, and it's

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.870
kind of an unexpected
thing, is when

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.360
you don't think someone
is having a good time.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.920
Because they are
very close to you.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.003
And they're sitting there.

00:19:28.003 --> 00:19:29.830
And they're like--
you think this.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.337
This is my personal
inner monologue.

00:19:33.337 --> 00:19:34.420
It's like, they hate this.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.440
Why are they here?

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.023
And then they're the
person at the end

00:19:37.023 --> 00:19:38.904
of the show who's like--

00:19:38.904 --> 00:19:40.380
standing up.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.125
You're like, where
did that come from?

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:43.564
I did not see that coming.

00:19:43.564 --> 00:19:45.480
DAVE MALLOY: Actually,
my wife is a performer.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.010
And whenever I go to
her shows I actually

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.010
have to sit in the back.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.140
Because apparently I have
a terrible audience face.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.660
RACHEL CHAVKIN: You have
a terrible audience face.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.640
DAVE MALLOY: Because
I'm just like--

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.440
But I'm just soaking it all in.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.990
Like, I'm not making-- it's
just all happening in my head.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.790
And after the show, I'm like,
oh my god, it was so amazing.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.190
You were like-- and
she's like, really?

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.640
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: He does this
when you have dinner with him,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.210
too, though.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.510
DAVE MALLOY: It's just
my thoughtful face.

00:20:10.047 --> 00:20:12.380
JOSH GROBAN: Resting thoughtful
face is what we call it.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.750
BRENDAN COLLINS: RTF, yeah.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.844
So speaking of--

00:20:14.844 --> 00:20:16.260
I love the idea
that Tolstoy tried

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.350
to write a book
about everything.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.220
You know, even the
title "War and Peace."

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.750
It's like, that's
half of everything

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.282
and the other half
of everything.

00:20:23.282 --> 00:20:25.240
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: I think
it's just everything.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.281
BRENDAN COLLINS: Exactly.

00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:27.902
But the casting for the show--

00:20:27.902 --> 00:20:29.610
I love that it-- you've
talked about this

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.110
in past interviews,
where you wanted

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.720
to have a similarly kind
of ecumenical approach

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.270
to, who is the star of the
show that is about everything?

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.270
And the characters
themselves are

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.010
kind of ciphers
for whoever happens

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.342
to be experiencing that thing.

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:43.050
So can you talk--

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.150
I mean, just to quickly call
out some people in the cast.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.150
It's incredibly diverse.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.680
So Natasha's played
by Denee Benton,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.280
who's an African American.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.440
Her understudy last week
while she was on vacation

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.521
is South Asian.

00:20:53.521 --> 00:20:56.020
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Well, one of--
and I should say, one of two.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.780
Denee has two
understudies, one of whom

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.990
is Southeast Asian, who
tragically apparently

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.135
is the first Southeast
Asian performer--

00:21:03.135 --> 00:21:04.260
BRENDAN COLLINS: Since "Bombay
Dreams" or something like that?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.900
RACHEL CHAVKIN: --in 10 years,
since "Bombay Dreams" to play--

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.530
a female-- to play a leading
principal role on Broadway.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.260
And then her other
understudy is a white actress

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.050
named Lauren Zakrin,
who's equally wonderful.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.007
But so-- yeah.

00:21:17.007 --> 00:21:17.715
Anyway, continue.

00:21:17.715 --> 00:21:17.970
BRENDAN COLLINS: Yeah.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:18.470
No.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.810
And the new Pierre-- this is not
a spoiler-- is Oak Onaodowan,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.537
who was from a little show--

00:21:23.537 --> 00:21:24.870
"Hamilton," I think it's called?

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:25.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.210
RACHEL CHAVKIN: I haven't--

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.850
JOSH GROBAN: [INAUDIBLE]
for a minute.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.170
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Can
you get me tickets?

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.170
BRENDAN COLLINS: But he's
also African American.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.280
And so you have this show
about 19th century Russia.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.360
And if you were--

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.512
your knee-jerk reaction would
be to not necessarily cast

00:21:37.512 --> 00:21:38.470
the people you've cast.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.094
So can you walk me
through the decision

00:21:40.094 --> 00:21:42.406
behind to make it what it is?

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:43.280
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Sure.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.835
You want-- I'll--

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:44.200
DAVE MALLOY: Ooh!

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.270
Well, I mean, yeah.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.377
One thing to start with--

00:21:46.377 --> 00:21:48.210
I think going back to
that idea that Tolstoy

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.030
was trying to talk
about everything

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.520
that was 19th century
Russia at that moment.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.560
And so we are taking
that story, but now we're

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.290
telling that story in 21st
century New York City,

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.040
and 21st century America.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.116
And so I think one
of the amazing things

00:22:02.116 --> 00:22:03.490
about the staging,
and what we've

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.615
been talking about and the
intimacy of the staging,

00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:07.710
is everyone is both the
character and themselves.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.320
We are very much this
troupe of actors in New York

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.931
City doing this story.

00:22:11.931 --> 00:22:12.430
So yeah.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.388
So we just wanted the
casting to reflect, well,

00:22:14.388 --> 00:22:16.170
what does 21st century
America look like?

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.150
In the same way that Tolstoy
was like, what does 19th century

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.858
Russia look like?

00:22:18.858 --> 00:22:21.500
And 21st century America
is beautifully diverse.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.990
So we wanted a
beautifully diverse cast.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.640
BRENDAN COLLINS: So yeah.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.300
That's lovely.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:27.799
Thank you.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.540
Just to quickly go back to the
audience participation element

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.590
to the show.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.440
Aside from the now
legendary phone

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.540
throwing incident of
2013-- and those of you

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.420
who know what I'm talking
about, look it up.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.120
The show-- it's incredible how--

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.980
you mentioned you
allow the audience

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.830
to be incredibly connected
to the people on stage.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.250
Have there been any special
moments, either one on one

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.440
or where people maybe
after the show come up

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.410
and say, oh, this meant a lot
to me because of X, Y, or Z,

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.100
or because someone on
stage did have a reaction

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.730
you weren't expecting?

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.890
RACHEL CHAVKIN: I think
there are so many.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.200
JOSH GROBAN: Lucas Steele,
who is so, so wonderful,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.430
plays Anatole.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.500
Whenever we're off stage
during intermission,

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.001
I always kind of debrief him
on the reaction of people.

00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:18.500
He has this flirty moment in
the top of the show where he'll

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.410
reach over and he'll maybe
scoot the date or the husband

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.510
to the side and
flirt with the wife.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.089
And he whispers in their ear.

00:23:25.089 --> 00:23:27.380
And then they always kind of
say something back to him.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.838
And then he goes
on with the scene.

00:23:28.838 --> 00:23:31.940
And there was one night
where it wasn't a whisper.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.380
He did the whisper into her ear.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.430
And she just-- we all could
hear her go, wow of wows!

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.785
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:44.060
And I think most of
them happen with Lucas.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.700
He also does this thing where he
scoots somebody over and tells

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.942
them about this Russian
custom where everybody

00:23:48.942 --> 00:23:50.150
has to sit down and be quiet.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.500
And he's got his mic right here.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.874
And the lady was
next to the mic.

00:23:52.874 --> 00:23:54.340
And she just goes, oh!

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:54.840
Oh

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.989
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:56.989 --> 00:23:57.530
I don't know.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.510
I just-- I like the Lucas
interactions because they're

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.380
usually the loudest.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.500
BRENDAN COLLINS: Yeah.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.177
And the character-- Lucas is a
very handsome man, I must say.

00:24:03.177 --> 00:24:04.010
JOSH GROBAN: Adonis.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.801
BRENDAN COLLINS: But
the character he plays

00:24:05.801 --> 00:24:08.282
is almost this ethereal
David Bowie come to earth.

00:24:08.282 --> 00:24:09.740
RACHEL CHAVKIN:
That was absolutely

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.750
the image for casting it.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.041
BRENDAN COLLINS: And so he
has a very striking presence

00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:14.140
whenever he's on stage.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.530
But so does kind of
everybody else in the show.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.150
JOSH GROBAN: Somebody on
Twitter called him a sex alien.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.358
BRENDAN COLLINS: A sex alien.

00:24:18.358 --> 00:24:19.100
Yeah.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.350
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: That's fair.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.807
JOSH GROBAN: That's
pretty much--

00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:24.140
BRENDAN COLLINS: So Rachel,
I'm glad you mentioned this.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.760
And I meant to mention this
at the top of the show--

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.800
that all four of you,
in addition to I think

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.950
19 other cast members and the
majority of the creative staff

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.710
are making their
debuts on Broadway.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.560
To have 19 people make
their debut in the same show

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.980
is virtually unheard of.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.880
I mean, when they bring
productions over from the West

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.500
End, sometimes that happens.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.990
But it's pretty unprecedented.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.280
So were you and Dave and
any of the other-- sort

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.800
of the brass behind the show--
were you nervous at all?

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.075
Or were you pretty confident?

00:24:51.075 --> 00:24:51.950
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.440
No, I mean, of course
we were nervous.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.370
Um--

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.890
DAVE MALLOY: There was
one running refrain

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.920
during rehearsals, and
during tech especially, where

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.590
Rachel and the
choreographer Sam Pinkleton

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.080
would be doing some thing
and trying to problem-solve

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.914
some bit of staging.

00:25:06.914 --> 00:25:08.746
And then one of them
would turn to the other

00:25:08.746 --> 00:25:10.790
and go, well, what do
they do in real Broadway?

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.742
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:25:11.742 --> 00:25:12.470
Yeah.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.020
Actually, our dance captain--

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.709
former dance captain-- Paloma
Garcia-Lee became the go-to.

00:25:19.709 --> 00:25:21.500
Because she's done a
lot of Broadway shows.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.900
And so we would say, what
would they do on real Broadway?

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.130
And then very nicely she titled
this extraordinary Broadway.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.900
And I mean, yes, of course we
were deeply nervous about it.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.500
And then also on the flip
side, I can't imagine--

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.840
I mean, again, because we've
gotten to grow this so slowly--

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.890
you know, we started development
of this show in 2011.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.040
There's no work of art I've ever
directed or probably will ever

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.850
direct that I know as
well as I know this show.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.340
And I love this show.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.390
And I know it's good.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.300
And we knew it
worked, and that it

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.730
had all the different
elements of high

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.830
and low and epic and
intimate, and was funny,

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.830
and is devastating emotionally.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.700
So in a sense, actually, I was
very delighted to find out,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.260
like, tech is tech is tech.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.740
And I've been training for that
since I began doing theater

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.670
when I was in college.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.450
So it felt sort of
at home, actually,

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.967
and has been really amazing.

00:26:21.967 --> 00:26:24.050
I went bowling last night
with the Broadway league

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.280
for the first time.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.010
And it's really wonderful
to walk into this community

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.310
and be like, ah, there's this
wonderful community here of all

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.607
these people who are making
a living, who are helping

00:26:33.607 --> 00:26:35.690
to run our city, who are
making our city the place

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.600
that I want to live in.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.640
And everyone's a bad bowler.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.574
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:41.574 --> 00:26:43.490
BRENDAN COLLINS: So we
have two audience mics.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.010
So if you want to line up and
ask questions of the cast,

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.218
we can do that in just a bit.

00:26:47.218 --> 00:26:50.169
But I have one more question for
the group before we open it up.

00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:51.710
So now it's pretty
common-- and Josh,

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.760
you mentioned that
you actually did

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.135
this when you saw the show
when it was in the Meatpacking

00:26:55.135 --> 00:26:56.380
District.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.879
You get a chance to meet a lot
of really established people,

00:26:59.879 --> 00:27:02.420
either in the Broadway community
or superfans who also happen

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.950
to be crazy mega celebrities.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.660
So was there anyone
that you've met

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.140
because of the show that
made you say, like, whoa,

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.390
this is real now?

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:14.384
This is sort of my
moment of arrival.

00:27:14.384 --> 00:27:16.050
DAVE MALLOY: Well,
Neil deGrasse Tyson--

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.966
JOSH GROBAN: I was going
to mention Dr. Tyson.

00:27:17.966 --> 00:27:18.750
DAVE MALLOY: Yeah.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.960
That was--

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.616
JOSH GROBAN: We have a
show about a great comet.

00:27:20.616 --> 00:27:22.690
And Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson
comes by you're like--

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.690
BRENDAN COLLINS: As long as he
didn't go to Twitter afterward

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.065
and say, like, actually, what
the comet would have done--

00:27:26.065 --> 00:27:27.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:28.844 --> 00:27:30.510
JOSH GROBAN: You know,
we've had a bunch

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.680
of people that have come by that
we've really been inspired by.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.990
I mean, it's a
little bit jarring,

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.640
especially when
they sit on stage

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.220
and, you know,
they're at a table.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.089
And you know, Dr. Tyson
was just to my left.

00:27:45.089 --> 00:27:46.380
And I'm singing the first song.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.310
And I'm just kind of--

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.319
all right, well.

00:27:48.319 --> 00:27:49.860
That's a whole set
of nerves I'm just

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.406
going to have a handle for
the next 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:53.960
Yeah.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.460
BRENDAN COLLINS: Lucas didn't
try to seduce him or anything?

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.543
JOSH GROBAN: No, he was
in the wrong seat for that

00:27:58.543 --> 00:27:59.160
unfortunately.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:27:59.993
BRENDAN COLLINS: OK.

00:27:59.993 --> 00:28:01.584
So we can take an
audience question.

00:28:01.584 --> 00:28:02.500
AUDIENCE: Hi everyone.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.580
Thanks for coming.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.120
I've seen the show twice and
was blown away both times.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.160
I completely fell
in love with it.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.442
And Josh, I've been a fan
of yours for a long time.

00:28:10.442 --> 00:28:11.400
JOSH GROBAN: Thank you.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.150
AUDIENCE: So yeah.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.230
I really love the show.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.620
Touching on the
audience participation,

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.230
has there ever been a time when
things have gone really wrong?

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.016
Like, there's a lot
of things to trip on.

00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:23.640
There are some times when maybe
the audience doesn't-- when you

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.430
try to participate with them,
that they may not react the way

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.230
you thought that
they would, or--

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.104
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:28:29.104 --> 00:28:30.290
I mean, the two--

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.940
the cell phone incident was
certainly a remarkable one

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.340
in many of our lives,
where a cell phone

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.690
was chucked across the space.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.040
That had nothing to do
with the show actually,

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.880
but was the audience
on themselves.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.100
I think probably the moment in
the show that's most open to--

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.870
it's like there's
a little bit of,

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.910
how's this gonna
go every night-- is

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:52.990
the passing of the letter to
Natasha at the top of Act Two.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.990
AUDIENCE: That took like
five minutes in my show

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.960
before the guy realized
what he was supposed to do.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.280
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Right.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.340
So-- right.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.550
So A, if it takes
a very long time

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:05.190
it can step on Lucas's moment,
who's singing his guts out.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.280
The audience member does
have to traverse some stairs.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.187
So there have been
things that happen there.

00:29:10.187 --> 00:29:12.270
And then there have been
equally wonderful things.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.170
Like one of my favorite moments,
that people still talk about

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.290
who were in the tent
production, is we had a woman,

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:24.750
quote unquote, "mom-dance
it" over to Natasha.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.680
And it was just wonderful.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.950
It was like whole dance
solo that happened

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.660
in the middle of the tent.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:35.730
So anyway, that's a moment
that's certainly open to, um,

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.890
fail blogs.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.530
BRENDAN COLLINS: But it's nice.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.550
It's almost like walking
on stage with a grenade.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.841
And you're about to pull the
pin, and you're just like,

00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:46.181
I hope I can get this away
from my body in enough time.

00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:47.430
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Pretty much.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.540
JOSH GROBAN: Every
night, you don't know.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.380
You don't know what
you're going to get,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.570
which keeps it
exciting for sure.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.422
BRENDAN COLLINS: We'll
take a question over here.

00:29:54.422 --> 00:29:56.130
AUDIENCE: Everyone,
thank you for coming.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.920
I have a question for
Brittain, actually.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.260
In your singing style, you bring
a very unique, almost folkish

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.914
style to the voice of Sonya.

00:30:05.914 --> 00:30:07.580
I was curious how you
conceived of that,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.720
and how that connects
to the character.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.510
BRITTAIN ASHFORD:
Well, I was born.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.620
And I don't know.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.540
I just-- I have been
singing since I was a kid.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.880
I never really had
any proper training.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.070
And I definitely listened to--
not even a lot of folk music.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:31.510
I listened to, pretty much, I
think, oldies when I was a kid.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.050
And I loved musical theater
when I was in high school.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:35.614
And I definitely
never got any parts

00:30:35.614 --> 00:30:37.030
when I was in high
school, I think

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.860
because I just didn't
understand how musicals worked,

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.110
and how I needed to be singing.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.320
Which is something I
really appreciate about--

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.900
something I actually really
love about being in this show

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.790
is that I am not a
"Broadway singer."

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.530
But it's just kind
of-- it's nothing

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.550
I've intentionally done.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.970
I've definitely been asked
if it's an affectation.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.050
Actually, a celebrity I
admire very, very, very much

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.570
came backstage and was
very complimentary,

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:09.508
but then asked me,
is that your voice?

00:31:09.508 --> 00:31:10.950
Or is that an affectation?

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.390
And I was like, uh, no, sir.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.940
That's my voice.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.220
It's so nice to meet you.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.435
JOSH GROBAN: Dr. Tyson.

00:31:19.435 --> 00:31:19.934
Yeah,

00:31:19.934 --> 00:31:20.228
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Dr. Tyson.

00:31:20.228 --> 00:31:20.728
No.

00:31:20.728 --> 00:31:21.550
It was not.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.520
It was not the good doctor.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:28.540
But yeah, I feel fortunate
that I can just sort of be me.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.110
And I know Dave, when he wrote
"Sonya Alone," he wrote it

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.800
for me--

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.675
DAVE MALLOY: For you.

00:31:33.675 --> 00:31:36.350
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: --based
on my music and my band.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.800
So in that sense, I
feel really lucky when

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.960
I just get to go in there
and I get to just do--

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.220
like, that's what I do.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.000
And I feel really lucky
to be able to do that.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.120
DAVE MALLOY: Well, and that's
a big thing actually for a lot

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.470
of the casting of this show.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.200
We don't cast people and
then tell them how to sing.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.600
We cast people who
sing in amazing ways.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.540
So I had known Brittain's solo
work as a singer-songwriter,

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.660
and just loved her voice.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.800
And so I very much wrote
the role for her voice.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.300
Yeah.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.120
And that's true--

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.911
I mean, that's true of
Josh's song as well.

00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:05.329
Josh has a big song in Act
One that was written newly

00:32:05.329 --> 00:32:06.370
for the Broadway version.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.390
"Dust and Ashes" was
written for Josh's voice.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:08.860
Because I'm like, ooh.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.240
Josh has a pretty good voice.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.480
Maybe I could write
a song for that.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.770
JOSH GROBAN: I am grateful.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.250
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: All I can--

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.560
BRENDAN COLLINS: You
should go pro with that.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.476
JOSH GROBAN: But yeah.

00:32:18.476 --> 00:32:21.290
To that point, I mean, for
me, just as a fan and muso

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.964
first, to be surrounded
by such uniqueness--

00:32:23.964 --> 00:32:26.380
and there is not a single
cookie cutter in any way, shape,

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.230
or form with anybody in the
creative cast, backstage

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.610
and on stage, with the show.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:31.690
There is so much nuance.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.540
There was so much deep
brilliance and uniqueness

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.140
to every single person that's
up there that, you know,

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.790
it felt very much like home.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.990
We all are coming
from different worlds.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.080
If you all the bios
in the playbill,

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.200
there are 10 projects that
every one of these Broadway cast

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.950
members have done before
they went to Broadway.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:51.940
This is not, for many
of us, not something

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.880
that is normal for us.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.060
So I think that's one
of the things that

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.350
makes the show so special.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.570
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.850
And if I can just
add on to that,

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.010
but that goes back to the
question about diversity.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:05.110
I mean, it's tragic
to me that we're still

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.450
having a conversation about
why it's revolutionary

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.880
that Oak or Denee should be
playing either of the titular

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.980
roles in a play set in
19th century Russia.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.990
But more so, actually,
or equally, in the cast

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.780
is this incredible diversity,
as Josh is talking about,

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.170
of talent and background.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.510
It's why there are
so many debuts.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:32.470
Because very few of us came up
through any sort of pipeline

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.800
to this moment.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.550
And the unpredictability
of that is

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.490
part of the chaos that is
in the culture of this show.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:42.970
And I think it's what makes it
such a nice place to live in.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.610
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: I also
think that if I had attempted

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.840
to pursue a musical life, a
musical theater life starting

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.774
from college, I would not
be the person I am now.

00:33:53.774 --> 00:33:54.940
I would not be in this show.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.860
I think I would
have been probably

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.950
thoroughly disappointed and
shut out a long time ago.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.702
I mean, or I just
kept making rock music

00:34:01.702 --> 00:34:02.660
in basements and stuff.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.404
I'd be fine.

00:34:04.404 --> 00:34:05.320
BRENDAN COLLINS: Cool.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.279
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:06.279 --> 00:34:06.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.530
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.239
Dave, this is a
question for you.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:13.120
Having played Pierre, but
also being the composer,

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.090
do you feel like you're
more self-critical of either

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.219
of those aspects of yourself?

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:21.040
Or is it just normal separation?

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.040
DAVE MALLOY: Oh, I'm
critical of every aspect.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.750
I mean, actually it
was an amazing thing.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.389
And you know, Rachel can
speak to the frustration

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:30.271
of having your lead--
one of your lead actors

00:34:30.271 --> 00:34:31.270
also being the composer.

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:32.534
Because I basically just--

00:34:32.534 --> 00:34:35.679
I didn't act until about
a week before we opened.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.469
Because like, I'll
be trying to act.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:40.300
And I'd be like, what
is the oboe doing?

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.389
And it's just very
hard for me to switch

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.159
those parts of my brain.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.650
So for me, actually, it was
such a gift and a blessing

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.654
to finally step out of the show.

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:52.070
And when we first did the show
at Ars Nova we were just 10

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.239
of us.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.364
There were no understudies.

00:34:53.364 --> 00:34:54.070
It was just us.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.600
So we just had to do the show.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.010
So I never had the
opportunity to step out.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.390
And when we finally
transferred off-Broadway,

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.540
we initially had understudies.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.060
And then people
took over the role.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.370
And then I was finally
actually able to step outside

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.100
of the acting and
just watch the writing

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.460
and just watch the composing.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.710
And then I was like, oh, yeah.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.240
There's some problems.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.740
Which is actually
one of the reasons

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.864
it was so great to be able
to come back to the work

00:35:13.864 --> 00:35:15.406
when we transferred
to ART in Boston,

00:35:15.406 --> 00:35:17.072
and to really expand
the role of Pierre.

00:35:17.072 --> 00:35:19.450
Because I think that actually
was kind of my blind spot.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.033
Because I was playing
Pierre at first,

00:35:21.033 --> 00:35:23.320
I didn't recognize
that, oh, he really

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.140
could have more meaty of a
story, especially in Act One.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.700
And so that was
what led to writing

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.660
the song "Dust and Ashes."

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.330
JOSH GROBAN: And I
should also mention

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.030
that Dave will be returning
to the role of Pierre--

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.180
DAVE MALLOY: [NERVOUS NOISE]

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:34.950
JOSH GROBAN: --for
a few select dates

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.640
in May that I am
very excited for.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.599
DAVE MALLOY: We decided
for those performances,

00:35:38.599 --> 00:35:40.181
instead of "Dust and
Ashes," I'll just

00:35:40.181 --> 00:35:41.590
be performing "My Ding-A-Ling."

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.155
JOSH GROBAN: Oh, I
love "My Ding-A-Ling."

00:35:43.155 --> 00:35:44.910
DAVE MALLOY: It's just
a much easier song.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:45.520
JOSH GROBAN: Oh, hell of a song.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.470
Hell of a song.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.610
DAVE MALLOY: So yeah.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:47.110
It's good.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:47.880
JOSH GROBAN: Yeah.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.105
The same rooted existential
agony in both songs.

00:35:52.105 --> 00:35:53.980
Which is actually an
interesting point, Dave.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:58.150
Because now, I mean,
especially with--

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.970
not necessarily that we're
in an era after "Hamilton."

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.060
But this idea that you can sort
of be a jack-of-all-trades,

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.580
and you can be the
person who wrote it--

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.250
it was your baby
from start to finish.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.290
And now you're in the show.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.900
Does that intimidate you
now that you're on Broadway?

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.150
To say, like, I
have to perform now.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.734
This is my thing.

00:36:16.734 --> 00:36:17.400
DAVE MALLOY: No.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.641
I mean, I'm so excited.

00:36:18.641 --> 00:36:19.140
Yeah.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.723
I mean, I haven't
done it yet, either.

00:36:20.723 --> 00:36:21.460
So who knows?

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.600
Maybe I'll just collapse,
just deer in the headlights.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.100
No.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.290
I'm so excited to go
back on and do it.

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.420
And yeah, the show
does feel like my baby.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.810
So to come back-- and
the role, especially.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.340
Again, Pierre is just my
favorite character in fiction.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.790
And he's the character
I relate to the most.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.555
So to be able to step
back into that role

00:36:39.555 --> 00:36:41.880
and embody it, in this
beautiful theater,

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.050
with this beautiful cast--

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.550
I'm so excited to do it.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.050
BRENDAN COLLINS:
And having seen now

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.910
a couple Pierres having
taken the mantle,

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.882
do you find that you're taking
bits of each performance

00:36:50.882 --> 00:36:52.840
and planning on incorporating
it into your own?

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.420
DAVE MALLOY: Tot--

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.740
I mean, I think that's happening
on a subconscious level,

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.070
for sure.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:56.760
It was so funny.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.470
When I first stepped out,
and would watch my understudy

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.803
for the first time, I'd go
to Rachel after a performance

00:37:01.803 --> 00:37:04.540
and go, you know, I usually
put my hand in my pocket there.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.810
And I noticed that
Luke didn't do that.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.426
Could you maybe
speak to him about--

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:10.800
it's pretty important that he
puts his hand in his pocket

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.280
right at that moment.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.047
And then Rachel
was like, OK, Dave.

00:37:14.047 --> 00:37:15.064
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:15.064 --> 00:37:16.980
But now I've learned
that different actors can

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.504
have different interpretations!

00:37:18.504 --> 00:37:20.420
JOSH GROBAN: My pants
don't even have pockets.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:20.974
So--

00:37:20.974 --> 00:37:21.640
DAVE MALLOY: Oh.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.390
JOSH GROBAN: Yeah.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:24.720
The Broadway pants, you'll
be horrified to know,

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.050
don't have pockets.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.008
DAVE MALLOY: I'll have
to put that in my rider.

00:37:27.008 --> 00:37:28.245
I demand pockets.

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.161
BRENDAN COLLINS: Cool.

00:37:29.161 --> 00:37:29.790
Yes.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.350
AUDIENCE: Not so
much a question,

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:32.910
but a thank you for Rachel.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.640
Having grown up in Russia,
what you just said--

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.259
I could never think
that I would heard

00:37:37.259 --> 00:37:38.550
two words in the same sentence.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.841
You said Natasha's bat mitzvah.

00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:40.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.790
Thank you for that.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.070
BRENDAN COLLINS: So now
that the show is kind of--

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.350
the same kind of thing,
of the modern musical.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.970
Because of how the
internet works,

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:53.550
it kind of can snowball and
take on a life of its own

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.610
to build a fan base and build
this rabid core of people

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.800
who are obsessed with the show.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.900
You know, you've seen now
that there's Tumblrs--

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.060
several of them--
dedicated to the show.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.670
The fans are
manifesting themselves

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.240
in a lot of different new ways.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.247
So especially for you,
Josh, coming from--

00:38:09.247 --> 00:38:10.830
not a different line
of work, but this

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.770
is your first time on
Broadway, and Brittain too.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:17.062
Do you find that the fan
experience is any different now

00:38:17.062 --> 00:38:19.020
than it maybe would have
been 10, 15 years ago?

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.415
JOSH GROBAN: I mean, it's been
really gratifying to see--

00:38:24.415 --> 00:38:26.040
and Brittain touched
on it a little bit

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.350
earlier-- just
for me personally,

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:31.020
my fan base kind of going a
little bit out of their comfort

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.150
zone, of what they're
used to, and embracing

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:36.300
this new adventure, and
embracing this work.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.760
And I'll see sometimes
some fans that I'm

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.756
used to seeing in my concert
world coming to 10 shows,

00:38:41.756 --> 00:38:43.380
and wanting to see
it from every angle.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.180
That means so much to me.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.710
And on the flip
side of that, people

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.084
who maybe don't know anything
about me, from the Broadway

00:38:49.084 --> 00:38:53.220
community, that have also been
so supportive and so welcoming.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.820
Whenever you can do something
artistically that can really

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.380
blend and educate
and give people

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.410
what they didn't know they
wanted, it's such a win-win.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.518
And so some things are the same.

00:39:03.518 --> 00:39:04.726
I still get, you know, dolls.

00:39:08.106 --> 00:39:09.480
That's pretty
consistent, really.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.063
I don't know why I
get a lot of dolls.

00:39:11.063 --> 00:39:12.920
But I get dolls of myself.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.570
I don't get--

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:14.640
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Some
very skillfully made dolls.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.460
JOSH GROBAN: I'm the last
person who needs or wants

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.710
a doll of myself.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.990
And yet, there they
are at Stage Door.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.490
So--

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.703
DAVE MALLOY: My opening
night gift was a doll.

00:39:21.703 --> 00:39:22.536
JOSH GROBAN: He did.

00:39:22.536 --> 00:39:23.220
He got me a doll.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.130
DAVE MALLOY: But I didn't
know that was a thing.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:24.700
JOSH GROBAN: Well,
it was a nice--

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.510
DAVE MALLOY: I
thought, like, I'm

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.718
going to really wow everyone.

00:39:26.718 --> 00:39:29.190
This is like the most creative,
unique opening night gift

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.066
anyone has ever done.

00:39:30.066 --> 00:39:32.065
JOSH GROBAN: But it wasn't
a doll of me, though.

00:39:32.065 --> 00:39:34.170
It was like-- it was a
traditional nesting doll,

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:34.670
wasn't it?

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.503
DAVE MALLOY: No, no.

00:39:35.503 --> 00:39:36.660
I gave you a doll of you.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.866
JOSH GROBAN: Of me?

00:39:37.866 --> 00:39:38.366
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:38.366 --> 00:39:39.330
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Josh
already threw it out.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.776
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:42.364 --> 00:39:43.530
JOSH GROBAN: Well I love it.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.190
DAVE MALLOY: I didn't make it.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.763
I--

00:39:47.763 --> 00:39:48.721
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Yeah.

00:39:48.721 --> 00:39:50.320
He paid someone else to make it.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:50.850
I don't know if that's--

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:51.975
DAVE MALLOY: Is that worse?

00:39:51.975 --> 00:39:53.270
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: I don't know.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:54.550
DAVE MALLOY: Let's
change the topic.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.830
JOSH GROBAN: Whoever makes
the best doll, let's just--

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.455
BRITTAIN ASHFORD:
Back to the question.

00:39:57.455 --> 00:40:01.110
I think it's been really
exciting to connect

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:05.347
to a different type of fan base.

00:40:05.347 --> 00:40:07.180
The internet has allowed
for that to happen.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.721
I mean, certainly
there's people that

00:40:08.721 --> 00:40:11.310
are really excited about
the show who have never

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:14.640
seen the show, who may never
see the show, particularly

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.810
young people.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.120
For me, traveling
around, I found

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.730
that my demographic was one
very narrow strip of people.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.880
And it generally leaned
more towards young men

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.500
aged 21 through 35, and
then young women 21 to 35.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.560
But now I find that I
have this growing fan base

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.380
of, like, rabid teenage girls.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.720
And for me, I love that.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.420
Just because it's so--

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.600
it feels very rewarding.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.520
And it feels very sweet
and genuine to get a letter

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.350
from a 16-year-old girl who's
like, I love your voice.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.490
I love your character.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:56.250
I love your song that
you sing to Natasha.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:57.833
I love what that
means for friendship,

00:40:57.833 --> 00:40:58.720
for women everywhere.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.430
And like-- and
like, for me, that's

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.610
way more rewarding than, like,
hey, uh, what are you drinking?

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.910
You know?

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.529
So that is--

00:41:08.529 --> 00:41:09.070
I don't know.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.150
That's very rewarding for
me to experience that.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.285
JOSH GROBAN: Was that the 21 to
35-year-old man you just did?

00:41:13.285 --> 00:41:13.590
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Yeah.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:14.256
JOSH GROBAN: OK.

00:41:14.256 --> 00:41:16.360
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: That's
me after the show,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.270
in whatever town I'm in,
that I'm like, oh god.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:22.240
Hey, I liked your set.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.740
BRENDAN COLLINS:
The 25-year-old man

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.410
sounds a lot like the
old "over it" guy also.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.406
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: It's
actually the same guy.

00:41:29.406 --> 00:41:31.180
BRENDAN COLLINS: It's
Harvey Fierstein, basically.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.886
JOSH GROBAN: Or the
Simpsons comic book guy.

00:41:32.886 --> 00:41:33.660
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Yeah.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.368
JOSH GROBAN: What is
it you are drinking?

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.240
Yeah.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.939
The letters are pretty
inspiring-- what

00:41:38.939 --> 00:41:39.980
the show means to people.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.438
And especially,
like you said, when

00:41:41.438 --> 00:41:43.540
somebody young who's a
student, or somebody who's

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.770
thinking about going into
this, when they write

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.770
to you that this has
opened their eyes of what's

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:52.267
possible in theater,
it immediately

00:41:52.267 --> 00:41:54.100
brings you back full
circle to those moments

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.016
when you were inspired,
and you were that age,

00:41:56.016 --> 00:42:00.940
and you were feeling insecure,
and lacking vision or a path.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.890
And it was art
and it was theater

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.300
that gave you direction.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.540
And it was arts education
that gave you a voice.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.190
When you get those letters from
people that tell you that this

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:16.780
show has been that guide,
at least in some small way,

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.514
for them, that's--

00:42:18.514 --> 00:42:19.930
I think I'm with
Brittain on that.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.534
That's my favorite, favorite
part of doing this show.

00:42:22.534 --> 00:42:24.675
BRENDAN COLLINS: Cool.

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:25.216
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:25.216 --> 00:42:27.414
So coming in as
somebody who knew

00:42:27.414 --> 00:42:28.955
the show was based
on "War and Peace"

00:42:28.955 --> 00:42:31.310
and not a whole lot else, it
was really surprising to me

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:33.200
that Andrey isn't here.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.704
And that's sort of the point.

00:42:35.704 --> 00:42:37.370
And it works really
well as a reflection

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:38.402
of Natasha and Pierre.

00:42:38.402 --> 00:42:39.860
But I'm wondering
if there was ever

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.070
any temptation to
cut away to him

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.062
and show his part of the war?

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.520
RACHEL CHAVKIN:
We're talking and--

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.320
DAVE MALLOY: Part two.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.194
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:42:48.194 --> 00:42:51.350
Dave and I really want to make
a 150-person site-specific

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.080
outside version of the
Battle of Austerlitz

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.270
that would be just that battle.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:58.600
So there is actually this--

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.974
JOSH GROBAN: Like a Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern version.

00:43:00.974 --> 00:43:03.440
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Anyone
wanna make that happen?

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:03.940
Yeah.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:09.950
So I think it was strongly
clear right from that very first

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:14.210
lyric, "and Andrey isn't
here," that his presence needed

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.100
to be very restrained and
repressed in this piece.

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.850
But I think also our love
for that character is huge,

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:24.180
and you know, somebody
may lead to future work.

00:43:26.654 --> 00:43:27.570
BRENDAN COLLINS: Cool.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.945
And we'll take
one more question.

00:43:28.945 --> 00:43:30.380
AUDIENCE: I have
another question.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.277
So on the topic of your singing
tonight, how do you maintain--

00:43:34.277 --> 00:43:36.610
in a show that's actually
really an opera more than even

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:37.500
a musical--

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.190
your vocal stamina
and physical stamina?

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:40.900
Because it's also a
very physical show?

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.710
There's a lot of dancing
and running around.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:46.270
JOSH GROBAN: Sleep.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.560
I mean, truthfully, it's--

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.518
BRITTAIN ASHFORD: Wait.

00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:49.129
You sleep?

00:43:49.129 --> 00:43:50.170
JOSH GROBAN: Very rarely.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.670
But when I do, I feel
much better onstage.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.714
I think that you
start to learn--

00:43:55.714 --> 00:43:57.130
well, this show's
been good for me

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.629
because it actually pushed where
I thought my boundaries had

00:43:59.629 --> 00:44:00.790
previously been.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:02.590
I'm used to singing
17, 18 songs a night.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.140
But I'm also used
to taking a day off

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.976
after every couple of shows.

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.600
The thought of doing
eight shows a week

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.930
was frankly terrifying for me,
especially with a show that

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:15.130
required so much kind
of yell-singing, for me,

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.350
and gravelness to
his voice, and stuff

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:20.890
that I was just-- as
somebody who's always thought

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:23.305
of vocal health
consciousness first,

00:44:23.305 --> 00:44:25.167
it was just kind
of a worry of mine,

00:44:25.167 --> 00:44:27.250
going into it knowing I'd
have to do 300 of these.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:31.575
So it's actually
taught me a lot that I

00:44:31.575 --> 00:44:33.700
didn't know I was able to
do, which has been really

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.880
rewarding and educational.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.230
But at the same time, you start
to learn about the monk mode

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:40.600
that you need to kind
of go into to recharge.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.449
And it's actually pretty
fast if you let it be--

00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:45.490
if you don't burn the
candle and you actually get

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:49.160
sleep and you try to do
good stuff for your brain.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.580
You know, I can't
be a total monk,

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.660
because then I wind
up resenting it.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.740
So you have to be
social and do stuff.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.500
But at the same time you've got
to really listen to your body.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.260
And I that this, doing
Broadway, teaches

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.252
you to be really keen to that.

00:45:01.252 --> 00:45:02.710
BRITTAIN ASHFORD:
For me, it's been

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:05.574
about recognizing my
boundaries before I

00:45:05.574 --> 00:45:07.240
hit them, which is
something I was never

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.410
very good about before, or
never really had to think about.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.127
Because when you're doing
your own stuff, also,

00:45:14.127 --> 00:45:16.210
it's that you can have a
moment where you're like,

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.370
oh, I can't sing this one song.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:22.740
Because I just maybe yelled
too much a little last night.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.160
You don't have to.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.710
It's your decision to not.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.240
But in a show where you
have to do the show--

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.340
there's no way around that--

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.606
you know that you can't
scream the night before.

00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:35.230
So for me, it's just
been-- in addition

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:36.910
to what Josh said,
getting rest and making

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:38.576
sure you're taking
care of your health--

00:45:38.576 --> 00:45:40.750
it's knowing your boundaries
before you hit them.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:42.444
And for me, that's
been really useful.

00:45:42.444 --> 00:45:43.610
And I'm like, you know what?

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:44.985
I really want to
go out. tonight.

00:45:44.985 --> 00:45:45.840
But I can't.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.860
Or like, man, another
whiskey sounds great.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.100
But smart person brain
says, maybe not tonight.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:52.630
You know?

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.300
So I think that's been critical.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.883
JOSH GROBAN: And the
other great thing

00:45:55.883 --> 00:45:59.949
about having a cast to lean on
is that you get a chance to,

00:45:59.949 --> 00:46:01.990
as you're singing through
the show, kind of clock

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.115
where you're at each night.

00:46:03.115 --> 00:46:04.752
And so every night
feels different.

00:46:04.752 --> 00:46:06.460
I come out and I sing
the first few lines

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.626
of my very, very first song.

00:46:07.626 --> 00:46:08.390
And I just go, hm.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.680
OK.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.013
Well, that's where I'm at today.

00:46:10.013 --> 00:46:12.460
And I know exactly where
I need to put my voice

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.589
or put my energy level in
order to get to song seven,

00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:16.630
and do that successfully.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:21.010
So you start to learn a little
bit about energy management,

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.650
vocal management-- in no
way, shape, or form that

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.750
affects what you're giving
to the audience each

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:26.230
and every night.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.271
That's always consistent.

00:46:27.271 --> 00:46:29.852
But internally, you
learn a lot about--

00:46:29.852 --> 00:46:31.560
like you said, you
can't change anything.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.059
The domino effect starts the
moment those double doors open.

00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:38.132
So you learn about that, which
has been very helpful too.

00:46:38.132 --> 00:46:38.840
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.480
BRENDAN COLLINS: So
one last question--

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.241
I feel like a wonderful
spine that's been involved--

00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:45.740
I mean, that's kind
of woven its way

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.115
through this whole
conversation--

00:46:47.115 --> 00:46:50.460
is that everyone here is kind of
doing this for the first time.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.030
And when there is
maybe a second time,

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.060
what is the number
one lesson that you've

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.060
learned from doing this?

00:47:03.645 --> 00:47:05.520
DAVE MALLOY: Are we
supposed to learn things?

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.731
JOSH GROBAN: I was told
there wouldn't be a quiz.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.010
I think that the bar for
me has been so raised.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:18.214
And I've been so lucky as a
first going out that there

00:47:18.214 --> 00:47:19.380
has been such a specialness.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.838
Everything that we've mentioned
in the last hour about what

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:24.090
makes this cast unique,
this story unique, this

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.410
show unique--

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.360
that's a huge
creative bar for me

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.180
that I'm so
fortunate and humbled

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.980
to have started
with on Broadway,

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.350
which is a very unusual
thing to have started with.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:37.120
We all, I think, feel
lucky in that same way.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.330
So I think for me,
whatever next adventure,

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:45.060
I would make sure that I hold
to the same standard of doing

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.970
something that maybe
is less expected,

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:50.190
that is an educational
experience, maybe not so

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:51.420
down the middle.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.540
And surround myself
with creative people

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:58.540
that I know I'm going to learn
a great, great deal from.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.390
And I think that if
the next going out

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:03.176
doesn't continue to
meet those criteria,

00:48:03.176 --> 00:48:06.030
then I would feel like the
bar was lowered a little bit.

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:09.210
But it has to be challenging
to me in those ways, I think,

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:11.950
going forward.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:13.680
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.280
It's funny.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.490
I think, actually-- there
have been many, many lessons

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:20.580
in terms of just, like,
literally just this is

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:21.910
what a tech process looks like.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.290
And this is when they need your
set designs, and all of that.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:28.380
But I think spiritually maybe
one of the biggest things

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.840
really does come from
Howard Kagan, who's

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:37.200
our producer, who I think-- and
I say this as a female leader.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.330
I think my default as--

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.030
and I don't know that this is
tied to my femaleness or not,

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:48.960
but it's to take care and
to know what is being feared

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.387
and try to ameliorate that--

00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:52.470
did I use that word right?

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.360
Address that fear
before we get there,

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.730
and make things achievable.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.930
And potentially debase or
lower an idea a little bit.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:05.310
And right from the
start, Howard was

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.670
very encouraging of being
uncompromising in what

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:12.210
we had achieved at Ars Nova--

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:17.400
scenically, spiritually,
the levels of that show--

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:22.170
and saying we could do that
a first in the tent and then

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:22.770
on Broadway.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.320
And that we didn't
have to sacrifice.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:31.020
And there were, of course,
painful choices and ideas

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.820
that were killed
in that process.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.930
But actually the encouragement--

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:39.570
beginning to think about
how this show tours.

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:44.940
And him relentlessly saying,
don't start with reality,

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.510
actually.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.920
Start with what would the
ideal be of what the show looks

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.750
like on the road, when you
have a day or a couple days

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:59.430
to go into a space, versus
the four-week load-in process

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.430
that we had for transforming
a Broadway house.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:07.840
And that's been very
bolstering, and is

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.762
something I'll take forward.

00:50:09.762 --> 00:50:10.720
BRENDAN COLLINS: Great.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.220
Well, thank you all very much.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.320
Just a quick-- some plugs.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.820
You can get tickets to "Natasha,
Pierre, and the Great Comet

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.070
of 1812" on telecharge.com.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.349
Josh, when are you
wrapping up your stint?

00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:22.390
JOSH GROBAN: I'm a little
over the halfway point.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:23.857
So I'm going to
be done July 2nd.

00:50:23.857 --> 00:50:24.940
BRENDAN COLLINS: July 2nd.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.440
And Dave, do you know-- you'll
be doing a couple of specific

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.380
dates that are listed on the--

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.747
DAVE MALLOY: I believe my
first date is May 4th--

00:50:31.747 --> 00:50:32.580
RACHEL CHAVKIN: 4th.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.021
DAVE MALLOY: 4th.

00:50:34.021 --> 00:50:34.520
Oh yeah.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.644
Because it's Star Wars Day.

00:50:35.644 --> 00:50:37.110
BRENDAN COLLINS: It is, yeah.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:37.780
DAVE MALLOY: Which is like--

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.790
oh, I'm so excited about that.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:40.405
RACHEL CHAVKIN: You can't
call out your first day,

00:50:40.405 --> 00:50:40.930
you know that?

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:41.971
DAVE MALLOY: What's that?

00:50:41.971 --> 00:50:44.580
RACHEL CHAVKIN: You can't
call out your first day.

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:45.530
To go see Star Wars.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.520
DAVE MALLOY: But I can call out
to Star Wars on the first day.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.436
BRENDAN COLLINS: Yeah.

00:50:48.436 --> 00:50:49.440
It is your show.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.310
So no one is going
to correct you,

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:53.003
really-- well, Rachel, you
probably would correct him.

00:50:53.003 --> 00:50:53.930
RACHEL CHAVKIN: Yeah.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:54.590
BRENDAN COLLINS: Great.

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:55.298
So thank you all.

00:50:55.298 --> 00:50:57.400
Can I get a round of
applause for our guests?

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.450
[APPLAUSE]
