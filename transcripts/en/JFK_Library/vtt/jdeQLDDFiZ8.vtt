00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.466
- They're all doing this stuff.

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.336
They all do this taking
away the driver's license.

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:08.853
They all do the you have
to pay to be on probation.

00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:11.006
It's just shocking.

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.279
There's 43 states in this country

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.274
where you have to pay money
to have a public defender.

00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:21.261
That seems impossible,
but that is the truth.

00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:24.716
So that's the one whole piece here

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:26.371
is that this is a national issue.

00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:30.267
The other part is that it's metastasized

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.687
into a whole bunch of other things

00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:36.649
because now we don't just
kick kids out of school,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.899
suspend them or expel them.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:43.503
We send them to court,
and we've been doing that

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:47.230
really since Columbine in a big way.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.647
And so it's the whole pipeline to prison.

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:57.273
It's now got a fast lane for it.
