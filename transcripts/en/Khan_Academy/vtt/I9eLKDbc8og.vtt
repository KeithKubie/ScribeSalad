00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.730
The surface area of a
cube is equal to the sum

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.937
of the areas of its six sides.

00:00:06.937 --> 00:00:08.020
Let's just visualize that.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.830
I like to visualize things.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.290
So if that's the cube,
we can see three sides.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.854
Three sides are facing us.

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:17.270
But then if it was
transparent, we

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.160
see that there are actually
six sides of a cube.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.960
So there's this one--
one, two, three in front--

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.390
and then one--
this is the bottom.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.540
This is in the back, and
this is also in the back.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.040
So you have three
sides of the cube.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.900
So I believe what
they're saying.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.470
The surface area of a
cube with side length

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.415
x-- so if this is
x, if this is x,

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:40.610
if this is x-- is given by
the expression 6x squared.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.570
That also makes sense.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.380
The area of each side is going
to be x times x is x squared,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.380
and there's six of them.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.680
So it's going to be 6x squared.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.470
Jolene has two
cube-shaped containers

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.910
that she wants to paint.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.740
One cube has side length 2.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.870
So this is one cube
right over here.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.240
I'll do my best to draw it.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.500
So this right over
here has side length 2,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.379
so that's its dimensions.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.760
The other cube has
side length 1.5.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.370
So the other cube is going
to be a little bit smaller.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.390
It has side length 1.5.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.090
So it's 1.5 by 1.5 by 1.5.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.470
What is the total surface
area that she has to paint?

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.750
Well, we know that the
surface area of each cube

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.990
is going to be 6x
squared, where x

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.000
is the dimensions of that cube.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
So the surface area of
this cube right over here

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630
is going to be 6.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.235
And now-- let me do it in
that color of that cube--

00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:40.990
it's going to be
6 times x, where

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.230
x is the dimension of the cube.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.270
And then the cube all
has the same dimensions,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.750
so its length, width, and
depth is all the same.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.350
So for this cube,
the surface area

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.845
is going to be 6
times 2 squared.

00:01:57.177 --> 00:01:58.760
And then the surface
area of this cube

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.230
is going to be 6
times 1.5 squared.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.090
And if we want the total
surface area she has to paint,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.400
it's going to be the
sum of the two cubes.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.030
So we're just going to
add these two things.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.530
And so if we were to compute
this first one right over here,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.870
this is going to be 6 times 4.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.690
This is 24.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.481
And this one right
over here, this

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.980
is going to be a
little bit hairier.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.800
Let's see.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.360
15 times 15 is 225.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.430
So 1.5 times 1.5 is 2.25.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.540
So 1.5 squared is 2.25.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.610
And 2.25 times 6-- so let
me just multiply that out.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.790
2.25 times 6.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.300
Let's see.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.775
We're going to have
6 times 5 is 30.

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:54.000
6 times 2 is 12, plus 3 is 15.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.830
6 times 2 is 12, plus 1 is 13.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.980
I have two numbers behind
the decimal-- 13.5.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.540
So it's going to be 13.5.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.940
And if I add these
two together, this

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.380
is going to be equal to
the total surface area

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.944
that she has got to paint, is
going to be 37.5 square-- well,

00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:17.610
I guess they're not
giving us the units.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.130
Well, 37.5 is going to be the
total area of square units

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.100
of whatever the
units happen to be.
