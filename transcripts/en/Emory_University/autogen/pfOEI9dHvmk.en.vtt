00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 align:start position:0%
university to do it and and I think that
 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
university to do it and and I think that
it's<00:00:46.839><c> because</c><00:00:47.140><c> that</c><00:00:47.350><c> in</c><00:00:47.469><c> a</c><00:00:47.530><c> university</c><00:00:47.920><c> it</c>

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 align:start position:0%
it's because that in a university it
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's because that in a university it
allows<00:00:48.460><c> us</c><00:00:48.729><c> to</c><00:00:49.539><c> ask</c><00:00:50.190><c> the</c><00:00:51.190><c> really</c><00:00:52.030><c> important</c>
