00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.870
KRISTAN: Hey, Matt made
it just in time.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.930
And today is 12/12/12, the last
time, I believe, any of

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.720
us on this planet currently will
experience such a date.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.970
LES: Speak for yourself.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.040
KRISTAN: You know, what's
a millennia

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.150
between friends, right?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.730
So this is the last Google
TV developers

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.810
Hangout for this year.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.950
That's why I've gathered all of
us together just to sort of

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.940
talk a little bit about what's
happened in the last little

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.460
while, what's happened
over the last year--

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.310
believe it or not, quite
a few things--

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.060
and I guess to wrap it up
with a little bit of

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.000
Q&amp;A from the community.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.360
I know we have some questions
that we'll get to.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.040
And it looks like Matt's
dropped off.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.470
Maybe he'll reconnect.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.040
Christian and I were at
AnDevCon last week.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.360
And what were your
impressions?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.180
CHRISTIAN: I think
it was good.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.140
We talked about Google TV.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.150
We gave an overview
of developing for

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.090
television in general.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.750
And I think a lot of the Android
developers, they're

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.750
already familiar with
phones and tablets.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.910
And now they're just adding
another big screen to their

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.080
target audience.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.330
KRISTAN: Everybody wants
the big screen.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.010
CHRISTIAN: The bigger
the better.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.600
KRISTAN: I'm actually surprised
you didn't mention

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.850
the thing that we cooked up.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.630
CHRISTIAN: Well, yeah.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.040
There's some reports on the
internet that we did a little

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.320
bit of a hardware teardown.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.270
KRISTAN: We did.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.520
That was actually quite a bit of
fun, especially donning all

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.660
the equipment and
the test thing.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.560
So for those of you who were not
at AnDevCon and would like

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.540
to be in on this little thing
we're talking about, Christian

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.120
and I did a teardown of
Google TV hardware.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.740
We covered pretty much
everything that developers

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.330
would care about-- the
CPU, the RAM, the--

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.760
CHRISTIAN: GPU.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.530
KRISTAN: --GPU, the NAND
memory a little bit.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.280
And then what we did was we put
all those parts from that

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.880
teardown into a Blendtec blender
and kind of hit grind.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.150
CHRISTIAN: Supersonic blades.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.660
KRISTAN: That blender
was amazing.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.030
So the guys at Blendtec
were great.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.070
And they sent us three
of these blenders.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.800
I think we only destroyed
1 and 1/2

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.010
of them in our testing.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.710
But it was pretty good.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.540
All right, so the buildup
was this.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.890
We've got all these people
in this room.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.700
And we're talking about this
hardware teardown.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.690
And we finish with the
description in the slides.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.010
And then I'm like, all right,
I got three Google TVs.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.660
We've got a room of
maybe 160 people.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.770
Got to figure out how to
fairly distribute them.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.680
So it's Let's Make
A Deal time.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.380
And it was who had the biggest
hard drive, who had lint in

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.840
their pocket, that
sort of thing.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.660
We give away three Google TVs.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.400
And at this point, everyone's
like, yay, Google TV.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.210
And then the second
question came.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.780
And the second question was,
all right, those of you who

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.700
received Google TVs, who
wants to give it up?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.320
CHRISTIAN: Well, we put all
the nice little hardware

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.280
things in a little Christmas
box, and then we added jelly

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.260
beans to it and all kinds
of other stuff.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.580
KRISTAN: All the things people
were asking for, you know.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.930
And one person took the bait.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.540
So yeah, they kind of ended up
on stage with us, wearing some

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.330
protective gear, as I took their
Google TV away and we

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.230
proceeded to grind up the
portions of the Google TV we

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.350
had dissected earlier.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.170
And yeah, the crowd kind
of got into that.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.090
That was pretty good.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.780
CHRISTIAN: We blended up all the
requirements that we hear

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.740
about from people.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.980
KRISTAN: Yeah, we just gave
the community what it was

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.840
asking for.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.986
As we will continue to do in
the new year, et cetera.

00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:43.500
I had a lot of fun doing it.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.170
LES: Which Google TV did you--

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.860
was it any particular vendor
you'd like to mention?

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.510
Or not.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.720
KRISTAN: Nothing to announce
at this time.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.540
They're all good.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.920
They all fit into a
specific spectrum.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.640
We were talking about Google
TV sort of in the general

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.710
sense, so the hardware we
covered was specific to Visio.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.270
But what we ended up grinding
up was kind of a mixture of

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.020
various electronic components
from various

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.210
models of Google TVs.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.450
You know, we had to
be fair, right?

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.510
I think the conclusion we
reached was it does not blend.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.870
CHRISTIAN: Well, we probably
didn't blend it long enough.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.003
KRISTAN: We need more
practice at this.

00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:25.870
I think we'll be doing something
like this again in

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.120
the future.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.440
LES: Maybe at I/O.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.610
KRISTAN: Yeah, well, at
I/O, we got to have

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.510
the industrial grinder.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.290
And we got to put a whole LG
TV in there or something.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.400
I don't know.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.910
Maybe we'll just say,
bring your hardware

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.800
and we'll grind it.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.360
LES: But OK, yeah.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.420
KRISTAN: So AnDevCon
was pretty good.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.256
Met a lot of speakers who I
hadn't met before, because I

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:49.470
guess I'm kind of new
to the circuit.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.480
And I had a lot of fun.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.560
CHRISTIAN: Yeah.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.410
I mean, it was really
a lot of--

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.580
I want to say quality
Android developers.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.430
It was a lot of people who have
written apps, who have

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.000
published apps.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.710
It's a fun, fun crowd.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.300
KRISTAN: So if you weren't
there this year, there's

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.870
another one, I believe,
in the spring.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.050
Well, there's one in Boston,
isn't there?

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.100
CHRISTIAN: Yeah,
Boston spring.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.960
But also the slides
are available.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.330
So people can just go to the
website and check it out.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.085
KRISTAN: Some of them may not
make sense without us

00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:16.760
speaking, though.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.550
Eh.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.940
Come to one of our other
presentations.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.480
Matt, since I have you on the
line, maybe you can talk a

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.810
little bit about the exclusive
European programming that was

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.564
announced recently.

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:31.730
He's blinking.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.560
He's on the spot.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.200
He doesn't know what to say.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.712
Or he's muted.

00:05:35.712 --> 00:05:39.430
LES: He's trying to
find his notes.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.360
KRISTAN: I can't
hear you, Matt.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.470
I think you might be muted.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.770
Les, can you hear him?

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.585
LES: I do not hear him.

00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:51.150
He's going to controller, so
he's in a studio somewhere.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.565
KRISTAN: Yes.

00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:52.505
MATT: How about now?

00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:54.472
KRISTAN: Now we can hear you.

00:05:54.472 --> 00:05:55.270
LES: Oh, that's right.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.420
Are you guys in the studio,
or are you in 1808?

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.340
MATT: I'm in a ad hoc little
space at the moment.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.470
We're getting a studio built
in this building, but

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.330
it's not there yet.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.510
KRISTAN: So to answer Les's
question, we're in 1808.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.290
I cleaned up the room
a little bit today.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.290
I put a nice tablecloth down.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.650
Felt we should be more
professional in our

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.075
presentation.

00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:19.927
CHRISTIAN: All right.

00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:23.990
And next week, we iron
the tablecloth.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.990
LES: Excellent.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.730
So what happened this year?

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.500
KRISTAN: Well, actually, before
we get to what happened

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.820
this year--

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.500
LES: Oh, right.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.770
Matt was going to talk.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.684
KRISTAN: Yeah, Matt was going
to talk about the European

00:06:34.684 --> 00:06:35.670
programming.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.800
And I'm going to mute Stoyan.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.260
MATT: So what do you want to
know about the European

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.220
programming?

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.710
KRISTAN: Well, for those of us
who are not in Europe, perhaps

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.210
you could fill us in.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.640
MATT: So I've been running
around for the past six months

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.200
since I've joined kind of
prepping all of the developer

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.050
community for the Google TV
launches in UK, France,

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.500
Germany, and Netherlands, and
just kind of making them aware

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.470
of the platforms and some of the
dos and don'ts, and what

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.640
they can and can't do
with Google TV.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.140
So yeah, it's been exciting
times over here.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.630
So I'm just getting all the
developers interested and

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.420
hyped up, and starting to see
some of the great things that

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.950
they've been producing.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.040
KRISTAN: Cool.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.870
That's it?

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.665
Nothing else to add?

00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:20.380
No.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.680
LES: Would you like to talk
about any launched apps or

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.870
launched new content.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.050
MATT: Well, at the moment, I'm
still working with a load of

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.830
partners and a load of
developers that have started

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.270
sending through loads and loads
of really cool things.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.470
But a lot of them are still
trying to do it in a much

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.860
larger picture, so they're
trying to do it with a whole

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.680
suite of Android applications
as well as Google TV.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.530
And obviously, with all the
Nexus 7 and 10, et cetera, I

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.560
think they want to do
that big launch.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.940
They want to be able to hit
all of these devices.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.870
So I'm seeing a lot of stuff
come through and a lot of

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.350
interconnected stuff.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.550
But none of them are launched
yet, so still waiting for it.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.430
But it's going to happen.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.040
It's going to be great.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.550
But yeah, I've been going to
all the Droidcon events, as

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.570
well as a load of Android
user group events.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.960
The communities are
just incredible.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.840
They're so welcoming and there's
just so much kind of

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.660
enthusiasm for all of the
Android platform.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.150
So yeah, Google TV, they're just
as absolutely loving the

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.030
fact they've got another form
factor, another way of

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.720
reaching their audience, and
an entirely new audience.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.550
So yeah, it's been awesome.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.330
KRISTAN: Cool.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.770
Les, do you want to talk
about the V3 roll-out?

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.420
LES: Sure.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.309
But first I'm going to
talk about today's

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:36.929
event, give a plug for--

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:44.000
on 12/12/12, Google, for the
12th year running, has

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.950
announced Google Zeitgeist.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:53.950
And for the first time, the
Google Zeitgeist Android

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.850
application launched today.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:02.620
And that's what I and another
Googler have been working on

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.090
all weekend, was getting
that launched.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:10.480
And so I am plugging it.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.180
So get your Google Zeitgeist
2012 Android application fresh

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.300
from market for your phone.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.060
KRISTAN: Cool, congratulations.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.800
I remember--

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.580
so I received an email from
Les over the weekend, can

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.560
people help test this,
and pulled it up on

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.960
all my Android devices.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.320
And it was really stable,
actually.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.270
LES: It was amazing.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.020
Yeah, I didn't write
it, but I put it

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.730
through all our process.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.290
And we had to put
it into-- yeah.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.720
Our process is insane.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.040
I'm told we were the fastest
getting through the process

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.190
that the Android
team has seen.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.010
So.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.120
I

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.700
KRISTAN: Nice.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.940
LES: I got recruited
Friday night.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.340
KRISTAN: Oh, wow.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.390
That explains the email
Saturday morning.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.330
LES: Yes.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:05.700
So V3 has launched
on the LGTV.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:12.120
It is giving advanced
media VPIs--

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.560
quality of service,
the DASH codec,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.810
really good audio codecs.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:25.040
And you have the ability in Java
to add your own codecs.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.120
So that if you've got a
proprietary video or audio

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:40.520
format, you can basically
decode that on a

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.405
Google TV now from Java.

00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:45.550
CHRISTIAN: And you don't need
native code for that.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.440
LES: No, you don't.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.040
CHRISTIAN: No NDK required.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.930
LES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.480
code at all.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.145
KRISTAN: Actually, it's funny.

00:10:50.145 --> 00:10:52.180
I remember in university--

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.240
let me just click on us
so we're focused--

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.050
I remember university, I took
this Fundamentals of

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.800
Multimedia Programming.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.990
And this was back a little
while ago, shall we say.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:08.020
And we had to write JPEG
and MPEG encoders

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.480
and decoders in Java.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.740
And I was shocked at how
performant they were, even in

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.627
comparison to the C code that we
had been writing in one of

00:11:16.627 --> 00:11:17.520
the other courses.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.660
So you know.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.610
That was on hardware that's
much older and much slower

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.620
than the Google TV.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.030
So I expect everybody who's ever
had an issue with a codec

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.040
not being supported for their
particular application, now

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.510
you can go up there
and write them.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.730
CHRISTIAN: Actually, one plug.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.710
So as preparation for AnDevCon,
when we were talking

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.880
about all that hardware, I
wanted to see what that

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.230
hardware really can do.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.900
And I dug into Renderscript
and took a bunch of the

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.520
samples, modified them,
and ran them.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.860
And I was really impressed.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.830
I was doing some video effects
and I was doing some--

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.370
basically, I think I had 2,000
sprites on the screen moving

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.950
around and didn't
drop a frame.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.324
So pretty cool.

00:12:01.324 --> 00:12:06.236
KRISTAN: There's a lot of power
behind that hardware.

00:12:06.236 --> 00:12:06.640
Right.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.860
So there is nothing else that
I have on the immediate use

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.690
that we can talk about.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.850
So instead, let's jump into
a sort of year in review.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.590
And those of you on the team,
remember the email I sent out

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.950
this morning.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:24.950
Somebody needs to mute.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:25.700
And it's Matt.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.472
There we go.

00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:28.920
LES: It's actually--

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.290
Stoyan's mic keeps coming on.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.320
And so if he'd stay mute
until he asks a

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.960
question, that'd be good.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.930
KRISTAN: So I haven't been on
the team very long, maybe--

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.020
I guess I'm getting close
to six months now.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.680
Wow, six months.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.290
LES: Actually, it would be close
to six months, because

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.470
you kind of started a
couple weeks before

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.230
the end of the quarter.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.080
So it's actually is important.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.320
KRISTAN: Sneaks up on you.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.566
I still feel like the new guy.

00:13:02.566 --> 00:13:03.580
I still act like the new guy.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.130
KRISTAN: So when I was trying
to figure out what we would

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.540
cover in this last Hangout for
the year, I thought it would

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.870
be really good to just cover
sort of a year in review,

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.600
where we were this time last
year, and where we are now and

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.180
the evolution.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.470
Because I think a lot of the
times, we're so focused on the

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.550
stuff that we're doing or a
particular application that

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.650
you lose the context of how much
is actually going on, and

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.110
how much movement there is.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.860
So I know I solicited all of
you for different things.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.840
Maybe we can just
start off with--

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.620
you mentioned Android Market
in your response, so.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:45.820
CHRISTIAN: Yeah.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.690
I mean, it's pretty amazing to
think that only a year ago,

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.600
we've actually launched the
ability for third party

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.255
developers to distribute
applications to Google TV.

00:13:55.255 --> 00:13:57.380
So at the time it was
Android market.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.210
Now it's Google Play Store.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.920
But that's only a year ago.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.060
So for all the developers out
there, it has been a really

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.530
busy year developing apps for
Google TV for the first time,

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.690
getting their feet wet.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.480
I think we've made a
lot of progress.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.230
When I look in market now,
there's a lot of really cool

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.976
apps that have shown up over
the last 12 months.

00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:22.400
KRISTAN: People are starting
to figure it out.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.680
LES: We released V2.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.996
Then we released 2.1, 2.2--

00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:39.325
or excuse me, 1, [? 2.1.2. ?]

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.472
And we also released--

00:14:47.472 --> 00:14:49.120
KRISTAN: Well, there's a
Honeycomb update in there as

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.660
well, right?

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.760
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, the Honeycomb
update brought in market,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.720
effectively.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.350
And yeah, we did a couple
updates over the year to--

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.710
especially the old hardware.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:07.610
So the Intel-based Sony Blu-ray
players, the K device

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.420
is still getting updates.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.580
And so we added market.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.070
Initially, we had a Google TV
specific market client.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.760
And now with the Google Play
update, we have the official--

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.920
just the same binary that's
on all the other devices.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.550
It is the Google Play
Android store.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.750
KRISTAN: The full experience.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.800
CHRISTIAN: The full
experience.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.870
Same as on the tablet.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.140
It's actually a tablet UI.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.130
KRISTAN: Yes.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.650
Unless you haven't done
the overscan.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.370
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, there is a
bug or two in there still.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.520
KRISTAN: There's always bugs,
but we're working on it.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.550
It's always this constant
driving to fix the problems

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.800
that we create and--

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.990
LES: I'm not sure that's
the direction

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.620
you want to be headed.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.880
But it looks like Krispy's
disappeared.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.500
MATT: Oh.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:02.040
We occasionally get this
over the pond.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.130
They'll come back
in in a second.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.550
It'll be fine.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.700
LES: Yeah, or something
changed.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.650
It says we're still on air,
but usually, when the

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.680
moderator disappears,
we go off.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:22.530
But hopefully somebody will ping
us with some information.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.925
MATT: So Les, what was your main
thing for google TV over

00:16:25.925 --> 00:16:26.520
the past year?

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.550
KRISTAN: We're still here.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.590
MATT: Oh, there we go.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.970
KRISTAN: I don't know
what happened.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.915
Somebody pulled something
out of something.

00:16:34.915 --> 00:16:39.310
LES: Well, it still has you
connected and a good still

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.860
shot down at the bottom.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.700
KRISTAN: OK.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.950
Well, we're back now--

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.350
--but I guess we launched
some arm hardware

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.430
this year as well.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.760
And some new devices.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.340
LES: Yeah.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.010
Do we know we're still being
recorded is the question.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.580
KRISTAN: It says at the top of
mine that the broadcast is

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.165
still going and that we have
a bunch of viewers.

00:17:03.165 --> 00:17:04.150
Quite a few viewers.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.420
LES: OK, so you're seeing
moderator information.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.510
That's what I asked.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.145
OK, cool.

00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:09.460
KRISTAN: Yes.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:09.970
LES: OK.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.280
So we're still going, then.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.079
KRISTAN: We're still going.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.420
Sorry about that blip, people.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.260
So yes.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.069
New hardware.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.520
This was kind of the big,
exciting thing, because--

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.119
CHRISTIAN: Yeah.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:23.359
And we talked about it almost a
year ago at CS in Las Vegas.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.970
We, for the first time, talked
about new devices with Marvell

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.170
chip set, going to an arm CPU.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.440
And at the time, we talked
about LG and--

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.410
I don't know who else
we announced.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.670
But throughout the year, we
basically rolled out the LGTV

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.540
with the Google TV built in,
which I think is a really

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.630
great experience.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.690
There's no extra set-top
box needed.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.840
It's right on the TV.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.770
And then we have, of course,
the Sony device.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.080
They did a refresh with an
army base with Marvell.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.242
We have the Visio devices
and we're still going.

00:18:00.242 --> 00:18:03.530
We were adding hardware
to the mix.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.600
KRISTAN: And according to
ifixit.com, the Visio device

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.850
is very fixable.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.130
CHRISTIAN: Doesn't really
blend, though.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.440
KRISTAN: Does not
blend at all.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.020
CHRISTIAN: The heat sink
is quite massive.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.200
KRISTAN: Well, we didn't
even try--

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.780
just as a little side note here,
we didn't even try to

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.970
blend the heat sink
on the Visio.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:32.090
But the screws and the bolts on
the motherboard, once they

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:37.500
get bouncing around at something
like 1700 RPM or

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.970
something like that, those
blades were really going fast.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.140
It was the hum.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.950
They were dinging around
inside of this blending

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.410
container and sparking.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.900
And I think-- oh.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.170
CHRISTIAN: Should have
made a video of our--

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:50.870
PAUL: So you made soup, then.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.970
It warmed itself up.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.590
KRISTAN: Yeah, we
made metal soup.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.300
But even the circuit boards
were just like-- they were

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.720
chewing, but they
went in square.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.540
They came out kind
of cookie shaped.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.910
Because they were just bouncing
around and rotating.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.310
Anyway.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.530
Sorry, I didn't mean to
digress that much.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:14.060
But yeah, the Visios are
fun to take apart.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.160
Shawn, you had put a bunch of
stuff on the historical list.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.310
You're like the custodian
of our history and--

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.560
SHAWN: Well, I looked through
our Google TV blog posts.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.810
KRISTAN: So I don't know.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.640
To talk to some of the points
that you had on there.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.580
SHAWN: Well, like you sort of
add it to your questions

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.920
pointed out, it's the
year where we had a

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.400
lot of Android apps.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.090
Before, going into that, we had
the Google TV spotlight,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.580
where we had about
60, 70, 80 apps.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.140
And then throughout the year,
a lot of the developers

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.060
actually converted some of the
web apps into Android apps.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.630
So thank you very much
for that effort.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.420
And now, I think, more than half
of the older the web apps

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.240
have already been converted into
Android apps, so that's a

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.015
great accomplishment
for the year.

00:19:58.015 --> 00:20:02.050
So thanks a lot for
the great work.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.460
We also launched Google TV--

00:20:07.055 --> 00:20:10.400
on Google+, we launched a Google
TV page and also Google

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.920
TV developers page.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.460
And on the Google TV
page, we've got

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.500
like 350,000 followers.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.580
And the Google TV developer
page, we've got

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.150
almost 12,000 followers.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.390
So thanks a lot for

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.950
participating in the community.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.220
A lot of the things, I think
you guys already mentioned.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.150
I think there is also the
"Gangnam Style" [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.720
Google+ launch in Korea.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.150
KRISTAN: Yes.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.760
SHAWN: That was a lot of fun.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.375
LES: Oh, and that's just
going amazing.

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:43.270
KRISTAN: Well, it's a
full IP TV, right?

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:49.050
LES: Yeah, and it's U+ is the
cable company, and they're

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.760
just installing it everywhere.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.290
MATT: And people have got the
option to upgrade for a small

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.210
fee, but it sounds like everyone
who's on that surface

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.290
is jumping over the chance of
getting this Google TV box.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.780
It's fantastic, isn't it?

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.540
LES: Yeah.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.060
It's pretty amazing.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.090
KRISTAN: Makes me really wish
we had fiber in California.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.150
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, no kidding.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.850
KRISTAN: As I'm sure many of you
who are watching this now

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.600
will agree.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.340
LES: Great if we could
find a company that

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.590
would provide fiber.

00:21:22.061 --> 00:21:25.335
KRISTAN: Maybe we should do a
road trip to Kansas next year

00:21:25.335 --> 00:21:26.210
and we should film it.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.550
LES: Actually, what we should
do is we should

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:32.470
go do a code lab.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.710
We should find out if
Kansas City has a

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.580
Android developers group.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.070
KRISTAN: Awesome.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.445
CHRISTIAN: Actually, if there's
any Android developers

00:21:40.445 --> 00:21:40.890
listening here--

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.150
KRISTAN: In Kansas City.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:42.960
CHRISTIAN: --in Kansas City.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.400
KRISTAN: You should
be joining us.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.840
PAUL: So that can bring up what
I've spent a lot of my

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.200
time on this last year.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.860
We started out doing
some code labs.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.390
Realized it could be quite a
challenge to set up a ton of

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.470
monitors in a room to allow
people to actually do an

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.690
interactive code lab.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.910
And especially as we sort of
see, I think, more interest

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:05.410
over the year.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.470
More people wanted to show
up to our events.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.770
So we transitioned to what we
call the Google TV Test Lab

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.920
and have gotten some pretty
good response.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.420
We've done it in Washington, DC,
we did one in Boulder, and

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.990
we're planning out what we're
going to do for next year.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.190
So if the developers out there
want us to come to them, the

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.080
way that these work really
well is we get your help.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.840
You help us set them up with
meet-ups and Google Developer

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.900
groups, Android developer
groups, whomever.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:40.270
But it's been really good,
because these test labs, we

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.220
bring TVs in and we side load
your apps on there.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.190
We try them out.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.670
And you get to see how they
can perform on all the

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:48.430
different devices.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.400
We have a Sony, the LG, and the
Visio devices all there

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.810
lined up ready to go
and try them out.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.170
KRISTAN: And pretty soon,
we'll have the

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.515
High Sense and the--

00:22:57.515 --> 00:22:58.930
PAUL: High Sense is coming.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:22:59.370
KRISTAN: And the--

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.870
LES: The others are-- haven't
announced yet.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.690
KRISTAN: Right.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.990
CHRISTIAN: Nothing to announce
at this time.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.860
LES: Go use your favorite
search engine.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.570
I think something's out there.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.420
I'm not saying anything.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.616
I just wanted to make sure.

00:23:17.616 --> 00:23:19.040
KRISTAN: There was something
else-- oh yeah, you were

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.400
mentioning.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.930
So I think you did the smart
thing, because Shawn and I

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:28.070
went to Seattle this year and
I organized 30 monitors and

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.870
Google TVs.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.460
And there was a lot of shipping
of stuff going on.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.740
And it was a lot of work, so.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.820
PAUL: But there are times when
you still need them.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.610
And we are doing hackathons,
so--

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.280
KRISTAN: There's one coming
up, actually.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.250
PAUL: Well, we've done three.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:41.650
Well, let's see.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.550
We've done two this year
and we're getting

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.870
ready to our third.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.000
The first one, we
did in April.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.620
We had 200 developers here in
[INAUDIBLE], which was great.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.190
We did the London hackathon
in July.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.020
We had about 50 to 60 developer

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.610
show up for that one.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:02.220
And we're doing a hackathon in
LA on January 26 and 27.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.480
And if you are interested
in going to that--

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.140
boy, I don't remember.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.560
I think it's YouTube hack LA
or something like that,

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.810
ythackla.com.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.025
Something like that.

00:24:12.025 --> 00:24:13.480
KRISTAN: If you can't find it
and you're interested in

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480
going, send me an email.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.710
PAUL: Yep, look it up.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.810
We're looking for developers
to show up there and it's a

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.300
hackathon for the weekend.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.570
We're really excited about that
one because it's in LA.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:26.030
You've got content people there,
people who have things

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.790
that they want to get
distributed to people.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.870
It's an opportunity for you to
build an app to get their

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:31.470
stuff out there.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.140
KRISTAN: It's already pretty
full, isn't it?

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.270
PAUL: Yeah, we're doing
pretty well.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.500
We're probably 70%
full right now.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.370
KRISTAN: OK, so--

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.940
CHRISTIAN: If we only had
a way to show YouTube

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.480
content on Google TV.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.850
If only.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.070
Huh.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.400
It's funny you should
mention that.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.825
LES: Wait till--

00:24:46.825 --> 00:24:48.280
KRISTAN: Yeah.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.090
LES: Yeah.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.960
Unfortunately, not yet.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.570
KRISTAN: We were already talking
about this a little

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.580
bit at AnDevCon.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.330
So it's kind of already
out there.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.790
It's coming.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.080
LES: Well, I've talked about
it on these things too.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.440
I was just going to wait
because the official

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.500
announcement might happen
real shortly.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.810
KRISTAN: That's true.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.350
So read between the lines.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.210
LES: Well.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:19.700
That said, as long as we're
going to plug events, Jarek

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.790
from the YouTube team and I
are doing an eight-hour

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:30.300
workshop at South by Southwest
called "Saving the Couch

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:35.297
Potatoes: the Cloudy Future
of Television."

00:25:35.297 --> 00:25:36.460
KRISTAN: So that should
be pretty exciting.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:42.270
LES: And we're going to take
you through the process of

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:53.220
filming content, creating a
content delivery network, and

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.710
creating apps to highlight that
content and display it

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.990
and monetize N analytics.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.270
So that should be
a great event.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:08.590
And it's at South by Southwest
Interactive.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.840
KRISTAN: Cool.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.020
I wish I could announce
something, but there's nothing

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.855
to announce.

00:26:16.855 --> 00:26:18.130
CHRISTIAN: At this time.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.800
KRISTAN: At this time, yeah.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.370
Anyway, that's pretty exciting,
actually, about

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.010
South by Southwest.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.080
Hopefully some of you have the
chance to go to that, because

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.345
I think that is one of the most
requested things with, at

00:26:31.345 --> 00:26:31.990
least, Google TV.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:37.280
I want more control over video
and getting it out there.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.450
What else do we want
to talk about?

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.600
We talked about Korea.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.500
We've talked about kind of V3
and the voice search and

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.405
functionality that goes along
with that, our re-brand of TV

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:50.180
and movies to PrimeTime.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.640
So if you hear PrimeTime as a
developer, we're referring to

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.890
what was TV and movies.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.090
Apps on Google Play, we've
talked about, Pandora--

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.030
oh, actually.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.860
Maybe you want to talk about
just who's launched this year.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.550
CHRISTIAN: That's what--
it was a busy year.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.020
So all the usual suspects
that were preloaded

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.570
originally are in market.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.020
So Pandora.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.360
They are always a very
popular application.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.890
People love listening to
music and watching TV

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.630
on their TV, naturally.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:26.430
Some of the other apps that in
that area is aVia Media Player

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.530
and then Plex Media Player.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.100
Also, GTV box.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.340
So those are all apps that allow
you to control media

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.640
servers in your home.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.240
You can stream videos from your
media server to your TV.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.890
And then, of course, there is a
lot of media games or media

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.240
applications, like Redux,
DramaFever,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.090
SnagFilms, Viki, Post TV.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:56.890
So what we see is most of the
really interesting and

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:00.810
successful applications revolve
around bringing some

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.170
sort or another of video or
media to the television.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.180
So a lot of people who already
have video on demand services

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.410
have created Google TV apps.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.340
And then we have games.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.950
So Greed Spiders is one that
we featured recently.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.590
We're always reviewing
for our staff picks.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.180
And there's a few more
games that we have.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.590
Canabalt was another nice one.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.410
Very easy to use on
a remote control.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.530
All you need is left,
right, up, down.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.100
The biggest problem with games,
other than the NDK one,

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.110
is usually the input device.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:38.380
So the question is how do you
effectively control the game

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.970
without a touchpad or without
a touchscreen.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.670
KRISTAN: Well, I remember days
of video games when you had a

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.230
controller with a wire connected
to your console.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.685
You can use USB host
mode and build to--

00:28:52.685 --> 00:28:59.030
LES: Well, the OnLive folks
created their own controller.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:28:59.770
KRISTAN: That's right.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.040
LES: And they've got quite
an amazing set

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:08.460
of Google TV devices.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.130
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, I think the
launch of OnLive was really

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:11.910
kind of interesting.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:18.060
It brought, suddenly, a lot of
console titles and good games.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.890
KRISTAN: Well, you have access
to a great library

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.840
set that they have.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:25.400
But I want to see more,
quote unquote--

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.820
I don't want to use the
word "native," but I'm

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.455
kind of forced to.

00:29:27.455 --> 00:29:30.900
I want to see more Android
applications that are

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.220
game-specific, Google
TV-specific, and use maybe a

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.410
secondary input device.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.530
I think that would
go a long way.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.750
And I see Jason has joined
the Hangout.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.530
And Jason, do you want to give
us an update on your game or

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:44.780
is it too premature for that?

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.940
I can't hear him if
he's talking.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.888
LES: I muted him--

00:29:50.888 --> 00:29:51.862
KRISTAN: Yeah, now we can.

00:29:51.862 --> 00:29:52.530
MATT: There we go.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.290
JASON: All right, there's a lot
of background noise here

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.030
because everybody's on
lunch right now.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.380
But yeah, my game is still
kind of premature.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.900
But I've been testing--

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.990
I'm trying to do a top-down
vertical shooter that's

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.343
optimized for Google TV.

00:30:09.343 --> 00:30:10.070
Hope--

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.800
somebody's knocking
on the door--

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.770
hopefully I can get some preview
screens out and maybe

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:21.130
a stage, kind of a demo within
the next couple of weeks,

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.710
because I'm not that far
off from actually

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.700
having a soft demo.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.200
But I'm trying to make it
as polished as possible.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.920
KRISTAN: What are you using
for your input device?

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.000
JASON: Input right now is
configured for remotes, so I

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.690
have the original Blu-ray Google
TV remote and the new

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.350
black Sony Google TV box.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.990
And I've been wanting to
work with [? Animo ?]

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.725
as a joystick control.

00:30:45.725 --> 00:30:48.610
So I've been trying to work with
that a little bit more in

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.410
depth when I get a little
bit more time.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:56.630
Definitely, OpenGL ES 2.0
is the way to go.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:01.390
I've actually ran a couple
samples with Canvas, which is

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.540
just kind of just a blueprint of
how the game mechanics are

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.410
going to work.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.640
And then I can [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.750
ship that over to more
production for OpenGL ES.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.600
KRISTAN: Christian was talking
about Canvas in one of our

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.580
talks, weren't you?

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.590
About OpenGL and the
performance.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.470
CHRISTIAN: So you can go all the
way down to the nuts and

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.540
bolts of just OpenGL and using
the OpenGL ES 2.0 APIs.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.580
Or you can just use the
Android Canvas Draw.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.380
And there's a bunch of vertex
draw operations that work

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.210
relatively well.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.410
But that's more for 2D
kind of scenarios.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.090
And when you do that, make sure
you turn on the hardware

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:45.560
acceleration in the manifest
or purview or whatever.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.390
Cool.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:49.240
MATT: So Krispy, this might
interest you, because I know

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.740
you're really hardcore
into your games.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.890
Have you seen Arduino
have released a game

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.920
controller PCB board?

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.320
KRISTAN: Oh, oh,
oh, hells yes.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.550
MATT: I thought you would.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.020
KRISTAN: Addafruit, which
is a hardware site

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.750
online that I just--

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.410
I love the stuff they
do with Hangouts.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.965
Yeah, I saw that board and I've
actually ordered three.

00:32:12.495 --> 00:32:13.710
MATT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.476
KRISTAN: I only have two hands,
so I don't know what

00:32:15.476 --> 00:32:16.650
I'm going to do with
a third one.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.660
But I've got some
plans for it.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.320
I mean, it's got a
microphone on it.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.490
It's got accelerometer.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.440
It's got a potentiometer
slider at the bottom.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.500
Yeah, it's got the analog on one
side and you've got like

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.380
four buttons on the other.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:30.990
It's great.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.315
It's just I'm going to have to
build a case for it first.

00:32:33.315 --> 00:32:35.310
So 3D printer, here I come.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.906
CHRISTIAN: You know, just
because we got a storage room

00:32:36.906 --> 00:32:38.730
doesn't mean [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:41.010
hardware.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:42.510
KRISTAN: Yeah, well.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.920
I think there's actually a lot
of hardware that I've ordered

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.520
that's starting to arrive
now as we play with.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.410
But I love--

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.850
I mean, you're into
this too Paul.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:56.950
It's like finding ways to
interface with hardware and do

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.970
cool things with Android and
controlling other things.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.440
PAUL: Make it pour beer.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.080
KRISTAN: That's right,
kegdroid.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.970
Which I want keg coffee
at my desk.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.710
PAUL: Well, we have our
second kegdroid

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.015
is online this evening.

00:33:09.015 --> 00:33:11.150
3 o'clock, we're going
to start drinking

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.140
off of it here, so.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.635
KRISTAN: Mm.

00:33:12.635 --> 00:33:14.400
PAUL: Two of them are
up and running.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.650
KRISTAN: Robotic beer.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.645
LES: You know, with enough
coffee, you could probably

00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:21.895
melt one of those.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.970
KRISTAN: Does it blend?

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.073
Actually, that would
be awesome.

00:33:30.073 --> 00:33:32.440
PAUL: There are days I would
love to see it blend, yes.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.310
CHRISTIAN: We have some
[INAUDIBLE] to work.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.580
KRISTAN: Actually, that would
be the margarita droid.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.890
That's next, yes.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.060
LES: Actually, that'd be cool.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.300
KRISTAN: Maybe that's what you
want to do with the Google TV,

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.730
is recipes and controlling
the Blendtec blender.

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.703
Because it's got firmware.

00:33:50.703 --> 00:33:51.670
I don't know.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.670
LES: We have a whole bunch
of folks here.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.520
Maybe we ought to take
some questions.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.820
KRISTAN: Yes, I was actually
just trying to transition us

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.820
over there, but we got wrapped
up in hardware and beer and

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.920
all that stuff we
all care about.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.580
So yeah, I'm going to
just pull up the

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.280
DORY here and ask--

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.790
or talk to the questions
that we have.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:16.650
LES: Also, if you've got a live
question, you're welcome

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.500
to type it into the chat window,
for anybody who's a

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.360
member of the group.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:29.080
And I will take a peek at the
various things going on.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.805
MATT: Stoyan is straight
in there.

00:34:32.805 --> 00:34:34.230
KRISTAN: All right.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.960
So let me just scroll
down to the DORY.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.699
All right.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.570
So Shawn, you can answer
this one live.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.570
The question is, we have
submitted a website that is a

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.280
Google TV optimized site
and it's been approved.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.330
It's visible on the website
gallery, but it's not visible

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.560
on Spotlight.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.730
So they wanted to know when
they'd be visible on Spotlight

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:57.750
Yes, we answered it here.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.880
But for the benefit of our
viewers, why don't you--

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.122
SHAWN: Let me--

00:35:01.122 --> 00:35:03.000
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.710
There are two things.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.230
One is called a Google TV
gallery and there's another

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.090
thing called the Google
TV Spotlight.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.930
I Gallery is for developers to
submit your applications

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.980
online, where we do
a quick review.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.400
And if it's good enough, we can
approve it and then you're

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.720
right there, live on
Google TV Gallery.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.960
But that doesn't guarantee that
it's going to be in the

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.980
Google TV Spotlight.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.680
For Spotlight our apps,
we have a little bit

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.430
more process involved.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:32.460
So you have to implement a
[INAUDIBLE] navigation.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.640
You have to get the
UIs correctly.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.870
And then we do a team review.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.110
At that point, we kind of work
with you guys one on one and

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.500
get everything, like your
assets, ready, and then

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.466
publish it.

00:35:45.466 --> 00:35:50.120
MALE SPEAKER: OK, I asked this
question that Shawn answered.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.450
SHAWN: Yes.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:56.050
MALE SPEAKER: I wrote you today
because you answered me

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:02.020
yesterday with an email that
you want to do some things

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:07.110
that we should get more
categories for the homepage

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.320
and to re-shoot, polish
our design and the

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.770
part should be working.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.410
And today me and my team
here does some work.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:21.930
And we sent you an email and it
didn't get in the gallery.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.945
So what should we do next to
be visible on Spotlight?

00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:27.410
SHAWN: Yes.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.780
I saw your email.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.310
I had a look at your app.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:31.170
It looks pretty good.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.460
So I'll get back to
you in email.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.280
MALE SPEAKER: So
it's good, OK?

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:46.220
And our team should wait
for you or something?

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.050
SHAWN: Yes.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.300
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.360
And we should be approved
for the Spotlight.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.220
SHAWN: Yes, I'll get back to
your email and ask you for

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.790
more info and get assets, things
like that, in place.

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.170
And also, you guys need to
sign some documents.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:01.470
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.940
No problem.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.400
One more question.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:08.710
Is there any restriction
for adult content?

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.270
SHAWN: Yes.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.000
We don't allow that.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.930
Not adult contents.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.320
KRISTAN: Well, that's a--

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.990
we don't allow that to
show up on Play.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:19.080
And there's rules around
Spotlight too.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.650
So nothing--

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.135
yeah.

00:37:22.135 --> 00:37:26.080
LES: That said, there are at
least two companies that have

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.090
Google TV optimized
adult content.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.980
One an Android app.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.460
And I'm just-- yeah.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:41.010
One an Android app and
one a website that's

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.330
optimized for Google TV.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:49.720
So don't let that we won't
promote it stop you if you

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.435
have other ways to promote it.

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:52.800
KRISTAN: Yeah.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.280
Very delicate way
of putting it.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.550
All right.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.500
So I'm going to jump to the
next DORY question.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.800
And hopefully someone can
fill me in on this.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.460
I know very little about
selling in market.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.640
But for try-and-buy, this person
was not-- this is Tom

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.500
in Orange County--

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.820
not exactly clear what content
I need to have in my app for

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.610
the subscription.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:14.910
Could you explain this?

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.910
I'd asked for some clarification
and Matt had

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.300
added a bit of info in here.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.940
So maybe we could just take
a second and talk about

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.880
try-and-buy.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.580
Maybe Matt, if you want
to pipe in here.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.420
MATT: So my interpretation of
this question is, with the

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:34.510
subscription side of stuff, you
can essentially say, I'm

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.660
going to give you a period where
you don't have to pay me

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.320
anything and you can have the
app and the content for x

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.530
amount of time, after which you
agree that you'll either

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.910
cancel the subscription or then
actually start paying me

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.400
the regular fee.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.000
So that was kind of my
understanding of it.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.170
The way the question is kind
of phrased is to say, if I

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:58.150
want to partake in this idea of
having a free period, what

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.830
content do I need to have?

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:02.340
It seems like they're kind of
looking at it the wrong way.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.750
The way it's designed is if you
have regular content that

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.050
you think people will buy for a
subscription rate, then the

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.400
free period, the purpose of
that is to just give them

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.080
early access to that, so they
can see what they're going to

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.510
buy before they actually
buy it, essentially.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.120
So realistically, if you're
looking at a subscription

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.155
model, then you should already
have some regular content or

00:39:23.155 --> 00:39:25.920
some content they're going
to want access to.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.020
And then, all you're doing
with the try-and-buy is

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.260
literally just a set period of
time where the Play still

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.210
won't charge them and you can
give them early access.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:37.110
KRISTAN: So I'm a magazine
company and I've got, say,

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.270
magazines or I've got videos
or something that you would

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.730
normally pay a monthly
fee for.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.840
I'm like, you know what, anybody
who downloads or

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.270
installs my app, they can have
30 days free access and then

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.273
I'll start billing them.

00:39:48.273 --> 00:39:49.020
MATT: Exactly right.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.880
CHRISTIAN: So Matt, is
there actually ways--

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.840
I know, for example, we have
support for things like in app

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.070
billing and for things like

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.800
subscriptions in the Play Store.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.580
So if I want to implement
something like a try-and-buy,

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.200
is there actually easy
ways to do that with

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.400
our Play Store APIs?

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.690
Or do you need to add the trial
period yourself and then

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.810
manage the payments.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.900
MATT: So there's another
question in the DORY that's

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.470
pretty much exactly this, which
is kind of saying, if I

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.100
want to give people access for
a set amount of time, then

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.620
they buy it for a
one-time fee.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.170
There's nothing in the Play
Store that I'm aware of that

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.680
allows you to manage
everything.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.390
Essentially, I think the way
you'd do it is it would be a

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.966
free app that they download.

00:40:34.966 --> 00:40:38.020
And the way I recommended it
is you essentially sign up

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.870
with some form of
account details.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.030
And then that way, your back
end server can say, right,

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.800
this is the person who's
using the app.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.660
This is the start period.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.630
Track them for that period of
time and then do an in app

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.740
purchase at that point.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.010
And then from that point, you
can basically say, OK, cool.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.090
I know what account you are.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.105
You've paid for the app.

00:40:54.105 --> 00:40:54.460
Here you go.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.100
Have access.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.710
LES: Actually, I have an idea.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:03.180
Can't you have a zero
cost item in play--

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.740
that you've sort of forced them
to buy a zero cost item

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.630
that gives them their
first 30 days.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.980
And then they need to
renew for cost.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.620
That way, everything is stored
in play and they're not

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.870
sharing their credentials
with you.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:24.250
MATT: So there's two
ways of doing it.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.920
That would be a really
nice way of doing it.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.770
The only question I'd have is
whether you could find out

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.990
when they purchased the first
item, to then validate how

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.010
long they've had it for.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.530
LES: Yeah, you can.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.430
MATT: OK, cool.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:42.740
LES: The new Play Store APIs
for V3, I think, would be

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.150
where you'd want to
look for all this.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.890
MATT: Yeah, because I know
that you can see what

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:48.620
purchases they've made.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.900
It's just whether you get
information like the actual

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.090
date and time they
purchased it.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.150
But yeah, if you can do that,
then that would be a really

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.560
nice way of doing it, because
then obviously you don't have

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.460
to maintain your back
end server.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.880
So yeah, that would be
another alternative.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.780
So yeah, one way or another,
you'd have to implement the

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:09.440
payment-free period and then
in-app purchase after that.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.390
And we were kind of having a
discussion that a lot of users

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.063
normally prefer taking that
approach than just buying an

00:42:15.063 --> 00:42:17.120
app up front.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.680
It's got a much higher
conversion rate.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.810
So yeah, it's not just handed
to you on a plate, but yeah.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:26.010
I think Les's idea of the zero
pound kind of payment is quite

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:26.930
a nice way of doing it.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.930
And that's exactly how the
subscription one works.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:33.040
LES: I'm sure I said
"pound," yes.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:39.260
MATT: Dollar, euro,
what have you.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.620
KRISTAN: Yay, pesos.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.870
LES: Pesos.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:44.690
KRISTAN: All right, yeah.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:46.850
I actually took a look
at the Android

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:48.210
documentation for this.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:50.900
And it was the first time I
had looked at it today.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.960
It seemed pretty clear how to do
an end-to-end subscription.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.630
And I think there's some
variable time rates on

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.790
starting your billing,
et cetera.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.410
So the best place to go,
I think, is the Android

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.080
documentation site.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.680
And just follow that.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.130
MATT: And they've got a really
nice Android training resource

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.120
for the in-app billing
V3 stuff, which--

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.650
if you're looking at doing this
kind of stuff or you're

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.985
already on V2, I strongly
recommend looking at V3.

00:43:17.985 --> 00:43:20.090
It does simplify the
entire process.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:21.960
And the training dock is
really, really helpful.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.440
So yeah, definitely worth
a look at that.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.740
KRISTAN: Let's just clarify
version numbers.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.085
We're talking about V3,
not of Google TV.

00:43:29.085 --> 00:43:30.850
MATT: In-app Billing Version.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:32.470
In-app Billing Version 3.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:33.790
KRISTAN: There you go.

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.420
CHRISTIAN: Which is available
on Google TV Version 2.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.440
KRISTAN: Yes.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.500
LES: And three.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.370
KRISTAN: Which is part
of Android Version 4.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.830
LES: No.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.275
KRISTAN: But it's retrograde.

00:43:44.275 --> 00:43:46.040
It goes back, I think,
to, what--

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.290
LES: It's Android Version 3.2.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.150
KRISTAN: That's us?

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.630
LES: That's us.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.020
KRISTAN: Lots of version
number everywhere.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.720
All right, so, is there a way
to access content of video

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.200
container and pick and choose
tracks for playback?

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.060
This is Sebastian's question.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.200
And he says he's looking for
Media Player track Info, which

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.260
was introduced in API 16.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.200
So this is where it gets a
little tricky, because API 16

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.910
is not where Google TV's at.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:19.330
We're on API 13.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:23.380
So I actually asked some of
the engineering team today

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:28.040
about this, specifically
Mark Winder.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:33.460
And he said I've got to talk
to the Korean team.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.380
So I couldn't find anything
that would

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.650
necessarily allow this.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.250
That doesn't mean it's
not possible.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:43.720
But the truth of it is, you're
probably not going to have a

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.750
good time trying to use it.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:48.940
So.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.830
MATT: I think a lot of
developers are trying to do

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:53.980
this on the Android side,
because video playback, if you

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.800
want to do anything other than
the smallest, smallest videos

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.650
across all devices
is extremely,

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.950
extremely hard to do.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.290
And you kind of want access to
this kind of information to

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:04.632
gauge whether you think your
device can handle it or not.

00:45:04.632 --> 00:45:08.080
And there hasn't been
a way of doing it.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:14.030
So yeah, unless we've added
something in, it's not looking

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.676
like it's going to--

00:45:15.676 --> 00:45:16.430
LES: Wait.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:20.043
Krispy, could you say what
Sebastian's looking for again?

00:45:20.043 --> 00:45:20.750
KRISTAN: Yeah.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.000
Just a sec.

00:45:24.795 --> 00:45:25.640
Let's see.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.220
I couldn't understand fully
the answer to my question.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.510
Is there a problem
if we stream live

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:34.590
TV with adult content?

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:38.650
And if there is a problem,
how could it be solved?

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.510
LES: OK.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:41.170
Yeah.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:42.420
That's for Stoyan's.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.280
KRISTAN: Oh, sorry.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.760
I'm reading the wrong thing.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.000
LES: We'll answer Stoyan's
question in a moment.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.250
KRISTAN: All right.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.090
Back to Sebastian's question.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:51.140
Sorry.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.720
MATT: The API with the Media
Player dock track info.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.610
KRISTAN: Yes.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:59.410
He was looking for something
like that for Google TV.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:03.910
As far as I know, you can only
get limited information on the

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:08.840
audio stream, not the
video tracks.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.270
Because that goes through
the trusted video path.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.150
I don't know.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:15.940
LES: Well, there might be some
information you can get that's

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:26.790
part of the new APIs in V3
that lets you get stuff.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.420
And there's also, of course--

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:37.750
you could create a simulated
codec that gets information

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:40.640
for you and then all
it does is pass

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:45.220
onto the regular codecs.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.890
KRISTAN: So yeah, I could
conceive of something where

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:51.730
somebody might take the quality
of service APIs and

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:57.980
also wrap that into some sort of
extreme video transcoder, I

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.920
guess, or analyzer.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.110
If that's possible.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.720
It seems like it might be kind
of tricky to pull off.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.220
CHRISTIAN: I think the short
answer is we're not API 16.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.840
This API will not work.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.190
Doing it yourself is possible,
but it's not easy.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.490
LES: All right.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:21.760
So for Stoyan's follow-up
question, adult content can't

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.820
be in your app that we are
promoting for you.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:31.730
You could do another app
that is separate.

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.620
And I do understand
that there is--

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.690
KRISTAN: Well, let's put it
in the simplest terms.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:41.220
Google will not promote any
adult content applications.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.300
LES: Right.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:47.710
I will say that I did notice
that IOS, whoever they are, is

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.120
now selling adult content
in Russia, but--

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.250
excuse me.

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:00.200
Who knows.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.670
But we don't, at the moment,
allow any adult content to be

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.230
promoted by us.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:08.230
SHAWN: And also, most
of the OEMs.

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.110
When they feature anything, they
have pretty strict rule.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.680
We make sure filter
all these out.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.910
LES: This was someone else.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.750
I was laughing because I was
talking about adult content

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:23.670
and someone sent a
URL to an MP4.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:24.800
KRISTAN: Yeah.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.670
It's hash coded, so who
knows what's in it.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.950
Probably not going to click on
that while we're on air.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:34.770
But John, let's see if we can
get you an answer here.

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:36.700
Great way to troll,
by the way.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.500
Kidding.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.950
So John would like to know some
info on the requirements

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.770
for streaming video content
on Android.

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:44.600
He's got an example.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.470
It's an MP4.

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:48.610
I assume it's H.264.

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.970
He'd like to know, if possible,
if there's a working

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.490
sample project that can stream
video content currently.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:57.650
So it's actually possible to
stream this MP4, assuming the

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:02.700
codecs match with Google TV,
with like four lines of code.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:08.030
So you could have a layout
with a video view in it.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:12.750
And inside your main activity,
you would capture the video

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:17.310
view and you would set the
content URL to the MP4.

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:20.300
And then you would call
video view prepare and

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.240
then video view play.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.560
And your video will
start playing.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.840
That's the simplest
form to go.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.990
CHRISTIAN: I think the last
talk that we just gave at

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:33.690
AnDevCon, there was
actually a slide.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:33.810
Yeah.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.735
Actually, I put the
code in there.

00:49:35.735 --> 00:49:38.720
LES: There's also on
code.google.com/

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:49.130
p/googletv-video-player, it
has example of all that.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:50.380
Another--

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:57.580
in the API demos there
is stuff that

00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:58.780
shows how to do video.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:03.420
So there's plenty of content out
there for you to go take a

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.400
look at, John.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.585
KRISTAN: Les, you want to maybe
paste the URL just to

00:50:07.585 --> 00:50:10.310
the sample site for John
in the chat stream?

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:11.090
LES: Oh.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:16.030
You mean doing it off the top
of one's head is not enough?

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.590
KRISTAN: I always fail at
writing things down, myself,

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:24.760
butter fingers and all.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.340
But just as a follow-on to
this, John, you should be

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.350
aware that it's usually better
to stream the video than it is

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.615
to do a progressive download
and playback.

00:50:35.615 --> 00:50:37.640
Google TVs have limited
memory.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.950
And the hard drive space, if
you can even call it-- the

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.940
flash drive space on these
things is also rather

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.680
constrained.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.970
So my recommendation is, if you
want to do something like

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.960
this, set up a streaming
server.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.720
You should be able
to use something

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.100
like VLC and Handbrake.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:59.460
Or there's a number of services
online that can allow

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.690
for CDN content streaming.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:06.290
LES: He's got a Flash Media
server that he's

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:07.310
using at the moment.

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:10.490
So he's got all that.

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:14.250
Though, what you might want to
look at, John, is encoding it

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:18.330
multiple ways and converting it
to an NHLS, because that's

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.990
a much better way of delivering

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.710
content to your users.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:26.500
KRISTAN: And it can keep your
cost down for bandwidth.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.780
LES: Yeah.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.300
I'm not sure-- actually--

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.740
KRISTAN: Well, it would optimize
it, potentially.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.006
LES: Optimize it.

00:51:32.006 --> 00:51:34.070
It provides a better
quality for--

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:37.730
I'm not sure you're actually
lowering your costs using it,

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.920
because it's actually using
the best quality, which--

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.270
it delivers the right quality
at the right time, which

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.260
actually might increase
your costs.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:48.750
KRISTAN: Really?

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:49.845
Oh.

00:51:49.845 --> 00:51:51.180
OK, I have it backwards
, then.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.370
Yeah, it's backwards
in my head.

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:55.120
LES: Yeah, it's maximizing
your cost.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:03.260
KRISTAN: So HLS, you can read up
on that at a large company

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.182
whose icon is a fruit.

00:52:06.182 --> 00:52:08.200
LES: Yeah.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.130
There is a document on--

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:13.210
I'll post a document,
John, to the stream.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:20.580
KRISTAN: All right, I'm
going to just move us

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.820
on to the next question.

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:24.730
We're getting close to 2 o'clock
and I have a meeting

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.150
I've got to go to.

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:28.380
LES: You scheduled
it for two hours.

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.120
I was so shocked.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.860
KRISTAN: I scheduled
what for two hours?

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.480
LES: The Hangout.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.410
On my calendar.

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.220
KRISTAN: Did I?

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.910
LES: Yeah.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:38.755
KRISTAN: Well, it looks like
we're going to be going for

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:40.190
another hour, folks.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.013
No.

00:52:41.013 --> 00:52:42.480
CHRISTIAN: I should've brought
some more food and drinks.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.930
KRISTAN: Should've brought
some beer.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:44.980
That's what we need.

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.550
Next time.

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:48.810
CHRISTIAN: Next year.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:50.060
KRISTAN: Yes.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:56.530
On the newer generation Google
TV devices, is the Drive API

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:00.290
integrated with Android apps?

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.130
LES: No.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.420
KRISTAN: Unfortunately not.

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:08.070
If you'd like to try to figure
that out, you're welcome to.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:10.310
CHRISTIAN: As far as I
know, Drive API, it's

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:13.340
basically just a web API.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.020
It's like just a--

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:14.890
KRISTAN: It's restful.

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:16.580
CHRISTIAN: Just a bunch of chase
and calls and stuff.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.340
So you can do that from
any platform.

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.340
KRISTAN: Mm-hm.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.820
Yeah, I'd kind of be interested
to know what you

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.880
would want to use Drive
for with Google TV.

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.630
I mean, I can think of
a few scenarios.

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:30.520
But I'm just curious.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:34.220
MATT: I think the main use
case for it is if you can

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:40.500
start syncing application state
across multiple devices.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.790
Drive seems to be a nice way you
can start doing that while

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:47.590
also still giving the user
control of what you're syncing

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:48.230
if that makes sense.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:51.220
You're not using a third party
circle, which they can't view

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.880
or change or delete or
have control of.

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.650
So I think that's one of the
main use cases for it that

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:02.402
I've seen or heard developers
kind of want.

00:54:02.402 --> 00:54:02.865
KRISTAN: Hm.

00:54:02.865 --> 00:54:07.090
I wonder if you could
use it as a CDN.

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:08.840
Although there's probably
more cost-effective

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.990
ways of doing that.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.770
I don't know.

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:14.460
I'd be interested to see what
was going to come of that.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.030
So we've covered, I believe,
all the questions

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:18.260
that were in the DORY.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:24.340
LES: There was one more
on the + page.

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:25.470
KRISTAN: On the + page.

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:26.220
All right, let me--

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.880
MATT: Yeah, there's a good
one by Damien on there.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.120
Or there's two on there.

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.870
KRISTAN: All right, let's see.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:33.120
We have--

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.750
there is too many sources of
information for us to go on.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.750
Let's see.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:47.820
Is there a way to get notified
when a TV is

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.640
woken up from standby?

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.550
That is, boot completed doesn't
seem too useful since

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:56.260
people rarely complete power
down on a device.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.670
Will a scheduled event via alarm
manager wake a device

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.320
from standing by to run?

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.970
So I actually here this one--

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:08.360
I don't want to say too often,
but I've heard a lot of

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.410
requests about getting notified
when a TVs woken up

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:14.185
or when it's shutting down or
being able to set a timer and

00:55:14.185 --> 00:55:16.490
get it to turn on the TV.

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:20.070
And I think this is,
what, HDMI CDC or

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:20.840
something like that?

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.460
CHRISTIAN: HDMIC or something.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.890
Yeah, there's basically
a remote control--

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:26.430
KRISTAN: CEC.

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:27.005
Thanks, Sebastian.

00:55:27.005 --> 00:55:31.090
CHRISTIAN: --protocol that's
available over HDMI.

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:33.390
We don't currently have
any APIs for it.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.110
KRISTAN: Yeah.

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:37.190
It's twitchy.

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:40.560
CHRISTIAN: It's also a little
bit vendor specific.

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.210
LES: Right.

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:48.670
And in fact, some of the
vendors, notably Sony, have

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:55.640
some CEC stuff that
they do with it.

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.020
So you might want to
check their device.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:04.580
And they have a developer's
website, developers.sony.com,

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.730
that talks about their TVs.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:14.080
And I bet if you wrote Toni,
T-O-N-I, there, he'd probably

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.330
be able to help you.

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.050
KRISTAN: All right, so.

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:23.130
David Carver asks, any plans
for a way to contribute

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.960
content to the PrimeTime app
so it can aggregate local

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.405
media for a local
media server?

00:56:29.405 --> 00:56:31.450
An API would be ideal.

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:32.180
LES: It would be.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:32.920
PAUL: So the answer--

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.400
not locally, there is not.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.770
If you've got content that you
want to get discoverable,

00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:41.170
there's kind of a
roundabout way.

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:45.900
But it's got to be high quality,
long-form content.

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:49.680
At the moment, you've got to
go as far as having TMS IDs

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.920
and all sorts of other stuff.

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.120
So if you've never broadcast
on television before, you

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.990
probably don't have that.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:57.740
And it'd be a real, real
pain to get it.

00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.980
So at the moment, there's really
not an easy way to get

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:01.370
your content into PrimeTime.

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.020
And there's nothing saying you
can't do your own self

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.400
discovery and DLMA server
stuff and that thing.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.420
There are a couple of
apps that do that.

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.740
But that's not going to get
you into PrimeTime.

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:18.110
CHRISTIAN: I think a more
realistic approach would be to

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:22.550
have a search provider that can
provide searchable items

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:26.580
to the Quick Search
bar, to the QSB.

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.650
Oh yeah, that's not
a bad idea.

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:32.210
PAUL: The challenge with that,
though, is that when you do

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:35.510
that, you only get one search
result that comes in.

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:39.800
CHRISTIAN: And users have to
manually enable your content.

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.620
LES: Yeah.

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.630
KRISTAN: So as with everything,
this stuff will

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:43.620
evolve over time.

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:46.140
So I think it's just a
matter of stay tuned,

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:49.090
keep checking in.

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.230
Nothing else to announce
there, but--

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.810
LES: All right.

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:54.780
So I think we've covered
everybody's questions.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.630
We haven't actually gone
through the list.

00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:02.360
Is there anybody who's in the
Hangout who joined that has a

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.985
question that didn't
get one asked?

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.810
OK, cool.

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:08.570
KRISTAN: Awesome.

00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:09.540
Thanks, guys.

00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:13.570
Hopefully you'll tune back in
as we start off the new year

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.470
with some more Hangouts.

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:17.860
So just to reiterate
again, this is the

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.290
last Hangout for 2012.

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:23.240
You can reach us by email if you
have questions pertaining

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:26.720
to whatever you're doing
with Google TV.

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.820
And I hope you all have a good
holiday and New Year.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:33.160
LES: I'm truly amazed.

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.060
Thank you all.

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:35.240
KRISTAN: Caio.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.200
CHRISTIAN: Next year.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:36.850
MATT: Have a good one.

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:37.680
Bye, everyone.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.200
KRISTAN: Bye.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.450
Ending broadcast.
