00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.970
After the first and second world wars, PTSD
had a negative connotation.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.770
But not only is it a real mental illness,
you don’t have to be a soldier in a warzone

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.010
to suffer from it.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.090
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.039
Post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD is
something we often think about as affecting

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.790
war vets who have lived through terrifying
conditions in a combat zone.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.960
Sufferers experience unexpected rage, tears,
panic, have nightmares, and are generally

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.390
emotionally numb to the point that it affects
every aspect of their lives.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.560
But PTSD it isn’t just a soldier's’ plight.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.980
It can affect anyone because regardless of
the specific trauma you suffer, it changes

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.230
the brain in the same way.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.020
It all comes down to the way our body reacts
to fear, and specifically, what fear does

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.050
to the brain.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.640
The Triune Brain model breaks the brain into
three parts.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.580
The reptilian brain, also called the brain
stem, is the innermost part responsible for

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.580
survival instincts.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.560
The mammalian brain, also called limbic or
midbrain, processes emotions and conveys sensory

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560
relays.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.580
The neomammalian or frontal cortex controls
is the most developed part of the brain responsible

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.940
for cognitive processing, decision-making,
learning, memory, and inhibitions.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.610
Usually the brain gives orders in a top-down
structure.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.410
The neomammalian, then the mammalian and lastly
the reptilian.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.060
But, when faced with a trauma this order flips
and the reptilian brain takes the lead.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.140
It activates the sympathetic nervous system
and initiates the “fight or flight” response,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.890
releasing adrenaline and putting your body
in a state of readiness to do something physically

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.890
taxing.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.730
But a stress situation also causes changes
in specific brain regions and this is what

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.920
leads to PTSD.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.170
This chemical activity from stress causes
the brain to create memories that leave temporary

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.210
imprints in the brain’s circuitry and neuropathways.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.229
Every time we recall the trauma, the imprints
on those pathways can reactivate, bringing

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.520
back the stress response from the initial
event, forcing you to relive that life threatening

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.620
situation.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.920
But this doesn’t last.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.030
Normally your body and brain start the recovery
process, releasing the hormone cortisol and

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.840
putting the brain back into its normal top-down
structure.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.800
The imprints on the altered pathways fade,
and over time, recalling the trauma won’t

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.870
cause the same stress reaction.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.820
But in cases of PTSD the brain doesn’t shift
into recovery mode and the imprints on altered

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.060
pathways stick around.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.159
The reptilian brain stays ready to deal with
a threat.

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.209
The memories from the trauma and the associated
stress response don’t fade.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.379
It’s the lingering chemical and biological
imbalance keeping the brain in a fear state

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.140
where the trauma is relived through memories
that leads to PTSD.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.739
But there is a lot more to this.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.329
An overstimulated amygdala, which keeps the
memories active, and an underactive hippocampus,

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.069
which fails to process that the threat has
passed, are also effects of trauma that can

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.510
worsen PTSD.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.510
The good news?

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.340
PTSD is treatable, but it’s not a quick
fix.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.879
Recovery varies from person to person and
involves reprogramming the brain and body

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.159
to resume normal function.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.280
And while it’s not always entirely successful,
with the right treatment sufferers can also

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.790
learn to manage and live with their PTSD.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.150
Unfortunately, many victims don’t seek treatment
for their PTSD.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.849
So are we failing sufferers?

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.159
Trace takes on that question in this episode
of Test Tube News.
