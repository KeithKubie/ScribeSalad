00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, we don't have to break this problem into two parts,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but I'm going to. I prefer to do it that way.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So let's see how long it takes the ball to reach the top of it's trajectory.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm going to use this equation and I know at the top of the trajectory the final velocity is zero

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
where the initial velocity is up at 20 m/s and the acceleration is negative.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Remember if we've chosen V₀ to be positive and that's upwards,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
acceleration which is downwards must be negative.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So that's time of 2s to go upwards and look at the top of its trajectory

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
it's for that instant not moving and it has to fall all the way down to the ground.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But how far does it have to fall when not just the 57 m from the top of the tower

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to the ground also whatever distance it's gained on its trip upwards.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's calculate that--to make this extra distance calculation, I'm going to use this equation,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it turns out that it has gone an extra distance of 20 m and notice that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I've used the time 2 because that's what we just calculated.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
With this extra distance of 20 m added to this 57 m, we have a total fall distance of 77 m,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and this is the tool for the job there to calculate how much time it's going to take

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and the time to fall down is 3.9 seconds.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And noticed than in solving this equation I've called the acceleration

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
positive again and that's because I've called Δx positive.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I could have called Δy negative since it is moving downwards, but when

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
possible I like to just work with positive numbers, but this is totally a matter of preference.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we have 3.9 seconds plus our original 2 gives us a total of 5.9 seconds

00:01:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that the ball will stay in the air--good work.
