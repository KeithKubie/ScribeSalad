00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.100
We're on problem 42.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.420
And they've drawn this little,
looks like a pie graph.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.380
And they say, in the circular
region with center o shown

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.570
above, the two unshaded sections
constitute 3/7 and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.550
1/3 of the area of the
circular region.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.510
Fair enough.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.790
The shaded section constitutes
what fractional part of the

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.650
area of the circular region?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.870
So the shaded section is just
the whole area minus these two

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.350
fractions, right?

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.370
So if you said what fraction of
the whole area is the whole

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.690
area, you would say that's 1.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.460
And you would subtract out these
two areas to get the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.070
shaded area.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.570
So 1 minus 3/7 minus 1/3 is
equal to the fraction of the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.690
totally area that this
shaded area is.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.150
And let's just add or subtract
those fractions.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.980
The least common
multiple is 21.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.160
1 is the same thing as 21/21.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.120
Minus 3/7.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.180
Let's see, 7 goes
into 21 3 times.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.050
So 3 times 3 is 9.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.850
So this is the same thing
as minus 9 over 21.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.840
And minus 1/3 is the same thing
as minus 7 over 21.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.250
So this is equal to 21
minus 16 over 21.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.660
And that's 5/21, which
is choice D.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.910
Next question.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.920
0.3.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.900
[SNEEZES]

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.560
Excuse me.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.150
My apologies.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.990
0.3 to the 5th over
0.3 to the 3rd.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.120
Well, anything to the 5th
divided by anything to the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.230
3rd, you could essentially say
divide the top and the bottom

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.660
by 0.3 squared.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.050
Well, actually, you could divide
the top and the bottom

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.630
by 0.3 cubed.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.280
You could say this is the same
thing as 0.3 to the 5th times

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.240
0.3 to the minus third.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.950
That's just another
way of doing this.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.130
And so if you're dividing these
two numbers, you would

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.050
subtract the exponents.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.920
But now we're multiplying.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.820
We're adding the exponents.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.666
But either way, it becomes
0.3 squared.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.190
And that is equal to 3
times 3, which is 9.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.430
And you're going to have two
numbers behind the decimal

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.000
points, right?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.990
0.3 times 0.3.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.470
Two numbers behind the
decimal points.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.200
1, 2.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.110
So two numbers behind
the decimal point.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.626
So 0.09.

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:27.780
Or another way of saying it
is 30% of 0.3 is 0.09.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.470
And that is choice C.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.510
44.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.680
In a horticultural experiment--
this is sounding

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.050
interesting already-- 200 seeds
were planted in plot 1.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.440
So plot 1 got 200 seeds.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.550
And 300 were planted
in plot 2.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.140
So plot 2 got 300 seeds.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:12.760
If 57% of the seeds in plot 1
germinated, and 42% of the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.320
seeds in plot 2 germinated, what
percentage of the total

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.810
number of planted seeds
germinated?

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.620
So the total number of planted,
what percent?

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.580
So how many total seeds
germinated is going to be 200

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.020
times 0.57.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.090
That's how many in plot
1 germinated.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.350
Plus 300 times 42%, or 0.42.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.010
That's how many in plot
2 germinated.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.220
All of that divided by 500.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.510
Right?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.370
And how do I know 500?

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.490
Because there were a
total of 500 seeds.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.550
So just to simplify the math,
we could just divide

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.100
everything by 100, right
from the get go.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.720
So if you divide the bottom by
100 and the top by 100, you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.980
have to do both terms by 100.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.170
So you get 2 times 0.57 plus
3 times 0.42 divided by 5.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.360
2 times 0.57.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.610
That is what?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:22.190
Let's see, this is
1.14 plus 1.26.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.700
Is that right?

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.020
3 times 4 is 12.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.780
3 times 2 is 6.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.080
Right?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.060
1.26.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.630
All of that over 5.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.100
This becomes what?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:40.390
This is equal to 2.4
divided by 5.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.360
And so 5 goes into 2.4.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.580
Let's see, goes into
4, 4 times 5 is 20.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.890
48.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.180
So 0.48.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.510
So the answer is 48%
or 100 times 0.48.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.020
And that's choice C.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.570
Question 45.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.170
Let's switch to a more
interesting color.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.150
3 and 8 are the lengths of two
sides of a triangular region.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.320
Which of the following can be
the length of the third side?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.580
OK.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.780
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.500
3 and 8 are the lengths of two
sides of a triangular region.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.600
Let me write their
choices down.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.210
Choice one is 5.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.270
I can easily imagine
a triangle that has

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.520
sides 3, 8, and 5.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.152
That seems completely
reasonable.

00:05:31.152 --> 00:05:32.210
I'm just experimenting.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.890
I don't know where
this is going.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.590
8.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.100
Well, sure, that's just
an isosceles triangle.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.910
You can easily have a triangle
that has 8, 8, and 3.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.050
Choice three.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.200
11.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.440
Now, this is interesting.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.270
Let me ask you a question.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.710
Can I have a triangle that
looks like this?

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.050
11 and then 3 and then 8.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.900
Is this possible?

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.010
Well, no, because
3 plus 8 is 11.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.320
So the only way you're going to
get 11 is if you push this

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.170
side all the way flat.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.600
That's the only way you're going
to get the length of

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.340
this third side to be 11.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.450
In fact, 11 is the upper
bound on what this

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.770
third side could be.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.960
Because imagine this.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.110
Imagine if I made the triangle
really flat, I made this angle

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.080
right here really wide, as
close to 180 as I can.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.410
And I make it really flat.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.840
Right?

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.710
If this length plus this length,
or this length plus

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.170
this length is equal to 11,
this length is going to be

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.040
shorter than it.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.000
This length right here has to
be shorter than this length

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.400
plus this length, right?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.410
Because it's kind of a
straight-line distance between

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.610
this point and this point.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.680
So 11 is the upper
bound, right?

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.880
The only way to get 11 is if
you completely flatten out

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.910
this triangle, at which point
that's not a triangle anymore.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.260
It'll be a line.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.960
So it can't be choice three.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.130
So the only possibility.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.910
They say, which of the following
can be the length of

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:54.880
the third side?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.960
So it's only choices
one and two.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.030
And that is choice C.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.450
Next problem.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.880
46.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:15.650
How many integers n are there
such that 1 is less than 5n

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.400
plus 5, which is less than 25?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.740
OK.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.610
So they say how many integers n
are there so that 5n plus 5.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.110
So they didn't say positive
integers, right?

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.000
So that's an interesting
thing to keep in mind.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.040
So let's just try to simplify
this a little bit.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.330
Let's subtract 5 from all
sides of this double

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:39.990
inequality.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.910
So if you subtract 5 from
everything you get minus 4 is

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:50.410
less than 5n, which
is less than 20.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.640
Right?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.960
So another way you could say
it, is let's just divide

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.770
everything by 5.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.890
So because 5 is positive you
don't have to change the

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.470
inequalities.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.810
So you get minus 4/5 is less
than n, which is less than 20

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.140
divided by 5, is 4.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.640
So now the question becomes
a lot simpler.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.940
How many integers n are
there such that this?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.200
How many integers are there
between minus 4/5 and 4?

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.840
And it's not equal
to any of those.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.300
So 0 is an integer.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.770
1, 2, and 3.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.510
So there are 4 integers.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.080
So that is B.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.190
OK, next problem.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:42.370
47.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:49.710
A car dealer sold x used cars
and y new cars during May.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:56.410
So number used is equal to x.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.650
Number new is equal to y.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.750
During May.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.910
If the number of used cars sold
was 10 greater than the

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.320
number new cars, which of the
following expresses this

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.070
relationship?

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:15.140
So the number of used cars, x,
was 10 greater than the number

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.850
of new cars.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.480
So it's 10 greater than y, so
it equals y plus 10, right?

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.740
This says that the number of
used cars is 10 more than the

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.330
number of new cars.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.460
So we just have to look for
that. x is equal to y plus 10.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.260
That's choice D.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.810
I think we have time
for one more.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:41.110
48.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.820
If a 10% deposit that has been
paid toward the purchase of a

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.890
certain product is $110,
how much more

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.060
remains on the product?

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.150
So essentially they're saying,
110 is 10% of what number?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.200
That's the first thing
you have to say.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:04.780
So 110 is equal to 0.1
times what number?

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.050
So that's the price.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.280
Let's call that the original
price of the product.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.550
So the original price of the
product is going to be what?

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.430
It's going to be 110 divided
by 0.1, which is

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.570
just this times 10.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.390
Which is 1,100, right?

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.850
Just add a 0.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.455
So that's original purchase
price of the product.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.990
The deposit is $110 and
they want to know

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.100
what do you have left.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.310
So you're going to put
$110 deposit on it.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.340
This was the original
purchase price.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.935
You put $110 deposit.

00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:45.590
Let's see, 1,100 minus 100 would
be 1,000, but then we

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.210
have another 10.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.540
So it would be 990.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.340
So that is choice B.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.300
And you could do it
the other way.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.880
You could just do a little
bit of borrowing.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.500
Anyway, you get the idea.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.970
And you would get choice
B, which is 990.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.810
And I'm out of time.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.450
See you in the next video.
