00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.330
We've covered a lot of ground in the last few units. You've learned how to

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.200
declare variables, and I want to come back to the question, what do you do with

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.150
a variable once you've declared it. Here we have a variable, planet. It's of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.080
type picture, and it's somehow initialized. Now I want to use the variable. I

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.150
want to call a method on it. What methods can I call? And when I pick a method,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.110
what values should I give it? That's what the Public Interface of the Class

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.280
tells us. It tells me, which methods I can use and what values I should supply.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.060
Let me give you an analogy. The public interface of a car is all of the buttons

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.460
and gizmos that you see here on the dashboard. A while ago, I was driving along

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.890
in this rental car I could not figure out how to turn on the dome light, so I

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.308
had to pull out the owners manual. The public interface of the class is also

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:53.620
described in a kind of owners manual, called javadoc. That's the owners manual

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.890
of a class or of a set of classes, let's have a look at javadoc.
