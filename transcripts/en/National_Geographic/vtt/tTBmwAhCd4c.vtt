00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.300
[music playing]

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.533
CROFTON DIACK: Cameras
aren't working,

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:07.400
and it's getting
super frustrating.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.400
MAN: This is what it's
like on "Life Below Zero."

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.266
JOHN GRIBER: The camera's
already down, tough conditions

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.734
all around to film it.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:14.533
CROFTON DIACK: No heat.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.533
No power.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.333
No anything.

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.867
Ugh.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:19.166
It won't even turn on.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.900
CROFTON DIACK: I've
fallen too many times.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.867
We have bad winds.

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:27.367
This is a typical
day in the Arctic.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.834
JOHN GRIBER: Making the
best with what we got.

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.200
[music playing]

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.467
CROFTON DIACK: It's super windy.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:42.900
And our cameras aren't working.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.567
And it's getting
super frustrating.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.967
SUE: It is an impressive
storm, and I'm only supposed

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.400
to get a little bit of a lull.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.834
So like it or hate it, even
though I've still got wind,

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:56.900
even though it's
still a blizzard,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.400
I have to start moving the snow.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.100
CROFTON DIACK: So it's
going get down to 20 below.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.700
We have bad winds.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.433
It's just blowing,
blowing, blowing.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.900
And it's messing
with our cameras.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.767
It's getting frustrating.

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:13.200
We have visibility
of 100 yards maybe.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.467
It's just a typical
day in the Arctic.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.266
They're filming at Kavik.

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.100
[bleep] winds.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.900
[bleep]

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.300
JOHN GRIBER: What I'm doing is
setting up suit, clearing snow.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.100
Ugh.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.367
[bleep] you.

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:29.500
Conditions are a
little blustery.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.734
[bleep] battery thing
keeps coming up.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:33.867
And we're unable to do our job.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:34.667
That's what I'm doing.

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:36.000
This sucks.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.333
You can't really always rely
on gear operating properly.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.834
Here's a top of a
building right here.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:41.934
So we've gotten a lot of snow.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:44.834
And a lot of wind has
moved a lot of snow.

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.934
So setting up these shots, I
really don't know if they're

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:49.066
going to work a lot of times.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.633
But we want to maximize
our time out here.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:55.667
So we've got GoPros
set up on Sue's bobcat.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:57.734
You never know if those are
going to last very long,

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:59.433
or if those are going to fail.

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:01.333
And then we'll be
running two other cameras

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.800
watching her clear snow.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.367
It's probably around 15
degrees ambient temperature.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:09.700
But with the wind chill, it's
probably more like negative 15,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.567
negative 20, I guess.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:11.800
I don't know.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.633
It's cold enough, you don't
want to touch anything

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.533
with bare fingers for very long.

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:21.633
Electronics don't seem to last
very long in the cold either.

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:22.867
CROFTON DIACK: This
is Sue right now,

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:25.834
trying to clear the path
so that our plane can land

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:27.133
at some point to pick is up.

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:28.467
But it's intense.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.967
So to get this shot of her
doing it, we need two C300s up.

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:33.567
We need GoPros up.

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:36.900
And I need Sue to be
a bad ass and plow

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.233
a road through everything.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:42.633
JOHN GRIBER: [bleep] Mark
II won't even turn on.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:43.433
MAN: Seriously?

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:45.300
JOHN GRIBER: Yeah.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.800
Making TV.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.934
We'll see what happens.

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.633
The drone's a valuable tool.

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:52.533
I mean, GPS is just messed up.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:53.967
And I don't know.

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.033
I'd hate to lose this drone.

00:02:58.233 --> 00:02:59.967
SUE: Not a bad way
to spend a day,

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:01.567
digging a little snow cave.

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:06.300
I feel like it's important for
me to brush up on my skills.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.100
And I'm not going
to wait until I have

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.767
to have one to
figure out, at 55,

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:14.533
do I still remember
how to make one?

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:16.300
JOHN GRIBER: It's
been kind of trying

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.166
with flying the drone lately.

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:22.433
Between super high winds,
incredibly cold temperatures,

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.433
I haven't really
been able to have

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:28.233
much success in keeping the
drone kind of where I want it.

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:31.133
I think we're so
far north that we

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:35.300
can't determine where the GPS
is, where the GPS signal is.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.333
And so it honestly just leaves.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:39.500
No matter which way I
push the controller--

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.433
left, right, up, down--

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:43.567
the thing, the drone
just takes off.

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:45.467
I mean, look at where we are.

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:47.433
There's a chance that I'd
probably find this thing.

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.033
Where it ends up,
I have no idea.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:52.333
You never know what the
weather is going to do.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:54.633
Zero wind, we've been
up here for two weeks,

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:57.533
and this is by far the
nicest day we've had.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:00.133
See, right now, it
says my GPS is good.

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.166
Let's see what happens here.

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:04.400
Sue's walking out to the Argo.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.433
And I'm really
hoping this works.

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:10.233
[drone whirs]

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:12.633
MAN: There it is.

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:13.433
JOHN GRIBER: I see it.

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:16.300
[music playing]

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.967
Just doing one more move,
and then we'll call it good.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.133
That was a good flight.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:39.600
That was the best one
of the whole trip.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.867
That was the best one
for two weeks of flying.

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:43.233
This is what makes
me happy right

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:45.667
there-- the drone is down.

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:46.667
So that's great, and
we got a good shot.
