DOUG: Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.176
Is this on?

00:00:06.176 --> 00:00:06.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.965
DOUG: OK.

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:09.590
Good afternoon.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.030
And thank you for coming.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.860
I'm very pleased to introduce
today Evan Thompson, author

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.510
and philosopher.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.440
Dr. Thompson works in the
fields of cognitive science,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.430
philosophy of mind, and Asian
and contemporary Buddhist

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.750
philosophy in dialogue with
Western philosophy and science.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900
He's a professor of the
philosophy department

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.230
at the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.880
and in 2013, was
elected a fellow

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.660
of the Royal Society of Canada.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.670
As an undergraduate, he was
a student of Robert Thurman,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.310
noted Buddhist scholar.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.170
Dr. Thompson has been an
early participant in the Mind

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.090
and Life conferences
with the Dalai Lama,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.580
where leading scientists,
scholars, and contemplatives

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.640
meet to collaborate
on research programs

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.400
to investigate the mind.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.940
Dr. Thompson has authored
many articles and books,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.840
including "The Embodied
Mind" and "Mind and Life."

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.020
His most recent work is
"Waking, Dreaming, Being,"

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.280
a thought-provoking book
centered around the questions

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.200
what is consciousness?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.720
How does it relate to
the brain and body?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.520
How does it relate
to our sense of self?

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.240
The book has been
widely praised.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.450
It's been called a
groundbreaking exploration

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.460
of consciousness.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.900
Dr. Richard Davidson,
researcher and founder

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.750
of the Center for
Healthy Minds, comments,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.580
"It is a dazzling synthesis.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.610
Thompson takes on some of the
most fundamental questions

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.920
about the nature of
mind, and addresses them

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.750
with remarkable
creativity and clarity.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.870
This volume is a must-read for
any serious student of the mind

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.120
and consciousness."

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.274
And I can say I've read
it and I've enjoyed it.

00:01:50.274 --> 00:01:52.190
There are many fascinating
things in the book.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.190
So I recommend you read it, too.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.770
And now I'll turn it over
to Professor Thompson

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.680
to guide us on a
stimulating journey

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.605
through "Waking,
Dreaming, and Being."

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:09.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:12.000
EVAN THOMPSON: Thank
you very much, Doug.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.510
And also thanks to
[INAUDIBLE] for the invitation

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.720
to speak here.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.690
And thanks to all of you
for coming to the talk.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.260
What I would like to
do is to share with you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.500
some of the main themes and
ideas of this book, "Waking,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.700
Dreaming, Being."

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.300
And to give you the central
idea right at the outset, what

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.800
I explore in the
book is the idea

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.430
that the self is an
experiential process.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.630
So the self is not a
thing or an entity.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.670
It's a process.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.000
And it's a process that's
under constant construction

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.450
and reconstruction.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.360
And this happens in different
ways across waking and sleeping

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.070
and dreaming, lucid
dreaming, various kinds

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.230
of meditative states, focused
attention, open awareness,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.354
and various altered
states of consciousness.

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:00.895
For example,
out-of-body experiences.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.960
Now in the book,
what I do to discuss

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.800
these states of consciousness
in relation to the self

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.440
is to use a certain model that
comes from Indian philosophy.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.750
And this is a model that we
see across different systems

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.530
of Indian
philosophical thinking.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.150
Buddhist, but also Hindu, for
example in the [? Samkhya ?]

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.490
yoga tradition.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.150
And its a model
that distinguishes

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.470
between awareness, the
sheer fact of awareness,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.320
the various contents
of awareness

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.520
that change from moment to
moment, the thoughts we have,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.600
the perceptions we have,
the dream images we have,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.490
the memory images we have,
the emotions we have.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.500
And then ways that we
identify with certain contents

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.360
of awareness as
I, or me, or mine,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.870
versus others as not me,
or not I, or not mine.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.270
So right now I'm in a
waking state, I believe.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.280
And I have an experience of
body sensations and of thoughts.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.770
And immediately
they are experienced

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.050
as mine versus the world,
which is experienced as not me.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.160
So there's a basic
self/not self distinction

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.700
that's operative throughout the
changing contents of awareness.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.790
And the Indian term for this,
the Sanskrit term for this, is

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.160
a [? ahumkara, ?] which
literally means I making.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.280
The process of making a sense
of self, a sense of identity.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.180
Or in a more cognitive
science language,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.560
we would use the term
say self-identification.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.860
Now with that model I
explore a whole range

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.180
of phenomena of consciousness.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.330
In the waking
state-- perception,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.400
attention, memory,
mind-wandering.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.320
I'm going to say some
things about those today.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.110
Different kinds of
meditative states.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.000
States of focus single
pointed attention

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.120
versus a more open awareness.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.410
Various experiences having
to do with dreaming,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.520
which I'll also say
some things about today.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.070
The experiences we
have just as we're

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.970
transitioning from waking into
dreaming or waking into sleep.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.710
So sleep onset,
hypnagogic experiences,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.920
those as distinct from
the dream state where

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.770
we have this experience of
being in a world in the dream

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.820
experience.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.290
Lucid dreaming, where we come
to realize that we're dreaming.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.520
And we can attend to our
state as a dream state,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.910
or attend to the quality of
the experience as dreamlike.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.340
Out-of-body experiences,
which can occur spontaneously,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.280
or through partial
aspects of them

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.580
through virtual
reality technologies.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.750
They are also one
feature of reported

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.900
near-death experiences.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.220
So that's a whole other
family of experiences.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.160
In the book I also
talk-- I won't

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.560
talk about this today unless
it comes up in questions.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.570
I also talk about the
nature of dream, the sleep.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.360
In many Indian
philosophical contexts,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.190
contemplative context,
dreamless sleep

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.350
is not considered to be
just a blackout state.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.720
It's considered to be a
state in which a certain kind

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.110
of subtle awareness
continues to be present,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.750
and that you have a taste
of in the immediate moment

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.030
of awakening from a deep sleep.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.770
And then I also talk
about the experience

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.270
of the dissolution
of consciousness,

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.930
or the breakdown of the self
in the process of dying.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.910
And then the recent interest
in near-death experiences

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.050
in clinical and neuroscience
research contexts.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.990
Now the approach that I take
is a neurophenomenological

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.490
approach.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.677
This is a term that was
introduced by someone

00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:32.760
I worked very closely with
for a number of years--

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.410
Francisco Varela, who is a
neuroscientist and a very

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.180
philosophical neuroscientist,
also a practicing Tibetan

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.000
Buddhist.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.740
And he used the term
"neurophenomenology"

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.200
to refer to the idea
that phenomenology--

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.680
the study of experience,
what experience

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.910
is like from the perspective
of experience itself-- is

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.290
an important source of
insight and information

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.120
for neuroscience, or
for cognitive science,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.570
more generally.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.460
So there's a mutual circulation
between phenomenology--

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.390
the study of experience,
and neuroscience--

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.750
the study of the brain, and that
a particular really important

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.710
window onto that comes
through the kind of training

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.720
of the mind, training of
attention and awareness,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.640
that we see in various kinds
of contemplative or meditative

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.600
practices.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.930
So the idea that meditative
insight illuminates

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.024
phenomenology,
phenomenology provides us

00:07:23.024 --> 00:07:25.190
an important source of
information for neuroscience.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.200
Of course, there's the
neuroscientific study

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.480
of meditation, as well.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.450
And that these things are all
in a mutually enlightening

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.240
and forming relationship.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.922
And this is the
perspective that I

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:38.380
take in the book in discussing
all of these different kinds

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.000
of phenomena.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.416
So I try to balance
the discussion

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:44.641
among these different methods
and sources of evidence.

00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:45.140
OK.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:51.620
So I'm going to go through
some basic points or themes

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.350
having to do with the experience
that we have through waking

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.270
and dreaming and lucid dreaming
in order to illustrate some

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.400
of these ideas.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.260
So to begin with
the waking state,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.030
the waking state is
one in which there

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.390
is an alternation,
an ongoing kind

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.310
of back and forth between what
cognitive psychologists would

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.379
call perceptual coupling--
that is, when we relate

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:18.420
to the outer world through
perception and action,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.442
and our attention jumps from one
sensory stimulus to the other,

00:08:21.442 --> 00:08:23.900
and we experience a sense of
self that's very much grounded

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.970
on the body and what the
body is doing in perception

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.800
and action-- versus
what would then

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.210
be perceptual decoupling, which
is the kind of relationship

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.890
that we have to inner thoughts
and mental contents that

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.159
spontaneously arise that
can grab our attention.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.360
If we mind wander
or if we daydream,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.030
or if we're
practicing meditation

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.980
where the perceptual
coupling aspect might be

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.840
say, attending to the breath.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.330
But of course, if you engage
in a basic breath meditation

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.834
practice, you know
immediately that you move away

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:54.500
from the breath.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.280
Some mental content arises.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.302
It holds your attention.

00:08:57.302 --> 00:08:59.760
And then at a certain point,
you notice that your attention

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.440
is held by that content.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.070
You release it, let it go,
and return to the breath.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.530
So that's a kind of cycle
of perceptual coupling,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.140
and then awareness of
spontaneous mental content

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.280
returning to the perceptual
sensation of the breath.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.820
Now until the waking state is
characterized by this dynamic.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.350
Now I want to talk about a
study that I was involved in.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.120
This is not talked about in the
book "Waking, Dreaming, Being,"

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.980
because it was just
published this year.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:35.180
And this is a study that
looked at spontaneous thought

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.910
or spontaneous cognition and
the neural activity associated

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.890
with it studied
using fMRI imaging

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.920
in experienced
mindfulness practitioners.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.480
So the participants
in the study were

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.580
18 long-term practitioners,
where that means over

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.340
estimated 3,000
hours of practice

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.390
in a particular
tradition of vipassana,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.790
or insight meditation
tradition of Mahasi Sayadaw.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.260
And the author, Sean
Pritchard, on this study,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.130
is a clinical psychologist,
and was for many years

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.930
a monk in Asia, and
an experienced teacher

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.250
and practitioner of this
particular method of vipassana.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.340
And so he was
involved in recruiting

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.120
the appropriate subjects who had
the experience for the study.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.470
And the reasoning was basically
that in this style of practice,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:29.230
one of the things that you do is
to notice when thoughts arise,

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:35.560
and to briefly label them-- body
sensation, emotion, narrative

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.950
thought-- and then to not
as it were kind of stick

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.310
to the thought, but to
note the thought, label it,

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.640
and then to let go.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.400
So given that these
individuals engage

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.024
in this kind of
practice, the reasoning

00:10:48.024 --> 00:10:49.860
was, well they
should actually be

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.520
quite good at noticing
when a thought first

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.300
arises in their
experience in a way that

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.030
would enable them to report it.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.530
So the reasoning
was that they would

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.900
be very good at noticing the
arising of a thought in a way

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.890
that would enable
it to be reported,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.130
and that this would then
provide a marker in time whereby

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.650
one could look at the
antecedent neural activity

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.540
to the reporting of the thought,
the neural activity when

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.790
the thought is being reported,
and the neural activity

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.380
subsequent to the thought,
and that that would provide

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.910
a way of looking at some
of the dynamics associated

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.710
with spontaneous cognition.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.950
So in this study,
which was a study--

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.350
the first author
is Melissa Ellamil.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.990
And the study was done in the
laboratory of Kalina Christoff

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.650
at the University
of British Columbia.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.840
The procedure was to report
thoughts when they first

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.950
are noticed to have
arisen, and then

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.640
to indicate whether it's
an emotional thought,

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.640
or whether it's a visual
thought, or a narrative

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.530
thought, or a
thought having to do

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.960
with a sensation of the body.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:59.260
And the control
in the experiment

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.970
was to then present according
to the same time course, words

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.970
that would be
perceptually recognized

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.238
as emotional or
visual or narrative.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.360
And what they found is that
before the button press,

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.670
certain areas are
comparatively activated.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.665
And these are memory
areas-- the hippocampus,

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:25.350
parahippocampus especially, and
the inferior parietal lobule--

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.970
that's before the button press.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.950
During the button press,
another suite of areas

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.640
are comparatively activated.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.810
And then after the button
press, another suite of areas

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:36.560
are activated.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.310
So then the question is, what's
the interpretation of this?

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.924
I should say that
the idea here again,

00:12:41.924 --> 00:12:44.090
is to get a kind of extended
picture of the dynamics

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.540
of brain activity
as thoughts arise,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.380
compared to as words
are perceived that match

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.270
the kind of thought in content.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.270
So this is what you see
for the thought arising,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:01.780
but not for the word perception
in the comparative analysis.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.240
And so the idea is
that, well, in the case

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.530
of spontaneous thought,
thoughts are born out

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.310
of memory, memory systems.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.167
And they have a kind
of affective salience

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.000
that might have to do
with a body sensation,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.900
or a kind of emotional content,
or a memory image or something

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.480
like that.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.080
They capture attention.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.729
So this is what the cognitive
scientists would talk about

00:13:22.729 --> 00:13:24.770
as that moment where
there's a kind of decoupling

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.228
from the perception
because there's

00:13:26.228 --> 00:13:28.450
a affect of salience
to the thought that's

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.540
capturing attention.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.140
And then that can become a focus
for metacognition, that is,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.960
for roughly thinking about the
thought, noticing the thought,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.286
not sticking to it
if you're practicing

00:13:42.286 --> 00:13:44.786
a kind of mindfulness meditation
where you note the thought,

00:13:44.786 --> 00:13:48.360
but you don't get caught
up in the content.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.930
And then whatever cognitive
and emotional aberration

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:55.050
ensues prior to
returning to, as it were,

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.480
releasing or
dropping the thought.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.290
So memory reactivation then
is before the button press--

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.770
so memory areas of the brain.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.380
The redirecting of the attention
to the recalled memory.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.910
That's also before the
button press, presumably.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.660
During the button
press, this is when

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.980
there's some kind of evaluation
or affective appraisal.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.100
And then after the button
press, the metacognition

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.960
and the elaboration.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.107
This is the kind of
model for interpreting

00:14:23.107 --> 00:14:23.940
the neural findings.

00:14:26.692 --> 00:14:28.150
So the point, then,
of the study is

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.550
to take advantage of
the particular skill

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.390
that this kind of meditation
practitioner has in a way

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.400
that illuminates something
about the dynamics of the waking

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.250
state, both
phenomenologically, but also

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.650
in terms of neural activations.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:47.515
Now another study-- or this is
more of a theoretical piece,

00:14:47.515 --> 00:14:52.430
a meta analysis with a
theoretical framing that

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.330
comes from the same lab
of Kalina Christoff,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.350
with the first author
now Kieran Fox,

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.430
is to comparatively
analyze mind-wandering,

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.210
or spontaneous
cognition of the sort

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.260
that we were just looking at,
in relationship to dreaming.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.870
So in this study they
compare neuroimaging results

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.850
from studies of
REM sleep dreaming

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.930
with neuroimaging results from
the study of mind-wandering.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.340
And they compare the
first person reports,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.220
the first person
content reports.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.750
So it turns out there's
a lot of similarities.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.090
That is, in both
cases, the content

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.610
is largely audiovisual and
emotional-- when you dream,

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:28.920
when you mind wander.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.030
The structure is
loosely narrative.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.980
And of course, its
tinged with various kinds

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.920
of fantasy elaboration.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.400
The content on
analysis turns out

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.200
to be strongly related
to current concerns.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.832
So you tend to mind
wander towards topics

00:15:43.832 --> 00:15:45.790
that are of current
concern in your daily life.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.790
And you tend to dream
in ways that reflect

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.060
current concerns as well.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.810
That of course it draws
on long-term memory.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.569
It simulates social
interactions.

00:15:54.569 --> 00:15:56.610
So a lot of mind wandering
is imagining yourself,

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.234
or what would have
been better if I had

00:15:58.234 --> 00:15:59.627
said this to my partner.

00:15:59.627 --> 00:16:01.710
And that would've been a
much better thing to say.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:02.820
Why did I say this?

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.855
We simulate and reenact
social situations.

00:16:04.855 --> 00:16:07.800
And of course, that happens
a lot in dreams as well.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.020
And we identify with now
not so much the bodily self,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.180
but with a certain
mental image of the self.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.680
So the mental image is
the content of awareness.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.060
And we identify with
an image from memory

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.580
or an image in the
dream state as self.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.850
In both cases,
meta-awareness-- so this

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.010
is awareness of the current
contents of consciousness,

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.100
or of the current state
of consciousness--

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.740
is comparatively lacking.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.540
So often when you get caught
up in a daydream or mind

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.920
wandering, its only down the
road that you become aware of,

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.380
oh, my mind is wandering.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.640
And of course, in a dream
that's a non-lucid dream,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.040
you don't have awareness of
the state as a dream state.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.020
That awareness is
actually what marks

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.590
the transition from a
dream into a lucid dream.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.179
And I'll say more
about that in a minute.

00:16:58.179 --> 00:16:59.970
And then from the
neuroscience perspective,

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.430
there's a large overlap
in activation patterns

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.130
of various cortical regions.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.050
So both activate
regions involved

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.599
in self-referential
thought-- that

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.079
is thinking about something
in relationship to self

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.480
and evaluating it
in a certain way--

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.730
overlap of activations in
areas involving memory.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.180
But in REM sleep, the
prefrontal cortical regions

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.079
that are crucial for aspects of
attention and cognitive control

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:32.690
are comparatively deactivated
beyond levels of deactivation

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.920
seen during waking
mind wandering,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.060
and interestingly
in lucid dreaming,

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.560
they comparatively reactivate.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.181
And I'll say more about that.

00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:41.680
OK.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.600
So that's by way of saying
we start with a waking state.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.230
We look at the alternation
between perceptual modes

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.550
of experience, mind wandering,
spontaneous cognition.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.572
That overlaps in certain ways
with features of dreaming.

00:17:54.572 --> 00:17:56.780
So now what we want to do
is to really look at, well,

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.520
what marks dreaming as distinct
from that experientially

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.450
especially.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.730
Also, of course, from the
perspective of the brain.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.430
But starting with the
experiential differences.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.020
And in order to
talk about this, I

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.950
want to differentiate between
the hypnogogic state--

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:15.420
so this is the state leading
into sleep, sleep onset--

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.450
dreaming, and lucid dreaming.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.480
This is an image by a
painter, Pablo Roman Andrioli,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.270
called "Hypnagogic Revelation."

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.420
And if you look at it,
it depicts the kind

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.750
of images that play
across your visual field

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.990
if you're falling into
sleep, and you're doing so

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.007
in a way where you're
not totally tired

00:18:37.007 --> 00:18:38.590
and you just kind
of crash, as we say.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.590
But you're actually kind
of drifting into sleep.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.360
And you can become aware of
various kinds of visual images,

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.720
various sounds that
you're not sure

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.710
whether they're sort of in you
or whether they're in the room,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.710
or thoughts that have
a peculiar quality.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.070
They seem meaningful in a way.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.420
But you can't quite
grasp what they are.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.460
So these are all characteristics
of the hypnogogic state.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.030
Hypnagogic literally just
means from the Greek,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.750
leading into sleep.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.020
One of my favorite descriptions
of the hypnagogic state

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.840
comes from Proust, from his
"Remembrance of Things Past."

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.560
The first volume, very
early in the book,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.660
the unnamed narrator gives
the following description.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.510
He says, "For a long
time I went to bed early.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.520
Sometimes my candle
scarcely out,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.360
my eyes would close so quickly
that I did not have time to say

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.820
to myself, 'I'm going to
sleep.' And half an hour later,

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.115
the thought that it was time
to try to sleep would wake me.

00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:35.740
I wanted to put down the book I
thought I still had in my hands

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.310
and blow out my light.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.120
I had not ceased while
sleeping to form reflections

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.520
on what I had just read.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.220
But these reflections had
taken a rather peculiar turn.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.480
It seemed to me
that I myself was

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.820
what the book was talking
about: a church, a quartet,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.000
the rivalry between
Francois I and Charles IV."

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So this is a description
that marks something

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.440
about the hypnagogic
state, which

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.730
is that there's a kind of to
use the psychoanalytic language,

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.070
there's a kind of dissolution
of ego boundaries.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.350
The sense that the image is
one thing and I'm another.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.190
That self/non-self
distinction breaks down.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.315
And there's an absorption in the
image as if the image is you.

00:20:12.315 --> 00:20:14.440
Or what you're thinking
about or what you were just

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.620
reading about is somehow you.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.170
Or you're not separate from it.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.940
And Proust really depicts this
quite marvelously, I think.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.290
So there's a
dissolution as we fall

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:29.170
into sleep between the
boundaries of self and not self

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.570
as they're experientially
present in the waking state.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.390
But there isn't the strong sense
of being immersed in a world.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.880
So right now we
all have the sense

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.570
of the presence of the world.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.300
We're immersed in a world.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.510
We can move in certain ways.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.910
We can perceive certain things.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.470
And that reappears
in various ways

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.320
in the dream state, the sense
of being in the dream world.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.440
But the hypnagogic
state is not like that.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.190
There's not the sense
of being in a world.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.800
There's this kind
of spectator quality

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.450
where you're sort
of watching things,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.158
but they're not really
separate from you.

00:20:58.158 --> 00:20:59.770
But you're sort of
fused into them.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.400
So the consciousness has a kind
of spellbound or fascinated

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.132
quality.

00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:05.590
These are actually
terms that Sarte

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.160
uses in his book
on the imagination

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.740
to talk about hypnagogia.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.710
He says there's an
identification, a fascination,

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.220
with these images that
play spontaneously.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.320
And they shift as
your eyes move.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.640
And if you try to sort of
focus your attention on them

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.280
visually, they sort
of break apart.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.320
You have to kind of let
them drift out of view.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.390
And they're highly susceptible
to intention and suggestion.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.809
Mm hm?

00:21:27.809 --> 00:21:30.134
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:30.134 --> 00:21:31.800
EVAN THOMPSON: Well,
I would describe it

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.758
in the way I'm using the
term consciousness now

00:21:33.758 --> 00:21:35.520
is still a conscious
state, because it's

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.556
an experiential state.

00:21:37.556 --> 00:21:39.180
So when I use the
word "consciousness,"

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.922
I mean that there is the
experience of awareness.

00:21:41.922 --> 00:21:43.380
There is some
content of awareness.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.110
And there's some sense of self.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.720
Or that sense of
self can drop out

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.242
in certain states
of consciousness.

00:21:49.242 --> 00:21:51.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.460
EVAN THOMPSON: So
you're in between.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.130
So if you were to look at
it from the neuroscience

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.830
perspective, the
brain rhythms have

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.160
a certain characteristic
frequencies

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.650
as you move from waking into
relaxation into drowsiness

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:06.790
into falling asleep.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.640
And we're in that drowsy
falling into sleep period.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.850
But there's still an
awareness of the present,

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.280
and even sometimes an
awareness of the room.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.080
So the awareness can still have
content from the environment

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.780
as well.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.280
OK.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.900
So the dream state then.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.480
So that's sleep
onset, or hypnagogia.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.870
The dream state.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:33.200
This is Adam Elsheimer's
painting of "Jacob's Dream."

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.520
So Jacob's dream in the
Old Testament, genesis 28,

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.730
I think it is, Jacob dreams
of a ladder with the angels

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.260
going up and down from heaven.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.370
And so one of the things
about the dream state

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.480
is the sense that
you're in a world,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.600
and things are
happening in the world.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.780
So that sense of
immersion with presence

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.910
where there's self
versus not-self

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.470
reappears in the
dream in a way where

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.040
it's dissolved in
the hypnagogic state.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.530
The English poet Robert Herrick
has this wonderful little poem.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.260
He says, "Here we
are all, by day;

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.050
by night, we're hurled
by dreams, each one

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.460
into a several world."

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.110
And this is an archaic use of
several, which means separate.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.890
So we all seem to be sharing
a common world in waking.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.850
As we go into our own dream
world, it's our world.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:24.980
It's a separate world.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.780
But he says, "we're hurled."

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.930
So there's the sense
of being immersed.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.600
We're thrown into another world.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.610
And that sense of immersion
is a particularly significant

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.680
feature of the dream state.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.510
So in a hypnagogic state then,
we look at visual patterns.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.940
And they absorb us.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.770
But when we dream, we
experience being in the dream.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.500
Or we experience being
in the dream world.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.360
Here's another
wonderful description

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.140
of a dream experience
that I think many of us

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.780
have that's from a very
old work of literature.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.140
Homer's "Iliad."

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.900
So this is when Hector has
gone outside of the city

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.070
walls of Troy to meet Achilles.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:11.470
And Homer says, "As in a dream,
a man chasing another cannot

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.570
catch him.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.420
Nor can he in flight
escape from his pursuer.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.180
So Achilles could not by
his swiftness overtake him.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.910
Nor could Hector pull away."

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.640
So this is a very
powerful image where

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.780
you may have had a dream in
which you're being chased.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.710
This actually turns out to be
a common dream theme-- being

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:28.500
chased in a dream.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.060
If you do content
analysis of dreams,

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.130
many people have
dreams like this.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.290
So you're being chased.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.150
And there's this
feeling that you

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.250
can't get away from the
one who's pursuing you.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.760
But they're not
overtaking you either.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.630
So Homer is using this
to depict the situation

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.010
of the battle that's
going to ensue

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.110
between Hector and Achilles.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:51.820
Now if you think about
this description,

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.260
or what it might be like for
you to have a dream like that,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.820
there's two ways in
which the dream might

00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.410
be structured experientially.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.240
On the one hand, you might
feel yourself in the dream.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.749
So you're experiencing the dream
world through your own eyes.

00:25:06.749 --> 00:25:07.540
And you're running.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.050
And you're looking back
over your shoulder.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.250
And you have this sense
that you're being pursued.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.160
So that's a kind of first
person perspective in the dream.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.950
But you may have had dreams
in which you see yourself

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.500
from the outside in the dream.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.880
So there's an
image in the dream.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.510
So in the case of a dream
where you're being chased,

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.286
you might first
experience it where

00:25:27.286 --> 00:25:28.910
you're in the first
person perspective.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.280
And you turn around.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.307
But then it might shift.

00:25:31.307 --> 00:25:32.890
And it's as if you're
sort of hovering

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.770
in the dream world looking
down and oh, I'm being chased.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.380
And you see yourself
from the outside.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.380
So this is the difference
between a third person

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.560
and a first person
perspective that

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.140
indicates the complexity of
self-experience in the dream.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.950
The dream is nothing but a
content of one's awareness.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.290
But in it, you mark a difference
between self and not-self.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.540
But then that can complexify
where one aspect of self

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.886
is this observer.

00:25:55.886 --> 00:25:57.260
And the other
aspect is the image

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.259
you see of yourself that
you say, oh, that's me.

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:00.810
Or you think, oh, that's me.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:06.630
Now interestingly, exactly the
same thing happens in memory.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.880
So if I were to ask you
to imagine your first

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.690
thought when you
woke up this morning.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:23.420
And now I ask you what were
you wearing when you first

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.362
woke up this morning?

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.170
Now it may not have
been this way for you.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.300
But when we ask
questions like that,

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.170
the memory tends to be biased.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.170
And there's scientific
evidence supporting this.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.530
So if I ask you what you were
thinking or how you felt,

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.390
the memory will tend to be in
the first person perspective.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.220
And psychologists call
that a field memory.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.830
It's as if you're
back in the bed.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.230
And you're kind of reenacting
or reliving the situation.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.310
But if I ask you something
factual, like what

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.350
were you wearing, or what
color were the sheets,

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.610
or how many pictures are on
the wall in your bedroom,

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.560
you might have the
outside perspective,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.367
which psychologists
call observer memory.

00:27:04.367 --> 00:27:06.200
It's as if you're sort
of hovering somewhere

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.730
in the scene.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.063
And you see yourself in the bed.

00:27:08.063 --> 00:27:11.410
And oh, you know, I was wearing
a white t-shirt, or whatever.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:16.840
So the same thing happens in
dreams as happens in memory.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.370
So there's a linkage then
between dreams and memory,

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:25.010
which is a very old idea, where
that structure of first person

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.720
inward experience versus
an outside perspective--

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.430
even though it's all
your own awareness--

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.760
happens in both cases.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.380
So the sense of the self
in the dream state then,

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.990
in its fullest
description, would actually

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.600
require us also to say,
well, on the one hand there

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.730
is the self as dreamer.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.310
That's you lying
asleep in the bed.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.220
But then there's the
self as dreamed--

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.730
we could call that dream
ego-- in which you might

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.950
be experiencing it from
within, from the first person

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:57.926
perspective, or from an
outside observer perspective.

00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:59.300
And I'm setting
it up in this way

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.800
because when we
come to lucid dream,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.160
you will see that, of course,
this gets even more complex.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.160
So lucid dreaming, then.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.062
So this is another--

00:28:07.062 --> 00:28:08.436
AUDIENCE: So you're
in the dream.

00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:09.915
And self as a dream.

00:28:09.915 --> 00:28:10.790
EVAN THOMPSON: Right.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.810
So the person who's
dreaming is you in the bed.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.589
But then there's whoever
you are in the dream

00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:17.380
that you're having.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.700
However you are in the
dream, that's the dream ego.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.200
So.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.940
AUDIENCE: So you are part of it.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.969
EVAN THOMPSON: Exactly.

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.510
So in lucid dreams--
so this painting

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.020
is called "Dream Signs."

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.020
And I imagine many of you are
familiar with Stephen LaBerge's

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.324
work on lucid dreaming.

00:28:31.324 --> 00:28:33.490
He's not the only one to
talk about this, of course.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.110
Others do.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:39.320
But one of the ideas is
that you might in a dream,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.610
if you've trained yourself
to do this in waking life,

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.580
if something that
involves writing or a sign

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.920
appears in the dream,
you take note of it.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.002
And then you look away.

00:28:47.002 --> 00:28:47.960
And then you look back.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.022
And very likely it's changed.

00:28:50.022 --> 00:28:52.230
Whereas in the waking state,
you look at a stop sign.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.690
You look away.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:53.273
You look back.

00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:54.940
It's a stop sign in the dream.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.180
This is not sure fire.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.650
But in a dream often, if you
look, and then look away,

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.637
and look back,
it'll be different.

00:29:00.637 --> 00:29:02.220
And if you can notice
that difference,

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.889
then that can be a sign,
oh, I must be dreaming.

00:29:04.889 --> 00:29:06.430
So it's one of the
kind of techniques

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:10.050
that's used to teach
yourself how to lucid dream.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:10.550
OK.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.780
So lucid dreaming.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.979
So this is a topic that's
become increasingly popular.

00:29:15.979 --> 00:29:17.770
And many people think,
well, lucid dreaming

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.320
means being able to
control the dream.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:19.840
You have a dream.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.720
And you can control it.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.550
You know that you're dreaming.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.050
And you can control the dream.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.500
And that's not really how
I think of lucid dreaming

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.610
in a more precise sense.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.700
For me, the mark
of a lucid dream

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.200
is not whether you
try to control it

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.860
or not, because some things are
going to stay out of control.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.350
And you might not choose
to try to control anything.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.290
The mark of a lucid dream is
you can direct your attention

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.225
to the experience as a dream.

00:29:42.225 --> 00:29:44.100
That is to say, you can
direct your attention

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.060
to the dreamlike
quality of the state.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.420
Now sometimes that might involve
having the full blown thought,

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.040
oh, I'm dreaming.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.770
But other times,
not necessarily.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.234
There's degrees of lucidity.

00:29:57.234 --> 00:29:58.900
So you might have an
experience in which

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.740
there's a kind of feeling of
insight that this is dreamlike.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.100
And the experience presents
in a dreamlike way.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.730
And you attend to it in that
way without necessarily full

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.750
blown thinking, oh,
I'm having a dream.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.208
So that it's important that
lucid dreaming isn't one thing.

00:30:14.208 --> 00:30:16.580
But there's a whole
range of possibilities.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.060
Or you might have an experience
in which you're lying in bed.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.060
You know it's a dream.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.018
You think it's a dream.

00:30:22.018 --> 00:30:24.060
You remember other
lucid dreams you have.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.880
You might decide to
try to experiment.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.400
Or you might decide just
to sort of let it unfold.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.550
There are all different
kinds of possibilities.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.880
But typically, lucid
dreams involve features

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.530
like greater clarity
or vividness,

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:40.020
the subjective experience of
things being clearer or more

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.840
vivid, a kind of realism.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.270
Things sometimes take on a hyper
real quality in a lucid dream.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.830
There's a sense often of
emotional exhilaration

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.050
or a sense of freedom.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.806
Often the realization
that it's a dream,

00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:53.430
there's something
exhilarating about it

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.850
that's very hard to describe.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.440
But if you've had the
sensation, then, of course,

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.470
you know what it's like.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.620
So now the sense of self
in the lucid dream state

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.340
complexifies the discussion
that we've been having so far.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.690
Because on the one hand,
there's the self as dreamer.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.200
So you might in a full
blown lucid dream think,

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:15.960
I'm dreaming.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.000
This is a dream.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.150
So you know you're asleep.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.880
And you have meta awareness
of the dream state.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.160
So you're aware of the
state as a dream state.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.440
The current contents of your
consciousness are dream images.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.300
But then there is however
you are in the dream.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.080
The dream ego.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.740
The self as dream.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.770
And maybe it's a flying dream.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.315
And you think, I'm flying.

00:31:39.315 --> 00:31:40.940
So of course, you're
not really flying.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.715
Or let's not be too prejudicial
here with the word "really."

00:31:43.715 --> 00:31:45.200
But the one who's
asleep in the bed

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.100
is not flying, because he
or she is asleep in the bed.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.030
But the one in the
dream is flying.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:55.360
So the pronoun "I" is picking
out two different aspects

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.410
of the total situation.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.980
And you might even
have a situation

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.677
in which you know it's a dream.

00:32:01.677 --> 00:32:03.260
And you know you're
asleep in the bed.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.170
And you're observing
some situation

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.650
from the outside in which some
aspect of what your image is,

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:09.710
you identify as you.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:13.350
OK.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.350
So just to give you a
little bit of a taste

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.260
of some of the
neuroscience involved here.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.660
This is a study that was done
by Ursula Voss couple years ago,

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:28.100
in which she used EEG to compare
the waking state with lucid REM

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.510
sleep and non-lucid REM sleep.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.980
And basically what you see
in the higher frequencies

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.840
as recorded at the electrodes--
the higher frequencies,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.500
say 32 to 48, the beta
and gamma frequencies,

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:50.680
fast oscillations-- is that the
lucid REM sleep and the waking

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.990
are more closely related
than the lucid REM

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.890
sleep is to the REM sleep.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.740
And also the measure
of the coherence.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.050
So actually these traces
are individual subjects.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.620
And this is actually measuring
cross spectral density

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.250
coherence, which is a
measure of the synchrony

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.340
of the oscillatory activity.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.080
So the point of
this is basically

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:19.079
that the lucid REM state
is a distinct state that

00:33:19.079 --> 00:33:20.620
has some of the
features of REM sleep

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.510
and some of the features
of the waking state.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:28.600
And it's marked as lucid,
because the individuals are

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.730
signaling using eye
movements that they're

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.680
aware of having a dream.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.750
So in REM sleep,
your eyes dart about.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:39.240
Otherwise, you can't move.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.240
And it was discovered that
if you ask participants

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.800
when they become
aware of dreaming

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.360
to move their eyes in the
dream, to move the dream

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.190
ego eyes left, right, left,
right, that this correlates

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.660
with physical eye movements.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.510
So you can actually mark off
epochs in which the person is

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.446
in a lucid REM sleep period.

00:33:57.446 --> 00:33:58.358
Mm hm.

00:33:58.358 --> 00:34:01.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
frequency of what [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.190
EVAN THOMPSON: So these are
measures of electrical signals

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.270
at the scalp.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:14.560
And the fast frequency in
the range of 32 to 48 cycles

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.100
a second, or hertz, which
drops off in REM sleep,

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:25.019
is still predominant
in lucid REM in a way

00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:26.310
comparable to the waking state.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.120
AUDIENCE: So it's
just like [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.040
EVAN THOMPSON: From
electrodes measuring

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.301
underlying cortical firings.

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:30.842
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:34:30.842 --> 00:34:31.341
OK.

00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:32.400
EVAN THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.440
This is another
study that used fMRI.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.560
This is from Martin
Dresler's lab in Germany.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.580
And here so whereas
the EEG gives you

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.639
very good profile of the
temporal aspects of the brain

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:48.480
activity, it's not so good
for the spatial resolution.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.639
So the fMRI gives a
better spatial picture.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.100
And so there at the top you
see left, right, left, right.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.949
Those are the eye
movements that mark off

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.900
the lucid dreaming epoch.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.770
And from the fMRI
perspective, you

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.390
see comparatively
increased activity

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.310
in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.080
So this is one of
the areas involved

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.930
in executive cognitive control
and planning, and volition,

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:16.120
and cognitive control of
the attentional functions.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.180
And then you also see
increased activity

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.460
in a bunch of neural
neocortical regions

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.060
that make up what's described
as a frontoparietal control

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.880
system.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.890
So this integrates attentional
processing and memory,

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.110
and is involved also in
meta-awareness and state

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.610
awareness.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.230
So you see these
comparatively re-activated

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.912
in the lucid dreaming as
compared to-- in the lucid REM

00:35:39.912 --> 00:35:42.120
sleep as compared to the
non-lucid REM sleep in a way

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.810
that resembles more
of the waking state.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:48.550
Back to the idea of self-making
or self-identification.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.590
So now we have a
range of phenomena

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.060
that we can look at under the
heading of those concepts.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.260
We have memory with the
field versus observer views.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.990
We have mental time travel.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:01.210
So you journey to
the past in memory.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.640
You project yourself
forward into the future

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.940
in prospection or anticipation.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.160
That involves a
mental image of self.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.400
You can envision yourself
from within or from

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.930
without in either
memory or prospection.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.430
There is dreaming
and lucid dreaming

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.860
with different self-experiences
and perspectives that

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.990
are involved there.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.830
There's imagination.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.896
If you just visualize
now the Eiffel Tower,

00:36:23.896 --> 00:36:25.270
you would visualize
it presumably

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.750
from a certain perspective
that would involve

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.070
your body being positioned
in relationship to it

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.081
in a certain way.

00:36:33.081 --> 00:36:35.080
You can do that from a
first person perspective,

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.621
or again, a third
person perspective.

00:36:36.621 --> 00:36:38.320
There are out-of-body
experiences, which

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.240
I haven't really talked about.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.870
But out-of-body
experiences are ones

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:45.366
in which you have a
dissociation or an alteration

00:36:45.366 --> 00:36:46.990
in the normal experience
of embodiment,

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.760
because usually I experience
myself as where my body is,

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.740
and my agency as
where my body is.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.310
But in an out-of-body
experience--

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.960
say spontaneously
happening in sleep--

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:02.280
I might have a vestibular
gravity experience of myself

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.290
up near the ceiling floating.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.160
And then I see a visual image
of myself down in the bed.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.030
So it presents not as
imagination, but as perceptual.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:17.230
But it involves, again, an
outside perspective on oneself

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.740
through the visual image
of one's body separated

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.570
from the vestibular sense that
you have some location, say up

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:24.280
by the ceiling.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.100
So self-experience can be
altered in that way as well.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.740
Now interestingly from a
developmental perspective,

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.820
memory with the field and
observer perspectives,

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.220
imagination, daydreaming,
narrative self-dreaming,

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.760
these all appear to
developmentally emerge

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.150
as a suite together
around the age of five.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.630
At least according to
David Foulkes' book,

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:53.080
though, this is an ongoing
area of research and debate.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.700
And the developmental
perspective

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.360
is important for a
point that I want

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.110
to make about the importance
of social cognition

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.430
in structuring all of these
forms of self-experience.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.800
So this is a
painting, El Greco's

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.440
"An Allegory," in which the
monkey, the boy, and the man

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.870
are all looking
at the same thing.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.560
And that is, the boy
is lighting an ember.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.320
They all know they're
looking at the same thing.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.756
They're all aware of each other
looking at the same thing.

00:38:19.756 --> 00:38:21.380
So this is a case of
what psychologists

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.780
call joint attention.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.976
Where you attend
to the same thing.

00:38:24.976 --> 00:38:27.100
And I know that you're
attending to the same thing,

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.310
because I can follow
your eye gaze.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.780
And you can follow mine.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.260
And this emerges
developmentally in the course

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.815
of normal development.

00:38:36.815 --> 00:38:38.940
Obviously, there are
differences with various kinds

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.450
of different developmental
disorders and so on.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.530
And this is crucial
for social cognition.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.590
Now one of the
interesting things

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.580
about this developmentally
is that at a certain point,

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:57.640
the infant experiences the
caregiver or the mother

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:03.310
or the father as paying
attention not say, just

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.960
to a toy that the infant's
also paying attention to,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.739
but paying attention
to the infant herself.

00:39:08.739 --> 00:39:10.280
So at a certain
point in development,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.180
you understand that
you are the object

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.930
of the attention of the other.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:18.750
And in order to understand this,
you have to in a certain way

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.720
understand the
possibility of there

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.400
being an outside
perspective on you,

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.600
that your experience
from within, as it were,

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:30.900
isn't the only way that you
can experience yourself--

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.600
you can experience
yourself by way

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.710
of understanding that
someone else sees you

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.754
from another perspective.

00:39:36.754 --> 00:39:38.920
And of course, this is
crucial for social cognition,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.380
and especially for things
like empathy and sympathy.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.351
Now here's a description from
Michael Tomasello's book,

00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:47.850
"The Cultural Origins
of Cognition,"

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.890
where he says, "as the child
begins to monitor adults

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:54.060
attention to outside entities,
that outside entity sometimes

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.140
turns out to be
the child herself.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.940
And so she begins to monitor
adults attention to her,

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.550
and thus to see herself
from the outside.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.340
She also comprehends
the role of the adult

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.380
from this same
outside vantage point.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.810
And so overall, it
is as if she were

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.840
viewing the whole
scene from above,

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.480
with herself as just
one player in it."

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.820
So that's exactly what
you do in a way in memory.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.180
You see yourself in
the observer memory.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.670
You see yourself
from the outside

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:23.020
as if you're just one player
in the scene, or in the world.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.140
And this developmentally is
linked to joint attention

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.015
and social cognition.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.110
Think of it also in
terms of language.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.110
The voice that we all seem to--
or many of us, at any rate--

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.330
carry around inside
our heads, where

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.710
we have this constant inner
stream of speech where

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.100
sometimes we seem to be
talking to who exactly?

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.600
To me.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.210
But I'm the one who's talking.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:49.910
So what exactly is going on?

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:53.310
Well, Vygotsky talked about
this in terms of the idea.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:56.280
His theory was that in
development, higher cognitive

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.970
processes happen twice.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.420
First socially.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.120
And then they're internalized.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.240
So you hear the
speech of others.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.800
And then you internalize it.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.650
And it becomes a kind
of inner narrative

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.070
that structures your
own sense of self,

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.530
especially the narrative
self, the sense

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:14.025
that the self has a history.

00:41:14.025 --> 00:41:15.900
There's a story that
you came from somewhere.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.970
That you're going to
some particular place.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:23.210
So that aspect of self is
a social and linguistic

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.960
construction.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.560
So then the question as we
go through all of this--

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.710
and I'm coming towards the end
now-- is well, is there a self?

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.610
Is there really a self?

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:39.450
What I've been saying is
that the self is a process.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:41.990
It's an experiential process.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.570
It's under constant
construction.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.740
And I've just tried
to indicate some

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.740
of the ways it changes
across waking and sleeping

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.800
and mind wandering and
daydreaming and dreaming

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.815
and lucid dreaming.

00:41:52.815 --> 00:41:55.190
Meditative states I just said
a little bit about in terms

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.540
of the practice of
mindfulness of thoughts

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.806
that we took advantage
of in the imaging study.

00:41:59.806 --> 00:42:01.430
Various altered states
of consciousness

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:02.390
that I haven't
really talked about

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.973
too much, like
out-of-body experiences

00:42:03.973 --> 00:42:05.570
or near-death experiences.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.260
So it's a process
that's constantly being

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.850
configured and reconfigured.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.720
So then well, what
exactly is it?

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.498
Is there really a self?

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:19.200
Well, one way to go
is that-- and this

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.570
is very popular
nowadays-- is what I call

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.126
a kind of neuroreductionist.

00:42:23.126 --> 00:42:26.390
I actually call it
neuroneolism in my book.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:30.142
And this is the idea that
well, really there is no self.

00:42:30.142 --> 00:42:31.850
And sometimes this is
linked to Buddhism,

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:35.466
because in the Indian context,
the Buddha's idea was anatta

00:42:35.466 --> 00:42:37.540
or anatman-- no self.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.140
And so the idea is often
well, there really is no self.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.850
And neuroscience is
saying the same thing

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.350
that the Buddha said.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.950
All there really is-- this is
not the Buddha's words now.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.000
This is the modern
neuroscience way of talking.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.220
All there really is, is
the illusion of a self

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.350
created by the brain.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:57.900
Now there's a sense
in which I think

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.130
that view gets something right.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.535
But I also think it's misguided.

00:43:02.535 --> 00:43:04.410
So the sense in which
it gets something right

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:07.910
is if you think the self
is a thing or an entity,

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.770
that it's single, that it's
unified, that it's permanent,

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.380
that to use
philosophical language,

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.590
it's a kind of a
substance, an entity.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.050
If you think that the only
way there could be a self

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.914
is if it were like
that, well, then,

00:43:19.914 --> 00:43:22.080
if there isn't anything
like that that you can find,

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.290
then it's going to follow
that there is no self.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.420
But that's not really
the way we should

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.700
have been thinking about
the self in the first place.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.470
Rather, as I've been
trying to illustrate,

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.011
the self is not a
thing or an entity.

00:43:32.011 --> 00:43:33.800
It's a process.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.650
And it's enacted.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:39.640
That is to say, it's through
perception, through memory,

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.940
through social cognition,
through culture,

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.090
through language,
and through all

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.380
of that being rooted in
the life of the body, which

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.480
of course includes the brain,
but isn't just about the brain.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.040
It's also about the
brain being in a body

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.850
geared into a world,
immersed in an environment.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:58.650
That the self is
constantly being

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.420
enacted through that dynamics.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.940
And so it's not a
fixed single thing.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.130
And even if we
feel experientially

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:10.890
as if it is, of course, when we
examine it carefully, it's not.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.630
It's a process.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:16.040
So the way that I put this--
and I'm almost done here now.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.110
The way that I put this in the
book is to say that "when I say

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.210
that the self is not a
thing, but a process,

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.610
what I mean is that it's a
process of 'I-ing,' a process

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:30.490
that enacts an 'I', and in which
the 'I' is no different from

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:34.440
the I-ing process itself,
rather like the way dancing is

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.980
a process that enacts the
dance in which the dance is no

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.400
different from the dancing."

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:46.450
So in summary then, or
in conclusion summary,

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:49.530
self-making-- this is the
Indian concept of ahamkara--

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.250
is like dancing.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:56.430
And the self is like a dance,
not a thing or an entity,

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.520
but a process.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.380
I'll stop there.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:03.845
And hopefully we have some
time left for questions.

00:45:03.845 --> 00:45:07.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:07.749 --> 00:45:08.290
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.100
So I have to preface
this with a funny story.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.270
I started reading your book
two or three weeks ago.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.050
And I kept telling my wife, oh,
this is such profound stuff.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:17.680
I wish I could as
this guy a question.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.850
And you show up at Google.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:19.350
So.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.487
EVAN THOMPSON: Go for it.

00:45:20.487 --> 00:45:21.570
AUDIENCE: Google is also--

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.720
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.860
AUDIENCE: Like a dream.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.590
So the last chapter
in your book is

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:32.310
like, super-- it's on of the
most profound things I've read.

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:35.342
The whole thing, knowing
where you sum it all up.

00:45:35.342 --> 00:45:40.040
I had this kind of
like intuitive flash

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.220
to reading David
Bohm and his concept

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.270
of implicate and
explicate order.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:49.490
Is that an analogous
thing that occurred to you

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.757
when you were doing your thing?

00:45:51.757 --> 00:45:52.590
EVAN THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.480
That's an interesting link.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.450
So I'm not a physicist,
so I can't appreciate

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:05.129
the technicalities
or the specificity

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:07.670
of his theory of the implicate
explicate order in the physics

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.950
context.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.158
AUDIENCE: I'm not one either.

00:46:09.158 --> 00:46:11.710
It's just-- it seemed very
analogous [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.210
EVAN THOMPSON: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:17.990
the similarity is the emphasis
on process and relationality,

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.030
rather than on substance.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.410
That would be how
I would see it.

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.120
There's actually a
point in the book

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.400
where-- I met David
Bohm at one point

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.480
when I was just starting
as a-- actually,

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.500
I hadn't even started
as a graduate student.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.860
I was at a conference.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.817
And this neuroscientist
I mentioned,

00:46:34.817 --> 00:46:36.650
Francisco Varela, who
is a family friend who

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:37.880
I worked with for many years.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.800
I was at the
conference with my dad.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:43.510
And Francisco Varela and David
Bohm were both presenting.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:47.460
And I got to sort of sit at
the side while they had dinner.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.840
And they had this long
argument about the mind.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.590
And David Bohm thought
really neuroscience

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:53.590
wasn't the right way to
look at the mind at all.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.700
He thought physics was
really the important thing.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.840
And Varela thought, no, no.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.650
Physics is fine.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.190
But you're not really going
understand the mind unless you

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.750
have a biological perspective.

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:04.552
So they kind of-- I was just out
of being an undergrad student.

00:47:04.552 --> 00:47:06.260
So I kind of watched
them play ping pong.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.419
And it was great.

00:47:07.419 --> 00:47:09.335
I mean, that's just in
a personal association.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.300
But I mean I would say
now, knowing a bit more

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.045
about his thought, that it
would be the commonality

00:47:16.045 --> 00:47:17.470
of the emphasis on process.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:18.060
Yeah.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.630
That's an interesting
connection.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.088
AUDIENCE: So I
guess my question is

00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:22.595
the specific on lucid dreaming.

00:47:22.595 --> 00:47:25.940
So you showed the slide where
lucid dreaming is more matching

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.756
of more a waking state.

00:47:27.756 --> 00:47:29.130
And so has there
been any studies

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:32.000
that show lucid
dreaming is-- does it

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.350
have that restoring aspect?

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:36.220
Because you know someone who's
dabbled in lucid dreaming.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.410
I feel it just takes energy.

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:40.480
And when I do it, even though
I get a full night's sleep,

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.937
I am a little bit
dragging the next day.

00:47:42.937 --> 00:47:44.520
So I mean, if you
come across anything

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.530
where lucid dreaming can also
help creativity, but also

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.247
you're losing out on that
restorative process of sleep.

00:47:50.247 --> 00:47:51.830
EVAN THOMPSON: I
don't know if there's

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:56.670
been any real studies
in a clinical context

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.490
about the effects
of lucid dreaming

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.950
with regard to
restfulness or waking

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.210
cognitive function compared
to-- or lucid dreaming compared

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:07.890
to non-lucid dreaming.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:11.050
I mean, I know that people
anecdotally often report

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:12.830
that well, the
lucid dream state is

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:16.030
very-- there's the kind of
excitation in the state.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:19.380
And you know, your
alertness is ramped up.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.930
And people have
sometimes said, so I

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.450
feel like I didn't have
as restful a sleep.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:25.980
I think my own
sense-- again, I don't

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.480
think this is based
on evidence yet,

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.040
but this is my own
kind of sense--

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.170
is that it really
depends a lot on how

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:32.820
you approach lucid dreaming.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.240
I think especially
if it's approached

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.770
in a contemplative
way, say in the context

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.500
of what in Tibetan Buddhism
would be called dream yoga,

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.000
or in the context of
Hindu yoga would be called

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.340
sleep yoga, where
it's an opportunity

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.320
to be aware of the mind
and the creative power

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.540
of the mind without
attachment, just

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:57.130
a kind of restful
observation, then my suspicion

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:02.480
would be that that would
have effects on how restful

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.040
or not it felt.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.700
That's my own sense.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.970
I'm not a really-- I can't
lucid dream on demand.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.580
So I can't test it
myself experientially.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.260
I mean, I lucid dream
reasonably frequently

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:21.650
with a certain amount of
ability to test certain things.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:26.380
And my sense is that if
it's approached that way,

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:30.200
then I don't wake up in a
kind of excited, agitated way.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:35.460
I wake up in a more balanced
way, I suppose you could say.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.530
AUDIENCE: I'm curious if there's
many fMRI studies on either

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:42.780
those that are kind of
considered enlightened, where

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.680
they talk about the self
as no longer a process,

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.070
like maharishi.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.390
You're familiar with that
where people that identify

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.110
with the capital S self.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.690
Or there's also
psychotropic substances,

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.550
like salvia divinorum,
where people

00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:00.590
report that they are no longer
at all identified with self.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:03.550
And they are an object
in that experience.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.752
And that being an
illegal substance,

00:50:05.752 --> 00:50:08.540
I'm just curious if that's
now hitting the radar.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.560
I know in "Search
Inside Yourself"

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:14.040
they did say some uses of
LSD were being brought back

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.050
into studies.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:18.204
So just curious if one people
that sort of claim they

00:50:18.204 --> 00:50:19.870
have this constant
awareness-- you know,

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:22.020
the Tibetans talk about
in "Waking, Dreaming,

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.022
Sleeping," there is a
very high level of state,

00:50:24.022 --> 00:50:25.480
where you're just
constantly aware.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.960
Has anybody like
that been studied?

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.840
And then second, are
they studying folks

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.290
under the influence of
drugs that can actually

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:34.910
sort of create that sense
for limited periods of time?

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:38.090
EVAN THOMPSON: Data on
those kinds of experiences

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:39.950
is very, very minimal
at this point.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:44.461
I mean, LSD research is just
kind of getting going again.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:52.040
Even the research on meditation
is very much still limited

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.824
by all sorts of things.

00:50:54.824 --> 00:50:56.740
And there's always the
question of exactly how

00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.580
to interpret reports like a
continuous constant awareness.

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.494
Certain traditions frame
things in terms of that.

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.160
So then there's the
likelihood that that

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.970
would be a report
that some individual

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:13.130
from a particular practice
tradition might make.

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:17.860
I myself stay away from
the enlightenment word.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.670
I think it's not
helpful to think

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:24.460
of enlightenment as there's
a state that's enlightenment.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:29.260
And we can study it in Brazilian
shamans and in Tibet meditators

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.110
and in secular Westerners.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.039
I think enlightenment,
especially

00:51:33.039 --> 00:51:35.080
from a history of religion,
history of philosophy

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.210
perspective, is a concept that's
used in different traditions

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.960
in different ways.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.680
And it means different things.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.550
And it's always in
some ways contested.

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:47.950
Different individuals make
claims for certain individuals

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:48.930
having attainments.

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:52.810
They function rhetorically
to legitimize in certain ways

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:53.870
in various communities.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.940
So in that sense
I'm kind of-- it's

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.850
not that I don't think there
are states of profound awakening

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.090
and realization.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:04.890
But kind of reifying them into
the category enlightenment,

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:05.994
I'm very wary of.

00:52:05.994 --> 00:52:08.285
AUDIENCE: You mean like
non-dual awareness [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:08.285 --> 00:52:09.160
EVAN THOMPSON: Mm hm.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.420
But even there, like,
what exactly-- yeah.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.008
What exactly does non-dual mean?

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:17.700
That's something
that if you look

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.190
at the history of
Buddhism, for example,

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:23.090
there's big disputes and debates
in Chinese Zen and Tibetan

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:23.980
Buddhism.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.630
A lot rides on the debates
in terms of philosophy,

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.200
prestige, lineage.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.655
So you know, I think
one of the dangers

00:52:31.655 --> 00:52:33.280
of the scientific
research is thinking,

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.560
oh, there is this thing
non-dual awareness.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.518
And now we're going to
image it in the scanner.

00:52:36.518 --> 00:52:39.610
And I really think that that's
a kind of reification of a much

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.170
more complex phenomenon.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.100
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
the sense of self as a process,

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.020
as enactment or construction
of consciousness.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.760
I'm curious how
far you would you

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.940
take it in correlation
with some Buddhist thought?

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:58.700
I mean, one could say
everything is a construction.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:02.220
Can we definitively say you
as a philosopher, a scientist,

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:06.600
that there exists
anything in itself

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.580
with a non-constructed
existence?

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.690
So how far do you take it?

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:11.650
EVAN THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:15.660
Well, I think
everything is processed.

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.719
And everything is under constant
construction as a process.

00:53:18.719 --> 00:53:20.010
That would be the short answer.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:24.760
I think not everything
involves the kind

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.830
of structured self-experience
that I've been talking about.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:32.105
That's a particular way that
things can get constructed,

00:53:32.105 --> 00:53:34.230
especially when we're
dealing with social cognition

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.771
and language.

00:53:34.771 --> 00:53:36.760
That's very much
how we human beings

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.270
construct ourselves socially.

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:39.978
And it's an interesting
question how much

00:53:39.978 --> 00:53:42.350
other forms of animal
life do things similarly

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:43.800
or differently.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.170
But in terms of a broader kind
of metaphysical perspective

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:50.880
as a philosopher, I mean, I'm
very much of an orientation

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.330
that sees things as
a kind of process

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:56.699
all the way down, and under
constant construction,

00:53:56.699 --> 00:53:58.990
or configuring and reconfiguring
all the way up and all

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:00.190
the way down.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:02.140
AUDIENCE: We have
some questions online.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.530
So in the interest
of time, I'll just

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:07.510
ask the one that
got the most vote.

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.570
So the question is,
what is the evidence

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:12.000
for a consistent
long-term meditation

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.230
practice enhancing and
improving the neural pathways

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.890
in the brain?

00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:19.030
EVAN THOMPSON: I
would actually say,

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:24.780
to be quite frank, the evidence
right now is still very,

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:29.020
very-- I was going to say thin.

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.700
But that's kind of a
prejudicial way of putting it.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.400
I think that we're not
in a situation where

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:41.400
we can say there is strong
evidence that the brain is

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:46.160
altered in ways that
are positive as a result

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.130
of meditation practice.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:48.350
I think we have
reason to believe

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:49.516
that that might be the case.

00:54:49.516 --> 00:54:51.470
But in terms of actual
evidence, the kinds

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:53.600
of studies with
the right controls,

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.830
I still think that that
evidence is not quite there yet,

00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:00.030
despite all the hype
that it's there.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.630
So I think scientific
honesty really

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:04.550
requires us saying that
could be something that

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:06.799
is borne out by future study.

00:55:06.799 --> 00:55:08.840
And we may have good
reasons to hypothesize that.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.110
But in terms of actual
evidence, that's

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.730
really not on the table yet.

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:16.670
The one other thing
I would say is

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:20.220
that we read a lot,
meditation changes the brain.

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.720
But everything changes
the brain all the time.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.710
If I take a sip of
water from the bottle,

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:26.270
my brain is changed.

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:28.806
So the idea that there's
something special

00:55:28.806 --> 00:55:30.180
about meditation
cause it changes

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.781
the brain, that's really hype.

00:55:31.781 --> 00:55:33.530
Everything all the
time changes the brain.

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:34.370
And the question is, OK.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:35.734
So how does it change the brain?

00:55:35.734 --> 00:55:36.650
Under what conditions?

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:37.930
In what context?

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:40.490
And the danger is that we
focus just on the brain.

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:42.030
Because it's about community.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.610
It's about culture.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:45.430
It's about history.

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:48.990
And that is as much,
if not more, important

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.160
than just looking
at what the brain is

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.966
as we can currently measure it.

00:55:52.966 --> 00:55:53.840
That's a long answer.

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:57.530
But that's my position.

00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:59.030
AUDIENCE: So I just
want to hear you

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:04.060
speak to the concept of
neural diversity in continuum.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.620
We have a lot of
conversations in society

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.620
now about autism,
Asperger's, things like that.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:13.504
How does the sense of self
kind of intersect with that?

00:56:13.504 --> 00:56:15.420
EVAN THOMPSON: I mean,
I think that's a really

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.340
huge and important question.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.770
And I'm not by any means-- I
don't really have the expertise

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:25.510
to address it in a full way.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.640
But I think that any account
of self-experience has to take

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.720
account of the various kinds
of different developmental

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:41.296
trajectories that appear
with autism or Asperger's.

00:56:41.296 --> 00:56:42.670
And again, there
all I would want

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:47.310
to say is that we shouldn't
leap to think that it's all just

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:50.080
a matter of the brain
being different.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.410
That again, a lot
of what happens

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:55.780
in culture and society and
social practices, I think,

00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.390
is really important there.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:01.580
And wider somatic perspectives
than just the brain.

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.830
But it's definitely an
aspect of self-experience

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:07.559
that would need to be part
of a more complete account.

00:57:07.559 --> 00:57:09.350
It's not something I
talk about in my book.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:13.020
I don't really have the
expertise to address it.

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.840
Yeah.

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.640
Yeah.

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.030
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:21.760
After years of research and work
in this field, and by the way,

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.980
thank you for all your ideas.

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.170
How has that helped
you in your life?

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:31.610
Or did it help to make sense
of the world of your existence,

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:32.714
like, for you personally?

00:57:35.397 --> 00:57:37.980
EVAN THOMPSON: I'm almost at a
loss as to know where to begin,

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.671
because in so many
different ways.

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:46.400
So I mean, I'm a
philosopher by training.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.150
So what's very important
to me in thinking

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:52.320
about philosophical questions
of the meaning of life,

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.330
or what happens at
death, or how should

00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:58.360
we as finite limited
creatures face something

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.740
like the inevitability
of death, that

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.130
the contemplative
perspectives on the one hand

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:07.400
bring a depth of mental
training and practice to that.

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.440
But having the scientific
perspective complement

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.600
that, where we can have the
scientific knowledge together

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.262
with the contemplative
knowledge inform-- I'll

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:21.470
just take death as an example,
because it's something

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:25.250
that I've been thinking a
fair amount about recently.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.300
You know, we're a culture
that kind of hides

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:29.040
from and runs away from death.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.850
So having the kind of rich,
contemplative perspective

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:36.800
informed by rich philosophies
with deep scientific knowledge,

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.060
I think really has
made a difference to me

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:41.470
in how I think about
how I would want

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:44.130
to die, how I want to live
given that I'm going to die,

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:46.380
what hospice care could
be like if we really

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.760
had that kind of sensibility.

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.755
So those are just
some of the things

00:58:50.755 --> 00:58:52.130
that kind of come
out immediately

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:54.180
in response to your question.

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.430
AUDIENCE: You mentioned it
just now in death, and also

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:58.730
previously in your talk
around near-death experiences.

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:02.560
I was curious to hear
your kind of perspective

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.800
on near-death experiences,
and how it impacts your work.

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.670
EVAN THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:11.820
So I think near-death
experiences

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:17.215
are experiences that
have been reported,

00:59:17.215 --> 00:59:19.840
or things we can call near-death
experiences have been reported

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.140
in many different cultures, many
different historical periods.

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.940
There's also ways
in which they're

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.230
unique and new because of
our medical resuscitation

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.230
techniques.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:33.830
It's unquestionably the
case, it seems to me,

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:36.940
that these experiences are
genuine experiences that have

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.770
distinct phenomenal features.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:43.030
At the same time, the
inferences that some people want

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:45.320
to make that they show that
consciousness transcends

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.360
the brain, I don't think
a careful examination

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.450
of the near-death experience
literature supports that.

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:52.560
It might some day.

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.340
I'm not saying that
it couldn't possibly.

00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:57.559
But I don't think
it's the case now.

00:59:57.559 --> 00:59:59.350
I think the most
important thing about them

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:03.730
is that they might tell
us something about what

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:08.520
people under certain conditions
experience when they're dying,

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.820
or when they perceive
themselves to be dying.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.650
And that's very important
information for us

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:19.750
to have for what I was
just talking about,

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:26.610
for thinking about how we should
face an experience like that,

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:28.640
that we're all in some
way going to have.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.140
Maybe that when we die, we don't
have a near-death experience

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.980
in that exact sense.

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.410
But the idea that
all of us are going

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:39.180
to suffer from cardiac
arrest eventually,

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.370
and that that's
something that we

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:44.780
want to be prepared
for experientially,

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.120
will those experiences
give us some information

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.412
to help us with that?

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:52.310
That's how I approach it.

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:52.810
DOUG: OK.

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:54.601
And I think we'll have
to wrap it up there.

01:00:54.601 --> 01:00:56.400
So thank you again,
Professor Thompson.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.259
It's been a most
illuminating hour.
