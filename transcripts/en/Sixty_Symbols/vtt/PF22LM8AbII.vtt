00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
I thought I would wander into a bit of a minefield and talk about Lift and what causes Lift in aeroplanes.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.020
And there are several entirely erroneous, or partially erroneous explanations,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.860
and actually very few entirely correct explanations actually 'cause it's quite complicated.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.660
[Brady] Well how do we know yours is going to be right?

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.080
Ah.  It probably won't actually, in its entirety, but, well you shouldn't say that on video.  [guffaw]

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.320
[Brady] Ha ha, where do you want to start?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.500
Maybe we should start with some of the wrong explanations.  So the classically

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.740
wrong explanation invokes a thing called the Bernoulli  Effect, and says ok so you've got your aerofoil and it's flying through the air but let's think of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.540
things in the reference frame of the aerofoil so we'll have that stationary and move the air streaming past it.  And the classic

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.680
explanation has the air going above and below the wing and kind of joining up when it gets around the other side.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.740
And of course there is more air kind of going higher and lower as well.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.738
And the classically wrong explanation says, "so the air going over the aerofoil

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.659
has further to go than the air going under the aerofoil so in order to meet up with the air at the other end it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.900
has to travel faster," and then there's this thing called The Bernoulli Effect

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.120
[which] basically says that when air is traveling faster, its pressure decreases and that's really just the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.840
Conservation of Energy.  That's really just saying that the energy of the air molecules is partly

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.300
in random motion, which creates pressure, partly in the streaming motion, and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.160
in order to conserve energy, if you increase the amount of streaming energy, you decrease the amount of pressure energy.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.560
So the pressure up here, [be]cause these air has got further to go than this air, it's traveling faster, [the] pressure is reduced,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.600
therefore the pressure above the wing is lower than the pressure below the wing.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.029
Pressure is just the force per unit area. That means that actually the force above the wing pushing down on the wing is less than

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:36.380
the force below pushing up and therefore the thing just rises.  Which all sounds very plausible.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.860
[Brady, incredulously:] But the Bernoulli Effect is a real thing!

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.620
Yes!

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.540
[Brady:] Is that not the Bernoulli Effect you just described?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.200
That _is_ the Bernoulli Effect I just described.  There are at least two flaws with this argument.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.300
The fundamental one,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.000
that I kind of slipped in there, is saying that the air meets up on the far end.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.060
So there's no reason why, you know, when the air leaves from this end,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.040
it doesn't kind of make an agreement with its pal here, that's it's gonna meet up when It gets to the other end.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.000
There is no reason why the air traveling above should get to the far end at the same time as the air traveling below.  In fact the air traveling above

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.020
travels so much faster, that it gets there *before* the air traveling below in reality.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.060
So that's the first fallacious part of the argument, is that It has to travel faster to meet up

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.600
with its friend at the farther side of the journey past the airfoil.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.880
[Brady] But professor, if you just said that in fact It gets there faster, doesn't that mean that we get like a Hyper-Bernoulli Effect?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.300
You actually get more lift than that naive argument would predict.  So there's a second argument which is sometimes put forward about why this can't be the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.780
explanation, and this one's not quite so true, and the argument goes that if It were true,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.480
then It wouldn't be possible for an aeroplane to fly upside down. Which of course they can. [Brady: yes]  So here's our aeroplane,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.239
here's our aeroplane flying upside down.  If the previous argument was true (which to some extent, it is) [then] this aeroplane would just fly straight

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.018
into the ground, because the lift effect we were talking about before is now pulling it in this direction

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.850
instead of that direction. But of course the pilot has other things that they can alter, and in particular they can move the nose

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.589
of the plane up and down, which of course has the effect of moving the wing.  And by changing the angle of attack, with the wing like

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.239
this, the airflow we were talking about before, there's a thing called the stagnation point, which is the point at which the air kind of

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.829
splits between either going above the wing or below the wing, and the stagnation point as you change the angle of attack in this

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.359
way moves downwards.  The previous arguments still sort of holds because actually the air going above the

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.239
aerofoil is still going further than the air going below the aerofoil, so the Bernoulli type effects that we were talking about before still occur.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.019
So the other argument goes:

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.169
that actually even when you're flying the right way up, you have a bit of an angle of attack, so the way you really

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.000
fly an aeroplane is with the aerofoil slightly tilted.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.700
And the argument goes that the air essentially just

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.040
bounces off the underside of the wing, and heads on down this way

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.260
and you can see that the air molecules, through this process, have acquired a momentum downwards. And that means that the aerofoil will acquire a

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.700
momentum upwards just from Conservation of Momentum.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.558
Brady: Yeah the plane's just being *battered* into the air.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.980
It is, it's been pushed up by air bashing into it.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.360
There are a couple of reasons why this is wrong.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.720
What happens on the upper side of the aerofoil remember is that the air goes

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.469
over, and actually also ends up being bent downwards.  The air traveling over the top of the wing, by acquiring downwards momentum,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.440
means that It has to be transferring upwards momentum to the wing as well, and so in fact the air traveling over the wing is

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.280
also contributing to the lift.  It actually contributes _more_ of the lift than the air [that's] going underneath

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.960
the aerofoil.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.680
It really comes down to the fact that you can't really think about a gas like air as just a load of little ping-pong balls.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.140
One easy way to think about that is if you were to,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.160
to hold your hands up in front of your face and blow against it.  [Whooshing sound as he blows]

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.220
The air actually hits your hand and then shoots out to the sides.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.240
Now if you were just throwing ping pong balls at the wall that would never happen, right?  They would just bounce straight back at you.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.960
And It really is because

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.700
air as a gas behaves in a very different way from this collection of individual particles.  You have to worry about the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.910
interactions between the particles as well.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.920
Which means that these kind of simple momentum conservation

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.400
ideas about how . . . an aeroplane can fly can't be the whole story.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.720
Brady, incredulously:  How does an aeroplane fly?  [Guffaw]

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.430
Okay.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.930
So.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.620
The physics for this sort of goes back to Leonhard Euler in the 18th Century,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.540
who came up with a set of things called the Euler Equations.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:07.800
And the Euler Equations, you can write them down mathematically (it's all quite complicated) but actually physically what they're saying is that as air moves around

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.740
there are three conserved quantities you need to worry about.  The mass is conserved, which it just says that molecules don't appear and disappear, that

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.440
they have to kind of flow continuously so you have Conservation of Mass.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.160
Momentum is conserved.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.680
Just from Newton's Laws,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.800
which kind of goes to one of those slightly spurious explanations we were looking at,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.300
and Energy is conserved.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.140
Which of course is where the Bernoulli Law comes from,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.200
and you need to conserve all three things at the same time.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.270
And that's why neither of those previous

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.059
explanations can be the whole story, because each kind of borrows bits of the physics but doesn't do the whole thing at the same time

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.090
The way these three things behave together is really quite complicated, which is why you get these complicated flow patterns around

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.160
wings like this and you have to start worrying about effects like turbulence and those kinds of things. Although each of those

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.200
previous arguments kind of captures some aspect of what's going on, you really need to think about all three of them at the same time

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.540
and actually if you really want to do things properly, you have to worry about

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.080
viscosity effects, that If you've got one load of air traveling at a particular speed it'll tend to drag the next lot of air along

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.220
at a similar speed.  It's very hard to have one lot of air going very quickly and the other lot not moving at all.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.000
So you have these

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
viscosity effects that air kind of drags other bits of air around and if you want to put that in as well then you have

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.100
to take the Euler Equations and add this viscosity effect and then you end up with a thing called The Navier-Stokes Equations

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.140
which were only invented in the Nineteenth Century,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.360
which are the full set of equations you really need to solve, to understand what's going on with it.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.540
[Brady] What is going on with it?

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.740
So ok, so remember we're trying to do these three aspects and really we,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.140
you know, you need to do Conservation of Mass, Conservation of Momentum, and Conservation of Energy, all at the same time.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.240
So here's what's going on.

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:40.099
Here's our wing.  The air above is kind of being squeezed together.

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:45.348
It's a little complicated to figure out exactly why, just because, you know if there were a wall up here it would kind of make

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.329
sense that actually suddenly it's being pushed into this narrower space and everything's being squeezed together. But there isn't, there's just a whole lot more

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:54.180
air up there.  But again this comes out of the equations that the air ends up being squeezed in this way.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.120
Because it's being squeezed into a tighter space but you've got the same amount of air,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.140
remember the first of the things we have to conserve is mass.  To get the same amount of air through

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.520
but in this squeezed region instead of this sort of wider region, it has to travel faster.  So the air is Indeed

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.060
traveling faster above the wing than it is below the wing, so that part is true.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.460
Not because it has to go further, just because the geometry of the obstruction here

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:21.830
squeezes the air together.  It really is just the way the air flows around an obstruction like this, so it is traveling faster so that's

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.400
the Conservation of Mass.  The air here is compressed, which means it's traveling faster, which means Bernoulli's Law,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.800
Conservation of Energy, says that the pressure here is lower which means that the force downwards on the top of the wing is less than the

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:35.920
force upwards, and therefore that's the phenomenon of lift.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.740
But then the last part, like if you think about it, the gas originally all flowed in like this, and by the end it's all flowing downwards like this.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.399
So that the air has Indeed acquired a downwards momentum, and we have to conserve momentum.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.560
You know if the air is now flowing downwards, being pushed downwards, that means that the wing is pushed upwards, and

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.620
so you can Indeed you think of this globally as a Conservation of Momentum effect that the air

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:03.180
globally acquires downwards momentum due to these various phenomena we've just been talking about, which means that the wing acquires an upwards momentum.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.000
So you can see all three of these aspects all feed into the explanation.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.780
The Conservation of Mass, the Conservation of Energy, and the Conservation of Momentum, and really

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.100
you can't extricate any one of them and say "that's the reason why!"

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.729
You really have to think about all three at the same time in order to understand the global phenomenon.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:27.019
Brady: Between The Bernoulli one and the Conservation of Momentum one, which one is more important?  Which like. . .

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.200
I don't think you can separate it out in that way.  I think you really have to think about all three at the same time. Because the

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.340
physics equations you're solving, [you] really are solving for all three of these things at the same time. And if you were to fiddle with one

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.100
of them, that would affect the others.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.500
So actually you can't say "Lift is being caused by Conservation of Momentum"

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.780
or "Lift is being caused by Conservation of Energy through the Bernoulli Effect."  It really is the

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.319
combination of both of them together with the Conservation of Mass which is causing the effect.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.109
Well I guess the last thing to say is that

00:08:57.329 --> 00:08:58.949
reality is always more complicated

00:08:58.949 --> 00:09:03.739
than any of these simple explanations, and actually if you really want to design a wing you have to do very complicated

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.620
hydrodynamic simulations in three dimensions because this is not a real wing, in fact, you know this is just a piece of cardboard,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.929
and actually real wings are fundamentally three dimensional entities, and so for example, one of the other

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.969
aspects you have to worry about with a real wing is that it has an end.  And at the end of It you

00:09:19.969 --> 00:09:24.160
have all sorts of effects like vortices being shed off the end of the wing and what-have-you which actually have a

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.860
significant effect on the lift of the wing as well.  So although as a physicist, this is the explanation, if you want the engineer's

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.399
explanation as to how a wing works, you really have to give an even more complicated story.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.039
Brady:  I mean you showed me a bunch of things at the start that you described as like the fallacies, and yet a lot of it ended

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.940
up being part of the final explanation.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.620
So it felt like those fallacies were okay [Prof: Right], there were just other things at play as well.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.520
That's true.  No I agree and that's a fair reflection that actually you know, I

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.320
refer to them as fallacies but they are, I guess, "partial truths" would probably be a better explanation for them.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.640
Brady: So the Bernoulli Effect does make planes fly.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.400
[The] Bernoulli Effect does make planes fly.  So does Conservation of Momentum.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.320
So in some sense everyone's right, so maybe everyone should be happy.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.500
. . . water.  So i got over there

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:11.680
some water, which I'll go and collect and we'll go another 20 paces that way, and show you that the water will

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.760
extend the range even further.
