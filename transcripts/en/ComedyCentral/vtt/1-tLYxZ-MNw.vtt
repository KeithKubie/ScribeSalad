00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:04.704
I wrote it, I sent it, I'm ****d

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.609 align:start size:97% position:3%
- My wife was in the
hospital with our new baby.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.010
She had just given
birth and I was alone

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.445
with my other two children,

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.281
who are, FYI, just for the
record, (beeping) nightmares.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.350
My mother-in-law was annoying
me with her text messages.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.353
"Do my dog's eyes
look okay to you?

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.954 align:start size:84% position:16%
"How are the windows
in the apartment?

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:22.888
"Clean?

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:23.723
"Was it diarrhea from the dogs?"

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:24.958
What the (beeps) man?

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.125
Like, now I gotta go
look at these like

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.293 line:92%
two Pomeranian's dog (bleep).

00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:30.062
So, I texted my wife and said,

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.731 align:start size:81% position:19%
"Your mother is
annoying me so bad

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:34.199 align:start size:88% position:13%
"I'm going to throw
her in front of a bus."

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.569
I looked down and saw
that I had sent that

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.137
to my mother-in-law.

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.438
(record scratching)

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:40.973
So I like freaked
out and panicked.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
I realized that
what I needed to do

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.478
was that I texted my
mother-in-law and said,

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.980
"Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.116
"That text was meant
for my cousin Ben,

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.151
"whose mother, my aunt Beth,

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.320
"is annoying the
(bleep) out of me."

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.454
She wrote back like,

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:56.956
"Ha ha."

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.491
So I was like, I don't
know if I'm in the clear.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.959
So an hour later,

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.595
I texted her again,

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:05.397
"Dude, tell your
mother to lay off."

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:08.234
And you see, I put
the dude in there.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.502
So she wrote back,

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.404
"Ha ha ha, still not Ben."

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.339
I was like, (clapping)

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.007
I did it, I convinced you.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.509
She won't find out

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.146
unless she sees this Unsend
thing online or whatever,

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.148 align:start size:94% position:6%
but she can't even
really work her computer.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.484 line:0%
Protip, erase your
text conversations
after they're done.

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.086
There's no reason to keep a log

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.021
of who you've been
talking to all day.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:30.423
That's,

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.257 line:0%
Unsend.
