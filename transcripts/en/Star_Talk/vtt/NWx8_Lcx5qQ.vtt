00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
- So, you gained weight in space.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.940
- I gained weight. I
really liked the food, man.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.070
It was good.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.970
(laughing)

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.440
- I mean, if you had a
pretty much unlimited supply

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.760
of macaroni and cheese, Chuck.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.700
- Yeah, but doesn't it come
in, like, a freeze-dried

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.530
little pouch?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.250
- Well, it's dehydrated.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.120
- Oh, is that what it is?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.150
- But it's good.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.980
It's macaroni and cheese,
one of my favorites,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.280
that's dehydrated.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.320
Also shrimp cocktail,
shrimp cocktail's excellent.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.150
- Really?

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.810
- That I think, I don't know
if you have stats on it,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.850
- Sounds like you guys are
living pretty high on the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.680
hog up there in space.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.320
- Of course we are, yeah.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.500
- I'll have another shrimp
cocktail, thank you.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.840
- Did you ever eat that
astronaut ice cream they sell?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.670
- No.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.890
- Yeah, don't eat that stuff.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.960
- Is that the ... It
looks like cotton candy?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290
- I don't know what it is,
it looks like cardboard.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.120
- Yes.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.400
- And every once in a while
I'd get coerced into eating it,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.330
for, you know, some
kid thing or something.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.620
(disgusted noise)

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.220
We don't eat that stuff in space.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.550
- You guys have actual good food.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.300
- We have really good food, yeah.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.060
Chocolate fudge cake, for
example, is a very good dessert.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.700
If you have this, call it
cardboard, which is what that

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.000
ice cream is, or chocolate
fudge cake, you're going

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.950
for the chocolate fudge cake.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.780
- Yeah.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.150
- Kids love that astronaut
ice cream stuff, though.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.980
- Yeah, well.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.990
- Kids, man, they'll eat anything.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.820
- Kids are stupid, let's be honest.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.360
- They're eating that
stuff, they love that stuff.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.360
- Kids don't know what they like.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.530
- But adults aren't, you
know, we're not going

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.460
to get fooled.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.790
- Well, we've lived.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.630
(laughing)

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.330
- Yeah, we know what it's
like not to eat cardboard.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.160
- We've lived.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.480
We know better than to
eat cardboard ice cream.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.450
- Yeah, that's no good.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.720
But the food is really good.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.630
- Wait, so, here's the
thing, because I'm trying to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.530
figure out.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.630
- Yeah?

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.790
- Aren't you supposed
to lose weight in space?

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210
- Most people don't gain weight in space.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.480
I was one of only two people.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.660
When I got back after my
first flight, and you get

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.170
your physical, and they
take your blood pressure,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.240
of course all your vitals,
and they weigh you,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.260
it was like, "Oh, my god!"

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.540
It was like a eureka.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.610
"He gained weight."

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.640
They got me in a little bit
heavier than when they put

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.400
me on the space ship a
couple weeks earlier.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.230
- How does that happen?

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.290
- So, I think there's a
couple, one is that I was in

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.240
really good shape when I
left on my space flights,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.150
best shape I was ever in in my life.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.210
So I think I was kind of low.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.410
And then when I got to space,
you don't eat very much.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.540
One reason you don't eat
very much, especially,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.880
is because you don't feel
very good, you don't feel

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.710
very well.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.660
You have a bit of stomach
awareness, because your whole

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.600
system is getting used to it up there.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.430
Your vestibular system works
on gravity when we're here

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.150
on Earth, so it tells us
we're right side up, we're

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.700
accelerating, we're moving around.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.540
- Right.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.560
- As we move our head, we're
running, driving a car,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.230
you're accelerating, all
that stuff works in concert

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.240
with your eye movements, with your vision.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.200
Now what happens is when
you're in space, and your

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.740
vestibular system stops
working because it works on

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.910
gravity, your brain gets a bit confused.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.740
- Right.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.370
- Because the vestibular system
is saying you're perfectly

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.840
still, but your eyes are
saying you're moving.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.860
So the first couple days
you don't feel very well.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.860
- So do you feel yourself
actually in free fall?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.950
Around the ...

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.320
Because you're in free fall, right?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.150
- You are.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.340
You're going around our planet
at 17 500 miles an hour,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.340
but really no sensation of
speed other than, you know,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.110
you look on this watch,
here is California, and then

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.710
we hit Miami, and 10 minutes go by.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.600
You know that's going really fast.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.430
- Right.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.260
- Right?

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.180
But you don't feel it,
there's no wind resistance,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.010
there is nothing.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.110
It's just, you know, this motion.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.010
- So, how about exercise?

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.840
- Yeah.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.580
- Because I thought you
guys had to exercise.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.260
- Maybe that's why I
gained all that weight.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.940
- I thought you had to exercise
while you were up there.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.830
- That's why I gained
all that weight, Chuck.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.330
The issue is, in space, if
you're up there for longer

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.930
periods, a couple weeks,
like I was up there with my,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.930
with my astronaut friends,
not that bad if you didn't

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.760
exercise.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.840
But we still exercised every
day to feel better, of course.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.030
- Right.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.260
- So every day, if we
weren't space walking,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.960
which is a pretty big athletic event.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.970
- I'm sure that's pretty hard.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.130
- You were doing something
to exercise, mainly riding

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.840
an exercise bike, is what
we had on board the shuttle.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.600
These guys on the Space
Station, these men and women

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.840
on the Space Station, if
you're up there for that amount

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.800
of time that the missions
are currently, six months.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.790
So, picture if you were on
like, super duper bedrest,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.970
meaning you have to do absolutely nothing.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.310
It's even worse than bedrest.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.400
But if you lay down ...

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.230
Don't try this, by the way.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.490
But if you laid down
for six months straight

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.570
and didn't do anything.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.350
- Oh my god, that's my dream.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.970
- Exactly, but it wouldn't
be such a good idea to get

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.990
up right away after those six months.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.590
So when you're up there floating in space,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.840
you're not even using any of your muscles.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.280
No load at all is being
placed on your muscles

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.240
or your bones.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.300
By load, I mean no force
to keep them healthy.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.130
- Right, there's no force.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.970
And that's because you're weightless.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:41.800
- Because you're weightless.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.770
So right now, even what we're
doing, by moving our hands,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.500
by sitting up straight as best we can,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.470
getting up and walking
around a little bit,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.940
we are doing a little bit.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.770
- Right.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.750
- That it keeps us, not
necessarily keeps us in shape,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.950
but it'll prevent us from
being totally deteriorated

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.060
after, like you would be in space.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.010
So in space, while you're
doing that, if you're not

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.050
doing anything, your body
adjusts to that environment

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.380
in that way if you're not doing anything.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.450
So you'll go through bone loss.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.410
Your bones will become much weaker.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.240
- Oh, really?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.180
- And you'll go through
muscle loss, and even your

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.460
heart will shrink.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.510
Your heart is a muscle, right?

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.340
- Right.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.610
- It's not going to have to
pump as hard if you're just

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.750
laying around all the time.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.400
So by exercising, you're
keeping your muscles strong

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.960
and your bones strong, and
everything working really well.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.190
And we've gotten pretty good.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.060
The issue with it, though,
is that it requires a lot

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.890
of time.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.830
It's a two hour exercise
period every day, six days

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.660
a week.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.490
- You're kidding me.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.320
- Every day, six days a week.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.160
- Two hours?

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.990
- Yep.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.660
- That's because the
benefits of exercising aren't

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.890
as intense because you have
no force enacted upon you?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.720
- Right.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.630
So there's a treadmill, and
there's an exercise bike

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.790
on the Space Station.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.220
There's also the
resistive exercise device.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.050
- Oh yeah?

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.880
- Yeah.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.840
So you get a resistive
exercise, which is like

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.690
weight lifting.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.520
- Right.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.110
- And because you can take
600 pounds, and you know,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.160
you and I can just play catch with it.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.990
- Nice.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.820
- Right?

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.810
That's a lot, we can't do
that here on Earth, right?

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.860
But in space, you won't
have the weights, right?

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.360
You have mass, but not weight.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.370
- You have mass, no weight.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.080
- Weight, but yeah, right,
because you need gravity to

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.440
actually weigh something.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.220
So, big barbells and dumbbells
aren't going to help you.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.300
So what we use is this
resistive exercise device

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.240
which works on springs,
pulleys, kind of like a

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.460
thorough band, you know that?

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.730
- Resistance band.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.800
- Resistance, exactly.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.640
- Yeah.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.660
- So this allows you to
get a full body workout.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.390
You can do squats and curls
and bench and everything

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.450
else like you would, but
you do it with this special

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.280
machine.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.810
- Now I just want to go to
space to lift 600 pounds.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.450
Just to bench 600 pounds.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.290
- We moved around, we were
at Space Walk and we handled

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.270
these big instruments
weighing 300 pounds like they

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.100
were nothing.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.450
You've gotta be careful,
then they get away from you

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.410
easily too, so you've gotta
be careful with that stuff.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.160
- We have forces enacted
upon us here on earth.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.580
Why don't they just create that up there?

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.070
Like, what was that, 2001 Space Odyssey?

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.920
- Yeah, they were rotating around there.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.420
- Rotating to create ...

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.640
- That would be cool, right?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.750
But that requires a really big spaceship,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.930
or it requires a lot of room.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.070
I had a friend of mine in grad
school who had this thesis,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.320
when he had his idea, and
the equipment he built was a

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.940
centrifuge that you could
sleep on so you wouldn't

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.950
waste any time during the day.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.420
And you were spun, it was a rotating bed.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.680
Your head was at the center
of it, so you wouldn't

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.350
get this Coriolis effect that
would wig you out, right.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.020
So it would rotate you
and it's that rotation

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.070
of sleeping in a centrifuge
and that would put force

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.980
on your body and that would help

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.070
but that was pretty big man,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.980
that was really big.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.810
- The bed was big?

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.690
- The bed yeah, you gotta put a bed

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.100
and then it's gotta rotate, you
need a lot of room for that.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.930
- Right, right, right.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.810
- So it's a little impractical.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.980
- So it was like a localized
artificial gravity environment.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.520
- Correct, yeah but if you could produce

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.580
an artificial gravity
environment by rotating

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.890
them enough, that would
probably be a good idea.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.370
I don't know what that would be like,

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.880
I think cause if you're rotating someone,

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.500
it was during sleeping but
for a room to be spinning,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.510
I think you need a really big room.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.770
- Or a lot of alcohol.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.820
- A lot of alcohol, then it get worse.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.380
- For the room to be spinning.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.510
- I think you're really need it

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.040
cause if we were in a rotating room

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.910
I think that would be
a little disconcerting.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.620
- Yeah without a doubt.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.180
So artificial gravity is probably not

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.190
something we're gonna see then,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.450
if it takes a huge, huge space station.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.940
- Probably, let's say
figure out a better way

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.770
to do it.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.190
The transportation mode
is the other thing,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.780
if you can get places more quickly

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.330
then you don't have to
worry about floating around

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.270
but when where we get to planets,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.100
even on the moon, you
have one sixth gravity,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.030
Mars you have one sixth gravity,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.910
so you have a little bit of gravity there

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.380
which is very helpful
but you gotta be able

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.990
to withstand the voyage
there without any gravity

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.940
field around ya.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.470
So, on the missions I was
on was going to Hubble

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.300
on the shuttle.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.890
- Which by the way, you
repaired the Hubble.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.720
- I did, I was one of those guys.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.630
- It was two of you guys out there

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.460
and you were actually..

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.290
- Two at a time.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.120
- Two at a time.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.670
- Yeah, we had four, you
have two space walking teams

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.190
and we're out there taking turns going out

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.310
five days in a row on both of my missions.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.340
- That's wild.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.250
- Repair man in space.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.930
It's like working on a
car with boxing gloves,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.380
that's pretty much it is.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.850
People ask me astronomy questions,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.200
they ask me, my neighbors,
I'd be putting out the garbage

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.430
and they go, "Hey Mike," and I'm like what

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.540
and they go, "Tonight,
isn't it true that Mars",

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.840
this is like a question for Neil,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.210
"Isn't it Mars is over
here and this the only time

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.900
in 300 years that it's over there

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.410
and Venus is there and we're
gonna see some other star

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.850
come out over there," and
I'm like, "I don't know"

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.870
they go, you don't know, I have no idea.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.810
They go, "You worked on
a Hubble, didn't ya?"

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.710
I go, "Yeah, I worked, I don't
look through the telescope,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.940
I just fix it."

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.080
So, yeah, I was the repair man up there.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.590
- That's so funny.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.990
You're way too modest man, a repair man,

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.970
an astronaut repair man,

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.090
who gets to say that.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.450
- I can fix almost anything
inside of a space suit,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.400
that's the problem, now
without the space suit

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.540
I'm kind of at a loss.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.580
- If you're not wearing a suit

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.410
you can't enact your super powers.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.210
- If I wanna fix the sink
I gotta get a helmet on,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.350
I'm so used to doing it.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.910
- Alright, keep your science capsule on

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.770
because the spinning doesn't stop here.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.760
For more on weight, mass,
gravity and centripetal force

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.360
check out Brilliant's
Centripetal force quiz,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.250
it's part of the
classical mechanics course

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.800
that gets into explaining the
core principles of physics

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.840
and applies them to real world uses

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.820
like rockets and space and space stations

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.280
and drones and zero G and more.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.210
If you're the type of person
who hears scientific facts

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.080
and wonders, hey, how
did they figure that out,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.670
then Brilliant is right for you,

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.350
it walks you through scientific
and mathematical problems

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.740
guiding you step by step at your own pace.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.000
- Zippity do da.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.060
(laughing)
