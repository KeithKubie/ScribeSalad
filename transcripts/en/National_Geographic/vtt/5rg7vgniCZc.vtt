JASON SILVA: What
does it take to power

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:14.900
a global civilization
to connect billions

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.066
of people across continents?

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.500
It takes the power
of transportation.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.767
From the beginning,
speed and strength

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:26.500
were paramount in the
hunt, on the battle field,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.600
for holding together
far-flung empires.

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:35.400
We sought new forms of power,
harnessing the forces of nature

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.166
to drive us forward--

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:43.533
the horse, the wheel,
steam power, jet engine.

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.767
Every new innovation
powered our next great leap.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:55.000
Transportation has become
our exoskeleton allowing

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.767
us to transcend our biology.

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:58.467
[music playing]

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:10.967
Faster than sound,
farther than the moon,

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:16.500
our inventions give us a level
of power we never imagined.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.166
With our machines we carved
through solid rock, tunneled

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:23.700
beneath the sea floor,
connecting the world,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300
mixing distant cultures.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.300
Freedom of movement has
given us freedom of mind.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.967
The flow of people and materials
exposes us to new ideas

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:36.266
and new understanding.

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.500
This is the story of how
transportation turned society

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.834
inside out, how engines and
animals powered the rise

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:47.700
of civilization, and how the
innovations that drive humanity

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.967
forward made us modern.

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:54.300
This is "Origins."
