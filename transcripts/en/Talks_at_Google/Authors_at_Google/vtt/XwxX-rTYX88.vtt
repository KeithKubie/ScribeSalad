SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
Let me just give

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.610
a sort of brief summary of
the book for those of you

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.790
who aren't familiar with
it and haven't read it.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.340
"The Away Game" tells the
story of the largest talent

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.460
search in soccer history,
which was carried out

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.800
over the last 10 years
by the wealthy desert

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.470
kingdom of Qatar.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.120
Over that period,
they held tryouts

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.080
for over five million
13-year-old boys, mostly

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.190
in Africa, looking for
soccer's next superstars.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.590
It was led by a
Spanish scout who

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.440
helped launch Lionel
Messi's career at Barcelona.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.650
And the process was over
1,000 times more selective

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.019
than getting into Harvard.

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:43.560
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.518
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: So it
was an incredible story.

00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:48.950
It was one that I really took
to when I first heard about it.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.320
And that was back in 2007 when
the program first started.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.000
I was living in Cairo--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.510
actually saw a commercial on
TV for this gleaming new sports

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.930
academy in Qatar called
Aspire, did a bit of googling.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.690
And it just so
happened that that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.440
was when they launched
this program, which

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.510
is called Football Dreams.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.320
And so I went over when the
first class of kids from Africa

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.940
were in Doha for
their final tryout,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.054
wrote a story about
it for the AP.

00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:18.220
And even then, I thought
it would be an amazing book

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.842
or documentary or
movie or something

00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:23.050
but wasn't really in a
position to do it at the time.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.340
And years passed.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.890
I moved to Islamabad, as
you mentioned, and spent

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.365
a bunch of time having
great adventures,

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:31.360
embedding with
troops in Afghanistan

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.407
and with rebels in Libya.

00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:36.490
But Football Dreams sort
of always stayed with me.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.670
I always wondered what happened
to those talented African kids

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.040
who I had spent a few
days with years ago.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.750
And so at the beginning of
2014, I decided to quit my job,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.750
took a leap of faith, and
spent the next four years

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.820
traveling all over
the world, researching

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.180
and writing this story.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.805
SPEAKER: And how did
you get introduced

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.210
to the scout, who was Josep?

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.840
SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
Yeah, Josep Colomer.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.050
He's the former youth
director at Barcelona.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.800
He's the one who helped
launch Messi's career.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.949
Messi was 16 when
Josep took over there.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.964
And he promoted
Messi four levels

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.880
in one year, which is
something that had never

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.370
happened at the academy before.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.540
And he's the one who gave Messi
his debut on the first team.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.470
I first met Josep back
in beginning of 2008

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.630
when I went to Doha for
that story about the program

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.330
at the beginning.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.160
He's a really
interesting character.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.200
He comes from this medieval
town north of Barcelona

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.350
and has been obsessed with
finding the next generation

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.490
of soccer talent.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.090
Even when he was a teenager,
he had a little futsal club

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.450
there in his little local town
and would spend his weekends

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.910
kind of canvassing the
local towns around him,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.165
trying to find the best futsal
players and so eventually

00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:53.540
made it all the
way to Barcelona.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.960
He helped Brazil win
the World Cup in 2002,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.760
so he's an
interesting character.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.460
SPEAKER: So the
framework of the book

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.940
follows three kind of
aspiring professionals.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.277
How did you decide
on those three?

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:08.110
How many players did
you research and end up

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.959
talking to to really
nail down your story?

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.000
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah, it
was a difficult process

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.430
trying to choose which
players to focus on.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.150
As you mentioned, I focus
on three African kids who

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.400
were found about 10 years ago--

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.530
two from Senegal,
one from Ghana--

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.162
and tell the story of where they
came from, how they were found,

00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:29.620
and what happened
to them when they

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.120
were selected for this program.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.300
And it was difficult to choose
which players to focus on

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.520
because so many of them
had incredible stories.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.740
I mean, these were
all kids who grew up

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.400
playing on dirt fields
across Africa, often

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.880
barefoot or in plastic
sandals, dreaming

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.580
that someday some foreign
scout would show up

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.470
on the sideline
and point to them

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.730
and say, you're
marked for greatness.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.050
And so you can imagine
their joy and surprise

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.240
when this Spanish
scout shows up who's

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.240
worked for one of the
biggest clubs in the world

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.698
and says he's going to take
them to a country they've never

00:04:03.698 --> 00:04:07.950
heard of before, Qatar, and
make all their dreams come true.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.610
But in the end, I held
interviews with over two dozen

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.930
of the boys in that program.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.530
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.709
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: And I
wanted to choose players

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.910
who had interesting stories
but different stories

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.220
so that they would be very
distinct for a reader.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.650
And the three boys I chose--

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.080
Bernard, Diawandou,
and Ibrahima--

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.310
they come from
different backgrounds.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.070
And also, they had
different trajectories.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.800
They had different outcomes.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.300
One of them-- I don't want to
give it away-- but one of them

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.040
made it all the
way to Barcelona,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.820
where he was playing with
Messi and Neymar and Suarez.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.640
The others sort of had
different levels of success.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.470
And that was very
important for me,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.017
to not just tell the story of
the boys who made it but also

00:04:54.017 --> 00:04:54.850
the ones who didn't.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.180
Because you realize that
the percentage of players

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.570
who actually make it all
the way to the top clubs

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.240
is infinitesimally small.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.589
I mean, at the Premier
League academies in the UK,

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:08.130
the percentage of
players who make it

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.074
from the youth level to the
first team is a half a percent.

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:12.990
And these are kids who
are already in the best

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.948
academies in the world.

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:16.140
So you think about
a kid who grows up

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.330
playing on a dirt
field in Africa,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.680
what's his percentage chance?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.520
It's really small.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.290
And so I wanted to also tell
the story of those kids who fans

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.390
never really hear about,
the names of the players

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.394
they never really learn.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:30.810
SPEAKER: So let's talk a little
bit about that percentage.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.230
And a lot of the--
big part of the book

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.000
in the scouting process
was the physical skills

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.684
versus the data analytics.

00:05:37.684 --> 00:05:39.100
And you're really
scouting players

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.040
that have no video
footage on them

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.190
and not a lot of information
to base your decision off of.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.762
What did you see was
how they were scouted?

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:48.720
And what were they looking
for in these players

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.154
to bring them to the academy?

00:05:50.154 --> 00:05:51.820
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.236
One of the things
I do in the book

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:56.250
is I weave in a discussion
of the science of searching

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.376
for soccer talent.

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:00.750
There's been a lot of research
in the last 15 to 20 years

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.030
about what makes a
great player and what

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.590
scouts should be
looking for when

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.050
they're scouting young kids.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.970
And the interesting
thing, as you mentioned,

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.040
is that they
shouldn't be focused

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.780
on physical characteristics.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.522
Things like size,
strength, and speed really

00:06:15.522 --> 00:06:17.730
aren't going to tell them
about a player's potential.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.140
Speed is probably the most
useful of those variables.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.640
But even speed is not really
going to tell you that much.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.180
Technique is more important.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.360
But the most important
factors are actually

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.340
the mental ones, things
like game intelligence,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.910
vision, personality.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.580
And game intelligence was the
most interesting one to me.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.010
When I asked Josep first,
when I first met him,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.640
what do you look
for in a player?

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.760
When you go and you're
standing on the sidelines

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.650
of a field in Nigeria
and you're watching

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.050
a bunch of 13-year-old
kids run around,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.570
what are you looking for?

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.590
And he said, I
look for the player

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.960
who understands the
game, who understands

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.262
what the game is asking.

00:06:56.262 --> 00:06:58.470
He said, there are plenty
of players who can dribble.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.600
There's plenty of
players who can shoot,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.570
but plenty of players, when the
game is asking them to dribble,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.110
they shoot.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.419
When the game is asking
them to pass, they dribble.

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.460
He said, but there are
certain players who always

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.810
make the right decisions.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.260
And he likes to point
to Andres Iniesta, who's

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.690
this sprightly
midfield genius who,

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.170
for his whole career until
just now, played for Barcelona.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.270
He likes to say that
Iniesta isn't big.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.386
He's not fast.

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:26.010
He's a good dribbler,
but not the best.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.120
He doesn't score goals.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.370
But he always makes
the right decisions.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.580
And so he was looking for
that game intelligence.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.130
And interestingly enough,
although Josep himself

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.967
didn't know the
science behind it,

00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:39.300
there's been a bunch of
research into game intelligence.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.000
And what they found
was that in children,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.510
game intelligence develops not
so much through formal games

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.216
and practice, but
through pickup soccer,

00:07:48.216 --> 00:07:49.590
through the kind
of street soccer

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.340
that these kids in Africa and
South America play so much of.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.320
And so he intuitively
knew that if he

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.360
went to a place like
Africa that there

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.590
were a lot of kids with that raw
talent that he was looking for.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.050
And it was interesting to see
that the research actually

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.255
backed that up.

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:07.380
SPEAKER: Let's talk a little
bit about the academy.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.660
A lot of investment
went into the academy.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.220
But it's kind of an
interesting dynamic on timing.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.570
And it seems like they were--

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.600
kind of had two routes
for the players,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.640
either to go get them
to become professional

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.100
when they turned 18,
or it seemed like,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.500
to play for a national team.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.910
Did you get a sense that with
the timing of the 2022 World

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.380
Cup and the age being
kind of the right fact

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.130
that that might have
played a little piece

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.576
into them wanting to play
for the Qatar national team?

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:36.159
SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
Yes, so that actually

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.610
did-- that ended up
playing into it somewhat.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.360
But the program actually
started before Qatar decided

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.130
to bid for the World Cup.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.410
And the background
to the program

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.110
is that it starts with
one of the richest

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.725
men in the world, a guy named
Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al

00:08:52.725 --> 00:08:56.220
Thani, who's a member of
the Qatari royal family.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.094
And he decided
nearly 20 years ago

00:08:58.094 --> 00:08:59.760
that he was going to
make it his mission

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.760
to produce a world-class
Qatari national team.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.970
In fact, he was so
passionate about soccer

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.420
that he was heir to the
throne at the time, of Qatar.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.360
He gave that up to his brother
and sort of threw himself

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.640
into this project
wholeheartedly.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.420
And the first thing he did was
he spent a billion dollars.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.160
And he built Aspire
Academy, which

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.000
is possibly the most high-tech
sports academy in the world.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.160
The signature feature of Aspire
is the largest air-conditioned

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.590
sports dome in the world, which
is the width of the Eiffel

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.646
Tower laying on its side.

00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:34.770
So it's absolutely massive.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.061
You can imagine what it was
like for these African kids

00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:40.950
when they showed up for
the first time in Doha

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.810
after running around
on dirt fields

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.750
and then seeing
this massive dome.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.510
So even though Qatar only had a
few hundred thousand citizens,

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.820
which is pretty tough
to think about producing

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.400
a world-class national
team, he had money to spend.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.480
He wanted to do it.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.310
So he spent $1 billion.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.200
He built Aspire.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.540
He hired all the best
scouts and coaches.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.150
And the first thing they
did was held tryouts

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.410
for every boy in Qatar.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.660
Because you can do that if
you only have a few hundred

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.520
thousand citizens,
quickly realized

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.220
they didn't have the
population necessary to produce

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.030
a world-class national team.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.510
And that's when they ended
up launching Football Dreams.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.152
He connected with Josep Colomer,
who had been at Barcelona.

00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:19.860
And they set off.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.380
They actually invited Pele over
in 2007 to launch the program.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.030
And their stated purpose for
doing this was just, well,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.630
they wanted to go find
players in Africa who

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.952
were much better than the
players in their academy

00:10:35.952 --> 00:10:37.410
so that those
African players could

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.540
train with their local
players and improve

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.500
the level of
training, which would

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.750
make the local players better.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.200
But Qatar has a long
history of using its wealth

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.260
to lure foreign athletes into
taking Qatari citizenship

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.230
and competing for the country
on the world's highest stage.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.960
They've done it for
Kenyan sprinters,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.220
Bulgarian weightlifters,
my personal favorite,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.170
a Chinese chess grandmaster.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.740
And so I think at the
beginning of the program,

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.500
they had this idea
that they would

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.480
go find the best of
the best in Africa,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.390
bring them, give them
Qatari citizenship,

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.970
and they would play for Qatar.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.820
And eventually, once they won
the right to host a World Cup,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.870
that became even more important.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.320
But as the book describes,
it didn't exactly

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.650
play out as they had planned,
so it became a more complicated

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.235
endeavor than they imagined.

00:11:27.235 --> 00:11:28.860
SPEAKER: And so you
mentioned that this

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.850
is one of the top
world-class facilities.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.980
What was that like
for the first group

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.975
that came over that, as you
mentioned, played on dirt?

00:11:37.975 --> 00:11:39.650
A lot of them
didn't have cleats.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.836
And coming into just
this incredible facility,

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:45.210
what was that transition like
to just the day-to-day life

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.300
and then also the ability to
train at such a higher level?

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.800
SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
Yeah, I mean again,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.050
it was staggering
for them to show up

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.536
for the first time at Aspire.

00:11:53.536 --> 00:11:55.410
I mean, one of my favorite
quotes in the book

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.350
is Diawandou, one of
the players I focus on,

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.020
who is this defender
from Senegal.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.870
The first time he walks
into the dome, he says,

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.870
even if I don't make it,
I want to be buried here.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.750
I mean, it was just like nothing
he could have ever imagined.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.150
And so these kids, they
had to adjust to that.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.270
I mean, these are kids
that many had never

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.720
had hot water showers
before or never

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.450
been in an elevator,
things like that, which

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.820
for us, are pretty commonplace.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.160
But for them, it was a
totally new experience.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.620
And it took some time,
too, adjusting to that.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.370
But they had to adjust
because they needed

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.920
to focus on what was going
to happen on the field, which

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.760
was they were about to be put
into a tryout with the elite

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.390
of the elite from
the rest of Africa.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.330
And in order to have any hope
of staying at the academy,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.900
they really needed to perform.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.240
And so there was a lot
of pressure on them.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.190
A lot of these kids, they came
from pretty poor families.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:58.650
And so their families saw soccer
and saw them as the best ticket

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.310
to sort of a better life.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.010
And so it was a lot of pressure
on them at a young age.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.670
SPEAKER: And they
had some success

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.105
as a team in the academy.

00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:07.980
Can you talk through?

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.490
I know they played the
Real Madrid, Barcelona,

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.920
some of the best European
teams in the world.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.810
Could you talk about
maybe one of the--

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.480
I think you highlight in the
book one of the great games

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.497
and some of the
wins that they had?

00:13:20.497 --> 00:13:21.330
What did you notice?

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.490
And what did you think was
kind of the coolest experience

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.090
for them?

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.798
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah,
I mean these kids,

00:13:25.798 --> 00:13:27.854
they sort of blew the
soccer world away.

00:13:27.854 --> 00:13:29.520
They would go play
at these tournaments.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.102
Nobody had ever heard of them.

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.060
I mean, the amazing thing
about Football Dreams

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.440
is even though it's massive--

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.134
again, they held tryouts
for five million kids--

00:13:37.134 --> 00:13:38.550
a lot of folks in
the soccer world

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.883
had never heard about it before.

00:13:39.883 --> 00:13:43.470
So these kids would
show up at a tournament,

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.620
and AC Milan or
Barcelona or PSG would

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.410
be looking at their
schedule and saying,

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.070
oh, we're playing
Aspire Academy.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.880
Who are these guys?

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.740
Africa and Football Dreams?

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.670
Never heard of them.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.160
And then get wiped
off the field by them.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.409
I remember I was with the coach
of the AC Milan's under-16 team

00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:03.450
at this tournament that's
held in Doha every year

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.770
called the Al Kass
tournament, which

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.978
is one of the biggest youth
tournaments in the world.

00:14:06.978 --> 00:14:09.200
And I saw him watch the
Football Dreams kids

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.200
play for the first time.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.880
And his jaw just dropped, and
he was like, who are these kids?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.180
But one of my favorite
stories along those lines

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.480
was back in 2011, they played in
this tournament called the Milk

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.310
Cup in Northern Ireland,
which is, again,

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.420
one of the biggest tournaments
in the world for youth teams.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.430
And they crushed everyone.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.240
And in the final, they beat
Manchester United five to one.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.600
And one of the players I
focus on, Ibrahima Dramé,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.670
who is this sort of tall,
strapping striker from southern

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.640
Senegal, scored a hat
trick in the final.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.800
He was the highest scorer
in that tournament,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.840
as he was many other
tournaments he played.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.620
And so that tournament was
very emblematic of they

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.410
would go, be totally
unknown, and then just wipe

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.420
all of these major
clubs off the field.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.537
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:14:55.537 --> 00:14:57.120
Now there was a lot
of money that came

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.830
into the investment of this.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.994
Did they feel they got
a return on the academy?

00:15:01.994 --> 00:15:03.660
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: I
mean, if you ask them

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.010
whether they thought
it was a success,

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.990
they would say yes,
because it's their program.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.020
But they spent upwards
of $200 million

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.855
on this program over a
period of 10 years, which

00:15:12.855 --> 00:15:14.230
sounds like a lot
of money to us,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.230
but for Qatar, actually,
is not that much money.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.030
That maybe is a day of oil
and gas revenue for them.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.290
So it's not a huge investment.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.640
I think it depends on what
lens you look at the program

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.200
through.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.710
If you look at it on a
purely scouting basis,

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.900
they produced some players
who made it to big clubs.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.983
A lot of their players
have played for their youth

00:15:35.983 --> 00:15:38.820
national teams in Africa.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.490
And so you could kind
of debate whether or not

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.550
it was successful.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.310
I think for that
amount of money,

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.340
you probably would have
wanted even bigger players

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.090
to come out of it.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.162
But you can debate that.

00:15:50.162 --> 00:15:51.870
The other thing that
they really focus on

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.550
is they say this was a
humanitarian program.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:58.470
They say, our focus
was to try and help

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.600
kids in Africa who
wouldn't get the chance

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.625
to become professionals,
top professionals,

00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:05.250
because they don't
have the development

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.010
opportunities at home.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.330
I think it's a harder
case if you look at it

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.444
as a humanitarian program.

00:16:11.444 --> 00:16:12.860
I mean, there were
definitely kids

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.170
whose lives were transformed.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.930
But spending $200
million on what

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.760
ends up being a very
small number of kids--

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.301
I mean, every year,
they held tryouts

00:16:21.301 --> 00:16:23.780
for about 500,000
13-year-old boys.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.030
And they chose the top 20.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.150
And then from that 20, you know
that only a small percentage

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.010
of those are actually
going to succeed,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.520
because it's so hard to
choose which kids at that age

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.960
are going to be
top professionals.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.770
And so $200 million on a
very small number of people

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.480
does not necessarily make the
greatest humanitarian program.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.450
And so I think from
that perspective,

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.000
it maybe doesn't look so great.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.208
SPEAKER: So you bring up age.

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.990
And I think the most
interesting parts of the book

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.750
and, personally, the
part I found fascinating

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.540
was that there is
this question of age

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.520
and about are these
kids actually 13?

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.900
And it seems like you
uncovered that in some cases,

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.540
there might not be.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.319
How many players did you
notice that the age might not

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.470
have been true?

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.270
And then what was the
most egregious 13-year-old

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.812
that you saw?

00:17:11.812 --> 00:17:13.520
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: So
yeah, so age cheating

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.131
is a big problem in soccer--
in youth soccer in Africa,

00:17:17.131 --> 00:17:19.130
and actually not just in
Africa, but other parts

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.800
of the developing world as
well, where kids will often

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.474
say that they're much younger
than they are to make it

00:17:24.474 --> 00:17:26.099
seem like they're
better than they are.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.460
I mean, imagine
putting a high school

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.910
senior in a game with a bunch
of elementary school kids.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.070
And you can imagine
that the high school

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.510
senior would seem really good.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.570
But actually, he's just older.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.530
And so this is so
widespread in Africa

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.810
that you'll hear coaches
talking about a player,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:46.697
and they'll say, he's 18
but his football age is 13.

00:17:46.697 --> 00:17:48.530
And so I had heard, I
knew conceptually this

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.860
was a problem, but I
spoke to Aspire about it.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.860
And they said, oh, yeah.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.390
No, we've got it covered.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.900
We do our own medical
scans on the players

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.736
once they get here
to Doha to make sure

00:17:59.736 --> 00:18:00.860
that they're the right age.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.256
And so FIFA, what they use
is they do a wrist MRI,

00:18:05.256 --> 00:18:07.130
because you have growth
plates in your wrist.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.670
And their scientists say that
if the growth plates are fused,

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.370
there's a 99% chance
a player is over 17.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.240
So that's what they use at,
say, the under-17 World Cup.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.440
And so Aspire told me,
we've got it covered.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.580
And I thought, OK.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.530
Well, it's not going
to be a problem.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.420
And that's a huge leg
up for them in them

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.160
trying to find future
stars in Africa.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.880
But then I went to Africa for
one of my big research trips.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.444
I mean, I spent about five
months in West Africa in total.

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:34.860
And I started getting the sense
that these players weren't

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.140
necessarily the age
that they were saying.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.370
You'd get comments.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.950
You'd hear certain things.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.240
And so one of the moments for
me that really kind of stood out

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.750
was I was talking to
a player named Yobou

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.197
Thome, from the Ivory Coast.

00:18:49.197 --> 00:18:51.780
And I thought he was going to
be one of the central characters

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.360
in my book.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.180
He has a fascinating story.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.960
When he was selected to go
to the final tryout in Doha,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.030
they discovered he
had a heart defect.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.190
And they did surgery on him.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.300
And he recovered.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.760
He became the captain of
the under-17 Ivory Coast

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.030
national team, took them
to the World Cup in Mexico,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.950
and then at that
tournament was lured away

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.236
by a German agent who
promised him glory in Europe.

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.110
And he ended up having
a very difficult time.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.952
So I thought, this
is an amazing story.

00:19:17.952 --> 00:19:19.410
He'll be one of my
main characters.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.284
And so I went to Abidjan
to spend a few weeks

00:19:21.284 --> 00:19:22.627
with him and his family.

00:19:22.627 --> 00:19:24.960
And so I was talking to him
and one of his youth coaches

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.910
from Abidjan.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.000
And I asked the youth
coach, so what age was Yobou

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.990
when you first saw him play?

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.302
And the youth coach said
to me, oh, he was 13.

00:19:34.302 --> 00:19:36.510
And I turned to Yobou, and
I said, but wait a minute,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.930
weren't you 13 when Aspire
came and held tryouts?

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.400
And he goes, oh, yes,
I was also 13 then.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.360
And so then I thought,
OK, well, he wasn't 13.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.760
But what age was he?

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.680
And it is very
difficult to figure out

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.650
exactly what age these
kids are, because everyone

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.790
is trying to deceive you.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.900
I mean, they are.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.180
Their parents are.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.080
Their coaches are.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.680
Sometimes federation
officials are,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.138
because they know that they
might get a little bit of money

00:20:01.138 --> 00:20:03.270
if a kid makes it.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.230
And so somebody told me the only
way to really determine the age

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.960
is to go to the kid's
elementary school

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.620
and figure out what was the
birthday that was written down

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.240
when the kid started
school at the age of five.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.656
And so I went to his
elementary school in Abidjan.

00:20:19.656 --> 00:20:21.280
And I managed to
convince the principal

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.357
to let me look through
these handwritten records

00:20:23.357 --> 00:20:23.940
that they had.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.700
That had this big stack
of handwritten logs

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.710
that were sort of
tattered and dusty.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.380
And so I'm flipping through
all these-- took me forever.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.780
I finally find Yobou Thome.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.240
And I kind of get
to his birthday,

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.890
and I do the math in my head.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.710
And all of a sudden,
I kind of like start.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.027
And I realized that he
wasn't 13 when he tried out

00:20:43.027 --> 00:20:43.860
for Football Dreams.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.565
He was 21.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.530
And I've seen pictures
of him at the tryout.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.090
And he doesn't
necessarily look 13,

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.800
but he doesn't look 21, either.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.910
So the problem was is
that these European scouts

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.089
that went and did the
scouting in Africa,

00:20:58.089 --> 00:20:59.130
I mean, they knew soccer.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.171
They came from Barcelona.

00:21:00.171 --> 00:21:01.140
They came from Espanol.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.490
They came from Atletico Madrid.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.680
So these were guys
who knew the sport.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.080
But they'd never really
scouted in Africa before.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.540
And so they would get
sold a bunch of stories

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.750
by the locals, one of
which was, oh, African

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:17.100
kids just mature a lot
faster than European kids do,

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.824
when actually, the
opposite is often

00:21:18.824 --> 00:21:20.115
true because of malnourishment.

00:21:20.115 --> 00:21:23.100
African kids, on average,
tend to be smaller

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.620
than kids in Europe
of their same age.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.850
But these scouts didn't
really know this.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.110
So they would just get
sold a bill of goods.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.860
And so the players
that they were picking

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.550
were not always as good
as they thought they were.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.250
SPEAKER: And
there's another kind

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.124
of piece to that that
you kind of brought up,

00:21:37.124 --> 00:21:39.780
which is they have the local
coaches that are really

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.624
trying to get them to
become a professional

00:21:41.624 --> 00:21:44.040
so they can take a little bit
of the money, a cut of that.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.490
It seems like there's a little
bit of illicit trade happening.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:48.180
Do you see that?

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.670
Was that a big part
that you uncovered?

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.128
And then what do
you see the soccer

00:21:51.128 --> 00:21:52.362
world doing to combat that?

00:21:52.362 --> 00:21:53.820
SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
Yeah, I mean, it's

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.476
a huge part of that
whole industry there.

00:21:56.476 --> 00:21:58.350
I mean, basically, you'll
have these guys who

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.900
are local coaches--

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.461
I say coaches in quotation
marks because they're not really

00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:03.960
coaches.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.945
They're just local guys from
the neighborhood who might

00:22:06.945 --> 00:22:08.070
have an interest in soccer.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.290
Maybe they played a
little bit themselves.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.050
And they'll sort of prowl
the schoolyards, looking

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:16.990
for the best young kids, and
buy them at a very young age.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.690
And so then they own
their registration.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.710
They own their license.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.410
And so if a club ever wants
to take that kid to Europe,

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.090
they're going to have to buy
that license from that coach.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.380
And that can create some
really difficult situations,

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.360
because the coach's
interests are not always

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.830
the same as the kids' interests.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.440
And one of the players
I write about in my book

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.960
ends up in conflict
because of that.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.530
And there's this big
problem of this sort

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:45.900
of illicit trafficking of young
players from Africa to Europe.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.570
FIFA put in some
rules in the last sort

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.470
of 10 years, 15 years, that
said that players aren't allowed

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.540
to go from Africa
or anywhere else

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.380
to Europe until they're
18, because they've

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.540
been trying to cut down on
this, although it continues

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.140
to happen.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.690
And there's a lot of stories
of kids getting there

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.750
and either tryouts
not materializing

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.004
or them not making it and
ending up living on the street,

00:23:10.004 --> 00:23:11.670
either because they
don't have the money

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.500
to go back or they're
so humiliated because

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.490
their parents spent their whole
savings to get them over there

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.660
that they don't want to go back.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.340
And so there's been an effort
to combat this problem.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.699
But it's definitely
still a big problem.

00:23:25.699 --> 00:23:27.740
SPEAKER: And so part of
what it seems like Aspire

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.870
did to into combat that
is acquired a Belgian club

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.850
as a way to have a
path for these players

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.960
to be professional.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.552
Did you see that that was
a successful practice?

00:23:36.552 --> 00:23:38.010
Or was everyone
still trying to get

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:42.884
to the big European, Barcelona,
Madrid type of clubs?

00:23:42.884 --> 00:23:45.300
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah, the
acquisition of the Belgian club

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.424
was one of the most
interesting parts of the story.

00:23:47.424 --> 00:23:50.241
Because what happened was Josep
Colomer, the Spanish scout,

00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:52.740
he was trying to figure out,
what do I do with these players

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.780
when they finish the
academy at the age of 18.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.000
Because it's very
difficult for most players

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.240
to make the jump from
18 to a top club.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.980
They need more
experience at sort

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.390
of a lower professional level.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.850
And so, when you're
Qatar, you just

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.810
go out and buy a
team for the kids.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.170
And so they went to
Belgium, and they

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.625
bought this little
second division club.

00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:14.430
And it was one of
the most fun parts

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.860
of the research process for me.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:21.150
Because, you can imagine,
this town of 20,000 people,

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.840
Eupen, the residents wake up one
morning and their local team,

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.340
the Pandas, is owned by
some Middle Eastern country

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.780
they've never heard of and
filled with African teenagers.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.480
And so it created quite a
bit of turmoil in the town.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.820
And so I went and spent
several weeks there.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.770
My wife was with me at
the time because she

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:41.510
speaks French and was
able to translate for me.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.330
And it was fun.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.729
We would walk down the street,
and it's the kind of place

00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:46.270
where after you've
been there a week,

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.669
everyone knows who you are.

00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:49.210
And so we would walk
down the street,

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.335
and they'd be waving at
us, calling us Mr. and Mrs.

00:24:51.335 --> 00:24:53.220
Washington, DC.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.221
And you go into a bar,
and you can't buy a beer.

00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:57.678
Like, as soon as you sit down,
there's one in front of you.

00:24:57.678 --> 00:25:00.310
And they just want to talk about
what's going on with the club.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.220
One of the local
supporters' groups

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.000
boycotted the first
year because they

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.102
didn't agree with
Qatar owning the team,

00:25:05.102 --> 00:25:07.560
although, then they discovered
that these African kids were

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.050
a whole lot better than the
players that they had before.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.260
And so they did come around.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.470
But it did end up being
a good jumping-off point

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.219
for some of the kids to
bigger clubs in Europe.

00:25:22.219 --> 00:25:23.760
What ended up being
more of a problem

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.940
is that there was only so much
room on this team in Belgium

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.600
for players.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.922
And so they could only take--

00:25:28.922 --> 00:25:31.380
after the first year, when they
sent a bunch of the players

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.120
there, they could only
take a few players

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.522
per year, the absolute
best of the academy.

00:25:35.522 --> 00:25:37.230
And so there were a
whole bunch of others

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.890
who didn't really have an
established route into Europe.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.590
And so that created a
whole lot of problems.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.170
SPEAKER: So let's talk
about where are they now.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:50.100
Are any of the, I guess, two
dozen that you researched--

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.330
how many have made it?

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.247
And are any playing in
the upcoming World Cup?

00:25:53.247 --> 00:25:55.413
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: So the
ones I focus on in the book,

00:25:55.413 --> 00:25:56.790
they aren't at the World Cup.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.100
Again, they've had varying
degrees of success.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.420
One made it to Barcelona.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.930
One other made it into Europe
sort of at a more middle level.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:08.672
And one had less success and
is actually back in Africa.

00:26:08.672 --> 00:26:11.130
There are a couple of players
from the program in the World

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.656
Cup this summer-- one for
Senegal, and one for Nigeria.

00:26:13.656 --> 00:26:15.030
There would have
been another one

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.730
for Nigeria, a player
who's very good,

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.340
named Henry
Onyekuru, who plays--

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.800
he's owned by Everton,
although he was loaned out

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.104
to Anderlecht last year.

00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:26.520
He was the top scorer in the
Belgian league the first year

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.094
he played in the Belgian league.

00:26:28.094 --> 00:26:29.760
And he'd be in the
World Cup this summer

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.440
but he hurt his knee.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.420
So he's not going to be there.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.120
And so I've definitely--

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.020
I've kept in touch with all
of the boys who I write about.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.510
The one who hasn't
had much success,

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.700
I'm actually trying
to figure out

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.500
a way to help him financially.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.170
I'm paying for his kid's
school fees right now

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.746
and trying to help
him get a job,

00:26:50.746 --> 00:26:52.620
because soccer really
isn't going to work out

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.770
for him at this point.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:58.110
And so that's-- the
difficult thing is, for me,

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.980
one of the most impactful parts
of the story was the players

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.610
who didn't make it, because you
see how difficult it is then.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.880
They get so close to the sun,
and then they fall all the way

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.930
back down to Earth.

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.790
And it can be very
difficult for them

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.180
to figure how to put
their lives back together

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.980
and find a new path forward.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.660
SPEAKER: And what about the
state of Aspire and Football

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.159
Dreams?

00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:21.450
Is it still progressing forward?

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.185
How is it today?

00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:24.060
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: So they
suspended the search

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.180
at the end of 2016.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.930
They said they wanted
to evaluate how it's

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.930
gone for the first 10 years.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.527
They're still running
the academy, both in Doha

00:27:32.527 --> 00:27:34.110
and they also have
a satellite academy

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.429
where they train Football
Dreams kids in Senegal.

00:27:37.429 --> 00:27:38.220
That's still going.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.170
They still have the
club in Belgium.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.350
And so they're still hoping
to produce future superstars

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.220
from the program.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.720
SPEAKER: And now
that you've written

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.950
a book on soccer, what's
your World Cup prediction?

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:50.910
You're an expert now.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:51.780
SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
Yeah, well, I guess

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.402
I have this sort of category
of what I would like to happen

00:27:54.402 --> 00:27:55.860
and then what I
think would happen.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.090
I mean, I'm a big Messi fan.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.962
So I would love to see
him win a World Cup.

00:28:00.962 --> 00:28:02.420
I don't think it's
going to happen.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.220
Their team is not very good
and totally imbalanced.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.720
They have amazing strikers
and not much else.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.110
I think everyone would love
to see Iceland make a run.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.674
It's interesting, Iceland is
about the same size as Qatar

00:28:16.674 --> 00:28:18.340
when you look at the
number of citizens.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.730
So it's incredible that
Iceland produces the stars

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.440
that it does in
Europe and that it's

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.120
made it into the World Cup.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.070
And then another
sort of emotional one

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:31.450
for me is Egypt, because I
lived in Cairo for three years.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.950
And they've been out of
the World Cup for so long

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.500
that it would be wonderful
to see them make a run.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.600
I'm hoping Mohamed
Salah's shoulder

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.810
is OK after the
Champions League final.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.780
And so those are my categories
of who I'd like to win.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.100
Who I think will actually win--

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.160
Brazil's very good.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.130
Germany's very good.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.880
And I think it will probably
be one of those two.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.200
But Belgium is very good.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.190
Spain is very good.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:56.150
France is very good.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.870
So I think it's going
to be a great World Cup.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.936
And I think if it's going to
be a Brazil-Germany final,

00:29:03.936 --> 00:29:05.060
I'd like to see Brazil win.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.240
I know it would be a kind
of collective bit of therapy

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.739
after the last World Cup if they
could they could beat Germany.

00:29:11.739 --> 00:29:13.280
But it will be fun,
whatever happens.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:13.905
SPEAKER: Great.

00:29:13.905 --> 00:29:15.600
So getting away
from the book, you

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.260
were a foreign correspondent
for many years.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.820
I'm sure you saw
some crazy stuff.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.520
What's the wildest story you
have from your time living

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.172
overseas?

00:29:24.172 --> 00:29:26.630
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah, I mean,
it was a lot of crazy times.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.190
Again, I spent a bunch
of time in Afghanistan

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.240
and a bunch of time in
Iraq with the troops.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.360
But probably the most
insane was I spent a month

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.400
with the rebels in
Libya on the front lines

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.710
when they were fighting Gaddafi.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.930
And it was like "Mad Max
and the Thunderdome."

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.730
I mean, these guys,
they didn't really

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.260
know what they were doing.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.110
They'd stripped rocket launchers
and anti-aircraft weapons

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.750
off Soviet attack
helicopters and bolted them

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:54.320
in the back of pickup trucks
and were driving around.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.090
They could never bolt the rocket
launchers on tight enough.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.465
And so when they started
firing, the rockets would--

00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:00.290
it would get loose.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.420
And the rockets would be
firing all over the place.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.780
And you'd be out there, and
all of a sudden, Gaddafi

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.620
would just start firing
artillery at you.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.830
And so the desert
would just erupt

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.210
with artillery shells hitting.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.010
And you'd have to dive
in the back of a car

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.650
and just speed off,
hoping not to get hit.

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:19.250
And so that, for me, was
probably the craziest

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.050
just because it was
so unpredictable.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:21.680
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.160
AUDIENCE: What's up, man?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:22.757
Ricardo.

00:30:22.757 --> 00:30:24.340
Thank you for coming,
definitely going

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.520
to pick up the book as well.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:25.730
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Great.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:26.324
Thanks.

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:27.740
AUDIENCE: Just one
quick comment--

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.320
you didn't mention
Colombia in your favorites.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:35.180
Not offended, but keep them
on your radar, everyone.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.820
One thing that I'm interested
in is understanding

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.660
your perspective in terms of
what kind of role technology

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:46.190
can play in the way that
the game is experienced

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:49.317
in developing worlds and the way
that people are finding talent

00:30:49.317 --> 00:30:50.150
and stuff like that.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.300
Because obviously, Google is
a technology company first,

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.330
and obviously
trying to help out--

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.610
move humanity in the right
direction and everything

00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:59.160
like that.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.630
But I'd just be interested
to hear your take on trends

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.630
that you're seeing and ways
that you envision technology

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.280
potentially being
able to help things

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.734
from a football standpoint.

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:09.650
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.832
That's a good question.

00:31:11.832 --> 00:31:13.790
Yeah, I think it's very
interesting, especially

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.560
from a scouting
perspective, what's

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.450
happening with technology.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.390
I mean, obviously, everybody's
familiar with "Moneyball"

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.820
and the sort of revolution
in data analytics

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.930
when it comes to sports.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.305
Soccer has actually
been somewhat

00:31:25.305 --> 00:31:28.160
of a laggard in that category.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.400
It's sort of dragged its feet
into the data analytics age.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.550
But there's definitely
been progress.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.330
There's a focus on
more useful statistics

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.480
when it comes to games,
things like expected goals,

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.910
expected assists.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.180
But the problem with a
lot of the technology

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:50.390
and the data analytics that's
been done in soccer so far

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.700
is that it was all
very ball-focused.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.160
So it was focused on things
that happened with the ball,

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.400
whether that be goals or
shots or assists or dribbles

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.700
or tackles.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.760
But the reality is
that 99% of what

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.836
happens in a game in soccer
happens off the ball.

00:32:04.836 --> 00:32:06.710
And so if you're not
taking that into account

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.540
when you're doing
your data analysis,

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.660
you're basically missing
the whole ball game--

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.010
pun intended.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.640
And so what they're
starting to do now,

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.520
because they have so
much tracking data

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.710
of both the ball
and the players,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.310
they're starting
to be able to look

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.230
at what's happening
off the ball, which

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.967
is incredibly important.

00:32:25.967 --> 00:32:27.800
And in one of the ways
it's most interesting

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.250
is what I talked about before
in terms of game intelligence.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.470
The ability to make
split-second decisions

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.020
in a dynamic environment
is the hallmark

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.260
of sporting genius in general
and very much in soccer.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.000
And so they're
starting to come up

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.520
with more sophisticated
algorithms using

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.850
all of this tracking
data that can spit out,

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.280
basically, intelligence
scores for players,

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.990
are players making
the right passes,

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.487
the right runs,
the right dribbles,

00:32:52.487 --> 00:32:54.320
given not only what's
happening on the ball,

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.650
but the position of all of
the players around them.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.530
Now, that's only happening at
the very top level right now.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.920
And even then, it's
sort of just starting.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.210
And it's going to take
some time for one,

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.140
them to make the algorithms
more sophisticated

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.150
because it's very
complex, and also

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:15.860
for them to be accepted
by scouts and coaches

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.706
in the sport.

00:33:16.706 --> 00:33:18.080
But eventually,
that will happen.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.420
And eventually, the
technology will become cheaper

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.580
so that it will filter
down to the youth level.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.850
And I think it's going
to be fascinating

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:26.840
when that does happen.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.050
Because I can imagine a
scenario where let's say

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.930
you recreated this same
scouting project some years

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.070
in the future.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.200
And you have a Josep
Colomer figure standing

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.740
on the sidelines who maybe
puts a drone in the air that

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.100
is filming all of
the kids and the ball

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.890
as the game is going
on that then spits out

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:52.730
game intelligence scores to
his iPhone or his Google phone.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:56.644
And he's able to
evaluate right there what

00:33:56.644 --> 00:33:57.810
he's seeing in front of him.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.120
So it will be interesting
to see once we start

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.600
to be able to get quantitative
measurements of game

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.170
intelligence how much of an
impact that has on scouting.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.179
AUDIENCE: Thanks a
lot for the talk.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:13.340
You slightly mentioned about
the kids who went to the academy

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.719
but then didn't make it.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.510
So I was wondering, can you
talk about that a little more,

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:22.659
like what happens with kids
when they return to Africa?

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:25.770
Are there any other programs
they can take part or any clubs

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.690
in Africa?

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:28.920
What happens?

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.520
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah, again,
he made it to the academy

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.150
but then had to
go back to Africa.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.610
And unfortunately, it's
one of the real weaknesses,

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.750
I think, of the program that
there wasn't really much

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.420
for him to go back to.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.305
Most of these kids, they didn't
see playing back home in Africa

00:34:49.305 --> 00:34:51.690
as success.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:55.570
I mean, the best players
in most leagues in Africa

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.230
are earning a few
hundred dollars a month,

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:01.260
which you think about that
compared to what a player will

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.992
earn playing in even the most
low-tier European league,

00:35:05.992 --> 00:35:07.200
it's just absolutely nothing.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.340
So all of them want to travel.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.020
In fact, that's one
of the reasons why

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.436
I called the book
"The Away Game,"

00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:14.040
is because that's
how they view it.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.123
They all want to get away.

00:35:15.123 --> 00:35:17.140
They all want to get
to Europe and play.

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.200
And so when they get back,
they don't necessarily

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.060
want to play in Africa.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.344
Or if soccer just doesn't
work out for them at all,

00:35:24.344 --> 00:35:26.010
they don't really
have much to fall back

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:30.300
on because although they went
to school during the academy,

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.744
education really wasn't
a focus for most of them.

00:35:33.744 --> 00:35:35.160
They admitted
themselves that they

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.410
would use class time
to sleep because they

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.080
were tired from training.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.990
And so unfortunately,
they really

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.510
struggle trying to
find a new way forward.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:49.270
And this isn't necessarily just
a problem with this program.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.170
I mean, a lot of academies
around the world, the kids

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.961
don't really focus
on a plan B enough,

00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:56.460
because they all
think they're going

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.585
to be the ones who make it.

00:35:57.585 --> 00:36:00.166
And you have to have
that self-belief

00:36:00.166 --> 00:36:02.040
if you're going to get
through a process that

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.940
is as competitive as it is to
make it in professional soccer.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.017
But the reality is only a
small percentage of them

00:36:09.017 --> 00:36:09.600
would make it.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.600
And so a lot of
them, they struggle

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.257
to figure out a plan B once
it doesn't happen for them.

00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:18.840
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much for
coming-- really appreciate it.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.995
The book sounds fascinating.

00:36:19.995 --> 00:36:20.995
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Thanks.

00:36:20.995 --> 00:36:23.880
AUDIENCE: I'm really looking
forward to reading it.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.400
So my question is what do
you think about the state

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.130
of African youth soccer?

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.030
If you compare the
talent in Africa

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.790
to the talent in a South
America or a Europe,

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.950
do you think the talent
is at equal levels?

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:39.270
And do you think that there is
a gap in the players making it

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.810
to Europe?

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.970
Is it the scouting?

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.354
At what point in the
pipeline does it break down?

00:36:44.354 --> 00:36:45.270
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.310
That's another good question.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.290
The raw talent is definitely
there, no doubt about it.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.950
It's as good as anything
you'll find anywhere--

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:56.370
South America, anywhere else.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.580
The gap is in the
development system

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.300
for both identifying and
developing young soccer talent.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.250
They don't have and
haven't historically

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:10.270
had the academy infrastructure
that you would see in Europe.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.560
And the club teams
haven't historically

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.780
focused on players much
younger than sort of 15, 16.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.790
You're starting to
see that change now

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.430
with some academies
that have sprouted

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.480
in the last sort of 10 years.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.540
One academy in particular,
called Right to Dream, in Ghana

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.770
is having good success.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.250
And there's others that have
started in that same mold.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.630
And so I think that's
one of the reasons--

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:43.290
Pele famously predicted in 1977
that an African country would

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.480
win the World Cup by 2000.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.730
And that hasn't happened.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.370
The farthest an African team
has gotten is the quarterfinals.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.210
And I think a big problem
is that the problem

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.100
of the lack of
youth development,

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.620
again, because at least
officially, players

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.290
aren't supposed to be going
to Europe until they're 18.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.930
There needs to be a good
development infrastructure

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.470
for them to succeed in Europe
once they reach the age of 18.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:09.690
And that hasn't existed.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.900
I think as you have with
a lot of different sectors

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.320
in Africa, not just soccer,
lack of resources and corruption

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.880
is a big problem as well.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.450
You often see teams get to
the World Cup from Africa.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.120
And then players are boycotting
because they're not getting

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.890
paid what they promised.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.840
And it can just be real mayhem.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.160
And it can impact their
performance on the world stage.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.890
And so that's been a
big problem as well.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:38.060
AUDIENCE: So I think
I'm one of the 99.5%.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:42.950
I played international soccer as
a kid, played in the Milk Cup.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:46.370
The question I have is when
you go through the evaluation

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.536
process where there's five
million kids through the years,

00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:51.410
a lot of the tools that
we have and metrics--

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.660
and everybody at Google
knows about metrics--

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.950
are about the physical, right?

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:56.480
So the drone stuff's
already there.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.200
We've already got the heart
rate monitors, we got already.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.450
But in my own experience--

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:02.450
I'm still involved here.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:07.310
I coach at Ehrenbern, and
the difference can sometimes

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.920
be emotional intelligence.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.900
Was there any part
of the process

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.230
through that kind of
vast number of kids

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.920
that actually looked at
that, or was the focus purely

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.600
on the physical?

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.460
SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
So in this program,

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.870
they didn't focus on emotional
intelligence or personality

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.300
in any structured way.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.350
It was a more informal thing
of spending time with the kids.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:37.250
But there are attempts at
some of the top academies

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.010
to look at emotional
intelligence and personality.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:45.860
And so for example,
at Manchester City,

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.900
there's a woman
named Carol Dweck,

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.960
who was at Stanford, who
did a lot of research

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.140
on what she called the
growth mindset in children.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.660
Sort of basically does a
child have a growth mindset

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.160
or a fixed mindset?

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.090
Growth mindset means that you
don't think your abilities are

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.340
sort of fixed in stone.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.610
You think you can develop
them with hard work over time.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.300
And she's found that kids
with a growth mindset

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.035
tend to do better in school,
tend to have better jobs,

00:40:14.035 --> 00:40:15.840
have better outcomes.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.870
And so they actually have
a test at Manchester City

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.830
when they've been testing
kids for growth mindset.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:22.880
Now, it's early days.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.070
They say they've
had some success

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.710
in seeing a correlation
between players

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.750
who are shown from
this test to have

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.650
a growth mindset and the ones
who succeed in the academy.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.330
So that's one attempt.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.100
There have been
attempts by researchers

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.750
to look at a much sort of
broader array of personality

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:45.890
variables to try and
figure out what impact they

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:47.570
have on player success.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.460
And they've been
able to identify

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.520
a bunch of different variables
that have an impact on success.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.940
But any one of them only
measures kind of 1% to 2%.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.080
And so personality is
such a complex thing

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.560
that I don't think they've
been able to isolate

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.360
one part of emotional
intelligence

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.210
that's going to really tell
them whether a kid's going

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.750
to make it.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.400
But there was another
interesting study

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.980
that was done in Australia,
where they looked at grit.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.370
Grit is another one of
these personality traits

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.080
that's been shown,
not just in soccer

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.910
but in a lot of
other facets in life,

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.080
that grittier kids
tend to succeed.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.850
And they found
that with players,

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.560
that the grittier
players tend to play

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.030
more when they're young.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.920
They tend to acquire
more game intelligence

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.211
and tend to be more successful.

00:41:32.211 --> 00:41:35.780
But again, it's just one
component of personality.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.470
Now, maybe as things like
advanced brain imaging

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.020
and things like that
become more powerful,

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.020
they'll be able to isolate it
in a way that's actually more

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.710
useful for decision-making.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.280
But I think right
now, they haven't

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.780
been able to do
it in a way that's

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.140
quantitative enough for them
to really kind of use it

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.985
as a filter for these kids.

00:41:55.985 --> 00:41:57.860
I think that the coaches
still think the best

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.780
way to do it is just
spend time with a kid

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.880
and see how they
react to failure,

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.980
see how they react to difficult
situations on and off the field

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.504
and go by that.

00:42:07.504 --> 00:42:09.170
AUDIENCE: So there's
no immediate impact

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.324
to the NFL draft anytime soon?

00:42:11.324 --> 00:42:12.740
SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
I don't think so.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.573
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:14.925
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah.

00:42:14.925 --> 00:42:16.640
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for the talk.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.840
So I have actually
two questions.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.420
One is, so it sounds like you
don't think this Qatar endeavor

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.470
experiment was a full success.

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.210
Or it could have been
a bigger success.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.830
So the first question
is, what do you

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.689
think that Qatar got wrong?

00:42:29.689 --> 00:42:31.355
And for example, would
the same endeavor

00:42:31.355 --> 00:42:33.970
have been more successful
if it was conducted, say,

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.650
in a European country, right?

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:42.020
And the second question is,
if you can comment on doping.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.820
Is there any doping
at these ages?

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.350
Do you have any--

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.070
what's the part of kind
of chemical supplements

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.290
in this part of the picture?

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:53.860
Does it come in into
these early ages?

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.180
Is it coming into
the picture later--

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.507
if you can comment on this.

00:42:57.507 --> 00:43:00.090
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Yeah, so I'll
take the second question first.

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.870
I don't think
doping is an issue,

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:07.070
at least with this kind of youth
scouting in Africa, it's not--

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.400
at least I never heard of it.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.120
I don't think there would
be really the resources

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.850
to do a sort of sophisticated
doping program anyways.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.260
In terms of the
first question, I

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.630
think they got a
couple of things wrong.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:25.410
I think, one, the age
issue is a big one.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.430
And I focus on the players at
the beginning of the program

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.450
that they found.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:33.390
I'm not actually sure how much
better they got over time.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.000
It may be that they got
much better over time

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.520
at determining players' ages.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.280
But at least in terms of
the ones I focused on,

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.060
I think that was a
big handicap for them.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.400
Because again, if
you're not picking

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.672
kids who are the age
you think they are,

00:43:48.672 --> 00:43:50.630
then they're not as good
as you think they are.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.640
And it doesn't necessarily
mean they won't succeed.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.910
But it means that there
is a smaller probability

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.800
that they're going to succeed.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.750
I think the other
thing that if I

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:02.480
were designing a program
like this and your outcome

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.800
was really just--

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.120
or your goal was really just
to produce star players--

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.416
they should have taken
more than 20 every year.

00:44:11.416 --> 00:44:13.040
They should have
maybe spent less money

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.820
on sending the kids to
Europe to play and to Qatar

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.000
to go train at the academy
there, and just take

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.260
more kids into the program.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.980
Because if you talk
to sport scientists,

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.190
they're often quite critical
of talent identification

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:29.840
at a young age in
soccer, because it's

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.910
so difficult to choose which
players have the potential.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.740
They say that it's
better to keep

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.690
as many kids in the
system as possible

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.630
for a long period of time so
that they can weed them out

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:42.197
over time.

00:44:42.197 --> 00:44:44.030
And there has been some
interesting research

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:45.770
on the German youth
national team,

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:49.640
where they found that,
on average, every year,

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.310
there's about 40% turnover in
the German youth national team.

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:55.430
So that shows you
that there is a lot

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:57.470
of changing opinions
about which players

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:58.940
they think are the best players.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.460
They also found that
the younger you make it

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.650
on the team, the
lower your probability

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.720
that you make it
to the senior team.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.930
And so the kids who they
think the best over time

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.010
are going to change.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:11.870
And so the only
way to really deal!

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:14.990
With that is to have more kids
in the system and to let them

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.080
be weeded out over time.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.080
SPEAKER: Well, thanks,
everyone, for being here.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.410
Sebastian, thank you for coming.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:20.330
SEBASTIAN ABBOT:
Thanks for having me.

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:22.121
SPEAKER: We have copies
of "The Away Game."

00:45:22.121 --> 00:45:24.400
And Sebastian will be
signing at the end.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400
SEBASTIAN ABBOT: Thanks.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.250
[APPLAUSE]
