Jersey I'm in an honor to the class I

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
Jersey I'm in an honor to the class I
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.830
Jersey I'm in an honor to the class I
have a question for you since the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
have a question for you since the
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.080
have a question for you since the
universe is constantly expanding do you

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
universe is constantly expanding do you
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.160
universe is constantly expanding do you
think that we would be able to have

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
think that we would be able to have
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.320
think that we would be able to have
people another planet earth becomes

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
people another planet earth becomes
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.060
people another planet earth becomes
overpopulated we look forward to your

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
overpopulated we look forward to your
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.080
overpopulated we look forward to your
response so Jill is asking about whether

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
response so Jill is asking about whether
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.849
response so Jill is asking about whether
there are possibilities of people on

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
there are possibilities of people on
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.370
there are possibilities of people on
other planets and how that relates to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
other planets and how that relates to
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380
other planets and how that relates to
the expanding universe well from the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390
the expanding universe well from the
 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.939
the expanding universe well from the
expanding universe we just know that the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
expanding universe we just know that the
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.589
expanding universe we just know that the
universe is very large and that there

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
universe is very large and that there
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.999
universe is very large and that there
are many places that people could in

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
are many places that people could in
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.819
are many places that people could in
principle live on the other hand we also

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
principle live on the other hand we also
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770
principle live on the other hand we also
know because the universe is very large

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
know because the universe is very large
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.049
know because the universe is very large
that it's very hard to go from one star

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
that it's very hard to go from one star
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.690
that it's very hard to go from one star
to another and we don't have any way

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
to another and we don't have any way
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.520
to another and we don't have any way
that we thought of that's a serious

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
that we thought of that's a serious
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.639
that we thought of that's a serious
possibility for interstellar travel so

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
possibility for interstellar travel so
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.520
possibility for interstellar travel so
that means we have to just look at the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
that means we have to just look at the
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.049
that means we have to just look at the
planets that are here in our own solar

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
planets that are here in our own solar
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939
planets that are here in our own solar
system they're not very far away but

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
system they're not very far away but
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.130
system they're not very far away but
they're still hard to get to we've been

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
they're still hard to get to we've been
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380
they're still hard to get to we've been
to the moon which is pretty close by we

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
to the moon which is pretty close by we
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.479
to the moon which is pretty close by we
have not yet put a human being on Mars

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
have not yet put a human being on Mars
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.000
have not yet put a human being on Mars
which is the next best place to get to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
which is the next best place to get to
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.609
which is the next best place to get to
and so it's really hard so I think the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
and so it's really hard so I think the
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.469
and so it's really hard so I think the
short answer is although the universe is

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
short answer is although the universe is
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.880
short answer is although the universe is
large and there are many places where

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
large and there are many places where
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160
large and there are many places where
people could in principle live that is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
people could in principle live that is
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780
people could in principle live that is
so large that we can't get there from

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
so large that we can't get there from
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.380
so large that we can't get there from
here so that means we're not going to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
here so that means we're not going to
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480
here so that means we're not going to
have a solution for over population on

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
have a solution for over population on
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.660
have a solution for over population on
this planet by going someplace else so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
this planet by going someplace else so
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.940
this planet by going someplace else so
I'm sorry to disappoint you about that

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
I'm sorry to disappoint you about that
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.030
I'm sorry to disappoint you about that
this is a really hard problem
