00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.500
Materials matter.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.769
You wouldn’t want to make a stop sign out
of candle wax or a bench out of chocolate.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.610
Neither would be able to hold up to the weather
outside, and things would get quite sticky 
rather fast.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.640
So if you’re going to create things and
solve problems, you’re going to need the
right supplies.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.840
The right materials.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.060
And two of the three main types of materials
you’ll encounter as an engineer are metals
and ceramics.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:34.440
[Theme Music]

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.240
Engineering, like life, is about choices.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.380
For example: some people decide to get braces
to straighten their teeth.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.440
But choosing to wear braces isn’t as simple
as a yes or a no: there are many different
kinds to pick from.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.800
Two of the most common are braces with traditional
metal brackets, and ceramic ones.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.700
There’s not always an obviously correct
choice: picking the right type of braces is all
about weighing the pros and cons.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.620
That’s true whether you’re the person
wearing them or the engineer designing them.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.710
So to make a good choice, you need to know
more about each material.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.480
As a budding engineer – and, like, a person
in the world – you probably already have a
decent idea of what metals are.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.280
They’re in our cars, our buildings, and
many of the devices we use every day.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.640
And you may have already worked with ceramics,
or at least have had them in your home.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.820
Pottery is usually the first example that comes to mind, but you can also find ceramics in many other things, like
bricks, windows, and even electronics.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.540
So metals and ceramics are definitely common.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.280
But working with them isn’t always easy.
Or simple.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.060
There’s a lot that has to happen before
you get your final product!

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.500
For example, imagine what it would actually
take to make a set of brackets for braces.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.480
Before making anything, you have to get the
material that you’re using, which often starts
out as ore that we mine.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.060
Ore is a type of naturally occurring rock
that contains certain elements or minerals.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.360
Once you get ore, you can extract the elements
you want from it.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.700
Then, through processes like casting or
forging, you can make that material into a
more-usable bulk form.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.420
A common example is an ingot, which is usually
a bar of a pure metal, like the bars of gold you see
in old Westerns or in Skyrim.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.300
You can then take those bulk materials and
form them into stock shapes, like sheets,
tubes, or even powders.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.780
That’s what you might find at your local
hardware or home improvement store.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.820
But then, to get your final product, you need
to turn those stock shapes into a preliminary
version of your braces.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.800
Even once you have that, and make any necessary
changes to the design, the braces still need to go
through a cleaning process,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.380
be checked by quality control, and then
packaged up before they can be used or sold.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.040
That’s a lot of steps, and those are just the
basic ones.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.820
In real life, there are even more.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.060
Not to mention the time and effort it took
to pick the right materials, design the brackets,
and make sure they fit well.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.880
You wouldn’t want to get all the way to
the end and then find out they’re just going
to snap in half!

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.320
That’s why it’s so important to understand
the properties of the materials you’re using.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.640
Most metals share a few common properties.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.120
They tend to conduct heat and electricity
well.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.980
Many are malleable, or easy to shape
without breaking, and ductile, or easy to
stretch and deform.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.360
Put another way, materials that are made from
metals are relatively strong and stiff, but also
resistant to fracture.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.460
This makes them good for building structures!

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.620
Metals also typically reflect light well,
which is what makes them shiny.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.740
That might not be the best if you don’t
want your braces to be so noticeable.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.000
It just depends on what’s most important
to you – brackets that are less noticeable,
or ones that are less likely to break.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.160
If you decide to use metal in a design, for
braces or anything else, there are lots of
different kinds to choose from.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.680
In fact, about three quarters of all known
chemical elements are metals.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.720
Common metals that we find here on Earth are
aluminum – or aluminium as we say back home!
– iron, potassium, and magnesium.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.660
But often, these metals aren’t used by themselves
– they’re added to an alloy,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.960
a metallic material composed of more than one element,
with at least one of those elements being a metal.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.500
Steel is a good example – it’s an iron
alloy.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.290
It’s primarily iron, but it also includes
a bit of carbon mixed in.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.840
Sometimes there are other elements like
chromium or nickel thrown in there too,
depending on the type of steel.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.880
But why not just use the iron itself?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.340
Why go through the trouble of making steel,
or any alloy for that matter?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.300
It’s because alloys have different, and
often better, properties than the individual
elements they’re made from.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.940
For instance, steel tends to have better impact
resistance than iron.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.640
And it’s far more resistant to rust and
corrosion – especially stainless steel.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.280
So you’d want to choose stainless steel over iron
for projects where corrosion would be a problem,

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.740
like for the exhaust pipe in a car or a
replacement joint like an artificial hip.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.180
A big reason that metals and alloys are the
way they are is because their chemical structure
is more free-spirited.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.230
The bonds within metals and metallic materials leave a
large number of electrons that aren’t bound to particular
atoms and can move from one atom to another.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.220
That’s known as the free-electron theory
of metals.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.680
It’s like these free electrons can move
as a group though the metal itself.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.280
This explains why some metallic materials
are so good at conducting heat and electricity
– especially simpler metals.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.920
Their electrons can more easily carry that
energy from one place in the metal to the other.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.860
So, metals have a lot of positives.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.500
But they definitely aren’t right for everything,
which is where something like ceramic might
come in.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.360
Ceramics are compounds that aren’t completely
metallic, but they don’t have carbon atoms bonded
in a way that would make them organic, either.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.740
You can define glass materials the same way,
so a lot of people include them in the same 
general category.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.200
The main difference between glass and other
ceramics is in their chemistry.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.920
Ceramics are usually crystalline, which means their
molecules are more ordered, whereas the molecules
in various types of glass are more random.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:33.640
But no matter how they’re organized, the molecules in
both ceramics and glasses are made up of at least one
metallic element, plus at least one non-metallic element.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.460
They often include oxygen, nitrogen, or carbon.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.060
Common examples include aluminum oxide, better
known as rust,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.480
and silicon carbide, which can form a very hard
material that’s used to make everything from
car brakes to bulletproof vests.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.320
And, of course, there are the more traditional ceramics
that most people think of, like cement, or compounds
made up of of clay materials, like porcelain.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.520
In general, ceramics are relatively stiff
and strong and often very hard.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.440
In this way, they’re similar to metals.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.590
But they’re also extremely brittle and can
fracture very easily.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.760
Which doesn’t sound too good if you’re
gonna have them on your teeth for a few years.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.400
Ceramics are also usually insulators, so
they don’t conduct heat and electricity well –
although there are some that do.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.100
And they tend to be more resistant to
extreme temperatures and harsh environments
than metals and polymers are.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.980
But while most ceramic materials have similar
properties, there are differences.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.400
We could spend hours going through all the
different types of ceramics out there, but
there are a few major ones.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.810
Glass-ceramic materials, or materials whose
chemistry falls between a glass and other ceramics,
are relatively strong and don’t melt easily when heated.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.460
They also tend to be biologically compatible.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.980
And they make good insulators, which is why
they’re commonly used in electronic packaging
applications.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.920
Plus, they can be completely transparent.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.880
Perhaps one of the biggest appeals of glass-ceramic
materials is how easily you can fabricate them.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.640
You can use conventional glass-forming techniques,
and you end up with a product that’s nearly pore-free,
which is great for handling liquids.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.800
So glass-ceramics are really useful!

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.560
But sometimes you want something a little
simpler. Like clay.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.960
Clay is inexpensive and commonly found in
nature.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.720
You can often use it as-is after mining it,
meaning that you don’t need to waste time
or resources on refinement.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.640
And it’s super easy to work with.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.820
If you’ve ever taken a pottery class, you know that
clay and water, when mixed in the proper proportions,
forms a material that’s easy to shape.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.180
Put that through a kiln, and you’ve got
something great for mugs and dishes!

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.000
For something a little sturdier, you might
try using cement.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.120
It’s mainly used as a binder to help hold
concrete together,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.760
which means you can find it everywhere from
roads, dams, and buildings, to more decorative
applications like patios and staircases.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.920
One big benefit of using cement is that it
can set at room temperature.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.260
Imagine if you had to break out some big flamethrower
every time you wanted to pave a new road!

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.000
So yeah, you could say cement’s properties
make it an important part of our lives.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.240
Ceramics and metals also show up in places you might
not expect them, like with microelectromechanical
systems, or MEMS.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:58.190
These are miniature smart systems that use tiny
sensors to collect information by measuring things like
mechanical, thermal, chemical, or optical properties.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:06.180
They then use the information to make decisions that
tell devices called microactuators to do something, like
move a fluid or redirect a beam of light.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:11.220
A major application of MEMS these days
is something you probably know pretty well:
the accelerometer.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.220
For example, there’s one in your phone to
detect its movement.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.420
And cars have accelerometers that trigger
airbags to deploy during a crash.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:26.190
Compared to older and more conventional airbag
systems, ones that use MEMS are smaller, lighter,
more reliable, and quite a bit cheaper to produce.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.620
And with something as important and life-saving
as an airbag, those are big benefits!

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.600
So, there’s a lot to consider when choosing
between materials.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.820
For a set of braces, metal brackets tend to
be more durable and are better at correcting
severely unaligned teeth,

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.600
while ceramics tend to irritate the mouth
less and aren’t as visible.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.680
And then there are your personal preferences,
which also matter.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.140
Other factors, like time, resources, and design
limitations, might also influence your designs
in the field.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.900
It’s all about finding materials with the
properties that make them the best fit for
want you want to accomplish.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:04.100
So today we learned more about two of the
three main types of materials that we use
as engineers: metals and ceramics.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.940
We saw the properties of metals and how we
often use them as alloys in our designs.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.600
Then we went over ceramics and the importance
of clay, cement, and glass-ceramic materials.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.840
Finally, we talked about the applications
of our materials with microelectromechanical
systems and accelerometers.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:25.560
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll learn
about the third main type of material that we’ll
encounter as engineers: polymers.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.360
Crash Course Engineering is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.
