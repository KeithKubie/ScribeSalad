Every topic, whether it be a note,
question, or

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.680
poll, allows followups down below.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.440
You can reply to a topic
by clicking here, or

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.930
reply to a followup by clicking below.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.980
If the topic is a question,
you can also edit the student answer.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.456
This is a collaborative wiki,

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:19.310
where students can put together
an answer to the question.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.150
So if you're providing the one
right answer to a question,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.020
you may want to add it here.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.470
If you're just posting
a further question or

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.009
a general suggestion that isn't
necessarily the one right answer,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.810
it might be better to
post it as a followup.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.130
&gt;&gt; One of Piazza's interesting features
is that instructors can endorse

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.690
student answer.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.150
As an instructor one of my favorite
experiences is signing on to Piazza,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.940
seeing a bunch of open questions,
but being able to go through and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.350
just endorse student answers.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.790
Because students have already answered
the questions for each other.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.430
It's much more satisfying to me to
see students answering each other's'

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.300
questions and helping each other out,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.540
rather than everyone relying on
the instructors and TAs for everything.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.210
With the kinds of students and the kinds
of classes we have in the OMS program,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.790
I never hesitate to say that I
think you'll learn more from your

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.730
classmates than you'll
ever learn from us.
