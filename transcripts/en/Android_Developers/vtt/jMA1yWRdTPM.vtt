Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.000
My name is Reto Meier, and
welcome to This Week in

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.600
Android Development for
February 5, 2013.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.790
It's been a while since the
last This Week in Android

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.390
Development.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.700
But just because we haven't been
recording video updates

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.390
doesn't mean we haven't been
hard at work creating new

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.010
Android developer resources.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.140
So, like the 49ers after
a power blackout, we're

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.450
returning stronger than ever.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.950
And there'll be no
holding us back.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.565
Since you last saw us, there's
been two updates to Google

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.800
Play services, including the
long-awaited update to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.620
MapView, support for vector
maps, pan and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.530
tilt, and map fragments.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.010
We also launched DevBytes with
the first six episodes of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850
these five-minute video
tutorials featuring the many

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.740
moods of Chet Haas.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.960
You can find them all
at bit.ly/DevBytes.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.440
Android Developers Live was
in hiatus over the holiday

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.130
period, but we're back with
Roman, Adam, and Nick kicking

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.490
off 2013 with their second
Android Design in Action

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.170
Hangout last week.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.010
Ian Ni-Lewis and a lesser
version of Louis Theroux

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.620
launched the Pure Android
collection on last Friday's

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.610
App Clinic, with apps Tasks and
Pattrn the first inductees

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.760
granted admission into
this exclusive club.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.800
In Android Developers Live this
week, Nick, Roman, and

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.805
Adam are back for another
Android Design in Action, with

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.230
a look at soccer apps and a
deep dive into creating

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.270
distinctive launcher icons.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.990
Our European advocates are back
on Wednesday for their

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.030
first half-hour Office Hours.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.130
And tune in to ADL+ live from
Sydney, with special focus on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.780
analytics featuring Raj from
the Adwords DevRel team.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.810
Finally on Friday, Ian and a
less talented version of Muse

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.740
front man Matthew Bellamy will
host an App Clinic dedicated

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.150
to soccer team tracking apps
FotMob, Sporee, and Game Plan.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.120
Are any good enough to
be Pure Android?

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.010
Tune in and find out.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.420
If you'd like the opportunity to
get near enough a developer

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.020
advocate to smell our passion
for app development, join Dr.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.930
Fibonacci as he presents Storm
live at the London Android

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.120
User Group on February 7.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.740
In app releases and updates
this week, we saw a new

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.140
release from "USA Today," Steve
Jackson's House of Hell,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.560
an update from clothes store
H&amp;M, and a new tablet app

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.009
update for HealthTap.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.050
That's all for This Week
in Android Development.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.720
We look forward to you joining
us for our many

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.920
live shows this week.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.930
And remember, a gloomy December
will brighten by May,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.100
and you're on your way.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.390
My name is Reto Meier.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.640
Thanks for watching.
