how play figures in your research I came

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680

to do my PhD in with Andre in 1999 and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
to do my PhD in with Andre in 1999 and
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.389
to do my PhD in with Andre in 1999 and
at first for me it was just an

at first for me it was just an
 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.670
at first for me it was just an
opportunity to work in in some other lab

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680
opportunity to work in in some other lab
 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.370

but I was so fascinated with the style

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380
but I was so fascinated with the style

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.850
lab that I worked with him in the cell
in the same lab since then and it's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860
in the same lab since then and it's
 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.430

really important that you an Android

doing something like your PhD supervisor

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209
doing something like your PhD supervisor

you go just along the straight railway

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090
you go just along the straight railway
 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.330
you go just along the straight railway
line that's boring

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
line that's boring
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.670
line that's boring
so it doesn't keep you involved doesn't

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
so it doesn't keep you involved doesn't
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.850
so it doesn't keep you involved doesn't
keep you interested so during this work

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
keep you interested so during this work
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.570
keep you interested so during this work
you try to make it more fun more

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
you try to make it more fun more
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.490
you try to make it more fun more
interest try to new direction step left

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
interest try to new direction step left
 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.960
interest try to new direction step left
step right no problem at all

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
