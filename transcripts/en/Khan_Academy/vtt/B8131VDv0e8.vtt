00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.038
- [Voiceover] Hello Grammarians,

00:00:01.038 --> 00:00:02.863
we're talking about irregular verbs.

00:00:02.863 --> 00:00:04.693
That is to say that
verbs that aren't formed

00:00:04.693 --> 00:00:06.033
like regular verbs.

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.843
And to give you a taste of
what regular verbs look like,

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:11.613
just as a refresher,
let's take the word walk.

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:13.523
Let's put it in the present tense.

00:00:13.523 --> 00:00:15.673
Now normally under normal circumstances,

00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:18.643
we'd wanna just add an ed to it

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.036
in order to form the simple past tense.

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:23.488
So we go from walk to walked.

00:00:23.488 --> 00:00:25.761
We add this ed ending.

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.313
And it turns out that there
are a lot of irregular verbs

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:30.363
that also behave the same way.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:33.346
When we make the past tense
we have this ed sound.

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:34.993
It's just that they're not represented

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.923
that way in the spelling.

00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:38.243
I'll give you an example.

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:41.743
The present tense form of
the word to sleep is sleep.

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:43.679
And when we put it in past tense

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.682
it is not sleeped but slept.

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:49.069
The pt part of slept

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.941
does the same work as the ed
ending, for the regular plural.

00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:56.443
So sleep becomes slept,

00:00:56.443 --> 00:00:59.633
is the same as walk becomes walked.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:03.693
Likewise keep becomes
kept, build becomes built,

00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:07.563
spend becomes spent, leave becomes left,

00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:12.249
leap becomes leapt and lose becomes lost.

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:14.513
So although these verbs
are all irregular verbs,

00:01:14.513 --> 00:01:17.343
within their irregularity,
at least in this case

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:21.117
there is some common distinctions.

00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:25.223
They're all still trying to
make the same sound as walked,

00:01:25.223 --> 00:01:28.251
it just displays differently.

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.486
So it's not sleeped but slept,

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:34.497
not keeped but kept,
not builded but built,

00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:38.386
not spended but spent,
not leaved but left,

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:43.243
not leaped but leapt, not losed but lost.

00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:47.366
At least as it applies to
modern standard English.

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:50.523
And that my friends is the funky ed.

00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:51.803
You can learn anything.

00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:52.919
David out.
