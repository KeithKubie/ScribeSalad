00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.429
Think of all the food made
in the world each year.

00:00:17.453 --> 00:00:18.677
Hard to picture?

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:21.403
Then, imagine that you
are all of humanity,

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:22.856
and on a plate in front of you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.399
is the one lovely annual
meal you make for yourself.

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:29.185
You did all sorts of work putting
that meal on your table.

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:31.836
You must be eager to consume
the fruits of your labor.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.683
And the vegetables

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:33.267
and meats

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:35.406
and waffles of your labor, too, right?

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.973
Well, oddly enough, a third of that meal

00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:39.656
ends up in the trash.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.511
A third of the food we eat globally,

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:47.071
an estimated 1.3 billion tons

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:49.358
ends up as waste.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.353
All the work we put into producing
that food is wasted.

00:00:52.377 --> 00:00:54.773
And what's worse, it costs us.

00:00:54.797 --> 00:00:56.635
America alone spends an estimated

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.748
165 billion dollars a year

00:00:59.772 --> 00:01:01.377
managing food waste.

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:02.255
We're wasting food,

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:03.028
energy,

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:04.413
and money.

00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:05.396
Perhaps worst of all,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.437
we're wasting the chance to change,

00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:10.740
to make the system of food
consumption more efficient.

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:12.479
If you want to bring on that change,

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:13.932
you should know about a humble

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:16.626
yet diligent and ever-so-crucial ally:

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.123
the worm.

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:19.790
Worms convert organic waste

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:23.334
and other compostable products
into natural fertilizers.

00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:26.070
Up to 75% of what we put
in the waste stream

00:01:26.094 --> 00:01:28.488
can become food and bedding material

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.313
for vermicomposting.

00:01:30.337 --> 00:01:32.469
You can create a worm bin in your own home

00:01:32.493 --> 00:01:35.197
to see the composting process in action.

00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.690
First off, you need worms

00:01:36.714 --> 00:01:38.475
and not your typical earthworms.

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:39.768
You need redworms,

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:41.626
eisenia foetida,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.174
the species responsible for most

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:45.365
vermicomposting in North America.

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.647
These red wigglers are surface dwellers

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.034
who don't burrow too deep,

00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:51.577
they're optimal feeders
around room temperature,

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:54.246
and they're well-suited
to converting organic waste

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.998
into usable fertilizer.

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:58.125
Now, your worms might be vermin,

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.586
but they need a comfortable
space to live and work:

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.649
some bedding materials,

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:03.340
either shredded paper or cardboard,

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:04.319
some moisture,

00:02:04.343 --> 00:02:06.079
and, of course, food,

00:02:06.103 --> 00:02:07.926
mainly, your leftovers,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.428
slightly decomposed table scraps.

00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:12.097
The worms break down food waste

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.485
and other organic matter into castings,

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.935
a fancy synonym for worm poop.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.022
Their excrement is absolutely
teeming with microbes,

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:22.063
which continue the decomposition process,

00:02:22.087 --> 00:02:24.481
making all those once-wasted nutrients

00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:26.868
available again as fertilizer.

00:02:26.892 --> 00:02:28.954
The timeline for the whole process varies

00:02:28.978 --> 00:02:30.645
depending on the quantity of worms,

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:31.457
the temperature,

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:34.086
and how much waste is added to the bin.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.080
And there's another timeline to consider.

00:02:36.104 --> 00:02:37.873
In a healthy worm-bin habitat,

00:02:37.897 --> 00:02:39.863
worm reproduction will occur

00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:42.154
when the wigglers become sexually mature,

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:44.330
indicated by an elongation of the segments

00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:46.048
into a bulbous structure.

00:02:46.072 --> 00:02:47.883
Three-month old wigglers can produce

00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:51.977
two to three semi-translucent
yellow worm cocoons a week.

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:53.811
You thought only moths and butterflies

00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:55.057
come out of cocoons?

00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:57.233
Well, we can't all be majestic.

00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:00.333
It takes around 11 weeks
for new babies to hatch.

00:03:00.357 --> 00:03:03.315
When your bin seems to be full
of living vermicelli noodles,

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.578
it's time to share
the bounty with your friends

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.773
and start a vermicompost club.

00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:09.529
Or keep those worms to yourself

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:11.165
and start a business.

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.783
Vermicomposting isn't confined

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:14.682
only to small worm bins,

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:17.508
it's an emerging
entrepreneurial enterprise.

00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:18.961
Large-scale facilities convert

00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:21.257
bulk organic waste and even manure

00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:24.515
into rich, black castings
called black gold.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.328
Its value as a soil
additive is unparalleled,

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:30.410
and it can help plants
resist harmful pathogens.

00:03:30.434 --> 00:03:32.768
The lack of available land
in urban environments,

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:35.711
coupled with growing interest
in smaller-scale farming

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:38.303
means there is a market
for vermicomposting.

00:03:38.327 --> 00:03:39.930
Many communities use composting

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:42.093
as part of zero-waste strategies,

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:44.356
and they can sell
their worm-eaten table scraps

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.854
to local farms, hungry
for rich fertilizer.

00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:48.408
So, instead of wasting money,

00:03:48.432 --> 00:03:50.560
dumping wasted food in landfills,

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:52.859
we can remake waste into an asset,

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:54.598
putting it back into our food system

00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:56.315
to make it more sustainable,

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.177
all with the help of the humble worm,

00:03:58.201 --> 00:03:59.861
the tiny organism that can help us

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:02.628
change the way we look
at food's place in our lives

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:04.541
and our place in the world,

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:06.137
as long as we give the little guy

00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.375
a place at our table.

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:09.606
Well, not an actual seat at the table.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.266
A bin in the shed is fine.
