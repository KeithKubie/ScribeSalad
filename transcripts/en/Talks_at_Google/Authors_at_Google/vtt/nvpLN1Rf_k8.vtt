FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello,
and welcome everybody

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.910
to today's "Authors
at Google Talk."

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.590
Today, we are incredibly excited
to welcome Marcia Reynolds.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.740
MARCIA REYNOLDS: Thank you.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.656
FEMALE SPEAKER: To talk
to us about her latest

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:13.590
book, "The Discomfort
Zone: How Leaders

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.129
Turn Difficult Conversations
Into Breakthroughs."

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.210
So, welcome Marcia.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.400
We're looking forward
to hearing from you.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.358
MARCIA REYNOLDS: Great.

00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:21.900
Thanks.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.330
So what I'd like to propose
and demonstrate for you today

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.340
is the concept that
the best leaders

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.042
make us feel unsure
of ourselves.

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:34.375
Now, I know that might sound
a little counter intuitive.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:38.210
Because don't we like it when
leaders, or anyone, makes

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.260
us feel good about
ourselves and what we do?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.840
But there are
those moments where

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.400
we get really stuck
in our thinking.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.630
And we all do.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.010
And we see things a certain way.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.270
And it's very difficult for
us to see other possibilities.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.780
Or those times when we just
kind of resist new ideas

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.769
or doing something, not
even sure why we resist.

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.810
But we do it in a way,
then, that we can't really

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.990
evaluate what's right
and wrong in a situation.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.790
In those moments
is when a leader

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.550
can say something and ask
a question that truly makes

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.200
a stop, and think,
about how we think.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.280
It's in those moments
of uncertainty

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.380
to where we're actually
most open to learning.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.060
It's in those moments
of uncertainty

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.940
where we can actually see,
what is my blind spot,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.080
and the source of my resistance?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.990
That even though
when I see them,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.600
I may not feel comfortable.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.680
I might not even be happy.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.220
I might feel a
little embarrassed.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.130
I might be sad that I
hadn't seen this before.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.280
I might even be angry.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.075
But then I grow.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.880
So if you were to recall
a time in your life

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.020
when maybe somebody
said something to you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.500
that changed your life.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.150
What was it they said that
truly made you see yourself

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.420
and the world in an
entirely different way?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.370
What did they say?

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.100
And how did you feel?

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.530
I mean, maybe it was a parent.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.560
Maybe it was a teacher that
made you raise your hand.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.960
Or that grumpy
neighbor that made

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.920
you realize you
were being a jerk.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.510
Or a sports coach, a friend,
maybe it even was a manager.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.520
What did they say?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.970
And, really, in that
moment, how did you feel?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.450
I've been asking this
question my leadership classes

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.830
for over a decade.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.390
And they always say it
was that person who really

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.300
saw me, who really
understood me.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.410
And also knew how I was
holding myself back.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.250
And then they always
say that, yeah, they

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.880
said something that challenged
me in a way that in the moment,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.750
it didn't feel good.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.400
But it made a difference to me.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.932
And from that
moment, I saw myself

00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:01.015
and the world differently.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.650
And these people aren't
always people that we like.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.770
In fact, I had this boss.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.550
He was not even near the top of
my list of most-liked bosses,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.410
more close to the bottom.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.100
We always fought about ideas.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.510
And when my projects would take
off, and I'd be successful,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.740
somehow he got credit
for the success.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.690
And in the five years
I worked for him,

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.840
he never pronounced
my name correctly,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.505
even though I always
said, it's Marcia.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.400
But he still had this way
of hearing me, of seeing me.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.430
He knew what really
drove me, what

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.740
motivated me to move forward.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.380
But he also knew how I
was holding myself back.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.790
And he say these things that
would make me stop and really

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.110
evaluate what I was
really doing in a way

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.020
that I could see
things differently.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.810
Like, for example,
there was this time

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.120
that I was complaining
about the executive staff.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.380
And they had re-prioritized my
project down the list again.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.280
And I was so angry.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.000
And how come they couldn't
see why this was so important?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.820
And he says to me, you know,
you can quit fighting now.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.970
You've made it.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.350
What do you mean?

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.400
I mean, as we were talking
about before we started,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.620
I am a small woman.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.780
And this was a semiconductor
company, primarily men.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.990
And I had to fight my way up.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.920
Fighting had served me.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.070
Who would I be if
I wasn't a fighter?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.270
But then he said,
do you think there's

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.580
a way instead of trying to
force them to see what you want,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.500
that you can inspire
them to see what you see?

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.600
I really valued people
who inspired me.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.250
And I really thought
I could do that,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.570
that I did that with the
people who worked for me.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.320
I had never thought that I
could do that with these people.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.510
Why not?

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.300
But I couldn't see it
until he made the statement

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.220
and asked the question, which
then changed my behavior,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.981
and changed my results.

00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:23.480
Then there was this
other time I was

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.490
complaining about my coworkers.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.175
Seems like I complained
an awful lot.

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.140
But we were doing this project.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.330
And I was saying, they
weren't pulling their weight.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.460
And he says to me, wow, it seems
as if everyone disappoints you.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.860
Again, I paused.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.070
And he says to me, do you
think anyone will ever

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.270
be good enough for you?

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.960
And I thought about
that for days.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.140
And I realized it was actually
the source of all my troubles

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.790
with all my relationships.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.270
So it wasn't even
work that he changed.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.720
But he totally changed my
life with one reflection,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.540
one question.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.050
And so when I looked
at that, I thought,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.715
was this just random statements
of this uncensored boss?

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.440
So when I left that
company, I went out.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.160
I was trained as a coach.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.170
And I had gotten involved
with emotional intelligence.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.320
And I was fascinated
by the brain.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.080
And then I went on to do my
doctoral work in psychology

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.200
just to really learn at
what are we learning now

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.080
that we have access to really
seeing how the brain works?

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.830
And my second master's was
in learning psychology.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.030
That was decades ago.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.410
And now I realize what we
thought then of how we learned

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.625
is very different now, that
there's different learning.

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:51.250
So what I want to
share with you today,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.250
briefly I want to look
at what type of learning

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.600
are we talking about?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.810
If you really want to change
people's behavior, particularly

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.000
when they're stuck
or they're resistant,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.540
how do you actually do that?

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.040
So we're going to
look at what is it

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.380
the conditions you're
trying to create?

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.120
And then I also
want to look at how

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.390
do you know what to say that's
going to make them see things

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.360
differently and then
change their life?

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.730
So when we look at
learning-- I said to you

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.260
that I learned early on
that there was a way that we

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.280
can help people to
learn information.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.950
But the problem with just
using the thinking brain

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.930
is that we're competing
with a whole lot of things.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.210
So if I tell you, I really
think you should do this,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.350
you might say, yeah, great.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.266
And you write it down.

00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:42.450
But then how many things
compete with that?

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.010
And within five,
10 minutes, you've

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.290
probably forgotten
what I've said.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.280
So even reading things,
how many articles

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.460
do you read online a day?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.043
At the end of the
day, if I asked you,

00:07:54.043 --> 00:07:59.274
what did you learn today, would
you even remember most of it?

00:07:59.274 --> 00:08:01.190
I mean, all those tests
you took in school you

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.180
had to memorize things.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.800
And if I gave it to you
now, would you pass?

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.250
Because this is short-term
memory we're dealing with.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.965
And, in fact, if you want
people to remember then

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:13.290
it's got to have a
strong emotion attached

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.680
to the information.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.860
They have to say, wow!

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.675
This is fabulous!

00:08:16.675 --> 00:08:18.050
This is going to
be great for me.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.070
It's going to truly help
me achieve my goals.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.500
If they don't, it's
not going to embed.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.070
They won't remember it.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.280
It has to be a big
impact in order for it

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.280
to get into long-term memory.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.130
So information-based
learning, and just telling

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.010
people what to do is
really an inefficient way

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.600
of getting them to change.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.440
So then we have the traditional
old management technique

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.150
is I'll scare you
into changing, right?

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.290
And people still do this.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:47.980
And parents do.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.670
You better do this, or else.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.100
The problem with this is
that fear-based learning

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.400
gets lodged back here where
we learn automatic pilot

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.970
stuff, the motor skills.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.080
Like you learn how
to drive a car.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.210
How many of you drive?

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.520
So how often do you
drive, and you've

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.670
been driving for,
oh, gosh, miles,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.340
and you realize you haven't
thought about driving?

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.840
OK.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.950
Raise your hand if this
has ever happened to you.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.790
Look around.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.100
You're driving on the road
with all these people.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.760
Thank God for automatic
pilot, that we

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.310
can do this without thinking.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.500
But that's the thing, if
I learned based on fear,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.820
then it gets lodged there.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.960
And I learn to do
things one way.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.980
And it no longer has access
to my long-term memory

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.820
and my creative source.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.010
So I learn how to do things.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.620
And under pressure, I'm really
good at doing things one way.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.450
But then you ask me to adapt
and do things differently.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.210
And you know what?

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.910
I can't.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.710
It's very hard for me to
then change the way I do it.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.020
Because I learned it under fear.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.670
It's almost as if
I have to learn

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.600
an entirely new way
of doing things.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.240
And then people wonder,
why are these people

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.750
so resistant to change?

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.840
Because they learned under
fear In the first place.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.120
So this is also a
very inefficient way

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.540
of teaching people, and getting
them to change their behavior.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.690
So the third way that we have
to change people's behavior

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.820
actually works with
the middle brain,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.110
where we have long-term
memory, and we can be creative.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.360
But there's a structure here
that is really important.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.880
And this is the
most important thing

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.700
in changing someone's
behavior, especially

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.650
if it has to do with
how I relate to others.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.960
And this thing is called ego.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.330
And ego isn't bad.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:46.020
Ego is how I see myself
and the world around me.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.900
And I need this
because I can't be

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.100
stopping all day long
and saying, who am I?

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.360
Where am I?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.110
I have to kind of
know who I am and what

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.430
I do so I can function.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.940
So it's a survival process.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.500
So all of our experiences,
and our beliefs,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.810
they create these frames
that we operate by.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.930
Well, the brain
dearly protects this.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.970
This is why when people feel a
little threatened of who I am--

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.470
are you threatening me?

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.690
Are you judging me
or my credibility?

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.480
I get defensive right away.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.900
And if I say, oh, don't be
so defensive, what happens?

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.990
You get even more defensive.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.450
Because we dearly protect this.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.360
But, you see, when you're
dealing with someone, the best

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.590
thing you can do,
then, is can you

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:41.360
break down one of those
defenses to where I actually

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.730
stop and think about,
is how I see myself

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:50.360
in this situation really serving
me and how I see the world?

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.200
So what we're trying
to do in order

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.480
to change people's
behavior is we have

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.070
what's called
insight-based learning.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.380
So when my boss said to me,
will anyone ever be good enough

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.740
for you, it's like, boom, he
broke through that defense,

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.140
got right into my brain.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.240
And my brain had
to stop and go, oh,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.210
wow, what you thought was true
maybe isn't, maybe something

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.710
else.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.170
So it starts rewiring.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.700
And all of a sudden, I
have a new awareness of,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.640
I wasn't really doing a
good thing for myself.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.810
And my view of myself and the
world then changed forever.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.800
What's really wonderful about
this is once that changes,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.150
that structure,
then my perspective

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.690
changes forever as well.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.150
And so does my behavior.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.180
So self-directed,
discovery-based learning

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.280
is permanent.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.650
So I don't necessarily go
back to old bad behavior.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.090
So when we're dealing with
people, especially when they're

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.870
resistant or they're stuck,
this is the most efficient way

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.130
of helping them to learn.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.610
And that's why I'm
sharing this with you.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.670
That's what you're aiming for.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.680
So behavior learning
could be that you

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.540
tell me something
that totally supports

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.830
how I see myself in the world.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.680
And I go, yeah, that's great.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.520
But, again, if I'm
stuck in seeing things,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.120
and I'm not serving
myself, or I'm

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.810
resistant to seeing
something else,

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.360
then you need to
help me break down

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.200
the barrier that's
protecting my sense of self

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.290
and the world, so I can
see myself in a bigger way,

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:29.100
and the world around me, that
gives me more possibility.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.590
So we do this by maybe saying
something that's surprising.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.920
I remember the first
time someone said to me,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.390
you know, I really
intimidate people.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.040
I'm like, me?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.700
I'm so short.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.290
I do that?

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.730
That was surprising,
made me think.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.810
Or a disruptive
reflection, where you just

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.250
hold up the mirror and allow
people to look at themselves.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.460
Or a powerful question.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.390
These are the things that
make me then stop and question

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.670
myself.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.610
And in that moment
where I question

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.570
myself is when there's
that great opportunity

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.870
that I may learn something new.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.830
So it's in this moment of
discomfort that learning truly

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.180
happens.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.590
And, again, when my
brain breaks down,

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.200
it's a really awesome process.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.830
I'm sure you've seen it.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.820
Where you say
something to someone,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.550
and there really is a breakdown.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.840
So what happens is, they will
stare at you for a moment.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.390
Because their brain is going,
uh, something new here.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.600
And it takes a moment to rewire.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.850
And so it's almost
like a trance state.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.410
But it's very similar,
if you've ever

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.080
seen a baby see something
new for the very first time.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.840
What do they do?

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.270
They just stare at it.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:51.050
And then when the brain
kind of formulates meaning,

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.860
then they either
cry or they laugh,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.690
depending on if they think
it's a threat or if it's funny.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.500
It's the same thing with adults.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.670
We kind of, like, huh?

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.770
And so this is a moment.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.920
If you create this, you
have to let it happen.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.250
Don't talk.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.700
Just let the silence happen.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.650
Let their brain rewire.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.450
And then they'll probably
have an emotional reaction,

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.852
where they may feel awkward.

00:15:13.852 --> 00:15:15.060
They may laugh at themselves.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.290
They may be embarrassed.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.840
They may be sad.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.200
They could be angry.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.330
But it'll dissipate.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.280
You just hold on.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.950
You just let them
work through it.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.670
And then you say, so, what
have you now discovered?

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.180
What is true for you now?

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.440
And let them tell you
what they now see.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.330
And once we change
our view of who

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.570
I think I am in the
world around me,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.152
then my behavior
changes as well.

00:15:42.152 --> 00:15:43.610
And, again, it's
far more efficient

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.840
than you trying to tell
someone your great advice

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.240
and brilliant ideas.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.720
It just doesn't stick.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.960
So the question,
then, is how do we

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.170
know what to say that's
going to create this moment?

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.240
Where does that come from?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.170
So a friend of mine was doing
her doctoral dissertation

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:09.960
where she was interviewing
all these master coaches that

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.530
seem to be able to do
this almost naturally.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.690
And she asked them,
what exactly is it

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.180
that you do that creates
that moment where people go,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.270
oh, wow, and they change?

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.280
And all of them said, well,
I access my intuition.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.220
But the difficult thing,
when she asked them, so,

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.150
how do you do that?

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.890
Was like, oh,
well, I don't know.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.390
You know.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.100
You just listen.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.760
And they had a
very difficult time

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.790
articulating what
exactly they did.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:43.950
But if you can't articulate
it, you can't really teach it.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.980
And so I said, I've
got to codify this.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.790
I have to bring it
to a place to where

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.200
people know what it
is they're doing.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.900
Because otherwise if
I don't do that, then

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.010
most people will judge it
as kind of fluffy weird,

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:03.830
or something that belongs to
psychics and wizards, or maybe

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.950
women, women's intuition.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.050
But, frankly, I didn't
find any research

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.564
that really says we have
more intuition than men.

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:15.200
It's just sometimes women
trust their intuition

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.430
a little bit more.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.000
But we all have it.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.970
Don't we?

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.450
I mean, how many times
have you made a decision

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.800
that you now regret.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.910
And said to yourself, I
should have trusted my gut.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.240
My gut told me to do this.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.440
I didn't do it.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.240
Or you did something.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.737
And you knew it was because
other people told you to do it.

00:17:38.737 --> 00:17:39.570
But it wasn't right.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.210
And you say, I should
have trusted my heart.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.320
We all have this intuition.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.180
But we don't listen to it.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.740
We don't access it.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.910
Because we have this
chatty brain up here

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.850
that also sensors,
filters, analyzes,

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.440
critiques, and
kind of drowns out

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.430
this information that
we get from the rest

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.590
of our nervous system.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.990
And even though people say,
well, if you listen deeply,

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.330
you'll hear more than the words.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.550
But what is it
we're really doing?

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.400
In fact, it was
Sherlock Holmes who

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.160
does this quite well
in really seeing

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.110
beyond what most people see.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.070
He admonished Watson
by saying, you see.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.810
But you do not observe.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.020
The distinction is clear.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.190
So I went out.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.946
And I said, OK.

00:18:35.946 --> 00:18:37.320
So let me look
at-- so I think it

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.903
has to do with the
heart, and the gut,

00:18:38.903 --> 00:18:40.240
and the nervous system.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.610
And I found quite
a bit of research.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:48.120
And it's initiated from
Michael Gershon's work

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.220
in his book "The Second Brain."

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.050
And there was two things
that really stood out for me.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.600
One, was he said,
you know, there's

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.090
like a billion stars in the sky.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.423
And if you take all of those,
and put them in your head,

00:18:58.423 --> 00:19:00.870
you've got a billion neurons.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.860
But you know if you take 100
million of those neurons,

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.050
and put them right here
in your gut, that's

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.460
how many neurons you have.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.830
And there's every class
of neurotransmitter

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.030
that's in your brain that
are making connections--

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.020
every class of
neurotransmitter in your brain

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.840
is also in your gut.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.030
Now, I think that's far more
than you need to digest food.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.470
So there's processing.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:32.510
You gut is getting hits,
and processing information

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.667
all the time, and sending
signals to your brain.

00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:36.000
Again, it doesn't have language.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.640
So it has to go to the brain.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.450
And then I found
Andrew Armour's work.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.000
And his is the work that was the
foundation for the Heart Math

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.590
Institute.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.070
And he documented how the
heart takes in information,

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.040
processes it, and sends
signals to the brain.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.200
And he coined the
term heart math.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.780
And Paul Pearsall,
a heart surgeon,

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.660
documented how many
memories transplant patients

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.890
had that belonged to the donors.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.360
So, yeah, the heart
even remembers even when

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.820
it goes to someone else.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.820
The heart has memory.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:17.776
So I looked at these.

00:20:17.776 --> 00:20:19.900
And I said, well, that's
really the nervous system.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.940
And then Gershon said
in a fetus it's all one.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.770
It's all clumped
together like clay.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:33.550
And as the baby develops, the
gut and the heart separates.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.160
But it's still connected
by the vagus nerve.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.010
The nervous system
is really one organ,

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.420
even though it's separate.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.900
So we have the gut, and
the heart, and the brain.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.840
And so I looked at this.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.180
The nervous system is
really the head, the heart,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:56.040
and the gut are our
primary processing centers.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.800
And, honestly, that's
what intuition is.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.470
If we can stop and
listen to those,

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.670
what might we hear
differently than if we're only

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.180
listening to our brain?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.280
So I want you to imagine
right now that you're

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.060
dealing with a big decision.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.540
So if you can think
about something

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.240
that you're trying to decide on.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.200
And it could be a life decision.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.870
It could even be what you're
going to do this weekend.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:28.000
See if you can't just put
in your brain something

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.530
that you have to decide.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.970
And what I'm going
to do is I want

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.270
to do a quick
visualization with you.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.230
I want to see if you can
listen to your three centers,

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:45.140
and what might come up
differently from each one.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.620
So this visualization
that I use,

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:52.320
I teach it to coaches in
order to listen differently

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.060
to other people.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.350
But you can use it for
yourself and practice this way.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.110
And so you can do it with me.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.810
Or you can do it
however you like.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.990
I learned this from
a sports psychologist

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.220
in helping athletes
to get in the zone.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.350
Because this really is
a being present process.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.535
So I want you to, if
you can, to be here.

00:22:13.535 --> 00:22:15.410
If you've got a lot of
other things going on,

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.810
if you could just give
this a couple of minutes.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.200
If you could just
get comfortable.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.330
Feel your feet on the ground.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:27.200
Just notice where you are
right here, right now.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.480
And sense how you're feeling.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.890
Take a breath.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.120
And then the
visualization I'm going

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.370
to do-- if you want to
close your eyes, you can.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.950
It works if you could just
maybe put your gaze down

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.290
so you can actually get
into sensing this instead

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.590
of just watching me, or having
your thoughts go elsewhere.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.760
But I want you to think about
your decision from your brain.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.000
What are the things you
normally think about?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.050
Do you think about
the pros and cons?

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.600
Do you think about
what you should do?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.780
What other people are
telling you to do?

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.360
I want you just to
notice, what are

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.135
your thoughts around this
decision from your brain?

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.710
Now what I'd like
you to do is I want

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:24.080
you to imagine there's an
elevator in your brain.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.610
And if you don't
like the elevator,

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:31.800
you can make it a glowing
ball, or just your awareness.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.310
But if you have an
elevator, I want

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.880
you to take all
of your thoughts.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.110
And I want you to see
your thoughts float

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.880
into the elevator.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.625
Then I want you to see
the elevator door close.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.030
So see if you can't notice what
it feels like when you don't

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.450
have any thoughts floating
around your brain.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.120
They're all safely
tucked into the elevator.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.890
You can have them back.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.910
But all of a sudden, the
elevator starts to float down.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.880
And it floats down
through your head.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.210
It floats through your neck.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:09.510
And then it floats down.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.200
And it comes to rest in the
spot next to your heart.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.550
And when the
elevator door opens,

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:21.500
you notice someone or something
that you deeply care about.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.940
And I want you to feel.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.580
Really notice what
you feel when you

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.320
see this person or this thing.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.430
Do you feel happy?

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.300
Do you feel grateful?

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.420
Does this person or this
thing make you smile?

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.855
I want you to say
the word to yourself.

00:24:37.855 --> 00:24:39.120
Do you feel grateful?

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.060
Do you feel love?

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.310
Do you feel happiness?

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.970
Do you feel care, compassion?

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.210
Pick a word.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.190
And breathe it in.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.140
And just feel what it feels
like when this heart space truly

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.640
opens.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.120
Now I want you to think
about that decision again.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.240
But think about it
through your heart.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.510
Try to keep yourself from
going back to your head.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.180
Think about it
through your heart.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:09.060
What is your heart saying to you
right now about that decision?

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.795
Is it different?

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.400
Is it different?

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.480
Make note of that.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.360
Now I want you to say goodbye
to the person or the thing that

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.480
made you feel good.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.220
And the elevator closes.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.750
And it starts to float down.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.920
It floats down through
your diaphragm,

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.800
through your stomach.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.260
And it comes to rest
right in this place right

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.310
below your navel.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.540
This is your point of strength.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.290
This is your will.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.520
In many modalities they
call this your core.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.560
And I want you to
think of a time where

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.000
you spoke up and said
something, or did something,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.670
in spite of your fear.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:55.980
And how did that feel?

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.010
And I want you to say the
word courage to yourself.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.250
And have it float down.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.800
And just hold it right
in the middle here.

00:26:05.492 --> 00:26:07.325
Now I want you to think
about that decision.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.410
What is your gut saying to you?

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.650
Is it different?

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.500
Is it different
than what you heard

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.750
from your head and your heart?

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.062
Make note of it.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.850
OK, you can come back.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.390
This is something you
can practice daily

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.590
as you start opening.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.770
As Otto Scharmer says
in his book "Theory U,"

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.550
and work from an open mind,
and an open heart, and an open

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.340
will.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.650
I mean, if you think about
it, how many leaders,

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.110
there's such an oversight that
they create mission statements

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.050
based on market
needs and revenue,

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.870
and not really including
what truly inspires people?

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.760
Or how many teams
have you been on,

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.220
where you make plans, and
steps, and deliverables.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.700
But you don't stop
and ask people,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.570
what is it that you
really want to contribute?

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:15.300
What is the vision of what
you have of the end result?

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.290
What are you afraid might
happen along the way?

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:23.190
What difference it would make
if we ask people from the heart,

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.380
and from our will.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.540
And really listen to their
doubts, to their fears,

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.450
to their desires.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.440
What difference would that make?

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.890
So you can use
this in listening.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.990
And the emotions, if
you heard me say them,

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.660
is that we open our
mind with curiosity.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.410
Which, again, is difficult.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.620
We tend to want to analyze, and
tell people things, and what's

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.310
right, and try to fix them.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.530
But we use curiosity
to open our mind.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.540
We use care,
compassion, gratitude,

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.160
whatever it is
that you feel when

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.740
you saw that person or that
thing that made you feel good,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.120
that's how we open our heart.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:14.330
And courage is what
opens our core.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.230
So you can use
this in listening.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.189
In the book, there is a model.

00:28:18.189 --> 00:28:19.980
Because you're still
like, how do I use it?

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.860
Do I just go in and I listen?

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.970
But you want to start
the conversation, first,

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.390
really looking at
what it is we're

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.190
trying to accomplish here.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.610
So this is a dream model.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.030
Desired outcome, reflect
explored knowledge,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.760
and then make a plan.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.420
We always want to
try to get to what

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.970
would be the goal that
would be important to you?

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.840
It's not my goal going
into this conversation.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.470
It is about what's in it for me.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.470
We want to determine that.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.640
Do you want to be seen
as a leader by others?

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.489
Do you want more
respect from your peers?

00:28:51.489 --> 00:28:52.780
Do you want just peace of mind?

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:57.010
What is it that
you want more of?

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.540
So the conversation really has
to be what the person wants,

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.430
not necessarily what
you want them to do.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:04.320
We start there.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.395
And then we go into
this spontaneous process

00:29:07.395 --> 00:29:09.440
where we're listening
from these centers,

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.280
and reflecting
back what we hear.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.320
So we allow the person
to tell their story.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.510
And just share well, this
is what I hear you saying.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:22.430
This is what I hear in terms
of the emotions you feel.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.480
I think maybe this
is what's going on.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.387
And I can be wrong.

00:29:25.387 --> 00:29:26.720
And you can tell me, no, no, no.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.040
That's not quite it.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.900
But if I'm wrong.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.450
You'll probably
say, that's not it.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.130
This is it.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.300
So we reflect.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.000
We explore.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.600
We ask questions.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.340
And then if they
say, wow, yeah, OK.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.970
I get it, we ask
what is it you got?

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.680
You need them to our
articulate the discovery,

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:48.210
the new awareness, so it
sticks before you make a plan.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.020
Sometimes it can be just one
statement and one question.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.170
I was working with
an executive team.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.800
Their leader was
leaving after 14 years.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.660
It was a quasi-governmental
organization.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.390
And he was retiring.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.720
And he said, you know,
they seem to be paralyzed.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.130
And they're just not moving
forward with any plans.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:08.700
Can you go talk to them,
coach them a little?

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.920
So I went in.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.220
And I said, well,
I know that things

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.450
need to start moving forward.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.000
I think that's what
you want to do.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.880
But tell me, what is it
that's going on right now?

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.410
Well, the first guy started.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.300
And he says, it's awful.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.180
And he told me, like,
he was going to retire.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.990
He'd been there for 35 years.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.430
And he was just going to leave.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.520
And I said, OK,
great, thank you.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.570
And then I asked the next
person, so what's happening?

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.970
Oh, it's awful!

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.220
I'm just going to get my team.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.120
We're going to huddle up.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.670
And we're going to
just go do things.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.050
I'm like, OK.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:45.230
Thank you.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.840
And I went around the table.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.930
Tell me what's happening.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:53.240
And each person told me
how awful this thing was.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.870
And once they were
done, I said, wow.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:56.500
I hear.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.730
I hear what's going on.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.470
I hear that you're not
happy about him leaving.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.880
You're probably sad because
you really liked him,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.410
that you're afraid
of what's going

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.940
to happen with the
new person coming in.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.200
And this was going to be a
board-appointed position.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.540
Maybe you're even
angry that you don't

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.780
get to be a part of
this decision making.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.735
And I heard it in the
words that they said.

00:31:17.735 --> 00:31:20.939
And I reflected it back to them.

00:31:20.939 --> 00:31:22.230
And they said, yeah, that's it.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:23.440
And I said, OK.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.820
With all that on
the table, tell me

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:30.410
what do you know to be true
right now at this very moment?

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.020
And what do they
know to be true?

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.300
The guy was leaving.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.100
So after a long pause, where
they looked at me, huh?

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.870
Somebody finally said,
our director is leaving.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:43.700
I said, OK.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.200
Since that's the
only thing you know

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.150
to be true, what it is
that you need to do?

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:53.110
Another long pause,
and then the head of HR

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.360
said, well, I guess we need
to shore up our succession

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.990
planning so we can
weather any new leader.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.690
I said, great.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.240
How can I help you?

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.460
But, you see, they were so
stuck in their emotions.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.390
And when people get
stuck in their emotions,

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.200
they don't know
what it really is.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.650
You have to help them to
put it out on the table

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.180
so they can look at
what is their fear?

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.780
What is their anger about?

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.390
You help them to look at it.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:18.030
Then you can step back.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.790
And say, so what's
really going on?

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.880
Or maybe you just put
out what you think it is.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.470
And then, again, they can
tell you whether this is true

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.370
or not.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.180
And then we can
move through that.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.500
Because we can't
do this ourselves.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.460
Did you know you
can't tickle yourself?

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.320
Did you know that?

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.336
You can try.

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:39.082
Can' tickle yourself.

00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:40.790
Brain says, oh, I know
what you're doing.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.190
And it stops you.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.530
It's the same thing when you try
to evaluate your own thoughts.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.590
The brain says, no, I
know what you're doing.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.380
And it doesn't really
let you do that.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.420
You might cogitate the same
thing over, and over, and over.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.990
But it doesn't allow you to
break through that barrier.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.650
It takes someone else.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.370
You might read something.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.400
But somebody, when they
ask you that question,

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.580
where you go, oh, whoa!

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.200
I hadn't thought about it
that way, and, of course!

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.840
But I couldn't see it.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.620
That truly makes the difference.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.950
So when we listen
from our brain,

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:18.340
we do here belief
systems and assumptions.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.550
We do here that.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:27.100
What is it that frames that I'm
hoping that's keeping me back.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.780
I know it was Richard
Boyatzis said,

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.520
you can't see beyond
the box until you

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.970
see the box in the first place.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.350
So we help people
see what the box is.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.580
We hear that from the brain.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.790
But from the heart, we
really hear what they want,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.480
and what they value.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.130
And sometimes what they value
may be getting in the way.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:50.160
Sometimes first time
supervisors, or people that

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.460
are promoted to manager,
they valued great results.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.630
And now they have to get
results through others.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.920
And it's kind of
difficult to let go.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.480
So the desires and the
values, but we also

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.620
hear doubt based on
past experiences.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.810
And so what is keeping me
from truly moving forward

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.989
because of what has
happened before?

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:18.550
And then from the core,
we hear their fears.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.260
And then what they
can't let go of.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.489
Again, in almost any
transition, people do,

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:25.800
they have to learn new things.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.679
But they have to let
go of old things.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:33.000
And it's often the let go
that's the most difficult.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.429
These are the things that we
hear from these three places.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:41.719
So what I'd like to do is
I want to-- real quickly,

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.790
I'm going to read you a case.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:47.790
The book explains all this
and how you can do it.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:50.650
And then there's two
chapters of case studies.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.973
So you can actually
see this in action.

00:34:53.973 --> 00:34:55.389
I'm going to read
you some things.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.590
And I'm going to walk
you through, again,

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:01.830
just real quickly through your
head, your heart, and your gut.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:06.270
And I want you to see if you
hear anything differently

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.630
when I read this to you.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.720
OK, so the case is that
Anna wanted a promotion.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.460
She was a stellar performer.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.340
And nobody could argue with her
work skills and her ability.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.520
She was really great.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.930
But the problem was
that she was having

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.410
a difficulty with her peers.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:28.970
In meetings she got
a little cynical,

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.730
sarcastic, rolled her
eyes, cut people off.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.380
And they really
weren't happy with her.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.160
And her boss basically
said, until you have respect

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.800
from your peers, it's going to
be difficult to promote you.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.330
So I want you to start
by first being curious.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.160
So I didn't walk
you through this.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.270
But, again, before you go
and you talk to someone,

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.550
you start first by
opening your mind.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.429
And we open our
mind with curiosity.

00:35:57.429 --> 00:35:59.970
So the first thing you want to
do is take all those thoughts.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.430
And put it in that elevator.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.520
Let them float away.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.150
Whatever works for you.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.870
And say the word, curious.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.140
Curious.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.770
I don't know how this
person sees the world.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.240
And I don't know the answers.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.870
If you already know what it is
you're going to say to them,

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.490
there's nothing left.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.350
If you already know how
they're going to respond,

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.600
they will respond in that way.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.260
So can you be curious?

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.720
So listen with curiosity.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.570
She started the conversation
with me by saying,

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.990
I know my peers have
trouble with me.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.920
But I've been getting
good results for years.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.500
If they only listened to
what I have to say and try

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:45.590
my approaches, they would
see how it could help them.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.094
They keep doing
things the old way.

00:36:47.094 --> 00:36:48.260
And nothing gets done right.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.190
My boss won't put the
right pressure on them.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.160
So I have to do it.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.160
You've heard people like that?

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.400
So listening from your head,
what would you ask her?

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.430
What would you ask her?

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.470
Would you be curious
at what she has tried,

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:07.410
if she's tried anything?

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:11.200
Maybe you'd ask her
what else could you try?

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.950
Generally, when we
listen from our head,

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.770
we get into a little
problem solving.

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:19.580
But you might want to know a
little bit about how she really

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:25.580
believes people think, or why
her boss isn't helping her.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.300
OK, so that's from your brain.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.750
But now what I'd like you
to do is, again, to pause.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.930
Take a breath.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:37.030
And do that visualization where
you see elevator moving down.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.810
And it slowly floats down.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.930
And it comes to
rest at your heart.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.510
And, again, you see someone or
something when the door opens

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.570
that makes you smile,
makes you feel good.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:54.030
And just feel that
heart space opening.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.540
And I want you to try to
listen to the next part

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.160
of the conversation
through your heart.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.200
And as you listen to the
heart, just notice, what is it

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.000
you'd like to ask her now?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.360
What might you say?

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.710
And what might you ask her?

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.420
And see if it's different.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.360
So I asked Anna what
she felt her purpose was

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.560
as a team member?

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.610
She said, I want
us to be the best.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.970
I want our region to
outshine the others.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:26.180
I want us all to win.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.760
So I asked her if
her team members

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.480
felt she wanted this for them.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.630
She said, well,
they should know.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.470
But maybe they just don't
understand why I want this.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.830
My intentions are good.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.070
I want them to do better.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.920
It will help us all
if they step up.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.530
They would understand
if they tried.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.140
Now, listening from your
heart, what would you ask her?

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.490
What would you ask her?

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:59.635
Would it be different than
when you listen from your head?

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:08.320
Would you want to
know why she's so

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.410
attached to them
feeling that way?

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.010
Is this so important?

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:16.830
Is there a way that she
could help other people

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.140
to have those same desires?

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:24.020
Does she even know what
other people desire?

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.790
What is she most worried about?

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.544
What's frustrating her?

00:39:27.544 --> 00:39:29.460
Did you hear different
things from your heart?

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.550
Sp just make a note.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:31.510
What would you say?

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.940
And what would you ask her?

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.700
So now what I'd like
you to do is to, again,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.060
go back to your heart.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.270
And I want you to notice.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:45.790
Say goodbye to that
person or that thing.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:48.920
And I want you to let
the elevator go down.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.420
And it comes to
rest at your core.

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.500
And I want you to
feel the courage that

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.980
emanates from here.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.280
Feel the strength of your core.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.960
Say the word
courage to yourself.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:06.005
Now see if you can't
listen through your core.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:13.550
She said to me, I do want
to be seen as a leader.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:17.170
But if I change my way,
why would they believe me?

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.150
Aren't I being inauthentic
if all of a sudden I'm

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.640
the nice one?

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.380
She paused.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.240
And didn't say anything.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.750
And I just held the silence.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.360
Well, maybe I could
start by having

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.040
one-on-one meetings with
people to show that I really

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.660
am interested in their ideas.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.530
I am interested, you know?

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.150
I do want them to know that.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:47.440
From your core, did you notice,
really, what is she afraid of?

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.430
What is she afraid of really?

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:54.110
What is she afraid to let go of?

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:58.780
If she were not to be the one
who knew, who would she be?

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.690
And how would people see her?

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:05.560
And isn't that not
what's holding her back?

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.180
Isn't that not?

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.860
So I want you to
notice, was it difficult

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.830
for you to go to any
of these centers.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.700
And we all listen from our head.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.550
But most of you will be able
to access one of these three

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.460
centers easily in
addition to your head.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.660
If you're a helper type
person, you access your heart.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.259
But it's the gut that
will be most difficult.

00:41:30.259 --> 00:41:32.050
If you're like me, and
you're a risk taker,

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.800
then it's easy for
me to access my gut.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.690
But this is my heart,
point of vulnerability.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.160
And it's hard for me
to go to my heart.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.670
But whenever I'm with a client
and I don't know what to say,

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:47.270
if I go to my heart,
boom, it shows up.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:49.470
And so when I run people
through these exercises,

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.011
and they get to
listen to each other,

00:41:51.011 --> 00:41:53.120
it's amazing the
questions that show up

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.740
from the head, the
heart, and the gut.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.750
And I can I ask you, if you
noticed it was difficult,

00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:59.650
just try it.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.990
Listen to someone differently
tonight, from your heart

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.070
or from your gut.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.840
And what comes forth
in that conversation?

00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:11.790
The point is is that we want
to get people to stop and think

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.748
about their thinking,
not tell them what to do.

00:42:13.748 --> 00:42:15.350
But just to get them to stop.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.540
And if you listen with
your entire nervous system,

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:22.672
and just allow it to come
forth, what might happen?

00:42:22.672 --> 00:42:24.130
There was some
great research where

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.860
they mapped the
brain of rappers.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.500
And it's the same process.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.930
Rappers know where it
is they want to go to.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:35.680
But then in the process of
creating their analytical brain

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.610
goes quiet.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.780
And then they just-- what
comes forth is what they say.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.460
And it's the same process.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.460
If you can quiet your
analytical brain,

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.450
and allow yourself to give voice
to your heart, and your gut,

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:52.240
your nervous
system, maybe people

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.670
will stop and
question themselves.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.959
And maybe they will see
other possibilities.

00:42:56.959 --> 00:42:58.500
So there are things
in the book, yes,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.874
that you have to
have some trust.

00:42:59.874 --> 00:43:02.650
You need to have an
intention for their goal.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:06.170
You need to come in with some
strong, positive emotions.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.250
You can't be angry or
disappointed with them.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.250
Because they'll then
not listen to you.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.300
And you need to hold people
in high regard that I trust.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.310
That you are able,
you're resourceful.

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.910
And that you can
discover this on your own

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:23.450
if I just ask the
right questions.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:26.350
So my purpose is
truly to help people

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.160
to see things
differently, to change

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.250
the conversations
in the workplace.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.910
In fact, what I
always tell leaders is

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:36.850
they really want you
to be present more

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:40.420
than they need
you to be perfect.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.870
And if you can help people
to actually stop and see

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.900
their blind spots and
their sources of resistance

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.950
where it becomes
present to them,

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:51.700
yes, maybe they'll
feel uncomfortable.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.555
Maybe they'll be embarrassed.

00:43:53.555 --> 00:43:54.180
They'll be sad.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.310
They'll be angry.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.470
But then they'll grow.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:03.680
And we do this by
courageously coaching people,

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.800
but using conscious listening.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.510
And just feeding
back what we hear

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:12.650
and what we sense
so they can see

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.850
these things for themselves.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:17.440
So, again, I really
want to start

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.120
changing the
conversations we have

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.360
so we are actually
helping people

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.880
not just do their jobs well,
but to step into their highest

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.720
selves of who they are
through conscious listening.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.070
So I hope that you join me.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.190
And we start really
listening to each other

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.770
in a more powerful way.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.592
Thank you.

00:44:41.592 --> 00:44:42.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:44.922 --> 00:44:47.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think we have
a few minutes for questions

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.580
if anybody has a question that
they would like to ask Marcia.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.470
AUDIENCE: So a lot
of what you said,

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.460
I could see how it
applies very easily

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.920
to one-on-one conversations.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.110
Do you have any
tips for doing this

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:00.950
with a large group
of people at once?

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.770
MARCIA REYNOLDS:
Yeah, well the example

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.610
that I gave you with
the executive team

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:07.010
was an entire group of people.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.550
And so it's the same thing.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.720
You want to have
a combined goal.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.580
What is it we're
trying to achieve here

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.140
that it is difficult to reach?

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.250
But, again, always allow people
to tell their stories first.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.720
So oftentimes we say, oh, I
don't want people to vent.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.940
And I want them to complain.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.737
But there's a seed
in the complaint.

00:45:25.737 --> 00:45:28.070
There's something you're going
to hear in the complaint.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:31.500
It's like, ah, that's the
thing that's holding them back.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.010
And so you want to
listen for that.

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:35.760
And then when you hold
that up, it's like,

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.050
well, I hear you say this.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.250
And yet you said this.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:41.850
And it kind of, like, collides.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.520
Or I can tell this is
really important to you.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.520
And yet you're being asked
to do something else.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.650
Is that the problem?

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:49.480
So you listen to their story.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.190
And then you're going to find
in there what's the problem?

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:54.110
You feed that back.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.600
And then ask the question.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.850
And that makes the difference.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:59.120
So you can do that
with an entire group.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.670
It's just that once they get
into the complaining thing,

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.470
it can really take off.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.640
But that's OK.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.910
Because we have to have
it out on the table.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:10.530
My first job was in
a mental hospital.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.510
And they did this brilliantly.

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.550
Whenever they had an
organizational change,

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.760
or a layoff, they let everybody
sit in a circle group.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.917
And they said, OK,
what's going on?

00:46:21.917 --> 00:46:23.750
And everybody talked
about, they were angry.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.450
They were sad.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.910
And they got it out.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.880
And the leader didn't
have to promise anything.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.150
It was just take the
pressure cooker off.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:32.610
Let's just take a look at it.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.940
And, OK, now that we know that?

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.120
What's stopping you
from moving forward?

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.680
What is it we need to focus
on that we could actually

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.510
put our energy into
making some change?

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.020
So absolutely it
works with a group.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.780
And there's some
examples in the book.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.100
Thank you for that question.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.530
AUDIENCE: So you've
talked mostly

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:56.160
about trying to help someone
else see their blind spots.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.270
What about the reverse?

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:01.097
Where you want someone else to
help you see your blind spots?

00:47:01.097 --> 00:47:02.680
MARCIA REYNOLDS:
Well, actually that's

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.530
why it's really good--
I suggest in the book

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.940
that you work through
these things together.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.050
Because I have a coach.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:12.010
And I can't see my blind spot.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:13.610
And, yet, she's so amazing.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:15.900
She'll say, right, one
question, you know coaching.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:21.010
One question, and I'll
go, ah, of course!

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.960
But I can't do it myself.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.020
So it's really great when you
have someone who will really

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.679
listen and not want to
give you great advice.

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.470
And they're just waiting
for you to shut up

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:31.803
so they can tell you what to do.

00:47:31.803 --> 00:47:33.100
That's not helpful.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.610
But ask the question that makes
me stop and question myself.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.390
And boom, I break
down that barrier.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:40.680
I see something else.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.080
And I'm done.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.110
One question.

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.140
So, yeah, I seek it out.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.480
If I'm stuck, I
seek it out always.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.470
So, again, there's a lot
of exercises in the book.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:53.980
And so you can do
these things together.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.020
And a lot of stuff
on my website,

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.860
too, outsmartyourbrain.com.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.280
A lot of cases, and exercises,
and the visualization

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.310
is on the website.

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:08.190
And there's an assessment,
rate your discomfort zone.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.240
So you can assess
how well you deal

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.640
with other people's discomfort.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.930
Because you have to
kind of, like, be OK,

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:16.252
and let them go through that.

00:48:16.252 --> 00:48:16.960
And just breathe.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.110
And they'll be OK.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.930
You don't have to fix them.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.490
And then see what comes
out on the other side.

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.442
So, yeah, thank you.

00:48:25.442 --> 00:48:26.900
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Well, Marcia, thank

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.660
you so much for coming and
spending time with us today.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.360
I'm sure everyone's looking
forward to reading the book

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.835
and practicing.
