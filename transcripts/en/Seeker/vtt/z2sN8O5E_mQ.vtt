00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.750
When you think of mass extinctions you probably
think DINOSAURS!!!

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.350
Which I mean, that’s fair.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.130
Cuz, ya know, dinosaurs.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.980
But the greatest extinction event of all time
wasn’t the dinosaurs at all.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.639
About 250 million years ago something caused
even more species to die out -- in an event

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.060
called the end-Permian extinction, also known
by its much cheerier name -- the great dying.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.480
The Great Dying took out 96 percent of marine
species and 70 percent of all land-animals.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.590
Yeah.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.050
Scientists have been searching for the exact
cause of this mysterious mass extinction for

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.910
decades, but most scenarios they’ve come
up with have been, well, less than satisfying.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.769
However, a researcher at UC Berkeley is on
the case, and he might be onto something.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.489
The most convincing theory so far involves
the large scale volcanism of the Siberian

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.280
Traps that happened around the same time as
the End-Permian extinction.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.829
For those playing the home game, that’s
at the end… of the Permian Era.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.999
The eruptions exploded 300,000 years before
the End-Permian extinction, but were active

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.719
for hundreds of thousands of years... even
after.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.120
They oozed lava and spewed ash all over the
place.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.070
This would’ve caused a host of issues like
global warming and localized acid rain.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.420
But how did volcanoes in Siberia manage to
wipe out life across the whole planet?

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.210
To add to the mystery, the end-Permian fossil
record shows that a global decline of forests

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.090
at this time was coupled with mutated pollen.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.310
Something was making it impossible for plants
to reproduce, hmmm.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.219
It’s been proposed that the volcanic gases
from the Siberian Traps could’ve severely

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.189
compromised Earth’s ozone layer -- exposing
life on earth to extremely high levels of

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.039
UV-B radiation.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.119
Scientists think this could’ve damaged the
plants, potentially destroying the food chain

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.119
from the bottom up.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.590
This is where UC Berkeley Researcher, Jeffrey
Benca, comes in.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.950
To test this theory, he took mini pine trees,
and put them in an extinction chamber.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.179
Inside they were exposed to extreme amounts
of UV-B, akin to what would’ve been experienced

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.749
before the Great Dying.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.939
Lo-and-behold-- the trees made malformed pollen
and became sterile!

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.210
What’s even crazier though, is four of the
five greatest extinctions on earth--- including

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.149
the dinosaurs-- were accompanied by large
scale volcanic events, which are often associated

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.950
with warming global temperatures, acid rain,
and you guessed it: ozone layer depletion.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.290
It’s a little too early to say if this new
finding helps explain other extinctions.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.569
But it is kinda crazy that Earth’s worst
extinctions weren’t caused by giant asteroids

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.430
or hellfires, but good old fashioned climate
change and ozone depletion, ain’t it?

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.060
If we keep at it, we might just bump The Great
dying out of first place.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.370
Do you think we could get a trophy for that?

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.260
If you’re still worried about the ozone
layer, you might want to watch this video

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.000
about how scientists stood up to power and
saved it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.849
BTW while researching this we found: those
volcanic eruptions from Siberia?

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.741
They oozed enough material to cover a region
the size of the United States in magma -- a

00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:59.110
KILOMETER DEEP. Cool. Thanks for watching.
