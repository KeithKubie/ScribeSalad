00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.949
Sex is awesome, right?

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:02.949
Wrong.

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:05.879
Turns out sex might be great for everyone
except Grandpa.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.450
If thinking of your grandparents having sex
is weird, just remember, you’ll be that

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.519
age some day...so listen up, ya old boners.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.590
Hi everyone, it’s Jackie.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.380
And I’m here to tell you that you should
definitely have sex.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.480
Ok, we’re not medical doctors and you shouldn’t
necessarily take our advice on that, but there

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.720
are many studies out there detailing the health
benefits of sex.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.770
Although... if you’re an older guy hitting
the town, you might want to simmer a little.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.230
The Journal of Health and Social Behavior
recently published a study about the effects

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.870
of sex on older people, specifically between
the ages of 57 and 85.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.059
It showed that older men who had sex at least
once a week, ended up much more likely to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.490
later experience cardiovascular events, like
a heart attack or stroke, than men who were

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.160
sexually inactive.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.120
Researchers also found increased levels of
hypertension, rapid heart rate, and elevated

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.990
C-reactive protein, which would indicate inflammation
in your body,.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.590
But this didn’t hold true for women.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.390
They did not see these same risk factors,
and in fact, women who reported having enjoyable

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.360
sex actually ended up with lower risk of hypertension
five years later than those who didn’t enjoy

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.830
themselves.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.660
Hypertension is a fancy scientific way of
saying high blood pressure.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.860
Turns out men and women aren’t the same.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.870
For example, when experiencing stress, and
yes, sex can be a stressor, men are more likely

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.680
than women to report increased blood pressure,
type 2 diabetes, heart disease and heart attacks.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.110
This happens because the male body responds
to cardiovascular stress by increasing vascular

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.170
resistance which is the force that opposes
blood flow.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.240
This can lead to an uptick in blood pressure,
but these changes don’t seem to show up

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.290
until the sun is going down on your life.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.140
However, the female body responds with an
increased heart rate -- therefore an increased

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.830
amount of blood that the heart is pumping.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.310
And this may explain why some older women
end up experiencing decreased hypertension

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.440
if they remain sexually active.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.190
Scientists theorize that since older men may
have to exert themselves more than younger

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.140
men, the increased activity could create more
stress on their cardiovascular system while

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.611
trying to climax.

00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:04.280
So medications like Viagra may not be as helpful
as you think.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.090
Now before you start thinking that the 40
year old virgin may have the right idea, remember

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.850
that sex can also be healthy and good for
you.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.850
Phew!

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.850
The older men in that study who had sex, but
less frequently (only one to three times a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.580
month), actually had lower risks of certain
cardiovascular disease factors.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.470
So the amount of exertion matters.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.760
Another study out of Harvard showed that men
in general who ejaculated 21 or more times

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.950
per month had a 33% lower risk of prostate
cancer.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.760
There is also research showing that sex can
improve your mood, your quality of sleep,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.700
minimize your stress levels, help you look
younger and, who are we kidding, it’s just

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.700
fun.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.000
So...if you’re an older man having sex,
you might want to watch yourself.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.540
But if you’re a women at any age, I say
get it ladies!

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.430

Sometimes I even find funny things to say
about sex.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:08.980
So, given how much energy is involved, is
sex actually exercise?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.310
Good news.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:29.540
We covered that in this video here.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.100
