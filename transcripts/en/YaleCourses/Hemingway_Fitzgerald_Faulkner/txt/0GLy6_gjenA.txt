Speaker 1:          00:01          Um, uh, going to, uh, start by the way, and I know that, um, Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner, very much iconic figures of American literature. Um, and probably you guys are here, uh, because you know something about those offers already. So I'm not going to be going over a lot of material that you guys know already. Instead of will, I like to do, is to come up with a little bit of a material that might be somewhat surprising to you. And, um, I'm going to be talking about, um, uh, free analytics scales are, this is kind of a critical paradigm that we'll be using, um, throughout the semester, which is the use of three analytics scales to talk about the authors. So first of all, this, the macro history of the United States and the world and two techs come to mind both Hemingway's for whom the bell tolls and to have and have not, uh, so that's the largest possible level.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Um, and then we'll go down a little bit to the next level, um, which is, um, still large. Um, but it has to do with narrative experiments, um, of modernism. And the text that we're reading can all be called moderns text, um, in one way or another. Um, so we'll be looking at the sound of fury specifically for that register, that analytic register of experimentation. Um, and finally we'll be looking at the smallest possible scale micro level. Um, and it has to do with sensory did housing. It's like all three of them, uh, are wonderful on sensory details. But today we'll just be talking about one tax, uh, the great Gatsby and what particular moment when the registering of the sensory world is very important. Um, so let me, um, go to, um, Hemingway and, uh, talk a little bit about him. Um, in many ways as a kind of a gateway or a guy, uh, to Google vision of American literature.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Um, Hemingway was framed much a world traveler. Um, he, um, you know, basically we can get a map of the world by just looking at his writings. Um, but he had this special love of the Spanish language. Um, so, um, for whom the bell tolls will be reading this in our class, uh, Isabel, the Spanish civil war. Uh, and Hemingway was there as a war correspondent. Um, and, but we can see that he actually got into combat situations right here. Uh, so, uh, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's really interesting to think about Hemingway. It's both a journalist and also, um, uh, uh, the novelists. Um, so this the global dimension of Hemingway, but also the global diamonds in the Spanish civil war itself. It was a civil war. It was portraying, um, two sides fighting in Spain. Um, but it was also very much an international war, um, in the sense that, uh, Russia was a part of it.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Germany was DePaul of it. Italy was positive. Um, so it very much was a gathering of, um, a lot of nations, uh, converging on the soil of Spain. Um, and fighting a war that in name was the Spanish civil war, but actually in action in terms of his castle players was very much an international war. Um, so, um, this is one level at which we can understand Hemingway, is that he really was a player, um, in a very large scale map of the world. Um, and because he was such a player on a large scale map, uh, we shouldn't be surprised that he will be going to other countries as well and love loving the Spanish language. Uh, we're taking him to Cuba. Um, so, uh, we'll be reading to have and have not, uh, which is about Cuba. Um, and this is a very, um, unforgettable image of a Hemingway and Castro.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Uh, we might not know that they were actually good friends. Uh, so this is just something that, you know, we should keep in mind as we read Hemingway. Um, and Hemingway actually, uh, the, as the war ended in 1939, um, and from 1939 to 1960, he actually lived in Cuba. Um, he wrote a lot of is uh, important novels there to oh man. And the sea was written when he was living in Cuba. So, you know, again, a very important fact to bear in mind. Um, and this is, um, the interior of his house in Cuba. Um, and I don't know, I'll put all of this, the PowerPoint on our website, so you'd be able to see the detail. But this is a cigar box there was given to Hemingway, um, and on the cigar, but the box is as a grant and Mikko the Cuba great friend of Cuba.

Speaker 1:          05:12          So he, anyway, uh, it isn't, it right now is not just an American author, but very much a Cuban, um, other, um, in Cuba. Um, so, um, we, we won't actually be talking about Castro's Cuba to have and have not actually took place earlier, but this is just a kind of a continuing relation, uh, the Hemingway has to that country. Um, so, okay. So we'll move on now to the next scale of analysis. Um, and this is the narrative experiment. Um, the very, um, striking a narrative styles that we see in this body of writing. Um, and no more so than in the sound, the fury. Um, I think that if we've read that novel, we know that it's impossible just to read it once and understand of it, right? This is kind of not really compels us to go back to read several times, um, because the level of experimentation, um, in, in that novel.

Speaker 1:          06:13          So this is from the opening of the sound of the fury and you guys probably know that there are four sections to the sound and the fury. Um, and the First Section is toe, uh, by Benji who's clinically retarded. So this is all the action is unfolding, um, in the mind of someone who's not really registering the world. Um, most of us do. So let's just see how Benji understands the world, how he takes in the world. Did you come to meet Kelly? If she said rubbing my hands, what is it? Whether you're trying to tell Kenny Kelly smell by trees and like when she says we were asleep, whether you're moaning about [inaudible], you can watch again when we get to the branch here. Here's you a Jimson a week he gave me the flower. Makes no sense, right? Right. Now it doesn't make any sense. Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:10          So I, I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that this is actually a conflation of two moments in time. The first moment takes place when Benji was just a young boy. The second I tell in Italics, um, takes place when, uh, Benji is actually 33 years old. Um, so we don't usually tell the story that way, jumping across such a vast space of time. Um, but that's exactly the kind of narrative technique to Faulkner users in the sound of fury. Um, and the numerous advantages and challenges to that kind of writing. Um, but one interesting fact that emerges from this little old moment, um, is that a young white girl, Kathy is Benji's sister, a young white girl is seen in intimate power level with a young black boy who's luster, the black servant who's taking care of Benji. So what could be the connection between a young white girl and a young black boy?

Speaker 1:          08:19          It turns out that it really has everything to do with smell. Benji love Patty and she smells like trees for him. I don't think the Bangy actually registers Kenny as a person. She's really just a smell to him. Um, and uh, it, you know, I think that most of us actually registered people in that way, you know, taking one very specific aspect of other people. But I think they're Benji, especially those that, um, so it is caddies smell that means everything in the world really to Benji. Um, and when luster gives him the Jimson with it is not exactly the smell of catty, but it's close enough. So that luster is actually the closest that Benji can get to in the very sad times when he is 33, when he's really lost everything that he loves in the wall luster and the Jimson weed is the closest they can get back to caddy.

Speaker 1:          09:17          So this is the language, the way their Faulkner's telling the story is not based on linear chronology. It is based on the logic of association in our minds. And different people have different logics of association and Benji's logic of association is completely based on the sense of smell bits on Sam as well, but then the smell and the specialist. So, um, we can tell that, uh, we can say that in some stance, Hemingway has taken us to a foreign country, you know, thing that's to stay in and to Cuba. Um, and Fargo has also taken us to a foreign country in the sense that the mind of a retarded person is the sort of foreign country to those of us who are not retarded. And this is a very interesting kind of foreign country, um, to go to, um, and to steep ourselves in. Um, so finally, um, we'll move on to the smallest possible scale, uh, which is, uh, as, as they related to what we've just seen in thought now.

Speaker 1:          10:21          Uh, but this was an early moment in the great gas VA. Um, and it is about daisy, one of the most famous characters in American literature. Um, and this is nick Carraway, the narrator talking about daisy, his cousin. Um, so nick is not retarded. He's highly intelligent, but um, his take on daisy is interesting and that is not necessarily the tech that we would have to our cousins. Think about how we think about our cousins. Probably not nothing like this. So who voice compel me forward? Breathlessly as I listen. Then the glow faded each like discerning, discerning her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk, highly idiosyncratic idiosyncrasy of, of highly intelligent person. But in many ways as unusual as Benji's my, so Nate tends to conflate different senses. He's talking about the quality of son of days a but his youth using visual images to talk about that quality of staff.

Speaker 1:          11:34          So they uses voice failing out is like children leaving the street at Das is very interesting visual image to talk about a certain quality of Sar. Why does he want to do that? Why does Fitzgeral want to write in that way? Why is it that the visual register is being involved in all to talk about all of the [inaudible]. That's one of the questions that we'll be thinking about as we move on, um, in our class. So, um, so far you've noticed, um, that I've associated one scale of analysis with one author, right? So Hemingway is associated with the largest possible scale, um, partner with kind of a middle scales and Fitzgerald with micro level. Um, it, we could do it that way. Um, but I don't really want you to get the impression, um, that one author is to be associated only with that one particular scale.

Speaker 1:          12:38          So in the rest of the lecture, what I'd like to do is to talk about one phenomenon that is across scale phenomena. That is something that invites experience on all three levels, on the largest possible scale on this mid level and smaller scale as well that all three offers talk about to some extent, maybe they don't talk about it and I kind of frontal away, uh, but they engage in, in some fashion. So it's an important event for them. Um, and it's not surprising that war should be an important event, two or three others because the body of writings that were looking at, um, really all come right after World War One. So well one is in some sense the unspoken horizon ray behind all of his writings. Um, and, uh, we'll be talking about war today and talk about war generally, um, as the most obvious level, which is large scale, uh, geopolitics.

Speaker 1:          13:39          Um, and to some extent when you have action happening on that scale, there's a kind of a loss of individual agency, um, and the narrow to a problem that comes with that. Um, this also the deep, the problem, the deformation of language, um, the way that worst get used as euphemisms in and the conditions of war. Um, and what that does to language in general. Um, and then we'll talk about war as a psyche phenomenon. Um, combat trauma and the psychology of homecoming. All this worth familiar all is, uh, just things that happen when we go to war. Um, but we'll, we'll, one is especially important to think in terms of those lives because this is in many ways the first war, uh, that, um, that that was not only fought on this scale that was unprecedented, um, but also different war strategies were being tried out.

Speaker 1:          14:39          So one of the very important features of where we're one was trench warfare. That this is really what we see here. Um, people digging themselves in and staying in those, um, trenches from months and years, really. Um, and to experience has no more than people firing at you. Um, and then being sung in month. Um, Matt is the most important, um, sensory material the people actually remember about the war. Um, well, well one is, uh, was is also important because, uh, chemical warfare was introduced. Um, and so in this image, um, we see, uh, Ashley British soldiers who suffer from poison gas. And we'll, we'll one, I'm just looking at these images. We can see that this is really not a glorious why there's no other heroic war. It is a war that is impossible to romanticize. Uh, you know, when you are stuck in those conditions, there's almost no way you can prove that you are brave person.

Speaker 1:          15:42          Personal bravery doesn't really come into play under those conditions of war. So it is a war that is impossible to feel good about. No matter how brave you are, you can get a sense of passion that comes from that kind of bravery. Um, and so, um, there are a number of consequences, uh, of that, uh, impossibility of filling, heroic in possibility of getting any kind of emotional satisfaction from fighting. Paul Fussell, who's a very, um, insightful and important critic wrote about called the Great War and modern memory. Um, and I've kind of a celebrate, uh, classic on, on one their Azure. Uh, and he, this is what he says. Well, he claims Om the primal scene is undeniably horrible, but there's irony is dynamics of host of bridge is what horns the memory. I'm saying that there seems to be one dominating form of modern understanding that it is essentially ironic that it originates in the application of mine and memory to events with a great one.

Speaker 1:          17:01          Great Warriors. Whoa, whoa one. Um, so Paul also claims that the war's structures, human experience, both those who are actually fighting and civilians back at home, where people who come back to civilian life as basically an ironic structure through which we experience the world. What does that mean? We'll be looking more to think about what it means to experience the world through the lens of Rna. Uh, but right now we can also get a little bit of what, um, first for me is just from this one passage. Uh, it has to do with the dynamics of hope's a bridge. What does it mean to live without any kind of hope for yourself or for the outcome of the war. And sometimes hope is not even linked to vegetarian, which is a really radical claim that it doesn't really matter if you're on the winning side. That doesn't really give you grounds for hope.

Speaker 1:          17:57          Why would that be the case? Um, and uh, and that, and the other claim that foster was making, um, is that RNA is basically a mental structure, the structures, our memory as well. It's not just our immediate reaction to wall when you're going through it that you can make ironic comments about things that are happening. But when you think about it, when you bring it back to your mind afterwards, that RNA is the structure by which you recall something and lift that event over again. What does it mean to have an ironic recall in relation to your own experience? Um, so let's look at Paul fussell's claim, um, through the three authors who have written a fairly memorable things about those phenomena out. And I'm very glad to be able to talk a little bit about farewell to arms. We're not reading farewell to arms in this class.

Speaker 1:          18:54          Um, some of you might have read it on your own, but this is a celebrated moment, um, in farewell to arms, um, talking about the effect of war on language and how it makes it impossible for us to use certain words. I was always, this is the protagonist Fredrick Henry. I was always embarrassed by the worst, sacred, glorious and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them sometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot. So the only, the shower it worse came through and had read them on proclamations now for a long time. And I had seen nothing sacred and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like stop loss as Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to Barry, yet abstract was or just glory, honor, courage or hello work have seen beside the concrete needs of villagers, the number of regimens and a days is as Hemingway writing in their world to arms.

Speaker 1:          20:05          But in some sense, this really disrupts the whole pan in way that we know, right? The importance of days, the importance of places, um, the importance of numbers. Um, this is alive long habit for him in where, and here we can sometimes see the origins of that way of writing the fairy queen very economical, very not really kind of writing, um, in is in some sense a response to the circumstances of war is almost as if warm makes it impossible to do a romantic kind of writing. And Hemingway's writing is the kind of the counterpoint to a flowery, uh, to heroic, to romantic kind of writing. So on the level of use of was, so it was just becoming impossible to use. But I think that, um, irony also extends to a larger scale, uh, which has to do really with the way we tell a story, whether or not we can tell the story in a straightforward fashion.

Speaker 1:          21:09          And Paul offers or suggest, and I like to test this with Hemingway, is whether or not after World War One, it is still possible to tell story in a completely linear, straight forward fashion. Um, is there something about war that makes it almost necessary in order to tell the story from the side tower in a truncated version, tell it in a jumbled version as we've seen in Bangi, um, or tell it in some way that is mixed up, you know, all those things that we recognize knowledge, all three authors, maybe it has to do with what. So right now I've sort of just outlined, you know, some things to look for as we're reading this office. One is the twisted logic of events, um, and um, that things are just not working out, not landing where we will expect them to land. Um, the possibility of symmetry of blame, which seems the logical consequence when we have no heroes.

Speaker 1:          22:12          Um, and our focus retelling of the past, not looking at the events frontally but looking at Lurie fashion. Um, and then there could be some point in being blurred. Usually being very is not a narrative advantage, but it could be that under some circumstances, learners is actually a cultivated effect and is designed to do something, you know, so the work that has been done by being the lyric, um, understanding as we know something about ray, how many ways is famous for that, I'm just being totally, um, giving us the minimal expression, um, understand the emotions, um, and then the possibility of content until we've outcome. So this is just a kind of schematic way of laying out some of the things that we're looking for. Um, that will test once again, um, by looking at specific passages. Uh, so you know, I just said that Hemingway Fitzgerald, Faulkner or engage well or one in some fashion, but I should qualify that by saying that the engagement is sometimes quite oblique.

Speaker 1:          23:16          So Hemingway actually fought in world war one. He was an ambulance driver. Um, and so he did, he was actually in the war. Um, but he got one that very quickly, he got wounded after a few months. He was oh, of commissions and the rest of the ward. So he didn't actually experience one on one in any of the way. Um, and even though he, he talks about, well one and farewell to arms, really his deepest experience of war is a war that came a little later, which is the Greco, the Turkish war of a horrendous event. Um, I think it's safe to say that there really is there no good guys and that in that war, both the toast and agrees with equally reprehensible. Um, this is an image of the burning or smirk now, um, 1922 and the first story that we'll be reading in our time is on the CI as well.

Speaker 1:          24:12          So this is the background to that Hemingway story. Um, and I'll be reading you, um, two passages by Hemingway to think about what irony means for Hemingway. Uh, for us, what this is an image of the leader on the Turkish side and he's actually our to Turk is actually the founder of Turkey of present day Turkey. So a very important historic figure that also actually figures in Hanaway's account of that war. Um, so this is, um, having way this passage is having weight. Once again going to cover the Greco Turkish war as a war correspondent, he was writing for the Toronto Star. Um, and this is the, uh, news article that he sent to the Toronto Star. It is oil to come out [inaudible] and company one Mesopotamia for and it is oil that Great Britain was to keep my circle 10 the authority. So the ears that is disappointed and canal a salad because he shows no indication to plunge into the fanatical holy war me yet get the warrant from Kamala, the businessmen.

Speaker 1:          25:29          Okay. So there's actually has a kind of current residents as well oil your is um, and um, was frustrating about Ataturk, um, to um, this, the, the religious side, it's not an exam is that he turns out not to be your fanatic at all. He's totally cool and completely deliberate and deliberative in his mouth. It's not going to plug it into any hand. Why is water so you're not going to get someone fighting as fanatical religious war. War is not going to happen because of religious fanaticism. What is going to happen because of the economic rationale as he coming from the importance was that is really the irony that Hemingway as a war correspondent is pointing to is there some, was a highly rational, we can't really say that it's irrational. While we can really say that the war is bad because it's irrational because some was a highly rational, and this is supremely ironical.

Speaker 1:          26:36          Hemingway is non approval war. All he's saying is that this, this award and it's driven by economic rationality. So this is one side of RNA is that things are not lining up. The good guys don't look like good guys and the bad guys or bad guys, not because they look like the bad guy that we would expect them with expect bad guys to look like. So it's just, and it happens. A largest possible scale. It's really the global geopolitics of war that's creating this monster that is Arthur too, but who was also a model of economic rationality. Um, so the other, um, I've bit of irony of voice actually what we'll be reading is the first story in, in our time on the key. A smirk. No. Uh, and this is the concluding paragraph of that story. The Greeks were Nice chaps to the losing side.

Speaker 1:          27:31          The Greeks were nice chaps to when they evacuated, they had all the baggage animals they couldn't take off with them. So they just broke the four legs and dump them into the shallow water. All those muse, the four legs broken push over into the shallow water. It was all pleasant business. My work. Yes, the most pleasant business. So, so much for the brutality of the Turks and so much for the victim hood of 10 weeks. Fixing Hood is something that actually extend from those who experience it into a condition they can. They then then confer on other people. There's no glory. There's no moral advantage to being a victim in the war because the victims of justice reprehensible as vectors. So this was really, I think that what Paul means by saying that, that this really an abridgment of hole in a wall like this is that we can't really go and fight for the weeks, you know, because they are the victims of the Turkish aggressive.

Speaker 1:          28:43          We can't really say that because the Greeks are aggressive to the aggressors on their own muse, on their own, um, animals or transportation. Um, so it's, it is, um, a world in which that is in some sense that has been emptied or moral meaning empty, the moral virtue. Um, and to the extent that that makes it impossible to take size with NSL satisfaction is very, very desolate landscape, emotional as well as moral landscape. So this is really what irony means for Hemingway is that it is an impossible place to inhabit. It is unbearable to talk about it directly. It was straightforward way. And the only way you can talk about it, it's being ironic and using, talking about it in a particular tone of voice. So very important component of RNA is to tone of voice that says our census. I'm pulling this, we'll use our ears to, to Hemingway as we read these words on the page.

Speaker 1:          29:44          Um, so let's move on now, um, to Fitzgerald and the Great Gatsby Fitzgerald, um, Ashley, um, did not have, um, a very extensive, um, experience of world war one either. He actually, um, and he, he enlisted but he didn't actually get to fight in world war one. So this is a really interesting, um, reaction of someone who wants to talk about the war, as in some sense the central event of his generation. Um, but we, we didn't actually have a kind of a personal acquaintance, uh, without central event. So this is from the great Gatsby theme. Um, and uh, is, uh, at this point, uh, we haven't been introduced to Gaspe right, because you guys know that nick Carraway is the one who's been telling the story for good part of the time as the great Gatsby begins, and he's just meeting this fellow, um, that he's making conversation with your face is familiar.

Speaker 1:          30:41          He said politely once you in the first division in a war while yes, I was in a 28 infantry. I was in the 16th until June, 1918. I knew, I've seen you somewhere before we talk for a moment about some wet gray little villages in France. Okay. I can tell you, we can go to the gas and see that this is taken from the great Gatsby, but it could have been written by Hemingway. Right, exactly. All those points that he makes, if they were to arms about important of the number of your division dates, places Fitzgerald rise exactly as Hemingway. So has people would write under conditions because those are the only details completely on the emotional, factual play numbers playing geographical facts. Those are the only things you can bear to name because to name anything else is in some sense an insult to your own experience.

Speaker 1:          31:48          And in South Sioux English language. Um, so I don't think that, you know, most of us actually talk thing about the great Gatsby, um, as a war novel and it is not. So don't, you know, don't think that I'm trying to create a reading of the great Gatsby based on the importance of over one note, uh, is a one that one novel. Um, but it is difficult that this person, that nick is talking to his gas Gatsby of course, and that they do have world war one in common, that they both actually were combat soldiers in World War One. Um, and that's part of the bond between Nate and gas pain, what it means for that to be beginning of a relationship between the two of them. Um, so in that sense, the great Gatsby is shadow by Whoa, whoa one. And we can think of various ways in which one or the phenomenon of war functions as a shadow and unspoken, barely alluded to, but nonetheless, not inconsequential, not trivial event that we should bear in mind this week.

Speaker 1:          32:55          Read on about Gatsby and the bottle neck. Um, so one other, um, finally shouldn't be surprised that we'll be moving on to Faulkner. Um, and I should tell you something about Faulkner, which is, um, really vary on the heroic. I mean, we've been talking about, one is a very unheroic out war, but, um, foreigners own conduct. Um, it's especially on heroic father actually went to Canada in 1918 to list in the Royal Air Force. Um, so he enlisted, never saw action. Um, his brother actually was seriously wounded in world war one. Um, but for the rest of his life, farming actually claim that he fought. He fought in world war one. There's not something that he claimed for awhile, you know, not like 19, 19 or 19, 2019 for these three is still claiming to his nephew that he was in action in, well, we'll want me, this is kind of a shocking fact about Vulcan.

Speaker 1:          34:07          I don't know what to do with that except that this just bear in his biography. So, uh, Faulkner writes to his nephew, Jimmy Faulkner. Um, I would have liked for you to have had my dog tag Royal Air Force, but I lost it in Europe, in Germany. I think that the Gestapo has it. I'm very likely on the records right now. It's a dead brother's flying officer spy. So, um, well, I mean, you know, it's, um, that's just a fact and we can do what we want with that. Um, Faulkner did write a novel, um, Carl, um, soldiers, uh, home. Uh, it, um, I'll, I'll give you the reference. His, his, his, his fits first novel. Um, it's actually about a veteran coming back. Um, so I will put that on, on the, on, on the website. Um, so he actually does write about what we're one, uh, but, um, he, for, for the most part, he's not known as someone who writes about whoa one.

Speaker 1:          35:12          Um, and instead, um, he actually, uh, we can say that there are shadows of a war in of Whoa, one in ice writings about the American civil war, which is obviously what is appropriate to partner to write about. Um, and he's not making anything up when he's writing about the American civil war. But what is interesting about Faulkner's writing about the American civil war is that after three orders, war is actually only five minutes. Ashley, the only order that gives us who gives us a huge growing, idealistic, possibly romantic image of someone who did not fight in Whoa, whoa. One can actually give us a utopian account of war. I think that is interesting that Hemingway would not be capable of writing anything like this. Even about the civil war though he's idealistic by the civil war as well. Um, partner is the only person because of his complicated relation to all one there for him.

Speaker 1:          36:27          The civil war is actually in the affirmative moment in a kind of twisted counter intuitive when, so this is a novel. Um, W won't be reading, but it's a great novel. So I encourage you to read this on your own if you have a chance after this class. Um, but it's, it's um, is about, is really about the civil wars, the background to the novel or in the sense that it doesn't really appear in it. Um, but a good part of it, um, some of it is about the women left behind. Um, and I'll just read you this moment and then we can talk about it. Now. There's two white women and a negress, not as three Negros are three wise now even it's three women, but merely as three creatures who still possessed in need to eat but took no pleasure in it, the need to sleep but from no joy in awareness or regeneration.

Speaker 1:          37:26          We grew intended and harvested with our own hands, the food we ate made and work that garden just as we cope and ate the food which came out of it with no distinction amount of three of us of age or color. It was as though we were one being interchangeable. And in this remanent um, we already have seen in the sound of the fury that for the races to be interchangeable and in this women in between Kelly and luster is a good thing for far right. And for here, the civil war is what enables that breakdown of racial distinction to take phase. Usually interchangeable is not really a good quality. Um, for, for us it's an insult to our individuality. Um, but here it is under the circumstances of their probation when all you can do is just to keep your body flows, just to make sure that um, you can put something into your, when that is the basic condition of life and when everyone has to work towards the fulfillment of that condition, um, then raise really doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          38:48          So this is a really, um, for Faulkner really emblematic moment. Um, when wise as well as blacks have to work just as hard. That labor is just a given for the mysteries as for the slaves. Um, and when there's just complete commingling of lives, um, in, in, in, in, in every aspect of daily life. Um, for Faulkner that is one of the consequences of the civil war is that even though there is a battle going on, um, and deadly consequences, the battle, um, that are dividing the nation in one sense, you know, nothing can be more divisive than still, even though the nation is being torn apart by war. The real is strange kind of healing, a strange kind of unity. This coming from that division, which is the very local, very personal, everyday unity between those who are left behind to 10 for themselves and the necessity of acting as one.

Speaker 1:          39:58          So it's three people, blacks and whites acting as one and war as the necessary condition. It's really the genetic ground for that kind of configuration of three people acting as if they were of one mind and one body. It is a soup, keenly Utopian vision for war. Um, and ironically both for good and new [inaudible] Faulkner who never fought in world war one who is capable of imagining that Utopian, um, a possibility. So, you know, I would say that that this is a kind of RNA that Paul Fussell wasn't really thinking about reflux for him. Irony basically as a kind of a negative anomaly. But I would argue that we can actually also expand poff Aso's those inside to say that the irony of war is such that one of the counter intuitive outcomes will actually include an affirmative understanding of war. Um, and actually we see this all the time.

Speaker 1:          40:57          The bond amount, comrades, he will, you know, gis bonding. That's just a phenomenon that we know about. Um, and we're following is really talking about in some sense is the similar bond amount, the women, um, similar Paolo to this kind of important emotional and social bond under conditions of great divisiveness of all, which is to show that there's actually no good resting clothes. Um, and this is really what I was saying about all three of others is that, you know, I think that all of us want to bring to rest at some point and, you know, they do come to rest in our own minds. Um, but I think that it's always possible to give yet another twist to interpretation, uh, while it's going on and the range of possibilities that emerge from any one event. Um, so this really was wonderful and challenging about those authors.

Speaker 1:          41:54          Is that something that seems to come to an end one level, Ashley? You know, if we just look at the largest hospital level in a divisiveness, um, on the level of Oomph, geopolitics, uh, it turns out that this actually unify and level on a much smaller scale. Right? So what is, was themes a tragedy? Um, on one level can turn into a kind of a comedy of those straight, straightforward along the either the comedy in the sense that allowing some hope to emerge. So I would have met Paul Fussell's, uh, argument about their brichman of hope in some way as well. Is that yes, there is an abridgment of hope, but there's also the possible reconstitution of hope, um, and what we're seeing in absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, in some sense, the reconstitution of hope. So I'm good. Stop right here. Um, and once again, um, those of you who didn't get to came in late, let me just say that I'll be talking a little bit about writing in this class. This class fulfills the railing and requirement and also as all of you to sign both the signup sheet and also put down on the index cards, uh, your preferences for sections.
