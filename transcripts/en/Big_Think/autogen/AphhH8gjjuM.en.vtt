here's a here's a question that you know
 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.720
here's a here's a question that you know
a little bit riskier but I think could

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730
a little bit riskier but I think could
 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.029
a little bit riskier but I think could
be an interesting one and that is for

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039
be an interesting one and that is for
 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.580
be an interesting one and that is for
people to think about ask the question

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590
people to think about ask the question
 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.020

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040
chance and you could do this at a
 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.860
chance and you could do this at a
workshop you could be asking people to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870
workshop you could be asking people to
 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.010
workshop you could be asking people to
think about whether the diversity we

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020
think about whether the diversity we
 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.979
think about whether the diversity we
have around the table whether enough

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989
