[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:10.978
SARI KATZ: You want to
just come sit with me?

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:12.432
Yeah.

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:13.473
GIGI GORGEOUS: Which one?

00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:14.480
You're over here?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.510
SARI KATZ: I feel like
this is going to be

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.593
a little bit tough for me.

00:00:16.593 --> 00:00:18.066
Let's see if I can do it.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:18.990
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yo,
let's hike her up.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.823
SARI KATZ: I got it.

00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:20.400
I got it.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.250
Hi, everybody.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.600
My name is Sari Katz, and
I am on the YouTube Content

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.040
Partnerships team.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.871
It is my pleasure and absolute
honor to get to work with Gigi.

00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:33.120
We've been working together
for like, what, two years?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.350
GIGI GORGEOUS: I was
going to say three.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.100
SARI KATZ: OK, maybe three.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.725
Actually, you're right.

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:36.130
GIGI GORGEOUS:
Yeah, a long time.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.400
SARI KATZ: You're right, and
you didn't remember this,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.100
but the first time we
did an interview together

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.370
was May of 20--

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.730
what are we now, 2017?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.759
So May 2014.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:47.800
GIGI GORGEOUS: In Canada.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.675
SARI KATZ: In Canada.

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:49.730
We're both Canadians.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.860
Any proud-- yes, yes!

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.236
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes!

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:53.230
SARI KATZ: Some proud
Canadians in the room!

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.240
GIGI GORGEOUS:
Now we're talking.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.750
SARI KATZ: That's right.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.170
That's right.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.405
Everybody else can just leave.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:57.613
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah, exactly.

00:00:57.613 --> 00:00:59.640
SARI KATZ: This is
a welcome space.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.150
So yes, so I hope most,
if not all, of you

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.650
are familiar with the
lovely Gigi Lazzarato,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.720
otherwise known
as Gigi Gorgeous.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.270
If you're not, Gigi's got
almost, what, 3 million

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.280
subs on YouTube now?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.071
GIGI GORGEOUS: Mhm.

00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.410
SARI KATZ: That's right,
360 something million

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.480
views on her channel.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.250
Gigi is a beacon of
positivity and beauty

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.000
and has been an incredible
inspiration to her fans

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.950
and the family at YouTube.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.790
So we've already welcomed
her, but welcome, Gigi.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.714
GIGI GORGEOUS:
Thanks for having me.

00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:36.119
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.009
SARI KATZ: Yay.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.300
So why don't we start off by
talking about your YouTube

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.480
channel?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.313
GIGI GORGEOUS: Cool.

00:01:40.313 --> 00:01:42.480
SARI KATZ: So what inspired
you to start on YouTube?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.896
GIGI GORGEOUS: I was actually
really bored in high school.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.600
I went to a Catholic school, so
I was in a uniform every day.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.530
We only had one day out of the
month to dress how we wanted.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.860
So I had a lot of creativity.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.490
And I had actually just
stopped competitive diving.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.394
I was national
champion in Canada.

00:01:57.394 --> 00:01:59.310
So I was kind of like,
at the top of the game.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160
I was on the way
to the Olympics.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.952
But I just fell out of
love with the sport.

00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:05.326
I was just like, really, I
don't want to do this anymore.

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:06.702
So I quit, just
full turkey quit.

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:07.909
Everyone was like, oh my god.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:08.630
What the hell?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.213
What is she going
to do with her life?

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:11.960
So I was in high
school, socializing.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.080
I finally had a social
life, because I was diving

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.370
all the time, practicing.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.820
So I saw Michelle Phan, who
actually is a makeup artist.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.440
And she is so talented.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.770
She kills it.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.020
And I saw her YouTube channel.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.910
And I was like, I want
to start doing makeup.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.230
So I stole my mom's makeup
and tested it out online.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.750
And I kept on uploading.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.597
I kept on growing,
as did the website.

00:02:34.597 --> 00:02:35.430
SARI KATZ: Yep, yep.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.560
Do you remember
your first video?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.393
GIGI GORGEOUS: I do.

00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:40.780
It was sitting on my bedroom
floor with my digital camera.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.890
I think it was like, you
know, so old, not cute at all.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.140
Couldn't see what I was doing.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.810
And then I just put it online.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.820
I forget what I edited with,
but I put it in the fastest

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.940
fast forward I could.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.394
And then I put Rihanna's
"Disturbia," the song--

00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:55.340
SARI KATZ: Uh oh.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.715
GIGI GORGEOUS:
--behind it, which

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:58.110
was my favorite jam at the time.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.110
And yeah, that was my first one.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.020
And then I think I did
makeup collections.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.270
Then it kind of
transitioned into lifestyle.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.730
I started talking about my
life, what I was going through,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.960
not just strictly makeup.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.730
And now those are
my favorite videos

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.380
to do, sitting down and talking.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.130
SARI KATZ: To do more
of the lifestyle?

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.610
Yep, I know.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.630
I do love your story times.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.590
GIGI GORGEOUS: Thanks.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.120
SARI KATZ: If anyone's
not familiar, again,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.290
go watch Gigi's channel.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.870
It's amazing.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.580
So nowadays, other
than your life,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.260
where do you get
inspiration from?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.220
Where do you come up
with all your ideas?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.850
GIGI GORGEOUS: I've honestly--

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.250
I get inspiration everywhere.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.380
I would say mostly from the
people I surround myself with.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.000
My best friends, they're all
very creative and extroverts.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.280
You know, we love just
creating random stuff.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.319
My girlfriend-- in nature, if
I see a cute little flower,

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.860
I don't know.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.856
SARI KATZ: What about
other YouTubers?

00:03:49.856 --> 00:03:51.980
Are there any really
inspirational YouTubers to you

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.480
now?

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.305
Who do you watch?

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:54.680
GIGI GORGEOUS:
Oh, I'm obsessed--

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.300
OK, well, she's not
really a YouTuber.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.620
Her stuff is posted online.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.330
But Wendy Williams--

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.710
I'm obsessed with her.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.750
It sounds so silly, but
I just have to catch up

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.280
with her all the time.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.890
I love Liz, obviously.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.620
I love Casey.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.870
SARI KATZ: Yes, Casey Neistat.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.661
GIGI GORGEOUS: Casey's
really fun to watch.

00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:12.530
Yeah, and it's not
anything up my alley,

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.390
but it's just fun to
see what he's up to.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.829
And I've worked with
him before for Samsung.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.620
SARI KATZ: Oh, yes.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.970
I remember.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.279
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes, which
I think is still a secret.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.820
I don't know.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.019
SARI KATZ: No, no, no.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.831
Not anymore.

00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:22.330
Not anymore.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.810
GIGI GORGEOUS: My bad.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.780
I love other story
times on YouTube.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.010
I think it's really fun.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.124
Yeah, I honestly
really watch everybody.

00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:32.540
I'm like, subscribed
to everybody.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.425
And I just scroll
through and watch.

00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:36.110
SARI KATZ: There's so much.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.120
What about if you could
choose one person that

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.340
doesn't have a YouTube channel?

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.159
Who would you wish
to start a channel?

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.700
GIGI GORGEOUS: Hm,
that's a good one.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.730
I would say, honestly, for
anyone that's watched my film,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.550
everyone's obsessed with my dad.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.380
So like, they're like,
oh my god, I really

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.390
want your dad to have a
Twitter or an Instagram.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.340
And I'm like, he's 50 plus.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.740
He's not trying to do all that.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.698
But I would love my dad
to have a YouTube, just

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:01.970
because he has inspired
so many parents out there.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.280
And I'm sure he has a
shit ton of questions

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.520
that he could get asked and
he could answer and help

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.840
the world.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.300
SARI KATZ: We will get to more
of your dad later tonight.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.460
Because if you
haven't seen the film,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.020
I'm not going to say he's like--

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.830
GIGI GORGEOUS: He's
the star of the show.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.466
[LAUGHS]

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:18.590
We're just going to say it.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.160
He really is.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.750
He really is.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.330
He really is.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.470
SARI KATZ: But no, he is also
just totally inspirational.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.540
And again, we'll get to that.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.670
But he's a wonderful,
wonder-- and in person, he's

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.961
just wonderful human being too.

00:05:29.961 --> 00:05:32.600
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah,
he's a sweetheart.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.760
SARI KATZ: What about
the impact that YouTube

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.777
has had on your life?

00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:38.110
So you've had a major impact
on a ton of people's lives.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.074
And we'll get to that.

00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:41.240
But what about the impact
that YouTube as a platform

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.209
has had on your life?

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.250
GIGI GORGEOUS: It's had
a huge impact on my life.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.610
I don't think that I wouldn't
be where I'm at right now

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.750
without the website.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.870
Because I feel like
in my life growing up,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.760
I knew that I was different.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.400
And I always felt like I
was different or special

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.030
in a way, rather
than the other people

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.640
at my school, or my family, or
my best friends, or whatever.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.265
And I think that
YouTube worked as kind

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:05.570
of like a little bit
of a therapist for me

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.800
without me knowing it.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.310
I would just talk about
what I was going through,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.810
answer questions from people.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.490
But in turn, it
was really helping

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.970
my growth and my
being self aware.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.970
And I think YouTube does
that for a lot of people,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.770
unconsciously.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.230
It just happens, because
you really are expressing,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.090
and you're talking,
and you're engaging.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.330
And it definitely helped
me with my transition,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.040
because it held me accountable.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.400
When I put up that video
saying that I am transgender,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.920
it was kind of just my telling
the world, telling my family,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.110
telling everybody
that watched the video

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.490
that this is who I am.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.874
And I was to be held accountable
for it, which it really,

00:06:44.874 --> 00:06:46.040
really helped in that sense.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.355
SARI KATZ: Yeah, do
you go back and watch--

00:06:47.355 --> 00:06:48.684
do you go watch those videos?

00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:50.100
GIGI GORGEOUS: I
really don't, no.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.430
SARI KATZ: No?

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.240
GIGI GORGEOUS: No.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.280
I feel like I made
so many mistakes

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.670
along the way with things I
said, things I joked about.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.830
It's just kind of cringe worthy.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.299
So I just keep it moving.

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:01.590
SARI KATZ: Keep moving forward?

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.830
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.990
SARI KATZ: But again, all
learnings, like you said.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.560
GIGI GORGEOUS: Totally.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.000
SARI KATZ: OK, that's good.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.550
GIGI GORGEOUS: No regrets.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.730
SARI KATZ: No regrets.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.563
GIGI GORGEOUS: But don't
want to harp on it.

00:07:08.563 --> 00:07:09.390
[LAUGHING]

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.630
SARI KATZ: Fair enough.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.450
So to someone that hasn't seen
your channel-- which again,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.930
I'm sure everybody has--

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.760
how would you
describe your channel?

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.460
How would you describe
the Gigi Gorgeous brand?

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.800
GIGI GORGEOUS: Honestly,
I'd just say my brand,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.560
or my channel, is just my life.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.759
I really, really don't
hold very much back.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.550
Recently I've been
doing a lot of traveling

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.320
for the film, and for
vacations, and whatever.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.590
And I've just
picked up the camera

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.150
and filmed my adventures.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.510
And I feel like you really are
getting an inside look into me.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.587
I think before, like in past
years, I was very proper,

00:07:43.587 --> 00:07:45.420
and I would sit down
in front of the camera,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.400
say what I had to say,
and then I'd check out.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.280
But after the film
came out, I think

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.757
it's just-- we called it "This
Is Everything" two reasons.

00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:54.090
Because it really is everything.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.423
We're not holding anything back.

00:07:55.423 --> 00:07:58.620
All facets of my life
are there for you

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.790
to see-- my family, everything,
the good, the bad, the ugly.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.360
And now I feel like it's
just everyone knows who I am.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.980
And I'm not trying
to hide anymore.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.865
So sometimes you
get a makeup video.

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:11.240
Sometimes you get
a travel video.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.300
Sometimes you get a
story time, whatever.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:13.800
You know?

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.970
SARI KATZ: Yeah, no one can
ever say that you are not

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.825
being yourself.

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:18.630
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah,
because I've always

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.730
said from the
beginning, anything fake

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.230
really never lasts very long.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.999
So even if you are being fake
about something here or there,

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:27.040
I feel like people will
catch on and they'll see.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.500
So even if people
don't like you,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.101
just be real, because there's
going to be people who will.

00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:33.059
And those are the people
you want to be around.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.169
SARI KATZ: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.059
That's the people you
surround yourself with.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.933
What about how you engage
with your audience?

00:08:37.933 --> 00:08:39.570
So obviously a huge
part of YouTube

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.360
is the fan culture,
social media in general.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.700
So how do you engage with
your audience both online

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.650
and in real life?

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.870
GIGI GORGEOUS: My
audience and my supporters

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.990
and my consistent viewers
mean the world to me.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.582
It is like profound
how much they

00:08:53.582 --> 00:08:55.290
mean to me, because
they've helped me out

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.810
of some of the darkest
points in my life.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.310
I don't even know
if I would be here

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.940
without them kind of stuff.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.950
And I think I keep
in touch with them--

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.840
well, just speaking
as of recently, we've

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.500
done a shit ton of
screenings for the film.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.150
We just came back
from the Middle East.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.920
It just feels like
we're nonstop.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.530
And to see their reactions
and to hug them and hear

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.890
their stories before,
after, during the film

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.364
is so special to me.

00:09:21.364 --> 00:09:24.030
You know, I'm the kind of person
that will log onto my Instagram

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.139
and reply on DMs and stuff
like that, but I'm more of an

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:27.930
in the moment girl.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.800
So I love seeing people, hearing
their stories face to face.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.020
So whenever I get a chance
to do a meet and greet

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.050
or a screen viewing, I'm
just like all over that.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:37.770
I'm like, yep.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.520
[SNAPS] I'm there.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.270
What do I wear?

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.040
Let's have fun.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.730
SARI KATZ: What's the outfit?

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.380
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.140
What's the look?

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.639
Number one.

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:44.100
SARI KATZ: What's the look?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.690
And we'll talk a little bit
more about Sundance later on.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.770
But that happened
at Sundance, right,

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.679
with the person in the audience
that raised their hand?

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:53.970
And where did you end up going?

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.250
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes!

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.500
OK, so really, really fast,
this is like a 20 minute story.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.360
I'm going to make
it like, a minute.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.330
SARI KATZ: Short story.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.210
GIGI GORGEOUS: So we had a
question and answer moment

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.355
after the film at Sundance.

00:10:01.355 --> 00:10:02.730
I had seen it for
the first time.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.897
I was in a 30 pound
dress, just you know--

00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:06.230
I had no idea what I was in for.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.116
SARI KATZ: She's not joking.

00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:07.560
GIGI GORGEOUS: Crying.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.143
Like 30 pounds, like actually--
with like a slit, like a gown.

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:12.300
No one else was dressed up.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.350
[LAUGHING]

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.350
My family was there.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.300
My best friends were there.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.716
Barbara, the
director of the film,

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.530
called everyone up on stage
for a Q&amp;A. This young boy,

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.090
like 16 years old,
he's like, hey, I

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.340
run a GSA, a Gay Straight
Alliance, at my high school,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.770
and not many people want to
join, and I don't know why.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.145
What can I do to
raise more awareness?

00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:31.170
Everyone thinks that
I'm weird at my school.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.950
And I want the straight
people at my school

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:39.332
to join, to be an ally, and to
give my alliance more backing.

00:10:39.332 --> 00:10:41.290
So I was like, well,
where do you go to school?

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.119
He's like, Malibu.

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:43.410
I was like, are you kidding me?

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.110
You're in Park City and
you go to school in Malibu?

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.070
I'll just come over.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.400
I love Malibu.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.305
[LAUGHING]

00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:54.430
SARI KATZ: Nobu on the way.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.950
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah, right?

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.780
I was like, well, yeah, I'll
just do Nobu right after.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.636
Like, it's so fun.

00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:01.020
[LAUGHING]

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.442
So we ended up coordinating, and
I ended up keeping my promise.

00:11:04.442 --> 00:11:06.150
I went over to his
school, and the school

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.800
did this whole huge assembly.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.430
It was ridiculous.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.850
But we had an open conversation.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.070
And I totally saw the
energy in the room

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.000
shifting from the
beginning, because I

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.577
know like how high school is.

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:19.160
You want to get out
of class and like,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.222
fuck this, whatever,
this is an assembly.

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.680
But all of them
never really cared.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.055
And then when we
started talking,

00:11:24.055 --> 00:11:25.180
everyone was attentive.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.555
And we had a
question and answer.

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:28.830
And we had people coming
up saying, like, you know,

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.750
I'm bisexual, and
I've never really said

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.520
that ever before,
or like, you know,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.249
I want to transition--
like really powerful stuff.

00:11:35.249 --> 00:11:37.790
And to hear that in high school
was just so rewarding for me.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.410
And I was just like, you know,
I want to do a school tour.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.720
This really is everything.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.574
This is like why I did the film.

00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:46.490
SARI KATZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.180
And obviously there's
a lot of pressure

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.070
on you, right, as a
voice in the community.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:52.861
GIGI GORGEOUS: Mhm.

00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:56.240
SARI KATZ: Do you ever feel that
weight, being in the spotlight?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.090
Do you ever feel like there's
things that you have to say,

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.600
things you should be saying,
things that you're not saying?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.350
What is that like?

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.516
GIGI GORGEOUS: There's
definitely a lot of pressure.

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:08.750
And it sucks, because no one
should feel pressure, I feel.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.460
You should just be able to live.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.800
But I think that there's
a lot of pressure

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.730
right now just on anybody in the
community to know everything,

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.690
to do more.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.160
I really never feel like I'm
doing enough or saying enough.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.830
But at the end of
the day how I keep

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.290
my sanity is I just
speak from what I know

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.030
and what I've been through.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.640
Because I've never really
tried to be the person

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.880
that's smarter than everybody
or trying to preach to you.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.860
There's plenty of
other people like that.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.840
I'm just trying to have
fun and give advice

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.800
on things that I know.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.760
SARI KATZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.460
Share your story as a way
to inspire others and a way

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.967
to make people feel comfortable.

00:12:41.967 --> 00:12:42.800
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.170
SARI KATZ: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:50.810
How did you make the decision
to come out on YouTube?

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.600
GIGI GORGEOUS: It was
a really hard decision.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.380
I think my mother's passing
when I was 19 years old

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.850
was just the kind of kick in
the ass that I needed that--

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.700
it was really a
turning point for me.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.060
If you're going to waste
days on days on days,

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.950
you're just going to
end up being unhappy.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.970
And I knew that I
wanted to do this.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.030
So I think after I told my close
friends and I told my family,

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.790
I really just
decided to drive it

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.454
home and go full balls
to the wall on YouTube

00:13:19.454 --> 00:13:20.870
and just tell
everybody who I was.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.720
Because even if I didn't talk
to them every day, even if they

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.700
were a complete stranger
to me, at least people

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.357
would know that
that's who I was.

00:13:27.357 --> 00:13:29.690
And that's what I was talking
about earlier with holding

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.890
myself accountable.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.580
It really did.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.202
YouTube really-- once you
post it, it's out there.

00:13:34.202 --> 00:13:35.660
SARI KATZ: There's
no turning back.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.930
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah,
there's no turning back.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.388
SARI KATZ: There's
no turning back.

00:13:38.388 --> 00:13:40.280
And we just talked
about, you don't go back

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.000
and you don't watch your videos,
but you started your channel

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.930
as Gregory.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.730
And you've left most, if not
all, of the content up there.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.532
Why make the decision
to leave it there?

00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:52.740
GIGI GORGEOUS: It's so weird.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.226
It was never really a
decision that I had to make.

00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:56.850
I didn't really think
about, oh my god,

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.250
should I take all this down?

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.340
Because I'm not an
insecure person.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.680
I want to leave
all that stuff up

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.000
because it makes me who I am.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.465
And it's also-- I worked
hard on those videos.

00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:08.590
SARI KATZ: You [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.756
GIGI GORGEOUS: I spent so
much time doing that shit.

00:14:10.756 --> 00:14:11.540
SARI KATZ: Yep.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.420
GIGI GORGEOUS: So I have
taken a few videos down

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.460
because I don't
agree with what I

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.200
was saying in them necessarily.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.870
I can't really even remember the
videos off the top of my head,

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.580
but I know I have
taken a few down.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.990
But all the rest are up there.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.830
That's how I came to be.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.010
And at the end of
the day, it's just

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.779
about being confident
and owning it.

00:14:29.779 --> 00:14:31.070
I'm not a different person now.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.590
I know a lot of transgender
girls, especially,

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.824
they'll go away for a
year and then come back

00:14:35.824 --> 00:14:36.740
as a different person.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.110
And it's like, if you need
to do that, that's fine.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.250
But I don't think that that's
necessarily the most honest way

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.961
to be happy.

00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:44.960
Do you know what I mean?

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.260
It's much more powerful to
just let it all hang out

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:48.980
and just be you.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.480
SARI KATZ: Just let
it all hang out.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.730
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.155
SARI KATZ: No, that's great.

00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:54.530
Again, it takes
a lot of courage.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.980
And it just represents
who you are as a person.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.150
What was the reception,
not just amongst your fans,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.580
but amongst the LGBTQ community
when you did come out?

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.760
What's been the
reception like for you?

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.980
GIGI GORGEOUS: It was
really, really positive.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.230
I think a lot of people were
kind of caught off guard.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.720
Because I remember-- it's
honestly kind of hard

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.950
to remember, even though
it was only six years ago.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.700
I remember a lot of people--
because I was always really,

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.680
really like beat.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.850
My face was always done.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.350
And I was always
in girls' clothing.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.580
And I just had insisted, no,
I don't want to be a girl.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.320
No I don't want
to-- because it was

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.670
something I was asked a lot.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.760
So I think people online
and people in my real life--

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.700
like, my dad was kind of
just like, well, what?

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.660
Now you want to be?

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.490
Like, what?

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.820
That's not fair.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.180
What are you talking about?

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.460
So I think a lot of
people were shocked.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.084
But I think a lot of
people were happy,

00:15:45.084 --> 00:15:48.344
just because I think they saw
that I was realizing my truth.

00:15:48.344 --> 00:15:50.510
And I think that even if
they weren't happy about it

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.376
at first, I think in videos to
come, and in months to come,

00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:56.000
I think they were like, oh, this
is actually who she really is.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.170
SARI KATZ: Yeah.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:02.120
And when you were growing up--

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.430
the way you represent
for young people today

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.590
a voice in the community, was
there anyone in your world,

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.577
in your universe, that sort
of represented that for you?

00:16:11.577 --> 00:16:12.860
GIGI GORGEOUS: Honestly, no.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.040
I think nowadays
kids have it really

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.560
hard with social media and
technology and all that stuff.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.380
I can't even imagine growing
up nowadays in high school

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.910
and elementary school.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.370
But I think they have it
a lot better in the sense

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.270
that they have role models like
Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.340
and all these
beautiful-- you know,

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.040
Ellen Degeneres was my one
person that I was like,

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.790
oh, she's gay.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.159
And I know that she's gay.

00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:37.700
Other than that--
but I didn't really

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.390
look up to her or
anything like that.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:39.980
But I knew.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.420
It was like something mindful.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.900
But I think people today have
it so much easier because they

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.120
have people out there
that really fight for them

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.830
and make it--

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.360
especially transgender
people, who

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.570
have people like that to
make it a household topic.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.210
Everyone knows what a
transgender person is nowadays.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.670
When I was growing up,
that was not the case.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.110
So I really didn't.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.050
And I think kids have
it really well today

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.621
to find out who they are.

00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:06.079
SARI KATZ: And you
started saying--

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.240
you started name
dropping some people.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.200
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.283
SARI KATZ: What about now?

00:17:10.283 --> 00:17:12.410
So are those some of the
people that inspire you?

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.800
Or who in the trans community
are inspirations to you

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.552
nowadays?

00:17:16.552 --> 00:17:18.260
GIGI GORGEOUS: Well
I love Caitlyn Jenner

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.805
because she did make it
such a household topic.

00:17:21.805 --> 00:17:23.180
I don't think
people were talking

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.700
about being transgender until
she came out, because she was

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.390
so in the spotlight
as Bruce, so everyone

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.550
was kind of like dying
over the gossip of that.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:38.390
But people like Laverne Cox,
who is like truly an icon--

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.300
the "Time Magazine" cover
is just like, insane to me.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.409
That's such an honor.

00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.950
Good for her.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:43.910
SARI KATZ: I remember
when you met her.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.826
GIGI GORGEOUS: I know.

00:17:44.826 --> 00:17:46.750
Yeah, we met her-- well,
I met her with you.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.140
Yeah.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.930
SARI KATZ: [INAUDIBLE] summit.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.160
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah,
she's so sweet.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.868
Every time I've seen
her, she's so sweet.

00:17:50.868 --> 00:17:53.480
And on social media,
she'll just shout me out.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.190
And she's just all
about the sisterhood.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.300
And that's how it should be.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.220
But also Janet Mock, who
is extremely intelligent.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.760
And she is the one to go to
if you have any questions

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.430
or whatever.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.090
Her second book just came out.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.925
And I have yet to read it, but
it's going to be a good read.

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:12.800
SARI KATZ: I'm sure it's
going to be amazing.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.258
GIGI GORGEOUS:
Yeah, she's amazing.

00:18:14.258 --> 00:18:16.470
She really does kill it for us.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.870
SARI KATZ: Yep.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.380
When you're making your videos,
are you thinking about it

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.770
from an educational perspective,
in the same way you just said,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.480
Janet Mock, she
knows everything.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.597
She has all the answers
to every question.

00:18:28.597 --> 00:18:29.930
How do you approach your videos?

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.330
Is it to be educational?

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.570
Is it to be entertaining?

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.976
Is it to be both?

00:18:33.976 --> 00:18:35.600
What are you thinking
about doing that?

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.558
GIGI GORGEOUS: I think
I'm honestly only trying

00:18:37.558 --> 00:18:40.370
to be educational when I'm doing
a makeup video or something

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.579
like that, to be honest.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:42.620
SARI KATZ: All right, OK.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.328
GIGI GORGEOUS: Just
techniques and stuff.

00:18:44.328 --> 00:18:47.180
But for the most part,
I'm just living my life.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.050
Because at the end of the day,
I think that the way people get

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.110
educated-- especially
people who have a little bit

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.590
of discrimination in them
towards my community or just

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.120
of anything--

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.270
I think the best way to get them
to wrap their head around it

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.256
and to stop thinking that
way is to just be you

00:19:05.256 --> 00:19:07.880
and maybe to add a little bit of
humor or something towards it.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.320
Because it will lighten them up.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.840
And it will also be like,
oh, she's a real person.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.560
You know, I've had so
many fathers, or mothers,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.770
or people come to me and say,
oh my my god, my daughter and I

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.050
bond watching your videos.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.008
And initially I didn't
know what she was doing,

00:19:23.008 --> 00:19:23.960
but now I get it.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.050
And now I'm a fan of you
too, because it's just

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.217
like watching a real person.

00:19:28.217 --> 00:19:29.508
It doesn't matter if I'm trans.

00:19:29.508 --> 00:19:30.860
It doesn't matter if I'm gay.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.277
It does not matter, because
I'm just a real person.

00:19:34.277 --> 00:19:35.110
SARI KATZ: It's you.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.484
GIGI GORGEOUS:
Yeah, it's the way

00:19:36.484 --> 00:19:38.390
to educate, through
storytelling, you know?

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.810
SARI KATZ: That's right.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:39.560
That's right.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.970
So obviously June, Pride month.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.130
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.070
SARI KATZ: You participated in
Pride in New York last year.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.920
You did Pride in LA
this past weekend.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.050
Obviously super fun.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.590
GIGI GORGEOUS: So fun.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.537
SARI KATZ: Do you remember
your first Pride experience?

00:19:54.537 --> 00:19:55.370
GIGI GORGEOUS: I do.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.370
It was actually with my
manager, who isn't here today.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.960
It was in Canada.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.880
He had an apartment there.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.750
And I was like, I just want
to go and see the vibe.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.637
Because I heard
it was craziness.

00:20:07.637 --> 00:20:09.470
But I didn't know it
was as crazy as it was.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.511
There was like-- we went.

00:20:10.511 --> 00:20:12.080
We all got together--

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.960
him, me, and my best
friend Mark at the time.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.790
And we just got drunk.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.040
And we walked the streets.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.350
And there was like,
naked men everywhere,

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.880
and just Pride flags.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.040
But it was like
the energy has not

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.950
changed since that first Pride.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.460
This Pride in LA--

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.107
I was hosting.

00:20:29.107 --> 00:20:29.690
I was working.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.920
I was on stage.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.820
But it was just like
the same energy.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.430
Just everyone has a smile on.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:38.000
Everyone is like, you know,
just dressing how they want.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.317
And sometimes that's an issue.

00:20:39.317 --> 00:20:41.150
Sometimes you can't put
glitter on your face

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.170
without being stared at.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.900
But everybody was just living
their authentic selves.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.740
And it was just so fun.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.844
And you really do
feel the energy.

00:20:48.844 --> 00:20:49.760
SARI KATZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.840
Everyone's there just to live
their life, be who they are.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.060
It's just a great experience.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:55.980
That's awesome.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.813
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah.

00:20:56.813 --> 00:20:59.960
SARI KATZ: So let's talk a
little bit about the movie.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.590
For those of you that don't
know, as part of our YouTube

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.530
original slate this year, we
released "This Is Everything--

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.130
Gigi Gorgeous."

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.840
And Sundance-- one
thing, it premiered

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.380
as an official entrant
to Sundance 2017.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.180
So why make the film?

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.130
Why was it important
to tell your story?

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.546
GIGI GORGEOUS: Well initially,
for anybody that's seen it,

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.910
all of the footage
that I self shot--

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.000
kind of like vlog, diary style--

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.070
all of that footage
was footage that I

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.450
planned on keeping secret.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.140
I kept it in a vault, I like to
call it, just in my computer.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.505
I really only made it
for myself and my friends

00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:37.880
and my family to
show them, like,

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.300
oh my god, look what I did,
or like a video diary for me.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.140
And then when I was done with
my transition, I was like, well,

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.250
I have all this footage.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.260
So I talked to my team.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.190
And I was like, I really
want to do some kind of film

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.450
or you know, a video
series or something.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.880
And then when YouTube Red
approached us, I was like, wow,

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.780
it's getting real.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:57.110
SARI KATZ: It's real.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.610
GIGI GORGEOUS: And then when
we picked the director, Barbara

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.940
Kopple, and when she had
time and everything really

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.360
worked out perfectly.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.820
It was fate.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.746
It was just a thing.

00:22:06.746 --> 00:22:07.870
So I was like, here you go.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.786
Here's all my footage.

00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:10.520
And then she was like,
I want you to not

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.570
see it until it's done.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.660
I want it to be a secret,
which was really hard for me.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.610
But my first time watching
it was at Sundance.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:17.270
And it was like--

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.600
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:18.950
SARI KATZ: I remember.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.150
I remember looking over.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.920
Gigi was sitting a
row in front of me.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.750
You were sitting next
to your dad and Nats.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.510
And I just kept looking over
to see what your reaction was.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.385
I couldn't tell though,
because I was behind.

00:22:28.385 --> 00:22:30.857
But it was-- first time, what
was going through your head

00:22:30.857 --> 00:22:31.940
when you were watching it?

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.499
GIGI GORGEOUS: It
was like, whoa.

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:34.790
It was just like a whoa moment.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:39.020
Because it was a huge theater,
just a huge IMAX movie

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.189
theater, huge screen.

00:22:40.189 --> 00:22:41.480
We were sitting right in front.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.700
And I just remember,
when it started playing,

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.410
I was just like, oh
my god, we're here

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.900
and we're doing this.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.987
It went by so fast.

00:22:48.987 --> 00:22:51.320
And I don't even think that
I watched it the first time.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.410
I think I was just looking at
how I looked, or something.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.949
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:55.949 --> 00:22:57.740
But the second and
third time I watched it,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.970
I really took it in.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.820
And I was like, oh my
god, this is done so well.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.970
I took myself out of it and
just watched it as a stranger.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:10.550
And it's crazy how much A, I
filmed, you know, B, I grew,

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.900
and just--

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.250
everything.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.320
I don't think many
people can say

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.680
that they've seen their
entire lives in 90 minutes.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.840
It was just like,
wow, that's me.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.210
That's my whole life, yep.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.800
SARI KATZ: Yep, that
was your whole life.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.540
You really did give over
complete and total trust

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.430
to Barbara.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.600
What was that like?

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.289
How did you let
go of the control?

00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:36.830
GIGI GORGEOUS: I
honestly just did it

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.210
like a Band-Aid, ripped it off.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.310
I was just like, if
she wants to do this--

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.090
and Barbara is-- she's amazing.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.530
She is a true filmmaking artist.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.940
And she's been
rewarded for that.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.590
She is very successful.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.579
SARI KATZ: Two time
Oscar-winning documentarian.

00:23:51.579 --> 00:23:52.370
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.210
So she's a pro.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.270
So when she said,
you know, I want

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.020
to keep this secret
from you, and I really

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.084
want to surprise
you at Sundance--

00:23:59.084 --> 00:24:00.500
and at the time,
we didn't know we

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.490
were going to be at Sundance.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.948
I wanted to premiere
it at Toronto.

00:24:02.948 --> 00:24:04.010
SARI KATZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.551
GIGI GORGEOUS: But
Sundance obviously

00:24:05.551 --> 00:24:09.284
is like, everything, so
wasn't pissed about that.

00:24:09.284 --> 00:24:10.700
But yeah, she just
said, you know,

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.010
I really want to surprise you.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.840
And I was just like, well,
if anyone's going to do it,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.980
it's Barbara Kopple.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.259
So kill it, girl.

00:24:17.259 --> 00:24:18.050
SARI KATZ: Kill it.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.750
GIGI GORGEOUS: And I was like,
when am I going to see it?

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.350
When is it done?

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.016
When is it done?

00:24:21.016 --> 00:24:24.140
And I felt like it took forever
because I wasn't involved,

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.386
but it was worth the wait.

00:24:25.386 --> 00:24:26.510
SARI KATZ: As someone who--

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.380
you still edit.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.089
You still do everything
with your videos.

00:24:29.089 --> 00:24:29.921
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah.

00:24:29.921 --> 00:24:32.110
SARI KATZ: So I can imagine
giving up that control

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.184
was probably pretty hard.

00:24:33.184 --> 00:24:34.100
GIGI GORGEOUS: It was.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.900
And my dad was also
in on the secret.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.835
He was giving them home videos.

00:24:38.835 --> 00:24:41.210
Because in the movie, I wasn't
expecting to see all of me

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.600
as a baby, or me diving.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.980
I hadn't seen me
diving since I quit.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.730
So I was like, where
did she get this?

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.710
And then my dad was
like, she emailed me,

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.980
and I gave it to her.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.300
I was like, oh my god, dad.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.790
SARI KATZ: What was the
best part of the experience?

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.665
And what was the worst
part of the experience

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:03.080
in making the film?

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.712
GIGI GORGEOUS: I would
say the best part is--

00:25:06.712 --> 00:25:07.920
well, there's two best parts.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.650
Watching it and having a movie
that documents the first 24

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.665
years of my life is the best
present I could ever get.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.290
It's so surreal to me that
all of that was on film.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.780
And it was edited from her.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.290
It's just like, the best gift.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.900
Number two is definitely
watching it with my supporters

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.980
and strangers.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.760
I love seeing their
reactions to it.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.910
And I love that I know now that
it's doing good in the world.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.860
And the worst part,
I would say, for me,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.930
is just anything to
do with my mom is just

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.280
like cringeworthy to me.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.870
I'm still dealing
with her passing.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.530
So it's like reliving that when
I watch it is just so hard.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.485
I cry every single time.

00:25:47.485 --> 00:25:49.820
SARI KATZ: Yeah, I can imagine
that's not an easy thing

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.645
to live and just
to see on a screen.

00:25:51.645 --> 00:25:52.520
GIGI GORGEOUS: Right.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.100
SARI KATZ: Absolutely.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.954
There are some very personal
moments in the film.

00:25:57.954 --> 00:25:59.370
GIGI GORGEOUS:
Mhm, yes there are.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:00.411
SARI KATZ: Lots-- again--

00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:01.730
GIGI GORGEOUS: Lots of nudity.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.396
SARI KATZ: There's a
little bit of that.

00:26:03.396 --> 00:26:04.980
GIGI GORGEOUS: A
little bit of that.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.010
SARI KATZ: How do you
feel about them now?

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.840
And how did you feel
seeing them on the screen?

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.500
GIGI GORGEOUS: Well
initially, I was

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.210
a little bit angry at
how my body was shown,

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:21.800
and the relationship I was in at
the time with my ex-boyfriend.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.680
That was documented in
the film because that

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.550
was when we filmed.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.530
So why would it not be?

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.182
But now, looking
back, it just is

00:26:29.182 --> 00:26:30.890
like, oh my god, that
was such a mistake,

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.620
or like, ew, what
was I thinking?

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.400
Fuck my life!

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.190
[LAUGHING]

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.972
As anyone would feel, but I was
angry initially, being like,

00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:40.430
why the hell would
she put that in?

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.710
But like, I mean,
that was my life.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:42.520
It's a documentary.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.240
You're not going to
leave everything out.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.450
And as far as the
nudity and stuff goes,

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.206
I just feel like initially
I was like, really?

00:26:50.206 --> 00:26:51.580
I feel like the
clip of my boobs,

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.580
when I first got them
done and they're so like--

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.840
I mean, they're just not
even boobs at that point.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.240
It looks so swollen and crazy.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.140
I was like, this is
like, so uncomfortable.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.265
I was like, waiting for it
to cut to another scene,

00:27:02.265 --> 00:27:03.802
and it just kept going.

00:27:03.802 --> 00:27:08.120
Like fucking hell, cut it!

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.380
But it's all for the good of
the education, the documentary.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.430
At the end of the day
it is a learning tool.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.259
So to see the process
is interesting.

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:18.175
But for me, it's like,
ah, those are my boobs!

00:27:18.175 --> 00:27:20.130
[LAUGHING]

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.690
SARI KATZ: It's true.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.060
In the film you also
recognize, and you

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.640
say this, that you've been
really, really fortunate

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.210
in a couple of different ways.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.400
The support of your
family and your friends

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.660
in the early parts of your
journey all the way to today.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.250
You also said you
know that that's not

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.520
the case for a lot
of transgender youth,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.470
who sadly sometimes go
homeless, commit suicide.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.010
What can you do, or what do
you do, with your platform

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.059
to support those who don't have
the same support as you did?

00:27:55.059 --> 00:27:57.100
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah, that's
something in the film

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.280
that I think we could have
acknowledged actually more,

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.510
the fact that I was blessed.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.670
I think Barbara did
a great job at that,

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.040
but I just wanted
to stress it more.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.920
I feel like I can never stress
how blessed I was enough.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.870
Because my dad really,
even from the beginning,

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.720
even though he wasn't
on board, he never

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.250
scolded me for who I was.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.280
Or he never said, you can't
have this or you can't do this.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.930
Because I was going
to do it anyways.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:20.810
And he knew that.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.050
So he was on board with
what I wanted to do.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.890
And that's like the world's best
dad, or world's best parent.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.440
And with my platform,
I just really,

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.440
really want to inspire people.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.330
And I know that people are
not always as fortunate.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.500
But I think it's not
the cards you're given.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.920
It's what you do with
the cards you're given.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.170
You know, I actually was
doing an interview yesterday.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:48.160
And I think the person said
41% of transgender youth end

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.750
up committing suicide.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.290
And it just is something
astronomically high like that.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:56.170
And it just breaks
my heart that they--

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.700
because I've been
there, you know.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.710
I think everybody
can relate, going

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.740
through a period in
your life where you feel

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.790
like you can't do it anymore.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.670
But I think for
transgender people, or just

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.120
people in our community,
it's kind of amplified.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.470
And it's not fair.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.540
But I think, at
the end of the day,

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.790
you need to get it in your
head that you're confident,

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.554
and you're going to kill it,
and things will get better.

00:29:18.554 --> 00:29:20.470
And that's what I plan
to do with my platform.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.740
I always really just want
to inspire people and get

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.704
the bad talking voices
out of their head

00:29:26.704 --> 00:29:28.120
and just let them
see the positive

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.381
and turn their lives around.

00:29:29.381 --> 00:29:30.880
SARI KATZ: Yeah,
no, that's awesome.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.432
Your dad is, like we said,
the star of the show.

00:29:35.432 --> 00:29:36.640
GIGI GORGEOUS: He's an angel.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.250
SARI KATZ: He is an angel.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.610
And at the end of the film
he talks about, or says,

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.430
he didn't have to
learn a new person.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.760
Gigi's heart and soul
didn't go through surgery.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.930
I thought that was
incredibly powerful.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.210
GIGI GORGEOUS: I know.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.160
SARI KATZ: That was
where I really teared up.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.935
I thought it was amazing.

00:29:54.935 --> 00:29:56.740
And there was a really nice
scene with you and your dad

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.489
after some of your
surgeries, where he's--

00:29:58.489 --> 00:30:01.000
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah,
I just got goosebumps!

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.730
SARI KATZ: Honestly, it's like
you don't hear that enough

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.360
in the world and the fact that
he is so incredibly supportive.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.484
And you know, your
personality is still the same.

00:30:09.484 --> 00:30:10.900
Your interests are
still the same.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.150
Your hobbies are still the same.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.540
You started your YouTube
channel doing something--

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.680
make up tutorials
and testing products.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.180
Where do you see
your content going?

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.054
You said you're enjoying
the lifestyle stuff.

00:30:24.054 --> 00:30:25.760
Where do you see it
going in the future?

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.640
GIGI GORGEOUS: I
actually don't know.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.090
It's like a beautifully
unknown territory for me.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.530
Because I think I just take
every day as another journey.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:40.550
And whatever I decide to
film, or post, or not post,

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.980
it's beautifully up to me.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.680
And it's just wherever
life takes me.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.430
But as far as projects going,
I am the first transgender

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:52.110
spokesperson for
Revlon, which I'm like--

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.586
I mean, I'm dying.

00:30:53.586 --> 00:30:54.801
SARI KATZ: Yes, yes!

00:30:54.801 --> 00:30:55.926
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes, Revlon!

00:30:55.926 --> 00:30:57.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.000
So that's where I'll
be going with makeup.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.380
And I think that's a huge--

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.290
I mean, it's not only a
sponsorship and a partnership.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.960
It's like, an honor to
be the first transgender

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.840
spokesperson for Revlon.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.760
I think it's a
huge step for them.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.530
And I'm really happy about that.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.460
SARI KATZ: Yeah.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.090
I'm wrapping up my questions.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:20.620
So start thinking.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.130
We do have some mics, or we
have a mic floating around.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.110
So feel free to think
of your questions

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.960
and come up and ask them.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.020
But what-- a couple
more questions from me.

00:31:35.955 --> 00:31:38.080
What's the experience been
like with your brothers?

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.110
Because you are-- you
and your two brothers.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.980
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.146
SARI KATZ: And they were
also incredibly supportive.

00:31:44.146 --> 00:31:47.020
So talk a little bit more about
your relationship with them.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.603
GIGI GORGEOUS: Well,
my brothers and I

00:31:48.603 --> 00:31:49.960
have always been really close.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.530
I've always been different,
since I was a baby.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.240
But they have really
good senses of humor.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.259
I'm the middle child.

00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:01.300
So I don't really know
the middle child syndrome,

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.008
but I always required
a lot of attention.

00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:03.681
[LAUGHING]

00:32:03.681 --> 00:32:04.680
GIGI GORGEOUS: Is that--

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.790
I don't know if that's true to--

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.220
SARI KATZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.095
GIGI GORGEOUS: It is?

00:32:07.095 --> 00:32:09.640
OK, so yeah, middle child
through and through.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.380
But my younger brother--

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.940
we spent a lot
more time together,

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.070
because my older brother
went away to university.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.470
And I actually started
transitioning when

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.520
I was at home with my brother.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.740
So he kind of saw everything.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.320
And he knows all of like, the
surgery aspects and everything

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:24.820
like that.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.320
And I was actually
really surprised

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.075
to see that they were
included in the documentary

00:32:29.075 --> 00:32:29.950
as much as they were.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.360
And the fact that--

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.990
I think with your family, and
with my brothers and my father,

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.810
just talking about
them as a whole,

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.390
I hadn't heard from their
mouths a lot of the things

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.410
that they said.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:45.590
Like my brother saying,
Gigi is transgender.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.200
It's as if she made up the term.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.850
That is her.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.810
Like, I had never
heard him say that.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.020
And especially like, my dad
and Adam, my older brother,

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.800
crying on camera, I was just
like, oh, my god, they like,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.030
really love me.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.940
And just like-- I don't
know, hearing that--

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.898
I don't know if it was
Barbara's magic or what,

00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:04.210
but they really opened up.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.030
And to watch them
say those things,

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.030
and to have that on camera
and as a film as a whole,

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.030
I think it just speaks to how
lucky I am with my family.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.440
Like, I have the best family.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.250
SARI KATZ: You do.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.730
The movie is a lot--

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.000
obviously, it's your
journey and it's your story.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.670
But there's so much
love in the film.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.990
And I'd only seen it at Sundance
for the first time, too.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.740
I wanted to wait.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.530
And I was really, really
surprised by that.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.500
I didn't expect it.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.110
So again, if you haven't
seen it, watch the movie.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.510
It's amazing.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.010
GIGI GORGEOUS: We're
up for an Emmy.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:36.880
Well--

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.280
SARI KATZ: Consideration.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:37.745
GIGI GORGEOUS: Consideration.

00:33:37.745 --> 00:33:38.815
SARI KATZ: Consideration
for an Emmy.

00:33:38.815 --> 00:33:40.065
GIGI GORGEOUS: But good vibes.

00:33:40.065 --> 00:33:42.022
We're putting out
there that we are.

00:33:42.022 --> 00:33:43.490
SARI KATZ: Good
vibes in the world.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:44.490
Good vibes in the world.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.540
But it was nominated
for an MTV movie award.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.340
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.042
SARI KATZ: I know
we didn't win, but--

00:33:51.042 --> 00:33:52.750
GIGI GORGEOUS: Who
ended up winning that?

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.320
SARI KATZ: I don't even know.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.190
I don't even know.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.720
GIGI GORGEOUS: It was rigged.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.350
SARI KATZ: Adam, do you know?

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.100
I don't even know.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.840
GIGI GORGEOUS: Rigged!

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.940
SARI KATZ: But again,
fingers crossed, Emmys,

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.080
fingers crossed.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.450
GIGI GORGEOUS: Fingers crossed.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.800
SARI KATZ: But those are
the questions I have.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.622
I hope people in the
audience have some questions.

00:34:09.622 --> 00:34:10.830
Yes, we've got one over here.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.260
AUDIENCE: First of
all, thanks for coming.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:15.654
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah.

00:34:15.654 --> 00:34:17.060
AUDIENCE: Love the talk so far.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.780
So part of our theme for
Pride this year at Google

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.670
is about showing up.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.270
So what would you say
to folks in the audience

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.728
or on live stream about showing
up for the trans community?

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:26.370
Or what are ways you would
say we could be the strongest

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.982
allies to the trans community?

00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:29.440
GIGI GORGEOUS: I
saw so many allies

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.710
when I was hosting Pride in LA.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.560
And even in the Middle East,
when I was in Tel Aviv,

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.489
I just saw so much love
and support from allies.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:42.570
I think being there, especially
right now, during that time

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.420
that we're in, I think
coming out during Pride month

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.929
and really sharing everything
on your social media, showing up

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:49.639
is--

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.639
I love that you guys are
doing that, by the way.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.360
Showing up is like, half the
battle in life-- you know,

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.290
for jobs or whatever.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.489
It's just showing up.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:57.060
So showing--

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.052
[LAUGHING]

00:34:59.052 --> 00:35:01.650
Like, duh.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.110
But yeah, I'd
honestly just be like,

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.640
go out to everything
gay this summer.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.580
[LAUGHING]

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.470
Right?

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.053
I mean, I don't know
what else to say.

00:35:12.053 --> 00:35:13.106
Sorry.

00:35:13.106 --> 00:35:13.980
SARI KATZ: It's true.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.590
Just being present and being
there is half the battle.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.390
I like that.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.486
Questions?

00:35:19.486 --> 00:35:21.230
Yeah, over here.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.167
AUDIENCE: Hi, Gigi.

00:35:22.167 --> 00:35:24.000
Thanks so much for being
here, first of all.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.920
I actually got to see
the film yesterday.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.035
It was really cool to
follow your whole journey

00:35:28.035 --> 00:35:28.660
and everything.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.020
So thank you for
putting that out there.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.320
I'm curious, what would you
say to a transgender person who

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.740
either doesn't have access to
the same kind of transition

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.990
or maybe doesn't even want
to go through the same kind

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.430
of transition, or even someone
who identifies as non-binary

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.010
or something like that?

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:51.400
And what can we do to
fight for more acceptance

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.585
of those identities and images?

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:56.460
GIGI GORGEOUS: Well
first, thank you so much.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.310
I really hope you
enjoyed the film.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.340
And of course, I'm happy
to be here talking.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.180
I would say being non-binary,
identifying as that,

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.530
is kind of something new to me.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.180
I'm meeting a lot more
people that identify as that.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.410
And it's really interesting.

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:13.764
And you know, I don't shy
away from asking questions

00:36:13.764 --> 00:36:14.680
or anything like that.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.680
I don't think it's rude.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.420
I think that they
enjoy talking about it.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.544
I think a lot of people
have that kind of like, uh,

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:20.310
should I--

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.880
is it rude?

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.610
But like, how else
are you going to know?

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.450
I would say, just to
pivot for one second,

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:33.180
I remember when I transitioned
I would tell people, I'm trans.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.060
And I really would love for
you to call me she and her

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.034
and use the name Gigi.

00:36:38.034 --> 00:36:39.450
And a lot of people
would slip up.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.000
And they wouldn't even--

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.330
I think I see a lot of
people doing it with Caitlyn.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.330
You know, they'll slip
up and say, Bruce and he,

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.121
and then they'll just
go on with their day.

00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:48.480
It's like, no, that's not OK.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.936
You need to definitely be on it.

00:36:49.936 --> 00:36:51.810
And I think that's one
way to give confidence

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:52.601
to a lot of people.

00:36:52.601 --> 00:36:55.770
If you're trans, and
you're being acknowledged

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.590
how you want to be acknowledged,
it is literally just the best

00:36:58.590 --> 00:36:59.790
compliment.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.050
You're giving an
unsaid compliment.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.890
And I think for people who
are non-binary, hearing they

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:07.020
and them is so
reassuring to them.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.640
And it's just like,
I can do this.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.890
I'm around comfortable people.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.510
I don't have to like,
cringe or worry, you know?

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.970
So I would say
allies also can help

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.900
in this, because they're the
ones who we want support from.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.540
Another transgender woman, at
the beginning of my transition,

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.720
saying she and Gigi to
me wasn't as fulfilling

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.410
as my father or my
brother saying it.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.030
So I think allies
can just support

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.470
and be overly supportive.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.420
Just give them everything.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.355
Make them feel good
about themselves.

00:37:35.355 --> 00:37:37.680
SARI KATZ: Yep, cool.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.215
Any other questions?

00:37:40.215 --> 00:37:41.775
Yes?

00:37:41.775 --> 00:37:43.900
AUDIENCE: So I think everyone
in the LGBT community

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.435
has definitely had a really
rough point in their life.

00:37:46.435 --> 00:37:47.810
And I was wondering
for you, what

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:52.387
was your biggest motivation to
get through those rough points?

00:37:52.387 --> 00:37:53.970
GIGI GORGEOUS: My
biggest motivation--

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.150
I had a few.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.620
My supporters for
sure, because I

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.740
knew that I had to be
held accountable for them

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.480
and from them.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.930
Also my mom-- knowing
that I could--

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.610
one of my biggest
regrets in my life

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.660
is not being able to say
to her that I was trans

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.007
while she was still alive.

00:38:15.007 --> 00:38:16.590
And I knew it was
going on in my head.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.480
I just couldn't work up
the courage to do so.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:26.010
So I think wanting to do that
is obviously something, 100%.

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.270
But she keeps me going.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.640
I think about, what
would my mom do?

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.670
Or you know, I'm going
to do this for her,

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.790
or I wasn't strong
enough in that moment,

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.500
so I'm going to be
strong enough now.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.470
It was definitely a
huge reminder to me.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.067
It's a reminder to me everyday.

00:38:42.049 --> 00:38:43.850
SARI KATZ: Any other
questions in the room?

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:44.580
Yeah, over here.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.790
Oh, one there and then one here.

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:51.170
AUDIENCE: So what would
you say to someone

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.060
in the queer
community that's just

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.190
starting out and trying
to find their voice

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:58.657
and build a platform possibly?

00:38:58.657 --> 00:39:00.740
GIGI GORGEOUS: Well that's
a really good question.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.420
I don't even know if I
can answer that fully.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.253
If you're trying to
build a presence online,

00:39:04.253 --> 00:39:06.170
I would say being
consistent is number one.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:10.790
So maybe having a
few ideas on the go

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.895
and having a couple of
things like back in the vault

00:39:13.895 --> 00:39:15.270
that you can really
put out there

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:16.970
to keep people interested.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:18.860
Because there are so
many people online.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.450
But as for real life, if I'm
understanding the question

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:29.450
correctly, I think just being
present as your authentic self.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:32.457
Even if you are searching for
something else, even though--

00:39:32.457 --> 00:39:34.040
if you don't know
if you're trans yet,

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.123
or you don't want to go
through with it, whatever.

00:39:36.123 --> 00:39:38.720
I think just living as
you are right that second

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.870
and waking up every day with
a really, really strong sense

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:42.410
of self.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.080
Because I think that will exude.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.970
And other people
will catch the drift.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:51.866
And other people will be
inspired by your confidence.

00:39:51.866 --> 00:39:53.273
SARI KATZ: Maybe one over here.

00:39:56.094 --> 00:39:57.010
AUDIENCE: We're just--

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.872
[LAUGHS]

00:39:58.872 --> 00:39:59.830
GIGI GORGEOUS: Bad mic.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:05.290
AUDIENCE: We're just starting to
see depictions of us in media--

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.330
I mean, fictional ones.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:10.870
Is there a favorite character,
trans character, in media

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.520
that inspires you?

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.940
GIGI GORGEOUS: Hm,
that's a good one.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:20.770
I love Zachary
from "Transparent."

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:21.430
I don't know.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.680
I don't know if
that's my favorite.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.400
It's hard to say.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.680
Good question.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.390
It's such a cop
out, but honestly, I

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.190
feel like Caitlyn
is my favorite.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.010
I was just such a fan of
the Kardashians before.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:36.700
So to see her transition,
and how good she looks,

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.387
I just am such a fan.

00:40:38.387 --> 00:40:39.220
I'm rooting for her.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.300
I have a lot to thank for her.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.560
And so does the community.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.741
So maybe she's my favorite.

00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:46.240
Maybe not.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.551
I don't know.

00:40:47.551 --> 00:40:48.612
I'm my favorite.

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:49.320
I'm just kidding.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.028
I'm just kidding.

00:40:50.028 --> 00:40:52.375
[LAUGHING]

00:40:52.375 --> 00:40:55.430
SARI KATZ: Yeah, over here?

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:56.367
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:56.367 --> 00:40:57.950
So I've been following
you on YouTube,

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.539
like totally from the beginning.

00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:01.580
And I know you've come
out a few different times,

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.651
in different capacities,
on your channel.

00:41:03.651 --> 00:41:05.150
And I'm sure for
people that are not

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:08.094
as connected to the
LGBTQ community, that

00:41:08.094 --> 00:41:09.510
can be kind of
confusing, and they

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.135
might have a lot of
questions about how

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:14.400
you've got to the fully realized
person you are right now.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.400
So what do you think is
the most important thing

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.120
for outside people to
realize about that very

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.310
personal journey of
continually discovering

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.520
yourself and finding your
truth at the end of the day?

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.160
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah,
I think it's an--

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.514
yes, I have come out
more than once online.

00:41:30.514 --> 00:41:32.180
And it's kind of a
question I get a lot,

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.860
but I take it with humor.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.470
Because I have been online
for a very long time.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.680
And I think people
realized a lot of things.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.185
You know that Kylie Jenner meme?

00:41:41.185 --> 00:41:43.560
This year I'm just realizing
a lot of stuff, or whatever.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.800
[LAUGHING]

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.490
It's true.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:47.290
It's true.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:50.840
I look at my YouTube as
literally a diary of like,

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.710
how I'm changing.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.430
And a year is a
really long time.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:57.380
So I think for me to be online
now for seven years, it's like,

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.670
of course I'm a different
person than when I started.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:02.570
So I think that just is--

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.180
it speaks to, and I
think it's inspiring

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.730
of people, to be like,
look at her way back then.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.960
She is so much different now.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.152
Like, almost
anything is possible.

00:42:11.152 --> 00:42:12.860
Because you know, I've
experienced things

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.790
and said things that I
never thought that I would.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:17.450
And you know, who
knows what I'll

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:20.120
be saying or doing next year?

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.330
You never know, you know?

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.740
So I think it just
speaks to authenticity.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.140
And authenticity comes
in many shapes and forms.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.620
And people realize
stuff all the time.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.162
I don't know.

00:42:32.162 --> 00:42:34.536
SARI KATZ: I think it speaks
to what you just said before

00:42:34.536 --> 00:42:35.487
to the other question.

00:42:35.487 --> 00:42:37.820
It's like you wake up every
day, and you live your truth

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.750
in the moment.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.345
And you're allowed-- your
truth and who you are

00:42:41.345 --> 00:42:44.030
is allowed to be fluid and
it's allowed to change.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.560
And as long as you
are recognizing

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.510
that you are being
true to yourself

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.190
and being true to your
audience, that's OK.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.480
And I think that's an
important thing to recognize.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.550
And again, not many
people are held

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.890
accountable in the same
sense that you are.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.140
Everything's out there.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.280
And there's a lot of questions,
because it remains out there,

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.705
which I think takes
a lot of courage,

00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:03.830
and you should be very proud.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:04.871
GIGI GORGEOUS: Thank you.

00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:07.490
Yeah, YouTube definitely
holds you accountable.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.550
If you post something-- girl.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.292
Even if you delete
it, it's like, someone

00:43:12.292 --> 00:43:14.750
is going to have that footage
somewhere, or someone's going

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.690
to rip it and post it again
or something, you know?

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.510
So it's like, you need
to know who you are.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.132
And it's good, because it's made
me realize my authentic self.

00:43:23.132 --> 00:43:25.340
And it's like, I don't know
if I would have been here

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.771
without YouTube.

00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:28.770
SARI KATZ: We're glad
that we could support you.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.476
GIGI GORGEOUS: Yes.

00:43:30.476 --> 00:43:32.600
SARI KATZ: If there are
no-- oh, one more question.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.710
One more question, great.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.270
AUDIENCE: Hey Gigi.

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.670
GIGI GORGEOUS: Hey.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.940
AUDIENCE: I'm Ricardo.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.314
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:39.380
So when we talk about Pride, we
often talk about celebrations.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.300
But as many of us know,
the first Pride march

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.549
wasn't just about celebration.

00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:45.880
And especially today, with
the political atmosphere,

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.620
there's a little more anger,
and resentment, and resistance.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.130
So what would you say is the
balance that we should strike

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.920
between being happy, and proud,
and celebrating all that we've

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.410
done, but acknowledging
the work that we need to do

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.700
and why we need to speak up?

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.115
GIGI GORGEOUS: Good question.

00:44:00.115 --> 00:44:02.240
Honestly, I don't know if
this is the right answer,

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.710
but I feel like celebrating
is almost the same

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.090
as fighting back.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.970
Because when you're out and
you're having a good time

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.955
and we're all together, it's
almost like the biggest eff

00:44:13.955 --> 00:44:15.890
you to society.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:21.440
And I know the Pulse Orlando
massacre a few days ago

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.899
celebrated the one year.

00:44:22.899 --> 00:44:25.190
And my girlfriend actually
did something super special.

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:29.270
We went there and we held a kind
of like a little mini event.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:31.280
And it was so powerful.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.700
And even that was really,
really dark and emotional.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.860
But I feel like we were
celebrating our community

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.050
and that we are still here.

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.420
And you know, the
night club was lined

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:45.500
with a fence with roses and
just so much love, objects

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.030
of love and light.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.450
And I think celebrating,
especially this month

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.030
in particular, I think it's the
most important month for us.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.340
I think showing up,
celebrating, having

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.310
fun, go have a drink with your
friends, go to this event,

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.560
take pictures, post
online that you're there

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.930
and that you support.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:05.930
And I think that's
fighting in a way.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.930
SARI KATZ: Well thank you
so much everyone for coming.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:12.380
And a huge thank you to Gigi
for being here with Talks

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.160

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.550

shout out to YouTube Red.

GIGI GORGEOUS: Yeah, thanks.

00:45:27.256 --> 00:45:28.307
[CHEERING]

00:45:28.307 --> 00:45:29.390
Yes, thanks for having me.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:33.040
[APPLAUSE]
