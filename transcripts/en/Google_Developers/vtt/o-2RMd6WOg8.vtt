EMILY FORTUNA: Welcome
to The Boardwalk at I/O.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.270
This space really captures
the festival vibe,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.757
and it's one thing
that makes I/O special.

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:12.840
This year, we collaborated
with a bunch of artists

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.630
to combine our tech
with their talents.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.046
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.040
This interactive
easel takes my doodles

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.500
and makes them
museum-quality works of art.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.719
So what I've drawn here is
obviously "Starry Night."

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.142

00:00:49.878 --> 00:00:51.834
That's my job.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:53.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.975
This art installation is
called "Mosaic Virus."

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:58.120
It uses machine
learning to create

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.190
flowers, whose
appearance is based

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.070
on the fluctuation of Bitcoin.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.205
They're pretty nice.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:06.038
I kind of want some of
these in my backyard.

00:01:06.038 --> 00:01:09.390
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570
I'm here with Kenric
and Alex, and they

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.060
curated all of the awesome works
of art here on The Boardwalk.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.955
Kenric, please tell us about
them, and how you curated them.

00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:20.330
KENRIC MCDOWELL:
Well, we've been

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.970
working with
artists for a while,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.470
and particularly in the work I
do, working with artists that

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.760
use artificial intelligence
and machine learning,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.560
and so we wanted to highlight
some collaborative projects

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.130
by artists working with
machine learning that provide

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.320
representation of
natural phenomenon,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.260
like onformative's piece
here, "Meandering River,"

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.810
or an Anna Ridler's "Mosaic
Virus," with the tulips.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.640
So we really wanted people
to see images of themselves,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.430
in collaboration with nature,
through machine learning.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.610
EMILY FORTUNA: Very cool.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.140
And you alluded to this, Kenric.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.240
This is an ongoing
collaboration, not just

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.130
happening at I/O. Alex, can
tell us a little bit more

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.380
about the history behind that?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.910
ALEX CZETWERTYNSKI: Yeah,
so for the last two years--

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.077
this is the third year that
we've been doing an arts

00:02:05.077 --> 00:02:08.500
program at I/O. And
every year it grows,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.639
and it feels great
to see how there's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.760
support for this
kind of presentation

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.330
at an event like this.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.740
And I think that
this year, we're

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.160
changing the format
a little bit,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.670
and we're seeing how
essentially bringing

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.010
the artwork on a place
like The Boardwalk

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.560
is allowing a deeper
interaction with them.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.980
And I think the audience
is really responding really

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.690
well to this kind of work,
like onformative's piece.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330
EMILY FORTUNA: Alex
and Kenric, thank

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.660
you so much for sharing,
and making this happen.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.560
It's really a lovely
place to hang out.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.810
ALEX CZETWERTYNSKI: Thank you.
