00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.760
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:11.500
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast at all.
I'm checking in on Ya.

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.850
She has chicken.
Um,
how are you?

4
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.140
Oh,
fucking a bulla.
Billy is back

5
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.410
and he's feeling better than ever.
No more coughing fits.

6
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.810
No more night sweats,

7
00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:32.800
no more sleeping under a mosquito net with my fucking malaria.

8
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.640
Um,
I don't think malaria is a funny reference considering each year

9
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.710
42% of women on the planet suffer from this while the men are giving endless

10
00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:52.270
supplies of Nyquil.
Oh,

11
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:56.470
here's something I started to talk about the other day on one of my podcasts.

12
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.071
What am I,

13
00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:02.071
many rambling nonsensical or whatever the fuck you say podcasts.

14
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.010
Um,
out here in Los Angeles,
Hollywood specifically,

15
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.610
there's a group of people that want to get the Hollywood sign taken down because

16
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:18.640
they live near the Hollywood sign and there's too many fucking tourists.

17
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.370
I just don't like that has got to be one of the most fucked up things I've ever

18
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:28.990
heard in my life.
Like the whole city has to suffer,
you know,

19
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.520
while you take down this iconic sign because you were dumb enough to buy a house

20
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.270
next to a tourist attraction,
you fucking moron.

21
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.920
Wait,
why don't you just buy a house across from the fucking magic castle?

22
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.740
Whatever the fuck they call it down there at Disneyland and then get upset,

23
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.320
you know,
uh,
we need to shut down Disneyland.

24
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.160
There's too many people walking around with like Mickey Mouse ears on.

25
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:58.670
It's almost like I bought a house right across from fucking Disneyland.

26
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.540
I could see if it was a new,

27
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.900
like since you bought the house that uh,
you know,

28
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.360
all of a sudden they put this new fucking thing up and you're like,
Whoa,
whoa.

29
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.340
Hey,
hey,
wait a minute.

30
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.610
This was a quiet neighborhood when I bought the house.

31
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.980
This is why I bought the house and all of a sudden there's all these fucking

32
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:20.760
people.

33
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.593
<v 0>Huh?</v>

34
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.180
<v 1>People love it that,
that,
that's fucking sign it.</v>

35
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:28.400
It's like 80 something years old,
right.

36
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.500
The fucking sign is probably as old as your house.

37
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.500
I don't know what the problem is.
Let me just look this up here.

38
00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:39.910
Hollywood sign history.

39
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.860
I used to be called the Hollywood land bag of the day.

40
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.300
Yeah,
it was Hollywood land.
I mean,

41
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.320
I think to actually think that the native Americans put it up.

42
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.350
If I'm not doing it might probably say something else like Hiawatha or some

43
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.350
native American shit is actually native American shooters at some white

44
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:01.780
Hollywood shit.
The history of the Hollywood sign.

45
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

46
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.710
<v 1>Assigned born in Ninth 1923 that fucking thing has been around and then some</v>

47
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:12.210
asshole with a house that was built in fucking 1978 that they just bought in

48
00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:14.720
2016 wants to fucking thing taken down.

49
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.430
<v 2>All right.</v>

50
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.690
<v 1>Nobody gives a shit about the history of the sign all the way maybe people do.</v>

51
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.340
All right.
Signs on was a hundred years old.
It's fitting that the Hollywood sign,

52
00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:29.630
the worldwide symbol of the entertainment industry was conceived as an outdoor

53
00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:34.220
ad campaign for a suburban housing development called Hollywood land.
After all,

54
00:03:34.221 --> 00:03:38.390
despite the high profile of the film is real estate has always been Hollywood's

55
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:43.360
primary economic driver.
Although the signs with the fight,
the,

56
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.210
no,
it hasn't.

57
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.870
You needed the entertainment industry so it could make stars so they could

58
00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:52.610
afford all these fucking houses.

59
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.100
Who the fuck would move out here just to live into a in a fucking house with all

60
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:59.140
of this traffic.
All right.

61
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.680
Although the signs of parents of purpose has evolved over the years,
it's basic.

62
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.280
It's aspirational.
Message remains the same.

63
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:11.140
This is the place where magic is possible,
where dreams can come true,

64
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.710
and these fucking people that lived there,
the side want to take this down,

65
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.353
<v 2>Huh?</v>

66
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.960
<v 1>Back then the dream was beautiful,
was a beautiful home and lifestyle.</v>

67
00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:25.640
Today the signs promise is more subtle and can only be described as the parade

68
00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:29.450
of images,
desires and ideas conjured by the word Hollywood.

69
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.080
I think that there fucking looking into this a little bit too much.
No,

70
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:36.650
Hollywood and you come out here because you want to fucking star in movies or

71
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.000
write movies that direct them,

72
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.803
<v 2>you know,</v>

73
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.350
<v 1>and to take advantage of your position of power,</v>

74
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.490
act like an animal and then have the whole fucking thing come crumbling down.

75
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:48.930
I mean that's,
that's,
that's what's,

76
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.780
that's what's been going on since we've been out here.
Uh,

77
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.510
take down,
Holly would sign search.

78
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.080
She's the Hollywood sign.

79
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.343
<v 2>Okay.</v>

80
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.720
<v 1>Okay.
Christine O'Brien.</v>

81
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.353
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

82
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.810
<v 1>Pesticided I guess nobody in La should get to look at that fucking awesome sign</v>

83
00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:15.200
anymore.
All right.

84
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.820
There's a woman who wants to get rid of the Hollywood sign.

85
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.610
I can't blame the impulse.
It looks so good.

86
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.950
Attacked by tornadoes in aliens.
What does such a rash,

87
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.270
such a rush in the slow creek and the quick crunch of the corrugated letters

88
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:33.760
peel from the scaffolding and fly off from mountain.
Whoa.

89
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.160
The fuck wrote all this shit.

90
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.320
The worldwide fame of the sign is bolted to that image of just of its

91
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:42.890
destruction.
Right.
Hey,
Christina.

92
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.800
Brian though suggest taking the sign down and moving it to universal studios on

93
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:51.801
the other side of the hill are wrecking the context lists h at some sort of

94
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.620
tourist trap in the flats of Hollywood.
She lives in the signs.

95
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.150
Original namesake.
Hollywood land.

96
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.240
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

97
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.830
<v 1>The sign once read Hollywood land.</v>

98
00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:07.130
Does that mean our houses where land used to be

99
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.160
this person?
Are they really smarter?
There's English as second language.

100
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.100
She lives in the signs.
Original namesake.

101
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.640
Does that mean she lives in Hollywood?

102
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.430
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

103
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.390
<v 1>a small,
steep,</v>

104
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.890
disorienting neighborhood where big houses hugged the streets in front and hang

105
00:06:26.891 --> 00:06:30.640
off into nothing in the back.
Hollywood lands,

106
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:34.390
ness of streets rise out from the top of Beachwood.
Jesus.

107
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.950
This fucking verbose count.

108
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.571
All right.

109
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:45.480
The strangest thing about the Hollywood sign is that everyone let a huge real

110
00:06:45.481 --> 00:06:50.481
estate advertisement slowly rot on one of the city's most prominent peaks for 55

111
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:54.960
years from when it was planted on the hillside by Hollywood Land Realty Company

112
00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:59.961
in 1923 until it was dug up and replaced in 1978 slowly accruing meaning and

113
00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:04.710
sentiment over the same decades.
Uh,

114
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.330
Los Angeles was earning its reputation as a place that was happy to demolish its

115
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:12.190
own brief pass.
Dude,

116
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.680
is this the weirdest right person writing ever?

117
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.370
It's like,
it just a contradicts itself.
I can't even read this shit.
All right,

118
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.310
let's,
let me just go back here.
Hollywood sign hiking to the sign.

119
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:31.390
The Hollywood sign.
Hollywood sign knocked down.

120
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.600
Here's the best way.
Hollywood signed.
Trail closure is long overdue.

121
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.920
Hang on a second here.

122
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:45.490
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

123
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.860
<v 1>I'm sorry.
This is just all fucking interesting to me.</v>

124
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.430
They got somebody with this selfie stick.
That's not really,

125
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.350
that's not a good argument for the other side.

126
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.940
I just don't get people that fucking bought houses up there.

127
00:07:57.941 --> 00:07:59.920
Like what did you think was going to fucking happen?

128
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.280
And like how much money do you fucking have and how much of a cunt or you just

129
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:10.480
move it to the other side.
I actually think,
to be honest with you,

130
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:14.770
the fact that someone would want to take that side down is a clear example of

131
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.680
the,
of,
of the disappearing middle class.

132
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.710
They don't want these animals going up there.

133
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:23.800
These lower class people walking around.
They fucking

134
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.800
Goddamn walled off house.
All right.
Why is it long overdue?

135
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:35.770
It was a great hike.
All right.
In the span of about 10 minutes,

136
00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:38.560
so,
and soak and hike from a paved road in the Hollywood hills,

137
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.240
Beachwood Canyon neighborhood to take a breathtaking view of breath,
uh,

138
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.700
Griffith Park,
the city skyline,
and of course the Hollywood side.

139
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.640
When I have the free time,
I always like to come here.
Nobody gives a shit.

140
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.170
But after this weekend,
uh,
she will lose her quick,
quick escape to urban life.

141
00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:53.921
Starting Tuesday,

142
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:58.350
the Beachwood drive will be closed to public because of court action.

143
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.680
Hikers and tourists will be directed away from the trail entrance.

144
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.940
The soon to be closed.

145
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:07.650
Trailhead is popular among Angelenos as well as tourists wanting a selfie with

146
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.180
the world's most famous sign,
blah,
blah,
blah.

147
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.260
Some residents welcomed the closure even though they,

148
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.920
along with other visits will no longer be able to access the trail though.

149
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.350
It's long overdue.
Says Jim Krantz 60,
stop it.
Yeah.

150
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.800
I'm an old angry guy.

151
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:27.540
Got a hair like you didn't go up there and he fucking 23 schedule with some

152
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.510
fucking chick back in the day and now you're too fucking old.

153
00:09:30.511 --> 00:09:33.540
Legs are too old to go up the trail.
So everyone else can't go.

154
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.440
Great Body camera fucking shot my deck.

155
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.090
He did that back in the fucking well that would make them too old.

156
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.610
The Vietnam era,
I dunno.
Uh,

157
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.820
okay.
Gate.
We'll have clocking through.
Okay.
I,
I'm always walking my dog.

158
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.990
We'd come up here every night.

159
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.200
We're going to miss our little hikes up here still.

160
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:56.960
While the closure is a bummer,
it's worth that.

161
00:09:56.961 --> 00:10:00.890
He said there's a classic fucking La guy is 60 years old still saying bummer.

162
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.470
What did you interview the fucking dude for?

163
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.320
To have it locked and lose all the people in all the noise and all the sound and

164
00:10:08.321 --> 00:10:10.910
all of the litter and everything else that goes along with it.
Yeah.

165
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.390
It's not a legal challenge by residents,
but one from the sunset ranch.
Oh,

166
00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:19.370
horse stabler and tour company.
Okay,

167
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:22.970
so what's the horse people that is putting an end to public access to the trail

168
00:10:22.971 --> 00:10:27.190
road.
All right,
fuck it.
I don't know what I'm talking about.

169
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.670
I thought it was the people with the houses.

170
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.770
Now it turns out it's a fucking rancher.

171
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.310
It's a matter all the selfie people have spoken your horses.

172
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.540
Is that what's going on?

173
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:39.410
Did I just waste 10 minutes talking about that fucking sign?
Why Bill?

174
00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:42.830
Why did you waste 10 minutes?
Because you fucking team lost again last night.
Yes,

175
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:43.664
they did.

176
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.540
The finesse Bruins.
The goal scoring Bruins once again,

177
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.320
uh,
lost to the,
the pretending to be tough.

178
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.670
Tampa Bay lightening.
Uh,

179
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.500
I've been watching the Bruins for 40 years and he spent a long time since I've

180
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:05.490
seen us get pushed around the way we're getting pushed around.
And I think,
uh,

181
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.640
we've got too many Rick Middleton's and not enough Jay Miller's,
we need a,

182
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.590
we need somebody to,
I dunno,

183
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.250
we're just letting people waltz into the fucking zone.

184
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.240
And I kind of feel like after the first two games at Toronto,

185
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:25.440
Toronto made an adjustment and kind of showed how to beat the Bruins.

186
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.340
And I think we caught Tampa a little flat because of the layoff and we beat him

187
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:34.341
in game one and they're basically just doing the same fucking thing that Toronto

188
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:38.590
did to us,
which is,
you know what kind of a one line team right now.
I don't know,

189
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.150
maybe we just had a couple of games that were bad.
Um,

190
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.850
but it's not the Tampa scored goals.
It's that they're fucking,

191
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.570
all this face washing and all this shit that they're doing and now they're

192
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:56.170
starting to fucking act like did this tough team and they're not,
I mean,

193
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:59.860
I could beat up half the people to Tampa.
That's a true story.

194
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.560
I'm fucking with you.
I don't know.
It's just weird.

195
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.950
I've never seen the Bruins not saying it's happening a lot.

196
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:10.780
It's that just taken a little too many fucking liberties and um,

197
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.300
the calls haven't been gone our way the last two games.

198
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:16.740
So I got to feel like would do this game,
you know,

199
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.060
I don't want to sit here and bitch about the officiating because some nights you

200
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:24.100
get the call,
some nights you don't add a,

201
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.880
it's just been kind of back to back yet.

202
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:30.490
I don't know how you miss a stick hitting an eight foot guy in the face.

203
00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:31.600
I don't know how you miss that.

204
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:36.450
And then you turn around and call a penalty on his retaliation and uh,

205
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.880
you know,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
It's been a,
uh,

206
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.120
but generally speaking,
I don't think the officiating,
I think,

207
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.110
I dunno if the overthinking things,
it's just been weird.
Not as much bad,

208
00:12:49.111 --> 00:12:52.860
just kind of weird officiating.
So maybe who knows?
Tonight we're dude next,

209
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.240
tomorrow night maybe I guess we play,
we're due to get some calls.
Uh,

210
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.750
however I will say this,
the,
uh,
rebuild his Ben as success.

211
00:13:00.751 --> 00:13:04.020
The fact we already want to fucking play off series and we could win this one.

212
00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:06.900
We can actually get to the eastern conference finals this quickly after blowing

213
00:13:06.901 --> 00:13:10.320
up the team.
So I am happy about that.
I just wish we would,
uh,

214
00:13:10.321 --> 00:13:13.740
we had a little more teeth,
you know,

215
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.510
I mean,
Tampa,
I don't look at tap.
They don't have any giant fucking goon.

216
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:24.460
They're basically a bunch of goals,
scores and a couple of fucking punks.
And,

217
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.820
uh,
I dunno,
I dunno what the fucking deal is.
I'd like to see Nash.

218
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.590
Lou uses size a little more.
Fucking lay somebody out.

219
00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:39.380
Even if you've got to take a pet.
Does that,
is that game gone now in hockey?

220
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.360
I mean,
we had our first fight last night.
Fucking unheard of.

221
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.960
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

222
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.650
<v 1>Fucking 10 games in to the playoffs.
We had our first fight.</v>

223
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.230
Um,
but you know,
all these people that watched Olympic hockey,

224
00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:57.380
this is the hockey that they wanted so they can now sit down and watch it,

225
00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:59.780
which they're not doing.
The cons,
you know,

226
00:13:59.781 --> 00:14:02.990
I think the people that tried to get fighting out of hockey are also people that

227
00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:07.790
want to take the Hollywood sign down.
Those kinds of people.
Oh,
by the way,

228
00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:11.390
you guys keep asking me about this Michelle Wolf thing.
I haven't seen it.

229
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.190
I don't pay attention to the news,

230
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.270
but evidently she did the White House correspondence dinner and everybody's all

231
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:21.530
up in arms because he told some jokes,
which I can totally understand.

232
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.050
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

233
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.560
<v 1>I mean,
she's telling jokes people.
I mean,
that's,</v>

234
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.850
that's how fucking dangerous is that.
You know,

235
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.930
it's just unbelievable to me that it's okay to,
uh,

236
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.420
genetically alter our food supply.

237
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.910
That's okay.
You can take all the fucking principles,

238
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:41.100
a heroine and,
and,

239
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.940
and create them in the synthetic form and create a fucking nationwide heroin

240
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:47.350
epidemic.
That's fine.

241
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.830
Not a word from CNN or fucking Fox on that shit.

242
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.960
Not a fucking peep,
right?
You can totally cook the economy,

243
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.340
leave millions of Americans upside down in their own fucking houses the rest of

244
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:04.730
their life.
They're going to owe more than what their house is worth.

245
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.270
And then you give the houses right back to the bankers so they can do it all

246
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:12.440
over again.
All of that is fine.
All of that is fine.

247
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:16.220
But evidently if you're a comedian and you tell some fucking jokes,

248
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.970
people are going to debate it for 10 fucking days while they're feeding kids.

249
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.640
They're their own fucking kids.

250
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:29.110
This poison food that's gonna make your nine year old have a fucking mustache is

251
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:32.420
fucking nuts are going to drop before he learns how to ride a bike.

252
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:35.240
It's so full of fucking hormones and all this other fucking shit.

253
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.470
Evidentaly that is fine.
Poisoning your own food supply,

254
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.690
something isis jerks off to doing to us.
I mean,
I,

255
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.520
those not terrorist acts against your own fucking people.

256
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.210
The people that did that shit should literally be hanging from their toes.

257
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.010
But there's not a fucking word that said about it.

258
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:59.050
Not a fucking word is said about it because they advertise on CNN and Fox and

259
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:04.430
they donate to fucking politicians.
So they don't say a fucking word.

260
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.710
You know,
all of these fucking presidents,

261
00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:11.850
they leave the office worth tens of millions of dollars despite the fact that

262
00:16:11.851 --> 00:16:14.580
they only made 500 grand a year as president.

263
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.620
You tell me how that math works out.

264
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.550
Why isn't that ever talked about the level that they do now?

265
00:16:20.551 --> 00:16:24.630
When a comedian tells a fucking joke,
it's ridiculous.
Um,

266
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.610
I'm off my soapbox.
Jesus fucking Christ I.
This is just,

267
00:16:29.611 --> 00:16:34.500
this is literally the era of just getting outraged about something that really

268
00:16:34.501 --> 00:16:37.980
doesn't fucking matter.
While meanwhile,
two feet away,

269
00:16:37.981 --> 00:16:39.860
there's a raging fucking inferno.

270
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.590
Can you believe the joke she told at that fucking place where she was hired to

271
00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:47.490
tell jokes?

272
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.180
Can you believe she went in there and did her fucking job that make God,

273
00:16:51.181 --> 00:16:52.110
that's outrageous.

274
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:57.410
Let's talk about that for 10 days and ignored the fact that the Ford Motor

275
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.230
Company is phasing out cars because no one buys them anymore because everybody

276
00:17:01.231 --> 00:17:05.220
needs an SUV because their cars are full of shit that they don't need,

277
00:17:05.221 --> 00:17:08.340
that they're eventually going to take down to goodwill and is going to end up in

278
00:17:08.341 --> 00:17:11.630
the fucking ocean in that swirl of fucking trash.
Fuck all of that.

279
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.410
Did you hear that Caitlyn Jenner joke?

280
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:21.890
Did you hear what so and so said about Donald Trump?
Um,

281
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.020
this is why I don't watch the news.

282
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.380
This is why I just sit alone by myself and think things and agree with them and

283
00:17:31.381 --> 00:17:35.130
then spew them out as though they're fucked me.
Why not?

284
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.160
Why can't I have my own little news network?

285
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:43.190
Why can't I behave like CNN and Fox and curate my fucking news and Spin my own

286
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:47.520
fucking angle on it and then just have Americans yelling at each other?

287
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.950
I Dunno.
I don't understand why people liked this.

288
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.030
The level of mouth breathing more on you have to be to be on Facebook right now

289
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.740
screaming at somebody about politics or social issues.

290
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:03.540
You know,
and even worse,

291
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.830
the people that totally buy into it and then start using all that fucking

292
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.580
corporate speak like that was microaggressive you know,

293
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.520
walking around like you're this informed person.
Ah,
they cannot go suck a dick.

294
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.120
Good for her.
She went there and told some jokes and she ruffled some feathers.

295
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.220
Good for her.
All right.

296
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.800
They know they're going to treat her like she's in fucking Isis.

297
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.490
Classic Classic Journalism in the modern era.
All right.
Um,

298
00:18:34.491 --> 00:18:37.400
I've got a couple of 'em so that's what I think about that.
Okay.

299
00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:39.680
I don't need to fucking watch any of the jokes.

300
00:18:39.681 --> 00:18:43.010
I know she's fucking hilarious and I know that it's completely blown out of

301
00:18:43.011 --> 00:18:45.650
proportion and everybody's running around like fucking chicken.

302
00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:50.300
Little people with blue ties yelling at people with red fucking ties or the blue

303
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.480
type people like it.
Cause the red tie people got it worse or vice versa.

304
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.133
<v 3>MMM.</v>

305
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.260
<v 1>Alright.
Plowing ahead here.
Okay.
Meanwhile,</v>

306
00:18:59.261 --> 00:19:01.930
there's going to be a fucking polar bear swimming up to my fucking house in

307
00:19:01.931 --> 00:19:06.310
about three years.
Alright.
Put your box.
Everybody bought your box,

308
00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:10.510
delivers healthy 100% grass fed and finished beef free range,

309
00:19:10.511 --> 00:19:13.900
organic chicken,
a heritage,
heritage bread,
pork,

310
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:20.060
which is the pure bred pigs swine that came over here from Europe.

311
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.830
Okay.
Not The bastardized once that we have here that are all,

312
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.770
all mixed up.
All right?
These are pure pigs,
um,

313
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.570
to your door on a monthly basis.
You know,

314
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:36.300
it's funny that they do that with dogs and pigs,
you know what I mean?

315
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.680
It's like if you'd like took out dog and pig and you actually put human being in

316
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:45.450
there,
you'd sound like a grand dragon.
Uh,
all their products are human humane,

317
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:45.961
humanly,

318
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:50.961
humanely raised and never given the antibiotics are our hormones.

319
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:54.150
I gotta tell you something,
man.
I been eating that stuff all week.
It's delicious.

320
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.040
Absolutely delicious.
A high quality healthy protein you can trust,

321
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:00.120
unbelievable taste.

322
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.260
There's a huge difference in taste between animals raised on pasture and those

323
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:09.180
fed grain and concentrated animal feed lot operations.
Yeah,

324
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.270
that's the difference between cool kids and people with helicopter parents.

325
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.990
What's your box?
But actually probably sounded good example.
Um,

326
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.020
parents that love them versus parents that abused them,

327
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.440
but at the end of the day,
they do kill the animals.

328
00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:23.640
So I don't think there's a lot of love there.

329
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.260
Put your box is changing that and they offer free shipping anywhere in the lower

330
00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:32.700
48.
Um,
I liked what you said in the 48 states.

331
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.750
I mean,
do I get to pick which 48,
Alaska and Hawaii,

332
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.300
the middle children of our states,
they never did.

333
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:46.620
They just never feel like they get their dope.
Cause then I connected to us,

334
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.620
you know,
what do you think would happen someday if Alaska,

335
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:55.621
Hawaii and Puerto Rico all got together and decided to take on blackwater?

336
00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.140
Now that's a fucking movie.
I would like to see,
um,

337
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.390
offer $20,
$20 off plus free bacon.

338
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.650
You get $20 off in free bacon by going to butcher

339
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.730
box.com/burr and using
the Discount Code Burpee,

340
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.630
you U R I have the hiccups now from talking about food.
Uh,

341
00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:25.120
express the p n Victor Papa November.

342
00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.070
Uh,
Facebook has been in the news a lot lately,

343
00:21:28.071 --> 00:21:33.071
getting thrashed for letting third parties get your user data.

344
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.350
Um,
but do you really think they're the only ones doing it now?
I don't.

345
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.760
I don't because I just got some spam from some fucking incorporation that I have

346
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.580
and the only people that had it was the bank.

347
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.490
So the bank obviously sold it to some other constant.

348
00:21:52.491 --> 00:21:56.750
Now I'm getting this fucking pamphlet asking me if I want to take a fucking trip

349
00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.940
to uh,
I dunno.

350
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:04.090
Honduras Internet providers like Verizon and spectrum can record a list of every

351
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.050
website you visit and they can legally give it to anyone.

352
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.460
It's time to stop trusting big corporations with your data and start protecting

353
00:22:13.461 --> 00:22:16.460
it with express VPN.
Od.
I like this.

<v 0>Yeah.</v>

363
00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:51.840
You can be protected for IX with express Vpn,

364
00:22:51.841 --> 00:22:54.150

Now.

365
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.810
You know,

you should be able to go and sue everybody.

378
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.720
They put all your fucking information out there.

379
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.480
<v 2>You know what I mean?
I Dunno.</v>

380
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:01.340
<v 1>They need to have like a lady to have stricter rules on hacking information.</v>

381
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:03.270
You know what I mean?
We gotta act like the way they do in,

382
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.490
in like Southeast Asia.
When bankers step out of line,

383
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:09.740
they put them to death.
You know?

384
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.560
I'm not saying we got to kill these fucking people,
but like,
you know,

385
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.120
we can bring back the stockade,

386
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.833
<v 2>right?</v>

387
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.110
<v 1>Nah,
you can't do that.
We'd be like,
we would sit there and be like,
well,</v>

388
00:24:20.111 --> 00:24:22.930
what does that make us?
We can't do things like that.

389
00:24:22.931 --> 00:24:27.700
We're not supposed to be like that.
We just waterboard people water boredom.

390
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.273
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

391
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.650
<v 1>There's a water waterboarding sounds.
That sounds like a fucking,</v>

392
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.000
sounds like a game that you,
a toy that you would have before,

393
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:40.940
like the fucking Internet Nela cool shit came along.

394
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.150
You don't remember all that bad.
Those awful fucking games that we have,

395
00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:48.020
at least we got outside.
We weren't fat fucks.

396
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.760
Do you guys remember trackball see if I can find that commercial.

397
00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:56.830
It was like basically,
I think we actually bought that

398
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:03.210
track ball commercial.
See if I can find this thing

399
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.010
trackball by whammo.
Oh my God.
This takes me back.

400
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.030
It's takes me whammo whatever happened to those guys,

401
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.280
the Internet video games.

402
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.570
Oh,
this is somebody fucking play in track ball.
I want the fucking commercial.

403
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.470
You know?
I don't understand these people that like,

404
00:25:26.471 --> 00:25:29.650
you know their kids about read a bump their head and rather than preventing it,

405
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:34.120
they let them do it so they can fucking get a youtube video out of it.

406
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.740
20 pictures that Hillary Clinton wish wishes would go away.

407
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:48.080
That's what I look up track ball and then that's what I get the night Ted

408
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.160
Nugent.
This is what you guys can,
I'm going to,

409
00:25:50.161 --> 00:25:53.280
I'm going to give up my information here by the videos that just came up here.

410
00:25:53.281 --> 00:25:58.150
You guys will understand what I look for
on Youtube.

411
00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.980
All right.
Michael Angelo,
2018 rock and roll led Zeppelin tribute

412
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.880
the night Ted Nugent challenged Leonard Skinner.

413
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:12.190
Jonathan Moffett plays Michael Jackson's.
Billie Jean.
He's a drummer.

414
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.780
20 pictures that Hillary Clinton wishes would go away.

415
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.940
Family never believed their GRANDPA's crazy stories until,

416
00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:23.440
and there's a picture of an old trunk.

417
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.990
The dragon takes its toll in blood is a motorcycle video.

418
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.600
I do watch people wipe out on motorcycles.
You guys do that shit.

419
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.110
I don't like watching like knockouts.
I used to like watching that shit,

420
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:42.890
but there's just too many fucking sucker punches and shit like that.

421
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:49.670
But I do like watching these fucking people on motorcycles driving like goddamn

422
00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:50.210
lunatics.

423
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:54.410
I like when they run from the cops and they get away and I like watching them

424
00:26:54.411 --> 00:26:59.020
wipe up.
I don't know what that says about me.
Brutal motorcycle crashes.

425
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:03.910
Part three,
part three,
4 million,

426
00:27:03.911 --> 00:27:08.020
800,000 fucking video.
Look at this guy out.

427
00:27:08.021 --> 00:27:12.680
Bam.
Hey,
he was going too fast.

428
00:27:12.681 --> 00:27:15.560
He rode right into the fat guy in the fact that I didn't even fall down.

429
00:27:15.561 --> 00:27:19.220
Now the guy,
the guy doing the front,
fucking,
this is my favorite one.

430
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.660
You know when they do the front wheelie there,

431
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.440
there's some point you have to let go and do the face plant.

432
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.230
Good Dude.
I swear to God.

433
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.320
People on motorcycle [inaudible] just a different breed.

434
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:35.810
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

435
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.460
<v 1>there's a level of balls.</v>

436
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.650
There's a lot of fat guys on motorcycles right now.
You know,

437
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.130
that has to affect a center of gravity of the bike.

438
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.070
It's got to bring it up higher.
Right?

439
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.200
That's probably why this guy just went down.

440
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:53.950
<v 3>Okay.</v>

441
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:58.360
<v 1>Is another guy going into a turn?
Everything's going good.</v>

442
00:27:58.361 --> 00:28:03.190
There's snow on the ground.
What could go wrong?
This is the last one.

443
00:28:03.191 --> 00:28:04.930
I'll do it cause I know this is getting boring here.

444
00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.700
Anything I can do to avoid talking about how miserable I was watching the last

445
00:28:09.701 --> 00:28:13.620
two fucking Bruins games.
Um,
what's going to happen?

446
00:28:13.621 --> 00:28:17.370
Is it dear gonna come running out.
This guy seems to be riding very responsibly.

447
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.890
He's checking out all the beautiful,
uh,
areas.

448
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:26.240
Is he going to hit get hit by a Santa Claus' sleigh?
Ah,

449
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.440
we hit the ice and he goes down.
Oh,
that sucks.

450
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.860
Well,
what the fuck were you thinking when he was a guy in a track?

451
00:28:33.861 --> 00:28:36.410
Is a smart guy.
Why don't more people go out to a track?

452
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.640
There's no branches are fucking SUV is out there.
Um,
all right.

453
00:28:40.641 --> 00:28:44.240
I'm done with that shit I'm speaking of which I got to get my truck tuned up.

454
00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.940
Get that fucker ready for the summer out here.

455
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.040
Get that fucker ready for the summer out.
Um Oh.

456
00:28:52.041 --> 00:28:55.880
By the way,
I'm having a very special guest coming out to the podcast next week.

457
00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:00.910
A very special guest to promote their new show berry on HBO.

458
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.620
It's going down next week.
Very special guests.
We'll be coming onto my repeat,

459
00:29:06.621 --> 00:29:08.900
very special guests.
He can look forward to that.

460
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:14.170
I have a week of shows coming up out in San Francisco Monday,

461
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.220
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday.

462
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.700
There was another show that I was announced on some sort of benefit I saw on

463
00:29:19.701 --> 00:29:21.890
Twitter.
I don't even know what the fuck that is.

464
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.520
My agent called me up asking me if I knew what the fuck it was.

465
00:29:25.521 --> 00:29:29.000
Nobody knew what the fuck it was.
I'm not going to be doing that benefit.

466
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.460
Why would I schedule an a competing show in a fucking hour,
right?

467
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:40.310
Yeah.
Christ,
they're going to call this person back.
All right,
well listen,

468
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.510
that was the fucking podcast.
Jesus Christ.
You know something?

469
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.060
I literally literally found this one in.

470
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.080
I spent 10 minutes talking about a fucking sign that I thought the neighbors

471
00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:54.600
were bitching about.
It turned out it was a fucking horse farm.
Um,

472
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:59.360
was there anything accomplished?
I defended Michelle Wolf.
Okay.

473
00:29:59.361 --> 00:30:03.550
How about that?
Without ever seeing what the fuck she said,

474
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.520
I don't even give a fuck you,
you're told jokes.

475
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.990
It's like getting mad at a plumber cause they came over to your house and,
and,

476
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.220
and,
and plumbed.

477
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:18.380
You get offended by the way they sneak out of fucking toilet.
Um,

478
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.760
I think that's all I did really.
Is that all I did?
Well,
you know,

479
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.293
<v 2>what do you want from me?</v>

480
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.890
<v 1>You know what's cool with seeing Pedro Martinez at the Bruins game?</v>

481
00:30:32.891 --> 00:30:37.390
I wish the Bruins and I mean,
Boston teams would do that more.
You know,

482
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.400
our legends just like disappear.

483
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.210
He need to have them come back around and talk to the younger people about the

484
00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:47.920
fucking,
even if it's from another sport,
it's still great just to see a champion.

485
00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:50.830
There was Bobby your and Pedro Martinez.

486
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.810
<v 2>Um,
yeah,</v>

487
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.760
<v 1>black.
I always bothers me like Larry Bird.
Like he just like left.</v>

488
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.950
He never see the guy come back.
But you know,
he was always like that.
Right?

489
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:06.910
He always wanted to go back to the country,
just be left alone,
you know,

490
00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.760
you know,
there's a bunch of billboards,
a couple billboards out here.

491
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.010
These fans put up asking Lebron to come out here.
I mean,

492
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:18.820
that's how hard people go out here.
It's how much money they got.
You know,

493
00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:20.740
they can just pay for billboards,

494
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.400
all these fucking wine and as Laker fans,

495
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.720
because they've been bad for a couple of years,
give us the best player.

496
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.390
It's all they fucking threw out here.
Drives me nuts.
Um,

497
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.580
you know,
it's just a Celtics can't compete with that.

498
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.960
I've been saying this for years.
This is our pitch.
Hey,

499
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.450
do you want to come to racist Boston

500
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:50.150
and deal with the winner in flux sixes or do you want to go to racist Los

501
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.540
Angeles where it's summer,
everyday in fuck movie stars and,
and,

502
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.640
and supermodels.
We can't compete with that.

503
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.080
I don't think there's one infinity pool in Massachusetts.

504
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.000
Do what?
I got a back yard.
Raped.
He could come over and skate on.

505
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:14.460
Um,
all right.
I got some shit to do.
Uh,
that's the podcast.
Go Bruins,

506
00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:15.390
go Celtics,

507
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:22.020
Celtics game two against the 70 sixers mo cheeks.
Andrew.
Tony.
Huh?

508
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:26.010
Those are the six years.
I remember.
I'm going to be watching that tonight.

509
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.180
Actually.
No,
I'm going to be editing.

510
00:32:27.181 --> 00:32:30.510
F is for family and then I'm going to go do a spot somewhere possibly.
All right.

511
00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:34.320
That's it.
Listen to the music and enjoy another half hour of,
uh,

512
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:39.170
some Thursday afternoon podcasts from earlier this year or maybe one from years

513
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.000
ago.
I have no idea.
I have

514
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.060
<v 5>a great weekend.
You console.</v>

515
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.230
See on Monday you are mine re

516
00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.683
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

517
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.153
<v 6>tropics.</v>

518
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.280
<v 5>I see.</v>

519
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:18.820
<v 6>Hi.
[inaudible]</v>

520
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:23.030
<v 5>lovely name,
yellows,</v>

521
00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.310
<v 6>big
[inaudible].</v>

522
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.680
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

523
00:33:28.681 --> 00:33:31.950
It's bill bar and it is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

524
00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.780
May 3rd,
2010.
Um,
how the hell are you?

525
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.520
I got some great news for you.

526
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.000
The podcast is back.

527
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:46.140
It is back up on iTunes and right now you're going to go to iTunes and you're

528
00:33:46.141 --> 00:33:49.860
probably not going to be able to find it because uh,

529
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.900
it's gonna take three to six days for it to actually appear if you go to search

530
00:33:55.111 --> 00:33:57.120
it because iTunes is a pain in the ass,

531
00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.850
as we've noticed over the last three months.
But my new,
uh,

532
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.360
my new sort of web guy here has been able to fix the thing.

533
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.810
And basically if you want to find all the podcasts since the beginning in 2007

534
00:34:10.841 --> 00:34:12.190
right up until now,

535
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.810
all you have to do is just go into iTunes.

536
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.770
And,
uh,
once you're in Itunes,

537
00:34:20.771 --> 00:34:25.540
you click on advanced and it,
once you click on advanced,
uh,

538
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.500
what you do,
it's two down.
Click on subscribe,

539
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.340
subscribe to podcast,

540
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.700
and then this little window will open up.
And this is what you type in.
All right,

541
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:43.210
type in www dot [inaudible] dot com slash podcast and hit okay.

542
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.170
And um,
you know,
that'll be it.
You'll be in,

543
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:53.190
you'll have all the podcasts from here on out until the end of time unless

544
00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:57.570
something happens to me because,
uh,
this is my podcast thing,

545
00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.900
whatever the fuck it is,
I'm not with the g cast anymore.

546
00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:04.320
I'm not with that Libsyn Shit.
I'm with my own thing,

547
00:35:04.321 --> 00:35:06.090
so I don't have to deal with their fees.

548
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.690
I don't have to deal with them suddenly going on a business or switching the way

549
00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:14.400
that they do things or their intellectual properties or their fucking whatever

550
00:35:14.401 --> 00:35:18.780
the hell it is that they're doing.
And this is why it took me so long.

551
00:35:18.781 --> 00:35:21.990
And I just want to thank everybody.
I appreciate the patience.

552
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.320
I even appreciate the angry emails people sent me like,
dude,

553
00:35:25.321 --> 00:35:28.620
what the fuck is going on?
Um,

554
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.670
I appreciate all of that because that meant you give a shit and that you like to

555
00:35:32.671 --> 00:35:34.080
listen to it.
So once again,

556
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.070
go into iTunes and at least on a Mac,

557
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.390
if you click on advanced the window that opens up to second thing down with say,

558
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.120
subscribed to the podcast,
you open that up,

559
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.430
a window will open and in it you will,
right,

560
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:51.270
www dot [inaudible] dot com uh,

561
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.000
slash podcast.
All right.

562
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.640
And it's the regular slash the one that starts further to the right and then

563
00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.530
comes to,
I don't even know.
No,
no,
I don't even,

564
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:03.240
don't even try to describe a backslash.

565
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.410
I don't even fucking know how to tell you that.
Um,
so that's it.

566
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:12.230
And one other thing I have to hype is we have our a fan page now here on the,
uh,

567
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.120
Bill Burr,
a Monday morning podcast,
and that one is,
uh,

568
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.580
www dot the capital m,
capital m,

569
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.920
capital p,
and then your spelling podcast.

570
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.413
I'm the worst

571
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.850
www.themmpodcast.com and m m in the P of podcast are capitalized.

572
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.520
That's how so go on there.
Leave your comments.

573
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.580
If you want to check out some pictures of some of the fucked up references

574
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:42.090
that'll make to whatever podcast you're listening to,
there'll be up there.

575
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:44.280
I actually asked you guys some questions on there.

576
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:45.510
I haven't done that in a couple of weeks,

577
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.580
but finally everything should be up and running and that was probably the

578
00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:51.271
driest,

579
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:55.650
most unfunny three minutes and 25 seconds I've ever done on the podcast.

580
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:57.240
But I had to get that information out there.

581
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.950
I'm going to send out a mass email and I'm going to put it up on Facebook and on

582
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:04.920
my space,
all that information that I just gave you.

583
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:06.870
And if you know other podcasts,
listeners,

584
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:11.220
if you want to email them what I just said,
email it to them and maybe I can,
uh,

585
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.400
maybe I can build it back up again.
You know,

586
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.250
just Kinda like a,
uh,

587
00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.650
something that went out of business and then they was kinda like the Jay Leno

588
00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:21.270
show.
I went away for a minute.

589
00:37:21.271 --> 00:37:24.990
Now I'm back and I'm trying to get my ratings back again.
Granted,

590
00:37:24.991 --> 00:37:27.600
I didn't kick out some unsuspecting redhead.

591
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:32.780
I kicked myself out and I am an unsuspecting redhead and speaking of redheads,

592
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.880
God damn,
and am I good with the fucking segues?

593
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.010
Somebody sent me something this week.

594
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.380
They sent me a video and they were like,
uh,

595
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.840
why don't you say that?
Like David tell a video,

596
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.920
somebody sent me a video and said,
you gotta check this thing out or whatever.

597
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:53.630
I don't know if you've seen this yet,
but there is a video on youtube.
Um,

598
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.690
are you guys familiar with the artist a mia?
She did that song,

599
00:37:57.691 --> 00:38:01.280
I believe it was it paper planes.
Um,
you know,

600
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:03.570
is that song you couldn't fucking get away from last year?

601
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:04.980
What was like an awesome song?

602
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.090
And then every filmmaker in America seem to fall in love with it and put it in

603
00:38:09.091 --> 00:38:13.560
their movie or even Salt Lake Pineapple Express.
It wasn't even in the movie,

604
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.650
but they still put it in the trailer.
All right.

605
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:21.600
I like paper and I like planes and I liked something and I'm fucking lame.

606
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:27.240
Ab some man.
You sound man.
You sound yes bill.
We know.
Ah,
there's,
there's one,

607
00:38:27.241 --> 00:38:28.230
there's a bed cover this.

608
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:32.450
My cover of a am I is a paper planes or whatever.

609
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.650
I know it's not called paper planes,
it's called something else.

610
00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:38.360
Something with paper in it,
you know.
So anyways,

611
00:38:38.361 --> 00:38:43.060
she has a new video out that somebody brought to my attention and to hear the

612
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:44.560
relaxed confidence in my voice.

613
00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:48.970
Now I feel so much better now than I know my podcast is backup on iTunes even

614
00:38:48.971 --> 00:38:50.230
though for three to six days,

615
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:54.460
most of you will not know that because you won't be able to find it because you

616
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:58.360
won't have heard this.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

617
00:38:58.361 --> 00:39:01.960
so somebody sent me this thing,
this uh,
this video.
Um,

618
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:06.730
MIA has a new video called born free.
All right?

619
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:07.720
So they should go,

620
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:10.450
you should check this video out and it's actually a video of my girlfriend

621
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:14.050
already showed me.
She goes,
I want you to see this.
Okay.

622
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:18.100
And it just watch it with an open mind.
I don't even want you to criticize it.

623
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:20.650
Just watch it.
Okay.
Can you do me the,

624
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.600
he has promise me that you're not going to go,
oh gee is two seconds into it.

625
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:28.480
Can you please?
So I said,
yeah,
fine.

626
00:39:28.481 --> 00:39:33.430
I'll sit down and I watch it and it's basically a,
I'm not to,
whatever,

627
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:36.970
I'm going to ruin it here.
All right,
spoiler alert.

628
00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:43.780
Um,
basically the video is about,
uh,
start really army guys,

629
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:48.370
but it's more like a sort of riot police guys,
white dudes,

630
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.750
I think all white dudes and like riot police and they're a,

631
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.590
they bust into this apartment building that looks like it's in the Middle East.

632
00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.160
It's got that Middle East sort of a vibe to it.
Um,

633
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.770
which basically means a,
you know,

634
00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:05.080
there's some bullet holes with some sand in the background.

635
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:09.040
To me that's the Middle East,
you know,
could be Miami.
I don't fucking know.
Right.

636
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.960
So I'm,
I'm watching this thing and they basically,
they just go through this,

637
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.570
this apartment complex,
just horrifically kicking in doors,

638
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.580
violating everybody's rights.

639
00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:21.040
They don't give a shit what people are doing because they're looking for this

640
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:25.500
one dude and they find the dude and they grabbed the guy right as redheaded

641
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.360
white dude,
sort of a buzz cut I guess.
And they grab him.

642
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:29.890
He doesn't want to go in there fighting them.

643
00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:33.820
And they bring them downstairs and then they put them on a bus and he gets on

644
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:37.900
the bus and it's a whole bunch of other red heads.
It's a whole,

645
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.280
it's a whole bus full of red heads.
All right.

646
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.270
And I'm right there.
I was like,
oh Jesus.

647
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:50.500
But I didn't say anything because I promised by lovely girlfriend I'd watched

648
00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:53.680
the whole thing.
So long story short,
they drive him to a camp,

649
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.600
they have him get off the bus and then they make them run so that all the police

650
00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:01.660
can basically kill them and they have them run through minefields and all that

651
00:41:01.661 --> 00:41:02.494
type of shit.

652
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.850
And it's basically commenting on the racial profiling,

653
00:41:06.851 --> 00:41:07.900
the genocide,

654
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.310
and some of the stuff that has gone on in the past and has gone evidently going

655
00:41:12.311 --> 00:41:14.950
on right now.
All right.

656
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.800
It made no references to Iraq,

657
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:22.060
but it definitely had a I rec sort of a feel to it,

658
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.050
except it was redheads so on the air.
And my girl was like,
well what did you,

659
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.160
and then like these red heads,
they're fucking arms are flying off.
All right.

660
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.290
They're beaten him with clubs.
They're doing all this horrific shit to him,

661
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.300
to this sea of red heads.
And she said,
what did you think?
And this is basic,

662
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:41.360
and I'm also answering this,
a person who sent it to me,
what I thought of it.

663
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.310
I thought it was a great idea for a video and I thought it could have made a

664
00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:51.311
good point if they didn't pick the singled out group of redheads for the simple

665
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:56.540
fact
that,
uh,

666
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.520
nobody gives a shit about red heads.

667
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:03.330
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

668
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:06.310
<v 8>We're just,
I don't know what it is.
People don't,
they,</v>

669
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.630
they just don't care about us.
You know,
I remember when Kanye West was saying,

670
00:42:09.631 --> 00:42:13.230
you know,
George Bush doesn't care about black people.
Well,

671
00:42:13.231 --> 00:42:16.080
nobody cares about white people.
So you know,

672
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.830
at least somebody cares about black people.
It's just George.
George doesn't,

673
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.310
you know,
but there's,
there's people who do,

674
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:30.300
that was my thing.
The second they decided redheads,
it just became a comedy.

675
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:35.390
And I got to admit it was weird because I've never seen a busload of redheads.

676
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.870
It dawned on me,
I've never seen that.
Like I've seen a bus load of like,
you know,

677
00:42:39.871 --> 00:42:42.840
generally speaking,
you look on a bus,
it's a bunch of people with brown hair,

678
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:47.750
the occasional blonde,
right.
And uh,

679
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:51.440
you know,
maybe a red head every five buses,
there'll be one red head.

680
00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:56.590
But an entire busload of redheads was funny to me and all [inaudible] also,

681
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.640
it was oddly disturbing.
It was,

682
00:43:01.641 --> 00:43:05.570
they were weird looking and I realized in that moment,

683
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.040
even as a redhead,
I'm going,

684
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:10.070
this are those weird look and sons of bitches and I realized that this is the

685
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:14.570
deal with red heads.
We are not the main course.
We are a spice.

686
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.100
We are the spice in like,
uh,
I dunno,

687
00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.660
we like red pepper flakes that you put on like I don't know,

688
00:43:22.661 --> 00:43:23.710
a steak or something.

689
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.340
If you ordered something in a restaurant and all they brought over was the
spice,

690
00:43:27.341 --> 00:43:30.100
you'd be like,
dude,
what the fuck was the meal?
That's what,

691
00:43:30.101 --> 00:43:34.960
that's what red heads do.
That's our job with people.

692
00:43:34.961 --> 00:43:37.870
You go to a baseball game and you just sit in there going,
Jesus Christ,

693
00:43:37.871 --> 00:43:41.710
how many fucking Brunettes can I look at?
Bam.
As a redhead.
Oh Shit,

694
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.410
there's a red head.
Right.
Reset your brain and he can,

695
00:43:44.411 --> 00:43:49.060
we'll look at some more brunettes now.
That's what we do.
So a long story short,

696
00:43:49.061 --> 00:43:51.880
that's what I thought I thought about the video.
I thought it was a,
uh,

697
00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:55.390
just cause they pay,
I don't know who else they could have picked.

698
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.590
I understand what they're saying.

699
00:43:56.591 --> 00:43:59.380
What if they rounded up this certain segment of white people?

700
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.910
Would you give a fuck now?
You know,
I guess,

701
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.290
you know,
as always,
I,
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.
But like,

702
00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:11.560
because it was red heads,
I just felt at that point,

703
00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:16.000
the second they started running through the minefield,
they should've had a,

704
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:19.420
they should have had like Benny Hill music,
wham,
wham Bam.
Back a day.

705
00:44:19.421 --> 00:44:22.600
A day at the end is they blew them up.
Cause I just was funny to me and weird.

706
00:44:22.601 --> 00:44:27.550
It was oddly like if you were walking down the street and all of a sudden like

707
00:44:27.551 --> 00:44:29.860
just a group of redheads was just walking the other way.

708
00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:34.440
You can't tell me that you wouldn't be creeped out or uncomfortable just for the

709
00:44:34.441 --> 00:44:37.770
mere fact that you've never seen it.
See it.
Like those are my fucking people.

710
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.440
And I saw them all together and I was weirded out by it.

711
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:42.160
<v 4>Okay.</v>

712
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.360
<v 8>Am I a self hating red head?
I don't think I am.
I just,
I dunno.</v>

713
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:50.470
So check it out.
It's called,
uh,
you want to see a bunch of red heads get,

714
00:44:50.471 --> 00:44:53.650
get beat up and blown up.
There you go.
I mean,

715
00:44:53.651 --> 00:44:58.390
fucking South Park did that shit way was Kika Ginger Day and kids actually did

716
00:44:58.391 --> 00:45:00.970
it.
They actually went out and fucking did it.

717
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.900
You couldn't have that upon any other group without some sort of outrage,

718
00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:10.580
you know,
flip some Jewish guys balls day.
You can never have that.

719
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.430
They'd be,
they'd be considered antisemitic.
Could be taken off the fucking air.

720
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.540
If you said something about black people,
you know,
redheads,
I dunno,

721
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:21.290
we fall into those weird cracks where were white dudes,
so no one gives a shit.

722
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:26.420
But uh,
are we a silent minority?

723
00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:31.450
I used to bits about that.
How redheads are portrayed in the movies.
You know,

724
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.320
we're never the cool guy.
We never out.

725
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:36.410
We're always the friend with a guy in the van.

726
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.850
You know when Tom Cruise is in that gone,
you know,

727
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.410
I'm like sitting there in a van and a laptop.
He's,

728
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:47.180
he's running around with like fucking Halle Berry or some other orange and know

729
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.010
you gotta give me more time and then I'm on the van.
Huh?
I'll try.
You know,

730
00:45:52.011 --> 00:45:56.060
and I'm clicking away on my laptop.
That's what I'm doing.
No Pussy,
no sunshine,

731
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:59.510
no pussy.
Okay.
Since the beginning of filmmaking.

732
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.473
<v 4>Huh?</v>

733
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:06.080
<v 8>Richie Cunningham.
Howdy duty.</v>

734
00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:13.010
David Caruso was our only fucking shot and he blew it.
They fuck,

735
00:46:13.011 --> 00:46:16.180
I just talk about this shit on stage.
You fucking blew it.
So I mean,
I don't know.

736
00:46:16.181 --> 00:46:21.040
That's just how we're,
uh,
outweigh where Eric Stoltz came close.
He can close,

737
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.190
but they did the movie mask and once again reminded everybody that he was

738
00:46:24.191 --> 00:46:28.660
genetically compromised.
Um,
what else

739
00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:34.110
has there been one?
Okay.
Even like Shaun White,

740
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:37.860
the baddest snowboard in the world.
Would they call them the flying tomato?
Yeah.

741
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:42.780
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks for that.
That fucking horrific fucking nickname.

742
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.600
There is no god damn respect,
you know?

743
00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:50.601
And here I am a redhead myself and I watched that video and I thought it was

744
00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:53.510
funny.
We thought it'd be funny.

745
00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:57.180
Remember that Joe Piscopo when he used to do Allen Funt we thought it'd be
funny.

746
00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.980
All right,
so let's plow ahead here.
That's what I thought about that shit.
Um,

747
00:47:01.981 --> 00:47:03.870
I did a lot of TV watching this week,

748
00:47:03.871 --> 00:47:08.871
but I'm going to try to get back to some of the topics here on the podcast.

749
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.630
Oh,
here's a little story for you.
I was going to tell you,
I forgot,

750
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.450
I've actually already recorded this podcast and recorded it last night,

751
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:17.070
but I was tired and I was grumpy.

752
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:21.060
I was in a bad mood because I had another incident with my downstairs neighbor,

753
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.560
the continuing story of the downstairs fucking neighbor.

754
00:47:25.561 --> 00:47:29.160
And for those of you who are new to my podcast,
I have a neighbor downstairs,

755
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.590
classic,
you know,
old guy.
And uh,

756
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:35.860
we have hardwood floors and he thinks we make entirely too much noise and he

757
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:38.250
fucking hates us.
So,
um,

758
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.280
but I confronted the guy so he doesn't yell at us anymore.

759
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.420
And uh,

760
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:49.320
yesterday I was a hanging out and I was doing what most people of my age to 41

761
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:52.960
years old.
What do you do?
A,
you helping out your wife,

762
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.960
you taken the kids to the park.
Fuck.
Now you're not even married.

763
00:47:55.961 --> 00:47:58.270
You don't have kids.
You know what you're doing.
You just,

764
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:01.840
you're taking your LP of,
for those about to rock that you just bought

765
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.840
and you're putting it on your turntable because you know that Angus is always in

766
00:48:07.841 --> 00:48:12.190
the right speaker and Malcolm is always in the left and you want to learn the

767
00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:15.970
rhythm to evil walks.
That's all I wanted to do.
People,

768
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.500
I wasn't hurting anybody.
All right.
And,
and for underrated,

769
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:25.240
overrated.
Very underrated.
ACDC album is the,
for those about to rock.

770
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:28.720
The problem was is they will have following the back in black album,

771
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:32.800
but if there's any guitar players out there,
he got to fucking listen to the,

772
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.160
to the B side of that album.
All right.

773
00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:42.230
Evil walks,
cod,
um,
the whole,

774
00:48:42.231 --> 00:48:44.220
the whole backside.
I love him.
Tournament,
what the,

775
00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:48.420
what the last song is on that one.
Mm.

776
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:49.990
I can't do nothing.

777
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:54.991
Right under Dan had a spell bound as another great one and it's just,

778
00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.361
I dunno,
I,

779
00:48:58.361 --> 00:49:03.361
it's still the craziest thing where now that I've started playing guitar is I am

780
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.820
finding a whole nother genius level to ACDC music that I've now been listening

781
00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:13.900
to for 30 fucking years if he can believe it.
Malcolm is an APP in Angus,

782
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:19.060
they're fucking geniuses.
So this is all I want to do is,
you know,

783
00:49:19.061 --> 00:49:20.740
I'm never going to be able to,
well who knows,

784
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.250
maybe if I play till I'm 65 I'll actually be able to play a couple of Angus

785
00:49:24.251 --> 00:49:27.060
leads if I stick with it.
But like I just wanted,

786
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.610
that's why I started playing guitars.

787
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:30.640
Like I just want to be able to play the shit that Malcolm place,

788
00:49:30.641 --> 00:49:31.990
just the rhythm underneath,
right?

789
00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.370
<v 9>So that's all I'm doing.
I'm sitting there with my fucking my phone or graph,</v>

790
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:39.070
my record player,
my stereo,
whatever you want to call it.

791
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.880
And I'm getting ready to switch the balance all the way over to the left.

792
00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:45.100
So I can figure out what,
what Malcolm is doing.

793
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:48.730
What the fuck does Malcolm do that makes you,

794
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:52.720
if you end the last row of the fucking Roman Coliseum,

795
00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:56.230
he still blowing you out of the back of the thing.
You know,

796
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:58.570
it's all about not playing the high d with those guys.

797
00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:01.810
They're fucking maniacs anyways,
so this is what I want to do.

798
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:06.040
So I switch it over to the left side and I find out my left side speakers fucked

799
00:50:06.041 --> 00:50:06.874
up.

800
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:08.370
<v 8>Oh my God,
Jesus Christ.</v>

801
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.360
So I'm trying to fix the thing and as I reached behind it and I got this little,

802
00:50:11.361 --> 00:50:13.700
I don't know what it is,
you plug the speaker into this little,

803
00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:16.340
it's like the size of like a matchbox car,
right?

804
00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:20.040
And I knock it out and it hits the floor.
Boom,
hits the floor.
I was like,

805
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.730
I literally made that face like,
you know,

806
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.970
cause I don't want to piss off the fucking bear downstairs,
right?

807
00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.930
So he doesn't yell us anymore.
You know what this Douche bag does?
He gets up,

808
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:30.651
don't,
don't,
don't,

809
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:34.250
don't go my hair and walking over to his door and he opens up his door and then

810
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:36.710
slams.
It is hard as he can.

811
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.470
And I really wish that I was mature enough as,

812
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:45.140
as an adult to just laugh that off.

813
00:50:45.141 --> 00:50:50.141
But it made me so fucking mad because I literally feel like this is like the,

814
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:56.480
the,
the,
um,
I'm walking around on egg shells,
male goddamn apartment,
you know,

815
00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.510
here I,
I dropped,
I dropped one fucking thing all day and I let her go.
Like,

816
00:51:02.511 --> 00:51:06.630
oh my God,
what did I do?
I'm literally on eggshells because,
and you know,
and,

817
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.980
and this is what always happens to me.
I always get on egg shells around people.

818
00:51:09.981 --> 00:51:10.461
Initially.

819
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:15.461
That's my initial reaction when someone's a dick is I kind of back off a little

820
00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:19.170
bit,
you know?
And then I,
then I always go into,
wait a minute,

821
00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:23.330
what are you really tiptoeing around?
Or whatever the fuck it is I'm doing.

822
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:28.310
And then I get mad.
And,
uh,
so that's what happened with that guy.
And it's just,

823
00:51:28.311 --> 00:51:31.220
it's just like,
I don't know how to solve this.
It's an old guy.

824
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:36.050
I can't yell at him.
I just can't.
It's like,
it goes against how I was brought up.

825
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:41.060
It's common decency.
He's an old son of a bitch.
Whatever.
He's fucking miserable.

826
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.620
But he keeps doing this,
this fucking Alpha male shit.
Well,

827
00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:49.100
you slamming the door like,
like,

828
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:51.620
I dunno if I'm wrong to read it that way.
Like,

829
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:54.020
like what do you think is some sort of fucking bad ass?

830
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.660
Remember that commercial where you want to dance all man,

831
00:51:56.661 --> 00:52:00.710
you want to fucking dance?
If I feel like doing walking up in a sweat,

832
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:02.270
can I open these goddamn blinds?

833
00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.740
It's probably going to be upset with the noise I just made.
There
you go.

834
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:10.400
Move the screen.
Ah,
fuck.
This thing's gonna slam open.
Now watch this.

835
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:15.890
So it happens every week.
There we go.
Now it's open.
Now it's open.
Um,

836
00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.780
yes.
So I was dealing with that fucking guy.
So anyway,

837
00:52:18.781 --> 00:52:21.590
so I did a podcast last night and just the,

838
00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:25.520
the anger I had for that guy was just running through the entire thing.

839
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:27.710
And I was like,
who wants to listen to an angry son of a bitch?

840
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.890
And I know what you're thinking,
Bell.
You know,
that's how I think he a funniest.

841
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:35.170
When you get mad,
it was a different kind of mad.
It was like a serious like,
dude,

842
00:52:35.171 --> 00:52:39.920
why don't you just fucking get over it?
Kind of mad.
So,
so anyways,
oh,

843
00:52:39.921 --> 00:52:41.340
here's the,
here's a story I wanted to tell you.

844
00:52:41.341 --> 00:52:43.730
I had a gay little moment yesterday at a,
uh,

845
00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.490
when I was hanging out with my girlfriend.
You know,

846
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:50.870
you have to have one of those moments,
you know,
you have,
I was,
uh,

847
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:55.020
driving back from somewhere.
Oh,

848
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.570
a vegetarian restaurant that my girlfriend wanted to go to.
She's like,

849
00:52:59.571 --> 00:53:03.440
you want to go to,
you want to go to Eddie cucumbers?
And I'm like,

850
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.813
no.

851
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.330
But I told her I'd take her out to breakfast and then it became lunch and then

852
00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:12.500
she wants to go to this fucking Vegan place.
Right.
You know,

853
00:53:12.501 --> 00:53:15.980
where they have like,
you know,

854
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:20.150
the chef should literally come out and be like,
okay,
who likes impressions?

855
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.550
All right,
this is my impression of Bacon.

856
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.030
He just wheels some brown soy that he,
that he fucking,

857
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:33.030
that's all it is.
It's,
it's a bunch of,
it's soy.

858
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:38.390
Soy is like the rich little of a Vegan restaurant where it can fucking imitate

859
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.270
him.
Everybody,
but not quite.
It's more like rich little in the 80s,

860
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:44.810
when he stopped working on his impressions and he's,

861
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.450
and he was still like nightly doing like an impression of like Lyndon B Johnson.

862
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:51.450
It's like,
dude,
we're already up to the fucking first George Bush,

863
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.680
which we're not aware of yet,

864
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:57.540
that it is the first George Bush unless we're Marty McFly.
So anyways,

865
00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:02.700
uh,
so we go there,
we fucking eat there.
Um,
and we're driving back.
She goes,

866
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:04.920
I want to get some ice cream.
You want to get some ice cream?

867
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:09.420
I knew a great ice cream place.
I said,
fuck yeah,
I love ice cream.

868
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:14.370
I love it.
I like to eat ice cream.
You know,
I'm not ashamed of it.

869
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:17.670
I know,
you know,
who doesn't like ice cream?
You know,

870
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.370
maybe people who are lactose intolerant,
maybe they don't like it.
People who,

871
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:24.840
who didn't floss throughout their life.
So it hurts their teeth.
You know,

872
00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.650
this one for you youngsters brush and floss every night because if you don't,

873
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:33.270
someday ice cream is going to hurt your teeth and you'll never be able to enjoy

874
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:34.860
it again.
You know,

875
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.480
some day you'll have full upper and lower dentures sitting there just fucking

876
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:43.500
doing that thing.
You know,
you know,
people chew when they have dentures,

877
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.400
they do that thing where they look like they're trying to blow a bubble with

878
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:50.910
their food.
For some reason their tongue has to stick out like a Goddamn Lama.

879
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:55.380
You don't want to do that shit.
So anyways,
I'm like,
yeah,
let's go.
So,
um,

880
00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:00.790
why am I walking around?
I don't know why I'm walking around.
What the fuck?

881
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:05.560
Why am I questioning it?
I felt like walking around,
I'm walking around.
Um,

882
00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:07.530
so anyways,
uh,
so we go to this,

883
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:10.830
this ice cream place and of course it's not like the old school ones that I used

884
00:55:10.831 --> 00:55:14.640
to go to like friendlies and Brigham's where you just walked in and there was

885
00:55:14.641 --> 00:55:18.240
like,
you know,
what do you want?
You want chocolate,
you want vanilla,

886
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.930
he wants strawberry.
You know,
rocky road,

887
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.960
they had a couple of those and I like rocky road and I'm like marshmallows.

888
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.790
I really don't.
They just did fucking gross that they're just,
I dunno.

889
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:33.540
Usually when something's gooey it makes it good,
like melted cheese.

890
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.960
But this marshmallow is a fucking disgusting,
you know?
Oh,

891
00:55:36.961 --> 00:55:39.870
you douchebags out there making s'mores.
I don't what the fuck's wrong with you.

892
00:55:39.871 --> 00:55:42.720
But anyways,
so we'd go to the,
we go to this,
uh,

893
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.850
we go to this place and we walk in.

894
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:48.210
It's one of these places now where they have all these new fucking,

895
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.770
I don't know what kind of flavors they got.

896
00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:53.070
I was going to say funky flavors and I realized that I shouldn't use that word.

897
00:55:53.071 --> 00:55:56.730
So I had to go back to fucking,
I was like,
should I say it?
Should I not say it?

898
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.550
Fucking flavors.
Um,

899
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:03.720
they had like red velvet cake,
ice cream.
I mean,

900
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:06.450
it doesn't even make sense anymore.
So they had another one that was like,

901
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:11.010
you know,
Carmel something and it had great nuts on the top of them.
Right.

902
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:11.821
So this is the deal.

903
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:15.360
I don't know if he'd ever been one of these designer ice cream places.

904
00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:18.870
What they do is their flavors are so fucked up.
You've never had them before.

905
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:20.340
So you've got it.
You want to try them out.

906
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.580
So how it works is it's a scoop a little out with that little,

907
00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:27.670
this little plastic spoon,
and then they hand it to you and then you eat it.

908
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.690
You know like,
Oh yeah,
I,

909
00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.860
<v 9>I like that one.
Let me try this one.
It's my girlfriend's doing that and it,</v>

910
00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:36.440
this dude scooping the ice cream out.
So it's like already,
it's just like weird.

911
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.470
Like which one you want to try.
And even like the names,
oh,
let me,

912
00:56:39.471 --> 00:56:42.860
let me try the triple foofy fucking one.
Right.
So I go,

913
00:56:42.861 --> 00:56:44.180
let me try the great and that one.
Right?

914
00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.020
So we scoops a little bit out and then he goes to,

915
00:56:48.021 --> 00:56:53.021
he goes down because they hand it to me and the spoon is so small,

916
00:56:53.451 --> 00:56:54.380
there's,
there's like,

917
00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:59.630
there's no way for me to take it from without brushing my hand and gets his
hand,

918
00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.940
you know?
And then I also,
I have to take it in a very,
very light,

919
00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.680
delicate way because I don't want to spill the ice cream.

920
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:10.610
So my hand grazes his hand,
you know,

921
00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.930
like we're in lady and the tramp fucking eaten spaghetti and a hand kind of way.

922
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.740
Right.

923
00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:20.660
And I take it from him and then I eat the ice cream and it just,

924
00:57:20.661 --> 00:57:24.890
it just,
there was something about it that just felt wrong.
Okay.

925
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.930
I just sort of,
it was intimate.

926
00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.550
I had an intimate moment with his hand in my hand and then I put a sweet treat

927
00:57:31.551 --> 00:57:34.090
into my mouth afterwards and told them it was good.

928
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:41.130
So,
so is the best part.

929
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:45.300
So I don't give a fuck what that ice cream was.
Felt like.
I was like,

930
00:57:45.301 --> 00:57:47.880
I'm taking that shit right now.
Let me get,
let me get that flavor.

931
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.080
Cause I don't know if I can do that again.
And uh,
you know,
I dunno.

932
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.120
I'll either start blushing or asked for your phone number.

933
00:57:54.121 --> 00:57:58.020
I don't know what's going to happen.
So the best part was after I go,
yeah,

934
00:57:58.021 --> 00:58:02.460
let me just get that great enough flavor.
My girl goes,
oh no,
you get two scoops.

935
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.520
Two different flavors.
What other one do you want to try?
And I'm like that one.

936
00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:09.120
The one right next to it.
I don't think they go well together.

937
00:58:09.121 --> 00:58:12.510
I don't give a fuck.
Can we end this?

938
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.160
What does that cowboy movie with a two gay cowboys in the,
uh,

939
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:21.690
Brokeback mountain moment with the ice cream we just ended.
Oh God.

940
00:58:21.691 --> 00:58:22.890
I'm getting creeped out right now,

941
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:26.920
<v 8>Jeff.
I'll tell you something else.
Fucking,
it was worth it,
man.</v>

942
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.620
Ice Cream was unbelievable with the grape nuts on it and telling you it's worth

943
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:34.300
it.
It's worth grazing another man's hands just to try it.

944
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:37.450
It's fucking phenomenal.
Um,
so there you go.
That was my,

945
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:40.900
that was my little moment.
And uh,
the ice cream is so good.

946
00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:44.710
I'm going to go there again and I'm going to try my best to get a female the

947
00:58:44.711 --> 00:58:48.700
next time I have to do that.
That might get dangerous.
Right?
And then what else?

948
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:53.600
Fucking,
no,
no,
no.
I'm going,
I'm going to go down.
I don't do sex jokes.

949
00:58:53.601 --> 00:58:57.440
Okay.
The two fucking easy.
All right.
I just trashed Jesus.
All right,

950
00:58:57.441 --> 00:59:01.010
so that was my gay little moment of the week.
Um,
I can't get fucking comfortable.

951
00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:03.980
Why can't I?
I can't.
I'm standing up.
I'm sitting back down.

952
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.460
My foot feels a lot better by the way.
I want to thank that.
The,

953
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.610
I had a couple of doctors who actually listened to this,

954
00:59:10.611 --> 00:59:12.960
or at least they say they are.
And uh,

955
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:17.300
whoever was the one who told me to take a bottle of water and freeze it in the

956
00:59:17.301 --> 00:59:20.870
fridge and roll that underneath the arch of my,

957
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.370
it's done fucking wonders.
So pass that on.

958
00:59:25.371 --> 00:59:28.910
If you have a fuck up the Archie or foot and every time he go to take a step and

959
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:32.720
it feels like there's,
there's,
there's an invisible smurf,

960
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:37.850
just stab in the bottom of your foot.
Just do a bunch of calf stretches,

961
00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:41.390
almost like runners.
Stretches is what you do.
And then like,
like three,

962
00:59:41.391 --> 00:59:46.370
four times a day,
just roll a frozen bottle of water underneath your arch.

963
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:49.970
It's like you're massaging it.
And icing it all at the same time.

964
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:52.850
And I gotta tell you want to talk about a fucking ice cream headache.

965
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:57.470
Take a frozen bottle of water and just stick it on the bottom of your foot.
Um,

966
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.740
but you know,
you get used to it,
you get fucking used to it.

967
01:00:00.741 --> 01:00:03.740
So I want to thank whoever,
uh,
whoever told me to do that,

968
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.120
I somehow lost the email with all my web stuff this week.
Um,

969
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:13.400
but anyways,
plowing ahead here.
I have,
I have more exciting news right now.

970
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:17.870
I am currently getting ready to do my fifth,
uh,

971
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.770
performance on the David Letterman program.
Number five.

972
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:26.510
My fifth time going to go out there and do some stand up and,
uh,

973
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.930
I'm putting together the set right now.
I'm very confident.

974
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:33.140
I think everything's going good.
It's ahead of schedule.

975
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:37.010
And tonight I'm literally going to sit down and,
uh,
before I go out,

976
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.460
I have it all worked out and I just have to type it out.

977
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:44.480
Like my jokes are easily,
I can take the curse words out easily.

978
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:48.740
Um,
because so much of my cursing is not even necessary.

979
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.970
I just liked to do it.
And then,
cause I love getting the emails,

980
01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:56.240
like so much of your current thing,
you don't even need it for

981
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:03.310
those fucking people who sit there and they think that clean comedy is like this

982
01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:08.540
unbelievable thing.
Like highly you do it.

983
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:12.980
I just don't understand it.
You know it's,
I'm not saying it's,
it's,

984
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.050
it's a bad thing,
but the way people like that,
that right there,
that's a peer,

985
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.940
that's pure fuck.

986
01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:23.270
You know what that's like watching Lawrence Welk in because they're just so

987
01:01:23.271 --> 01:01:28.160
wholesome that you just think that none of those guys in that band or are
racist,

988
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.440
you know,
you know people who will watch clean comedy and then just think,

989
01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:35.950
see right there,
that's what comedy's on Lantus Fuck.

990
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:39.770
And then those are the same people who like their neighbor ends up being a

991
01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:43.700
serial killer.
Right.
And they always say the same shit.
He was so nice.

992
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:45.890
Like what is your definition of Nice?

993
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.570
Because they say hello to you every morning.
Good morning.
How are you?

994
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.600
Nice weather we're having,
he's so nice.
He always says hello.

995
01:01:56.090 --> 01:02:01.040
He's or he never curses.
It's wholesome.
It's wholesome comedy.
You know?

996
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:05.090
Look at fucking Hugh Grant.
Could you get any more wholesome than that guy?

997
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:10.070
Hugh grant killed the hookers seen on sunset.

998
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:11.930
I learned that when he got busted,

999
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.900
they used to be hookers walking up and down the street back in the fucking

1000
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:15.560
heyday.

1001
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:20.130
But because that guy didn't even have the decency to pull down the fucking side

1002
01:02:20.131 --> 01:02:23.670
street,
the guy's got one blowing them as he goes into in and out Burger,

1003
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.440
you know?
But you look at his movies and he plays this bumbling,
oh woo.

1004
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:34.230
He's out there banging hookers so all you fucks,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm sick of it.

1005
01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:36.780
You're idiots.
You're idiots.
Your,
your,
your,

1006
01:02:36.781 --> 01:02:41.340
your basis for somebody being nice is they say nice things,

1007
01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:47.010
you know?
Have you taken any psychology classes?
Have you ever,
I don't know what,

1008
01:02:47.011 --> 01:02:51.540
tried to break somebody down and figure out why they do the shit that they do.

1009
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.400
Why am I yelling at all of you guys?
Like you disagreed with me?

1010
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:59.580
Obviously you don't give a shit if I curse.
If you listen to this thing,

1011
01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:00.840
you know what I did right?

1012
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:03.330
I should have been playing Catholic church music right underneath that.

1013
01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:04.680
That's what I was doing right there.

1014
01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.670
I was guilting you guys about something you didn't even fucking do.

1015
01:03:08.671 --> 01:03:12.390
What an asshole.
I apologize.
So anyways,
that's,
that's typical me.

1016
01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:15.600
I had great news and then I have to go negative way with it.
Um,
yeah,

1017
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:19.560
so I'm going to be taping on,
um,
Monday,
May 16th,

1018
01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:23.130
and then I believe at airs that Friday,
which is May 20th.

1019
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:28.131
So set your dvrs and all that type of stuff and I'm going to go out there and

1020
01:03:28.231 --> 01:03:30.330
have a great time.
So there is that.

1021
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:35.390
And another big piece of news for the Trifecta here is I finally have a date in

1022
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.080
Las Vegas.
That's right after years of people asking me on the podcast,
dude,

1023
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:48.090
why don't you come to Vegas?
What's the deal man?
Um,

1024
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:52.830
Tom Papa,
who is the host of the marriage ref,
very funny show on NBC.

1025
01:03:52.831 --> 01:03:57.210
Everybody should watch.
Good friend of mine,
Tom Papa,
wholesome Tom.

1026
01:03:57.211 --> 01:03:59.130
Papa does not curse in his act.

1027
01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:01.143
<v 2>You know,</v>

1028
01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.190
<v 8>granted he's murdered half his fucking neighbors,
but Napkin.
Um,
he,</v>

1029
01:04:06.191 --> 01:04:11.191
he hosts the show at the Orleans Casino in Las Vegas.

1030
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:15.680
Okay.
So just go to a,
I have all the information up on my website,

1031
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:18.170
[inaudible] dot com.
Um,

1032
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.920
but it's not going to have my name on it because it's Tom Show I'm coming on and

1033
01:04:21.921 --> 01:04:25.040
I'm basically doing the Tom Papa comedy show.
So if you see Tom Papa,

1034
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:30.560
why don't I give you the fucking dates and stop running my God damn mouth.
Uh,

1035
01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:35.390
I'm very excited about this date because a huge fan of Tom Papa,

1036
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.730
a good friend of mine,

1037
01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:40.580
and I don't get to work with a lot of my friends anymore because they're all

1038
01:04:40.581 --> 01:04:41.091
headlining.

1039
01:04:41.091 --> 01:04:45.320
So this is a rare time that I get to work with another comedian that I respect

1040
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:51.050
and am friends with a,
okay.
So it's on June 25th and 26.
It's a Friday night.

1041
01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.170
And one of the cool things about the Orleans a casino,

1042
01:04:54.171 --> 01:04:57.210
it's the last place where George Carlin did stand up,

1043
01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.840
see that a lot of people didn't know that.
Did they?
You didn't,
did you?
So,

1044
01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.660
uh,
there's that and that,
that ends that.

1045
01:05:05.661 --> 01:05:07.090
Now what the fuck did I want to talk about?

1046
01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.170
It just had a great segway there and I couldn't remember

1047
01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:13.940
the hell I was going to talk about Jesus Christ.

1048
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:18.280
This is always happens whenever I record these things.
I have these moments.

1049
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:23.170
I have these little levels and I've learned to not panic during them.

1050
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:27.310
Let's talk about a show that I saw in ESPN called a 30 for 30.

1051
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:30.160
It's this great new segment.
If you're a sports fan,

1052
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:33.400
set your DVR and check this shit out.
Um,

1053
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.920
they're doing stories on who killed the USFL,
uh,

1054
01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.820
the United States football league,
which I didn't,

1055
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:44.170
I didn't know somebody killed it.
I just thought it didn't work out.
You know?

1056
01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:47.860
Um,
I actually,

1057
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.350
a lot of people don't know this actually went to a USFL game.

1058
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:51.910
I saw the Boston breakers first,

1059
01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:56.440
the Washington federals at Nickerson field in a,

1060
01:05:56.441 --> 01:05:59.080
in Boston,
Massachusetts,
in the Boston breakers one.

1061
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:00.940
And it was almost a capacity crowd,

1062
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:06.010
just out of curiosity and a,
I still remember a lot of the teams,

1063
01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:09.550
Philadelphia Stars,
the New Jersey generals owned by Donald Trump,

1064
01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:11.920
had Herschel walker and Doug Flutie.
Remember that shit?

1065
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:15.960
Michigan Panthers won it the first year.

1066
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.950
Bobby a bear is that who was the quarterback,

1067
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.720
but then went and played with the saints.
Believe it or not,

1068
01:06:21.721 --> 01:06:23.220
I'm not looking at this shit up on the Internet.

1069
01:06:23.221 --> 01:06:25.890
I actually remember this stuff and my favorite fucking helmet.

1070
01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:29.820
I thought the Michigan Panthers had a cool helmet,
but I liked,
uh,
Oakland.

1071
01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.780
They had liked that,
that fist holding the lightening bolt on that yellow helmet.

1072
01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:34.643
It was the shit.

1073
01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.220
And I thought it was very fitting because the Raiders have the best uniforms and

1074
01:06:38.221 --> 01:06:40.680
all football and everyone's tried to rip them off.

1075
01:06:40.681 --> 01:06:43.770
Whenever your team becomes too pussy,
like they always go,
well,

1076
01:06:43.771 --> 01:06:44.581
let's fucking steal.

1077
01:06:44.581 --> 01:06:47.250
The Raiders will start wearing black because that's a bad ass color.

1078
01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.930
Remember Jerry Glanville,
Huh?
Speaking of marshmallows.
That dough boy,

1079
01:06:51.931 --> 01:06:54.360
remember that when nobody respected the Houston Oilers,

1080
01:06:54.361 --> 01:06:57.870
all of a sudden he gets a black satin fucking Houston Oilers jacket.

1081
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.500
I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
So anyway,
so I watched one episode of it,

1082
01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.520
I can't really recommend it high enough.

1083
01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:09.830
I watched one on the University of Miami called the you and it was talking about

1084
01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.260
the Hay Day of the University of Miami.
Um,
it was fucking awesome man.

1085
01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:18.920
It was just an awesome thing on so many different levels.

1086
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.080
Just showing how bad asked at team were,
was how crazy their team was.

1087
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:28.760
And then also just watching all those old guys now exaggerating all their

1088
01:07:28.761 --> 01:07:32.300
fucking stories was hilarious.
And that's the great thing about being an old guy.

1089
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:36.050
If you did something at eight when you retell the story,

1090
01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:37.560
you did it at 15 and they,

1091
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.630
they were doing it to such a ridiculous level that I almost forgot that I was

1092
01:07:41.631 --> 01:07:46.631
alive when that shit was going down because it sounded like a brand new story to

1093
01:07:46.671 --> 01:07:48.050
me.
I mean,

1094
01:07:48.051 --> 01:07:53.051
granted they were not liked throughout college football and college sports in

1095
01:07:54.681 --> 01:07:57.380
general.
Without a doubt.
They were considered crass,

1096
01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.300
no class thugs,
all the APPS fucking lutely.

1097
01:08:02.301 --> 01:08:05.690
But to tell the way they tell this story,
it's,
it's just like,

1098
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:08.780
and the president was like,
fuck Russia,

1099
01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.230
what's going on at the University of Miami?
I mean,
it was at the end of the day,

1100
01:08:12.231 --> 01:08:15.740
it's a fucking football team.
It's hilarious.
This one guy goes,

1101
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:20.330
we will like Ali talking track.
Oh yeah,
you just like,
golly.

1102
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:21.703
You know,

1103
01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:26.510
he basically brought talking shit to a whole nother art form.

1104
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:31.010
He basically was the first guy to do it.
Uh,
not even on a national,

1105
01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:35.150
he did it on a global level and he was also stripped of his title because he

1106
01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:38.900
wouldn't go to war because of religious reasons.
And he stuck by it.

1107
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.330
And you guys grabbed your Dick's after catching touchdown passes.
Oh yeah.

1108
01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:48.650
That's the same thing.
You,
he would just like it.
You know what this like,

1109
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:52.250
it always goes back to that same quote when I see that that Bill Russell Clip,

1110
01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:56.180
Bill Russell was talking about his philosophies on rebounding.

1111
01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:01.100
I knew what the guy,
I broke the guy down I,
Bubba,
Bubba,
and then he's just like,

1112
01:09:01.101 --> 01:09:04.610
so a lot of times I got the rebound before the guy ever even took the shot,

1113
01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.500
you know,
rarely bill rally.
You could,

1114
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.570
it wasn't really that you were six foot 10 and everybody else was a five foot

1115
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.250
eight inch fucking white guy at that point.
Other than Wilt Chamberlain who was,

1116
01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:20.810
you know,
didn't everybody look like Bob Cousy,
you know,
but he's an old man now.

1117
01:09:20.811 --> 01:09:24.080
So he,
he get,
he gets to fuck and he gets to,
to exaggerate.

1118
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:30.140
I look at Pau Gasol when they won game one,
uh,
the other night.

1119
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.670
Oh No.
When they,
when they closed it out,
sorry,

1120
01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:35.720
when they closed it out against Oklahoma,
when,
Oh,
when Koby missed that,
uh,

1121
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:38.060
he misses that shot and then pow,
you know,

1122
01:09:38.061 --> 01:09:42.480
caught the rebound and all the one motion put it in.
I can't wait.
I am,

1123
01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.670
and I mean,
it's like he's going to tell it to me.

1124
01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:48.140
I would love to hear him tell it later on in life,
how he's going to be like,

1125
01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:51.590
you know,
I mean,
did you see the look on his face?
He couldn't even believe it.

1126
01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.640
He was like,
oh my God,
Kobe's filing,

1127
01:09:54.641 --> 01:09:57.920
not going to yell at me on the jet ride home.
I did some good,

1128
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.680
I did something good.
He didn't even know what to do.

1129
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:04.340
It was like when Phil Mickelson finally when the masters and he jumped up in the

1130
01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:08.450
air and then landed on the ground and cause he felt weird.
Like he didn't,

1131
01:10:08.451 --> 01:10:10.670
he didn't know what to do.
He didn't know what to do.

1132
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.210
But later on in life when that fucking old fish heads,

1133
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:18.500
maybe when his head finally fucking fills out and it's round like a head

1134
01:10:18.501 --> 01:10:22.280
supposed to be rather than looking like the Sunday paper turned sideways.

1135
01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:27.500
Um,
God help me if that guy ever sees me,

1136
01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:31.550
I really forget that just because NBA players can throw him around that I am

1137
01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:34.850
only five foot 10 inches and he can fucking throw me through an Applebee's wall

1138
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.900
upside down.
Um,
anyways.
Yeah.

1139
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:43.220
When he goes to tell that story,
it's going to be fucking hilarious.
He was just,

1140
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:47.780
it was a moment in the game and I knew something had to happen,
you know,

1141
01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:49.100
and when he let that ball go,

1142
01:10:49.101 --> 01:10:51.500
I knew it wasn't going to go in and something told me,

1143
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.530
I don't know where that ball's going to come off the rim,

1144
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:58.700
but I'm going to be there.
You know,
he's going to tell it like that.

1145
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.470
That's what if,
if you're like me,

1146
01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:04.700
if you're in your early forties and you were around when the University of Miami

1147
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:08.660
,
uh,
was winning all those titles do with the way that they taught,

1148
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.020
you would've thought the entire country was,

1149
01:11:12.021 --> 01:11:14.010
was just quaking in the corner

1150
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.000
<v 9>because of a fucking football.
It was a football team was hilarious.</v>

1151
01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.180
You know,
especially being a guy from Boston,
which is not a college sports town.

1152
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.450
We're professional sports town.
All right?

1153
01:11:24.451 --> 01:11:28.920
So all we know about the University of Miami is that the fucking BC eagles beats

1154
01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:32.250
you on the last play of the game.
That's your bad ass team.

1155
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:37.530
Fucking 65 yard goddamn prayer.
Tom Jackson says,

1156
01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:42.300
knock it down and you didn't
you let Gerard fail in,

1157
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:44.220
sneak in behind you.
How does that happen?

1158
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:49.740
How does a fucking little white dude get behind all those black guys on defense?

1159
01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:53.700
It's,
it's physically impossible.
Why guys can't do shit like that.

1160
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:57.250
<v 8>Um,
so anyways,
but definitely watch it because a,</v>

1161
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:59.630
the guy who keeps raining it in is Michael Ervin.

1162
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:03.470
Cause Michael Reverend is just really fucking honest because at one point they

1163
01:12:03.471 --> 01:12:06.320
were saying,
you know,
the media was biased.
They will racist,
you know,

1164
01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:10.490
which obviously,
you know,
there's tremendous Ellen trunk mount of truth to that.

1165
01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:13.910
They were saying that while they were cutting to stories of these guys bringing

1166
01:12:13.911 --> 01:12:16.340
guns to clubs,
you know,

1167
01:12:16.341 --> 01:12:19.100
and then they finally cut to Michael Irving and Michael Irvin was hilarious.

1168
01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:22.460
He was just like,
you know,
a lot of guys say that the media was biased,

1169
01:12:22.461 --> 01:12:26.570
but now the truth is we,
we,
we were a bunch of bad kids.
We were bad kids.

1170
01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.760
So you know,
you can't fucking argue with the honesty.
All right,

1171
01:12:31.761 --> 01:12:33.770
let's get into the topics here.
I know,
I said,
all right,

1172
01:12:33.771 --> 01:12:37.010
youtube videos for this week.
If you sit in educatable right,

1173
01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:41.390
your boss has been a con today and you feel like fucking off,
you know,

1174
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:45.710
sticking it to the man.
Here's a couple for you to watch.
A two quick ones.

1175
01:12:45.711 --> 01:12:48.170
Fuck you.
Baltimore.
That's a great one.

1176
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:52.250
A parody of a car commercial and uh,
there's another one.

1177
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:53.900
If you're a sports fan,

1178
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:57.850
do you know like the new thing when you go to a game like the insane like flat

1179
01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.173
screen TV,

1180
01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:03.080
like they make some sort of intro for your team to get the crowds psyched up.

1181
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:07.580
Like uh,
like picks like the,
like maybe like the Nashville predators,

1182
01:13:07.581 --> 01:13:10.910
how they have like that saber tooth tiger.
Maybe I'll just have like a,
you know,

1183
01:13:10.911 --> 01:13:15.320
computerized saber tooth tiger doing some shit with like a hockey stick or

1184
01:13:15.321 --> 01:13:19.970
whatever.
I got the best one ever.
That is so fucking politically incorrect.

1185
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:24.320
If you guys ever wondered what a computerized polar bear would look like if it

1186
01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:28.580
decided to blow up the world.
And actually it actually blows up the world.

1187
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:34.160
If the planet earth gets blown up by this psycho fucking polar bear.

1188
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:36.140
It's the,
uh,

1189
01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:41.750
it's the Nanook hockey opening 2010.
That's what you want to search.

1190
01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:45.010
And then now nook is n a n all okay.

1191
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:49.880
Hockey opening 2010 it starts with a boat.

1192
01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.460
Uh,
an icebreaking boat.
You know,
obviously it's an Alaskan team,

1193
01:13:55.461 --> 01:13:59.140
I'm guessing with Nanook unless it's,
I dunno,
the Yukon territory's,

1194
01:13:59.150 --> 01:13:59.983
I have no idea.

1195
01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.940
And there's a polar bear frozen in the ice and it it because they break up the

1196
01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:08.240
ice,
the polar bear gets mad,
comes up through the ice.

1197
01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.880
It's 10 times bigger than the fucking boat.

1198
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:15.250
I'll just tell you the beginning and then some sort of supernatural shit happens

1199
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.170
where it's claps its hands together.

1200
01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:22.390
Like Michael Clark Dunk Duncan in that movie about death row in the mouse.
Right.

1201
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.510
And all of a sudden it has like a,

1202
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.520
a hockey stick that's glowing like a light saber.

1203
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:32.790
The thing lets out a growl and then slams it down on the ice break and ship

1204
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:36.130
breaks it in half and the fucking thing sinks.

1205
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:40.300
And the first thing I'm thinking was,
well what about the people on the boat,

1206
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:42.790
<v 1>right?
Isn't that what they'd say at the arena?</v>

1207
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:45.760
I think it's good that there's a teddy bear,

1208
01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:48.040
but does it have to kill people on a boat?

1209
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:52.480
This thing that's just where this starts.
I don't know what happens after that.

1210
01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:55.660
And next thing you know,
it's in an f 16 in the fucking planet earth blows up.

1211
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:59.800
This is for the beginning of a hockey game.
It's the greatest one I've ever seen.

1212
01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.020
If you're into that type of shit.
So check it out.

1213
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:06.190
And the Nook hop hockey opening 2010.
All right,

1214
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:10.130
let's get on with the questions for this week.
Uh,
ask bill.
Um,

1215
01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:12.260
<v 8>very interesting question and um,</v>

1216
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.260
I think I might need a little bit of help on this one because this goes outside

1217
01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.110
the realms of what I've been doing with my life.

1218
01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.900
Um,
Bill,
I've been meaning to ask you,

1219
01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:26.580
I'm afraid that when I'm an adult and have responsibility that I will not be

1220
01:15:26.581 --> 01:15:29.250
able to smoke weed.
I'm not a pothead.

1221
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:33.840
I smoke about a few times a week,
more in the summer.
Um,

1222
01:15:33.841 --> 01:15:36.210
I get decent grades at a decent school.

1223
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.240
I feel like professional and family life won't allow me to blaze anymore.

1224
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:45.210
This is what I love about this is right up until then,

1225
01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.680
right up until he says the word blaze.
I'm really,
I'm really believe in this guy,

1226
01:15:49.681 --> 01:15:52.770
you know,
whatever.
You know,
I smoked a couple joints a week.
You know,

1227
01:15:52.771 --> 01:15:56.520
I do well in school at a great school.
You know,
I'm very responsible.

1228
01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.500
I don't drink and drive it a couple times a week.
I have a,

1229
01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:02.040
if he said I have a couple of Tokes,
no big deal,
I get it.
You know,

1230
01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.160
you want to watch Laverne and Shirley and he'd fiddle faddle I don't have a

1231
01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:08.900
problem with that,
you know,
but once you say blaze,
I'm just a,

1232
01:16:08.901 --> 01:16:13.740
that's at least isn't that like blunt level?
Cause I always just,

1233
01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:16.080
I mean I'm not pothead.
I don't even smoke this shit.

1234
01:16:16.081 --> 01:16:20.640
So I just picture blaze meaning that there has to be some sort of significant

1235
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.020
source of fire to get that joint going.
Like it's that big.

1236
01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:28.170
Maybe I'm wrong because I'm a booze hound.
So anyways,
he goes,

1237
01:16:28.171 --> 01:16:30.950
do you think this is true?
Do you think anyone,
uh,

1238
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.380
do you know anyone your age or older who do smoke

1239
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.610
decent grades at a different,
at a decent school.
Okay.

1240
01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:43.410
Do you know anyone your age or older who do smoke?
All right.

1241
01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.910
Um,
the,
this is my feelings on,
on weed.
I don't think it's that bad.

1242
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.120
Especially nowadays we can get like a vaporizer,

1243
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:55.110
check that out or go to a,
the,
mm,
what is it?

1244
01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:59.970
www.themmppodcast.com.
And they'll have a picture for you.
I guarantee it.

1245
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:05.640
Um,
a vaporizer is basically you have,

1246
01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:08.880
you put the weed in there,
you light it on fire or whatever the fuck you do.

1247
01:17:08.881 --> 01:17:11.960
And it basically filters out everything except what gets you high.

1248
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:17.090
Now that has to be way more healthier than sitting down and finishing a six
pack,

1249
01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:17.924
isn't it?

1250
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:21.560
I guess it depends if you get the munchies and then he'd go out and eat cake and

1251
01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:25.550
ice cream.
I have no fucking idea.
But anyways,
I think,
yeah,
I,
there's,
you know,

1252
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:28.970
I know people who are married and have kids and uh,
you know,

1253
01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:32.810
if he once in a while they go out,
send their kids to bed,

1254
01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.510
have a couple of puffs,
but you know,
you know,
kids,

1255
01:17:35.511 --> 01:17:36.650
they'll figure out what you're doing.

1256
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:41.250
That's the only thing you have to really hide it because,
uh,
I don't,

1257
01:17:41.251 --> 01:17:46.251
I don't think I would smoke weed in front of my kids ever because even though I

1258
01:17:46.431 --> 01:17:50.570
don't think it's any worse than having a beer,
it isn't,
it really isn't.

1259
01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:51.800
Um,

1260
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.800
the thing is is you are knowingly breaking the law and it is considered like,

1261
01:17:57.410 --> 01:18:00.410
you know,
you're on drugs for,
for some reason alcohol isn't,

1262
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:02.660
which is complete bullshit,
but it is.

1263
01:18:02.661 --> 01:18:05.720
So just do that in front of a kid and you know,
kids,

1264
01:18:05.721 --> 01:18:09.710
they always want to outdo you.
They see you drinking a six pack.

1265
01:18:09.711 --> 01:18:12.860
They're going to try to go for,
you know,
at least eight to 12.
I don't know.

1266
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:16.940
So I would just be worried this is with no psychological,
you know,

1267
01:18:16.941 --> 01:18:19.580
psychology background or any of that shit.
I would just think if you,

1268
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.770
if your kids saw you smoking weed,

1269
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.260
that he would be smoking weed by at least seventh or eighth grade,

1270
01:18:27.261 --> 01:18:30.560
maybe 10th if he was a fucking nerd at that point.

1271
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:35.270
But um,
and then I don't think it would be that big a leap to coke.

1272
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:38.900
I really wouldn't.
Now I know.

1273
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:41.360
Potheads this is like a fucking big thing with you guys.

1274
01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:42.410
Well that's just bullshit.

1275
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.680
It's just bullshit to do proof you to fucking gateway drug.
Really.

1276
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:48.710
I think it is because everybody I know went that route.

1277
01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.970
You started off with booze,
then you went to weed,

1278
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:54.470
then you went to coke and whatever else.
So you are weed.

1279
01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:59.150
You went to coke or they had crank.
Anybody remember that shit?

1280
01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.010
Um,
and whatever else you did took pills,
whatever you did,
you were just like,

1281
01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:08.450
whatever is acid.
But you always went,
we'd first,
I mean,

1282
01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.450
as far as I know,
that's how,
uh,

1283
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:14.930
people who I didn't hang out with in high school did it look at me still being a

1284
01:19:14.931 --> 01:19:19.730
fucking friend,
not throwing anybody under the bus.
Um,

1285
01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.400
oh to it.
Speaking of that,
I'm back back in my hometown this weekend.

1286
01:19:22.401 --> 01:19:26.120
Really excited.
Thursday and Friday.
I'm at the Wilbur Theater.

1287
01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:30.590
Friday night is already sold out a Thursday night.
Tickets are still available.

1288
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:34.550
Go to [inaudible] dot com click on the Wilbur theater for Thursday,

1289
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:39.620
May 6th for tickets.
I'm really whoring myself out this week.
And um,

1290
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:46.170
yeah,
I'll be in Atlantic city on Saturday night during the Trump Taj Mahal.
Um,

1291
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:48.890
anyways,
so yeah,
that's my answer.
I think.
Yeah,

1292
01:19:48.891 --> 01:19:50.690
you can easily continue to smoke weed.

1293
01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:53.600
Just be open and honest with the person that you're with and just say,
look,

1294
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:57.680
you know,
I don't smoke it every fucking day.
Uh,

1295
01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:01.190
I just would rather do that than have like 12 beers and become a fat fuck,

1296
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.910
you know,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1297
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:10.410
I'm going to buy a,
I don't even know what the,
what the,
what the quantity is.

1298
01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:13.170
If you smoke twice a week,
what would you need?
How much would you need?

1299
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:15.870
Would you need a couple of buds for that?
Get you through it?
I don't know.

1300
01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:19.470
Just a couple of bucks a month.
That's all.
That's all I'm going to do,
sweetheart.

1301
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:22.230
All right.
Don't look at me that way.
Okay.
I'm a smart guy.

1302
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:26.640
I went to a smart school and uh,
you know,

1303
01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:32.490
do you know anyone your age or older who do smoke?
Um,
all right.
That's it.

1304
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:36.540
That is it for that.
Let's move onto the next thing.
Uh,
what are we going here?

1305
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:40.860
He built,
it's been about two weeks since the April 19th podcast.

1306
01:20:40.861 --> 01:20:43.770
When you said you wanted the listeners to ask you the following question,

1307
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:45.570
if I happen to be a comedian,

1308
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:50.550
what are the general rules if I am opening for the headlining act?
Ah,
right.

1309
01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.040
<v 9>Uh,</v>

1310
01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.400
<v 8>yeah.
I did not have a good time that weekend,
so yeah,</v>

1311
01:20:55.401 --> 01:20:56.740
this is what you would want to do yet.

1312
01:20:57.250 --> 01:21:01.900
<v 9>Just go up and do your act within the allotted time you're given.</v>

1313
01:21:01.901 --> 01:21:03.940
If somebody tells you to do 25 minutes,

1314
01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:08.920
do 25 minutes and do your act.
If you want to blow me off the stage,

1315
01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.360
go up there and absolutely fucking destroy with your jokes.

1316
01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:16.180
If you want to try and make it hard on me as a comedian.

1317
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:19.120
If you want the club owner to be looking at you going like,

1318
01:21:19.330 --> 01:21:23.530
this guy's going to headline someday,
that's the way you do it.
You go up there,

1319
01:21:23.650 --> 01:21:28.630
you do your act and you fucking destroy and you make it hard for me.
All right?

1320
01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.180
That's the ideal.
Okay?
Now there's other,
there's,

1321
01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:37.960
there's some headliners out there that tell like,
you're basically another thing,

1322
01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:38.411
uh,
as,

1323
01:21:38.411 --> 01:21:42.850
as courtesy to the closing act is you're not overly dirty and you don't play

1324
01:21:42.851 --> 01:21:47.020
with the crowd.
That's another,
that's another thing.
You know,

1325
01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:49.990
there's other people they say don't go in the green room.
You know,

1326
01:21:49.991 --> 01:21:51.880
some people who was like fucking divas,

1327
01:21:51.881 --> 01:21:55.750
they don't want anybody in there or they're tired and then there's other

1328
01:21:55.751 --> 01:21:57.820
headliners who won't even let you sell shit.
You know,

1329
01:21:57.821 --> 01:22:00.480
sometimes feature acts come up to me and like I have yo yo,

1330
01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:04.210
this guy saw my yoyos.
Some headliners don't yell at you.
Do that.

1331
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:05.890
So this is my shit.

1332
01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:10.830
I don't give a fuck how dirty you are cause I'm filthy.
I don't give a shit.

1333
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:14.220
You can talk to the crowd.
I don't give a fuck.
He can come in the green room,

1334
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:17.670
you can sell your shit afterwards.
I don't give a shit.
Just do your time.

1335
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:20.280
Just stick to your fucking time.
All right?

1336
01:22:20.281 --> 01:22:23.640
Don't go up there and do when you're supposed to do

1337
01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:28.420
<v 8>20 to 40 minutes and say,
Oh hey,
sorry about that.</v>

1338
01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:31.660
And then I say,
okay,
that's cool.
Whatever.
We all do that every once in awhile.

1339
01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:33.430
And then the next night on the late show,

1340
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:38.550
you do 37 minutes and you're talking to the crowd and you say means shit to him

1341
01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:43.540
and you're not really killing,
but you're not bombing.
You just,
you know,

1342
01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.860
this is a technique that some features do to try to make the headline or look

1343
01:22:47.861 --> 01:22:52.330
bad is they go over their time and they fuck with the crowd and they're overly

1344
01:22:52.331 --> 01:22:56.230
dirty or they'll say mean stuff and it's basically they're blowing out the

1345
01:22:56.231 --> 01:23:00.340
parameters of the show and then they're also,
they're making the crowd tired,

1346
01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:05.800
you know,
and uh,
so then when you go up as,
as,
as the act,

1347
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.420
<v 9>rather than having a crowd that's ready to go,
they're already worn out.</v>

1348
01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:13.630
You're coming up there and the energy is like,

1349
01:23:13.631 --> 01:23:15.940
you've already been up there for a fucking half an hour.

1350
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:19.630
That's like how tired they are.
And uh,

1351
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:22.330
that was basically the scenario that I was in.

1352
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.740
There's this guy did 40 and then he did 37.
And then when I said,
dude,

1353
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:30.670
what the fuck?
That's such,
that's two out of three shows.

1354
01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:35.200
He then hit me with the brilliant,
oh,
how much time do you want me to do?

1355
01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:38.920
You know,
which is like an open miker question.

1356
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:41.080
This guy was actually older than I was.
Okay.

1357
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:45.340
You know the club told you how much time to do so either you're deliberately

1358
01:23:45.341 --> 01:23:50.080
trying to make it difficult on me by boring the shit out of this crowd for an

1359
01:23:50.081 --> 01:23:52.240
extra 20 fucking this guy supposed to do 20 minutes.

1360
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.650
He did 40 he's doing twice as time.
Um,
yeah,

1361
01:23:56.651 --> 01:24:00.010
it was one of those deals.
Either that or a,
I don't know what your deal is.

1362
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.460
I don't know.

1363
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:05.460
I was not able to figure this guy out and it was actually a sad thing because he

1364
01:24:05.831 --> 01:24:09.910
was a smart guy and he had good jokes and he should've just done m and a even

1365
01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:13.600
like Saturday night.
Then he goes up there and then he did,
he did like 14 minutes

1366
01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.660
and I was just beside my,

1367
01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:20.680
so now I've got to cover an hour and 15 rather than just doing his 20 minutes.

1368
01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:24.400
And I go up there,
you know,
and I do my hour,

1369
01:24:24.401 --> 01:24:26.710
hour and 10 now he is up there for,
you know,

1370
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:33.100
like 12 minutes or some shits and now I've got to cover the rest of it and it's,

1371
01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:36.430
it's,
I just wanted to be like,
dude,
what is your problem?

1372
01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:42.430
You know why you don't have a watch?
You know,

1373
01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:45.130
you've been doing this shit long enough.
I know you headline.
I know,

1374
01:24:45.131 --> 01:24:48.460
you know what it's like when somebody does that amount of time in front of you.

1375
01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:54.700
So I dunno,
I just basically after,
uh,
after he said,
uh,

1376
01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:57.820
what did he say?
How much time do you want me to do?

1377
01:24:57.821 --> 01:25:01.570
I just basically stopped talking to him for the rest of the weekend because,
uh,

1378
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:06.030
it was just like,
I can't explain it when it,

1379
01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.970
when somebody asks a question in what they're really saying is,

1380
01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:13.060
I think you're a fucking moron.
That's basically what he was saying.

1381
01:25:13.061 --> 01:25:14.200
I think you're a fucking moron.

1382
01:25:14.201 --> 01:25:18.580
Like you're going to be three shows into the weekend and the comedy club never

1383
01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:23.260
told you how much time to do in front of the headlining act.
You know,

1384
01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.670
and you never asked in three shows in,
you don't know where the light is.

1385
01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:31.480
And you already went over on the first show when you apologize for it and then,

1386
01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:36.190
then you fucking do it again.
And it's like,
yeah,

1387
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:39.400
that's either you're a moron or you just don't give a shit.

1388
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.500
And this guy was not dumb.

1389
01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.620
So either he didn't give a fuck or he was doing it on purpose,

1390
01:25:44.621 --> 01:25:45.670
which is how I took it.

1391
01:25:45.671 --> 01:25:49.630
I took it like this guy is doing this on purpose to make me look like an
asshole.

1392
01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:53.830
But fortunately I'm a fucking beast and I had no problem following the guy,

1393
01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.540
but it was just bullshit.
I didn't,

1394
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:59.170
I felt like I was going on up after like a fucking telethon and for all you

1395
01:25:59.171 --> 01:26:00.620
young comics out there,
I know you're not gonna.

1396
01:26:00.621 --> 01:26:04.100
It's a stupid fucking thing to do because I actually would have said Nice things

1397
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.990
<v 8>about the guy cause he had good jokes and uh,
but I also,
you know,</v>

1398
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.390
I'm not going to go bad mouth them to be honest with you.

1399
01:26:11.391 --> 01:26:13.700
I don't even remember his fucking name,
you know?

1400
01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.340
I don't even remember his fucking name.
So that's it.
So that was my weekend.

1401
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.600
That's what I was dealing with,

1402
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:24.410
that was staying there and this guy was going over and he was like,

1403
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:29.530
what you mean you don't like a bucket of shit dumped over your head before you

1404
01:26:29.661 --> 01:26:32.720
go up?
What?
Oh,
I didn't know that.

1405
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:37.270
I've only been doing it for 20 fucking years.
I have no idea.

1406
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:40.020
What are the rules?
Dia?

1407
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:43.170
Just keep going until you feel like you want to get up.
What,

1408
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:47.420
how do you feature for somebody?
I have no idea.

1409
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:52.990
I've just been doing stand up since fucking Rita Rudner was an open miker I

1410
01:26:54.471 --> 01:26:58.370
don't know anything.
It was,
it was fucking ridiculous and um,

1411
01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.860
whatever,
whatever.
And I just felt like,
yeah,
why do I tell the whole story?

1412
01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:04.694
I felt like it,

1413
01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:08.540
like somebody at the club should have said something to the fucking guy.

1414
01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:13.670
Um,
they,
after the second time,
you know,
and nobody did.

1415
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:16.760
And then I'm putting a position like,
do I go to the club owner like a,

1416
01:27:16.761 --> 01:27:20.730
like a fucking girl and tell on the guys to do tubes.
So I,

1417
01:27:20.731 --> 01:27:25.520
I decided to say something to him,
you know,
and then he hit me with that shit.

1418
01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.190
How much time do you want me to do?
Gee,
I don't know.

1419
01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:30.740
You've been in this business 20 years was the last time you heard somebody go,

1420
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:32.600
yeah,
do 37 in front of me.

1421
01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.950
Do 37 and be sure to piss off as many people in the crowd is,

1422
01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:40.340
is possible before I go up there that that would be awesome.

1423
01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:42.260
And if there's somebody drunk in the crowd,

1424
01:27:42.261 --> 01:27:45.710
by all means just keep going back and forth with them and turn it into an

1425
01:27:45.711 --> 01:27:47.750
absolute shit fest before I go up there.

1426
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:52.130
That would be great if he could go do twice the amount of time that they told

1427
01:27:52.131 --> 01:27:55.880
you to do and act like you have no fucking idea that would that,
yeah,

1428
01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.980
that's what I want.
That's what I'm looking for.

1429
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.770
I'm sure that that's what you're looking for when you go out and headline.

1430
01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.270
All right.
I got a little upset there.
Um,
so that was my experience.

1431
01:28:05.271 --> 01:28:09.050
So there you go.
That's what you're supposed to do.
All right.
You know,

1432
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.380
just go up there and do your fucking act and if you kill the guy after you

1433
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:14.150
cannot follow you,

1434
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:17.630
he'll have no reason to complain because you didn't fuck with the crowd.

1435
01:28:17.631 --> 01:28:20.090
You weren't dirty.
You just did you shit and he couldn't follow you.

1436
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:24.380
That's the deal.
All right,
so we're going to end with this one.
Uh,

1437
01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.820
somebody asked me a hypothetical question that I think this is a new topic here.

1438
01:28:28.821 --> 01:28:32.600
Hypothetical's a little hypothetical for you.
Uh,

1439
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:36.380
if something happened to your dog and she needs an operation that's going to

1440
01:28:36.381 --> 01:28:37.730
cost 50 grand,

1441
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.200
but there's only a 65% chance that she'll survive the operation.

1442
01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:47.030
Do you pay apps a Fuckin lutely absolutely.
I pay twice that

1443
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.090
absolutely.
65%.
Absolutely.
Put my mortgage down on that.

1444
01:28:53.091 --> 01:28:57.710
She's a fucking pit bull.
She's a warrior.
You know,
that's my buddy.

1445
01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:01.480
Absolutely.
Come on.
You know,
you know my dog.

1446
01:29:01.481 --> 01:29:03.580
My dog might do a lot of things,
but you know what,
it wouldn't do.

1447
01:29:03.581 --> 01:29:05.890
It wouldn't go up and do 37 minutes in front of me.

1448
01:29:05.891 --> 01:29:10.630
It wasn't okay because there's a loyalty to a pitbull that,

1449
01:29:10.631 --> 01:29:13.180
that son of a bitch didn't have when I was out there.
All right.

1450
01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.640
Ah,
fuck.
I ran out of time.
You know what I forgot to do?
I forgot to do the whole,

1451
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:23.110
uh,
the whole bad covers,
the worst covers you've ever heard.
I gotta,

1452
01:29:23.111 --> 01:29:26.170
I gotta I gotta break out that list next week to you guys are sending me some

1453
01:29:26.171 --> 01:29:30.250
great ones.
One that I can remember off the top of my head was,
um,

1454
01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:35.190
was when earth wind fire did a,
did a cover of Paul Mccartney.

1455
01:29:35.191 --> 01:29:38.100
I think he was with the Beatles.
That got to get you into my life.

1456
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:42.390
And it was a song that when the Beatles did it,
or Paul Mccartney,
I forget,

1457
01:29:42.391 --> 01:29:45.930
it was a great song,
you know,
and when earth,
wind and fire did it,

1458
01:29:45.931 --> 01:29:50.931
they somehow turned it into this smooth jazz sort of,

1459
01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:55.680
uh,
you hear the song and you start moving your head like those dudes in night at

1460
01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:59.990
the Roxbury.
It's just,
it's one of the worst.
The harmonies,
Ah,

1461
01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:04.440
God to get into my lane,
but I bought up a Ba.

1462
01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:07.650
It's fucking horrible.
And it's no excuse because it's a big,

1463
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:12.360
it's like fucking like 27 black guys weren't earth,
wind and fire.

1464
01:30:12.361 --> 01:30:16.410
You would think one of them would be like,
hey,
this kind of sucks.
You know,

1465
01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.410
how the hell did we pull this off?

1466
01:30:18.411 --> 01:30:20.630
This sounds like somebody white did a cover of this.

1467
01:30:20.631 --> 01:30:24.050
That's how fucking awful it was.
All right.
