00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.900
Have you ever wondered how flies land on the
ceiling?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.160
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.920
A popular notion of how they accomplished
this used to be that the flies would do a

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.560
half barrel roll sideways just before landing
on the ceiling and then let their momentum

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.430
carry them the rest of the way up.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.430
This was shown to be incorrect when, in 1958,
Natural History Magazine took and published

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.950
photos of flies landing on the ceiling.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.040
What is actually happening here is that as
the fly approaches the ceiling, flying normally,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.440
it extends its forelegs above its head and
grabs the ceiling with its front feet.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.500
It then uses its momentum to swing the rest
of its body up until all its legs are firmly

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.000
attached to the ceiling.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.500
At this point, you might be asking how they
manage to hold on to the ceiling with gravity

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.830
pulling them down.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.990
Scientists used to think that the little hairs
on the fly’s feet allowed them to grip tiny

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.620
cracks in surfaces they walked on.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.700
However, in 2006, researchers at the Max Planck
Institute in Germany discovered that the substance

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.760
secreted by the hairs on a fly’s feet is
actually a very sticky glue compound.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.110
This glue is strong enough to hold the fly’s
weight as it walks upside down or up the wall.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.300
In order to get each foot unstuck as the fly
walks, it has to push its foot away from itself

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.350
and peel it off the surface of what it is
stuck to.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.250
Because this takes a lot of energy, when the
fly is on the ground or any surface where

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.501
it is walking right side up, it will only
use three of its legs to walk; so it doesn’t

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:48.490
have to expend so much energy unsticking all
its feet.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.590
This sticky glue on its feet is also one of
the reasons flies tend to spread diseases

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.590
so well.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.079
When they walk on feces, garbage, etc, the
glue on their feet picks up all sorts of harmful

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:10.810
bacteria and they spread this bacteria by
walking on, for instance, you or your food.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.590
YUM!
