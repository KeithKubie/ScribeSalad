00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And just for kicks, let's try this again with a different equation--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a and b are now -1 for b and 4 for a that describes a different line.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm going to give a couple of choices. Here's one, here's another one, and here's the third.

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which one is best reflective of this equation over here?
