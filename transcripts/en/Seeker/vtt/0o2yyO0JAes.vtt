00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Why do we have to sleep? I am losing valuable life

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
hours here!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200
Anthony here for DNews, and I have always wondered

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.200
just why exactly we have to sleep.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Do you know how much I can do if I

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200
never got tired. Scientists wonder about it too.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
Every animal participates in

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
some form of sleep, even though it puts us

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
all in an incredibly vulnerable state;

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.200
Anything can get you, seems wasteful.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
So, it must perform some

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.200
function that is so important it is worth the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
trade-off of being killed by a predator

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200
who is on a slightly different work schedule.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200
There are a few theories. One is that it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200
gives us more time to repair our muscles

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
and cells. One is that it lowers the amount of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200
energy we need and less energy means less

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.200
meals, means less hunting and gathering, which we can't

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.200
really do in the dark anyway. One of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200
the recent and most popular theories

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.200
has to do with memory

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.200
consolidation. when we sleep, our

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
brain takes everything we have seen and done

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
throughout the day and filters through it. Looks

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.200
for patterns, sifts through what it finds an essential

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200
and decides what to turn into a memory.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200
And some experts think that dreams

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200
are a sort of representation of that;

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
It's like a nightly clean up. We've seen

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.200
evidence of it. Studies show that if you get

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200
sleep right after practicing something that takes

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200
fine motor skills, like typing or

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200
playing an instrument, it helps you retain that

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200
knowledge faster. Missing a night of sleep

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
can mess with attention, awareness

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200
reasoning, problem solving skills. But

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
the super weird thing is that even

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
without sleep body repair

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.600
happens. So where is the big benefit?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.600
Researchers from the University of Rochester

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600
think they found it. Turns out sleep

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
isn't just a mental house cleaning for your brain,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
it's a physical one. Your body

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
has got a great system for flushing

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600
all the unneeded stuff out that piles up;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600
It's called the Lymphatic System. But the Lymphatic

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600
system does not extend to your brain.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.600
And your think box keeps itself

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.600
locked up behind something called the Blood Brain

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600
Barrier, which tightly regulates everything

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.600
that comes in and out. Your brain controls everything

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600
so it keeps itself in a high security

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600
area where it can't be contaminated.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600
But it has to get rid of its waste products

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600
somehow, but we have never actually been able to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
see how. But using new technology

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
called Two Photon Microscopy,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600
the Rochester researchers were able to see the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600
brain's disposal system. They're calling it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600
The Glymphatic System. It's this plumbing

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600
system that pumps cerebral spinal

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600
fluid through brain tissue and then flushes

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.600
it into your circulatory system and the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.600
Lymphatic system just takes it from there.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.600
And here is where sleep comes in.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600
The Glymphatic system seem to be about

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600
ten time more active during

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
sleep in mice. It seems like

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600
pushing all that CSF through its system

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600
requires a lot of energy, so your brain

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600
makes a choice: Run your body

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600
or clean itself. That seems to

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600
be why our brain uses as much energy

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600
when we are asleep as it does when we are

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600
awake. Not only that, it looks like

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.600
brain cells shrink up to 60%

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600
during sleep, so all that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600
CSF can wash over it faster.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.600
So what makes this flushing

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
process more important that cell

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600
repair or forming memories? Well,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.600
build up of waste is linked to serious

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
brain diseases, like Alzheimer's. If you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600
don't shut down every night, your

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
brain can't clean itself out properly

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
enough. I don't know, are you guys getting enough

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600
sleep? Let me know down below, but don't  brag
