00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.990
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.400
we had set up a
definite integral

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.810
using the shell method for this
strange solid of revolution.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.780
So now, let's just
evaluate the integral.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.760
And like we've seen many times
in these type of problems,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.160
we really just have to do
some polynomial multiplication

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.870
right over here.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.640
So x minus 3 squared, well,
that's pretty straightforward.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.569
That's going to be x
squared minus 6x plus 9.

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.610
And we're going to multiply
that times x minus 1.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.568
So let's do that first.

00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:30.530
So multiply that
times x minus 1.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.790
And so negative 1
times 9 is negative 9.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.370
Negative 1 times negative 6
is positive 6, positive 6x.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.980
Negative 1 times x squared
is negative x squared.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.198
Now x times 9 is 9x.

00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:53.220
x times negative 6x is
negative 6x squared.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.760
And then x times x
squared is x to the third.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.660
And so we get x
to the third minus

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.090
7x squared plus 15x minus 9.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.020
So we just multiplied x minus
3 squared times x minus 1,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.374
and then we have to
multiply that times x.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.040
So we could essentially
raise the degree

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040
of each of these things.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.400
At least it's easier now
take the anti-derivative.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.210
It's equal to 2 pi times the
definite integral from 1 to 3

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.450
of this stuff times x.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.840
So it's going to be
x to the fourth minus

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.630
7x to the third power
plus 15x squared minus 9x.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.012
And then, of course, dx.

00:01:46.012 --> 00:01:50.720
And I'll make the dx in
that same nice blue color.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.980
Now let's just take
the anti-derivative.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.040
So this is going to be equal to
2 pi times the anti-derivative

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.400
of all of this business.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.960
We're going to evaluate
it at 3 and subtract it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.990
when it's evaluated at 1.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.980
So the anti-derivative
of x to the fourth

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.427
is x to the fifth over 5.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.880
The anti-derivative
of x to the third

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.480
is x to the fourth
over 4, and we're

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.700
going to multiply
that times negative 7.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.850
So it's negative 7x
to the fourth over 4.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.610
And then the anti-derivative
of 15 x squared,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.780
that's going to be 15 times
x to the third over 3.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.320
15 divided by 3 is 5, so
it's plus 5x to the third.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.490
And then finally,
the anti-derivative

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:52.999
of negative 9x, that's going to
be negative 9x squared over 2.

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:53.790
And you can verify.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.248
If you take the
derivative of this,

00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:56.990
you get this business
right over here.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.610
And so this is going
to be equal to 2 pi.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.660
And so let's evaluate all
of this business at 3.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.600
So when you evaluate
it at 3, you

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.060
have 3 to the
fifth power over 5.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.700
And I believe 3 to the fifth
is 243, but I'll verify.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.580
3 to the third is 27, 3 to
the fourth is equal to 81,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.665
3 to the fifth is 243.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.040
So this is going to give us
some hairy math to deal with.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.420
So it's going to be 243 over 5.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.150
3 to the fourth
power, that's 81.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.900
But then we have to
multiply 81 times 7.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.250
So we're going to get 567.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.690
Is that right?

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.220
81 times 7.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:58.300
7 times 1 is 7, 7 times 8 is 56,
so we're going to get minus 567

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.870
over 4.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.251
This is going to be really
painful to do the arithmetic

00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:01.750
part.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.080
But we'll power through it.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.220
And then we have 5x
to the third is 27.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.367
27 times 5 is what?

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:11.866
135?

00:04:13.994 --> 00:04:15.410
I don't want to
make any mistakes.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.370
27 times 5.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.650
7 times 5 is 35,
2 times 5 is 10.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.150
Yep.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.970
135.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.720
So plus 135.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.540
And then finally, we
have minus 9x squared.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.500
So x squared is 9 times 9 is 81.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.270
So minus 81 over 2.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.590
So that's all of this
business evaluated at 3.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.560
And from that, we're
going to subtract it

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.555
when it's evaluated at 1.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.500
Let's do this.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:10.426
So we get 1/5 minus 7/4
plus 5, and then minus 9/2.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.050
And what we are left with is
just a really hairy fractions

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.550
problem.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.790
So I will just hope that I
don't make a careless mistake

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.670
at this point.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.670
So let's try to do this.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.890
This is going to be
equal to 2 pi times,

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.710
and if we wanted to find
a common multiple here,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.310
it looks like it
would have to be 20.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.330
Least common multiple
of 5 and 4 and 2 is 20.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.310
So this is going to give us
243 over 5 is the same thing.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.720
243 times 4 is going to give
us 3 times 4 is 12, 4 times 4

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.450
is 16, plus 1 is 17.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.150
2 times 4 is 8, plus 1 is 9.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.410
So we have 972 over 20.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.775
And then we have to
multiply 567 times 5.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.690
So you can see the arithmetic
is the most painful part here.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:21.960
7 times 5 is 35, 6 times 5 is
30, plus 3 is 33, 5 times 5

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.350
is 25, plus 3 is 28.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:32.710
So we have 2,835 over
4, and then 135 over 20.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:39.470
Well, 135 times 2 is going to be
270, and then times another 10

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.120
is 2,700.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.547
So plus 2,700 over 20.

00:06:45.547 --> 00:06:46.380
Did I do that right?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.510
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.100
And then finally, 81 over 2.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.830
That's going to be the
same thing as negative 810.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.700
Let me do that same color.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:03.250
Negative 810 over 20.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.960
Numerator and denominator
both multiplied by 10.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.080
And then let's see.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.870
Negative 1/5, that's the
same thing as negative 4/20.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.950
It's going to be positive
7/4 is the same thing

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.400
as positive 35/20.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.620
And it's going to
be a negative 5

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.240
is the same thing as
negative 100 over 20.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:39.754
And then finally, it's
going to be a positive.

00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:41.420
I don't want make
that careless mistake.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.200
I want to make sure I
get the signs right.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.350
After I distribute
this negative,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.075
it's going to be a
positive 9/2, which

00:07:45.075 --> 00:07:49.902
is the same thing
as plus 90 over 20.

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:51.110
Did I do all the signs right?

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.270
Negative 1/5, positive for
this one, so positive 7/4,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.500
negative 5, and then
positive 90 over 20.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.930
And so now, I just have to
do some hard core addition.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.030
So let's do it.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.530
So first, I'll take
all of the positives

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.210
and then I'll subtract out the
negatives, just to simplify it,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.270
so I have to minimize
the number of times.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.020
Well, I'll add all the
positives together,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.895
and then I'll add all
the negatives together.

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:19.410
And that ought to make it
one subtraction problem.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:26.570
So 972 plus 2,700
plus 35 plus 90.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.910
So let me just write it down.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.870
So this is 2,700 plus 972.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.720
I should probably take out
a calculator at this point,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.000
but I'll just do it by
hand, since I've already

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.580
done so much of it by hand.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.100
Plus 972 plus 90 plus 35.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.301
So we get a 7.

00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:54.860
7 plus 9 is 16, plus 3 is 19.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.830
Did I do that right?

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:01.500
Yeah, 16 plus 3 is 19, and
this is 17, and this is a 3.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.430
So we have 3,797 when we add
in all the positive numerators.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.990
And then all the negative
numerators, let's see.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.115
I'm going to add them
together to see how negative.

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:15.840
So 2,835, 810, 4, and 100.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:28.030
So if I add 2,835, 810, let
me see, 100, and 4, this

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.340
is how much negative I
have to subtract from that.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:37.750
5 plus 4 is 9, 3 plus 1 is
4, 8 plus 8 plus 1 is 17,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.880
and then you have a 3.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:46.810
So we're going to
subtract 3,749 from 3,797.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.050
And so this actually
works out quite well.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.613
That gets us to 48.

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:58.120
Let me make sure I haven't
made a careless mistake.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.602
2,835, 810, 100, and 4.

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:03.310
Those are all the
things I'm subtracting.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:08.921
2,700, 972, 90, and 35 are
all the things I added.

00:10:08.921 --> 00:10:09.420
Yep.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:16.080
3,797 minus 3,749 is
going to be equal to 48.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.610
So this whole expression--
we deserve a drum roll now--

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:27.620
is going to be equal to
2 pi times 48 over 20.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.730
And both 48 and 20
are divisible by 4.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:37.280
So you get 12 over 5.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.990
My brain is turning
into mush now.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.690
I'm becoming paranoid that I've
been making careless mistakes.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.550
We're almost there.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.890
So it becomes 12 over 5.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:52.230
And so our final answer,
12 times 2 is 24.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.420
So it becomes 24 pi over 5.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.480
And we are done.
