CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.760
Sorry for the delay.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.550
We've had just some technical
issues, but we finally managed

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.970
to get it running.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.910
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.230
My name is Claudio, and I'm one
of the engineers in the

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.380
Google Drive Developer
Relations Team.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.090
Today, I want to show you an
Android app that's pretty

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.820
popular right now.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.400
It's called Atooma, and it was
built by an Italian team, and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.410
I'm so proud because I'm Italian
myself, so I'm very

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.590
happy for them.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.710
And they participated in the
TechCrunch Italy event, and

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.000
they won it as the
best product.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.940
So I want to show you what this
app can do and how this

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.930
app integrates with Drive.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.240
And I understand the app is
still in beta, so there's some

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.410
rough edges here and there,
and I have some

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.930
recommendations for the app
to be slightly better.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.830
The app works perfectly.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.360
What I will suggest is just some
small things on the user

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.950
experience.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.070
But let me show you the app
first, and then we'll see what

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.580
we can do to make it better
and how cool this app is.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.980
So let's move to the tablet.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
The app, as I said,
is called Atooma.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.290
What the app does-- sorry, I
didn't even mention that-- but

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.800
what the app does is it lets
you automate tasks.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.480
So you can say things like, if
it's late at night, turn the

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.930
volume down, things like that.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.190
Or if I'm driving fast, don't
let the phone ring.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.270
Or what I'm going to show you is
if I take a new photo with

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.130
my camera, anytime I take a
photo with a camera, upload it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.070
to Drive directly.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.130
So all this kind of automation
can be done with Atooma, and

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.800
it's very, very easy to
set up these tasks.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.340
It doesn't require a programmer
or a very technical

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.130
person to do it.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.330
I'm going to show you.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.180
So let me start Atooma.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.470
So I click on it.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.070
First thing, this is
kind of weird.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.160
The app always starts
in landscape mode,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.370
even if I'm in Portrait.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.345
So this is one of those small
things that I would like the

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:19.820
team to fix.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.320
You know that I'm in Portrait
Mode, so you shouldn't show

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.630
the app rotate the screen.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.440
But still, as soon as you start
the app for the first

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.850
time, you get a tutorial,
which is very good.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.860
It explains to you how
to use the app.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.480
So you start with swiping
first page, and once you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.200
swipe, you get a step-by-step
guide.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.930
Sorry, it's still in Landscape,
but I will go very

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.440
quickly through this.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.060
And another small usability
thing here.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.430
I swiped to get here, and I
got a new page, so I would

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.640
expect here to use swipe
to go to the next page.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.490
But it doesn't actually swipe.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.630
So you have Next buttons here.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.170
So you should be consistent
with the user experience.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.940
If you swipe the first
page, you should

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.760
swipe all other pages.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.220
But still, no big deal.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.200
This tutorial will explain
how to use Atooma.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.700
I will do that for you, so
no need to go through it.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.820
So we can skip it from here.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.030
And if you skip it from there,
you will still get it the next

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.690
time you run the app.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.470
If you don't want the tutorial
to show up the following time,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.300
you have to go through all the
pages, and at the end, you

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.470
have a flag that says don't
run this thing anymore.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.900
So now that the application is
running, you can create your

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.480
tasks, your things to
do with Atooma, and

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.300
they're called Atooma.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.990
So it's very easy.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.250
You click on New Atooma, and
it's basically two steps.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.520
You have to define what the
condition is, so when to do

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.180
something, and then
what to do.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.130
The first part is called
If, and the second

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.440
part is called Do.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.330
So you have different categories
here to be used.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.070
So you have from data, from
mobile, from apps.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.640
And let's say what I want to
build is this Atooma that

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.390
says, every time I take a new
photo with my camera, upload

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.410
it to Drive.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.220
So I'm going to click on Mobile,
and you have this nice

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.480
wheel with all the options,
all the categories,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.730
subcategories.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.660
What I want here
is the camera.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.450
So I click on Camera.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.020
And then I have two options,
New Photo or New Video.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.160
So you can have an Atooma that
starts whenever you take a new

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.600
photo or a new video.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.380
And I'm going to
use New Photo.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.010
And that's basically it.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.900
If you want, you can add
multiple conditions.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.410
So whenever I take a photo and
it's late at night, or

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.440
whenever I take a photo
and my battery is not

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.500
low, things like that.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.580
But for us, this is
going to be just

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.400
whenever I take a photo.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.860
So I don't need to specify
any other details, so

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.350
I can move to Do.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.870
What I want to do now is saving
the file to Drive.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.080
So I will go to Apps.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.420
I have multiple options here.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.020
It's nice Atooma that integrates
with different

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.800
properties, not just
Google ones.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.930
So you can have Gmail actions,
you can have Google Drive

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.860
actions, but you can also have
others like Facebook, or

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.100
Dropbox, or many others.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.960
What I want to show you
here is Google Drive.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.730
So I click on Google Drive, and
you have multiple actions

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.570
which you can select here.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.290
And what I want to do is add
the file to Drive, so I'll

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.010
click on Add File.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.590
Now I have to specify some
details about the actions I

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.960
want to perform.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.780
So I can select to add this file
to a specific folder in

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.580
my Drive, and if I do, Atooma
lists the folders I have in my

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.740
Drive account.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.810
And this UI was built by Atooma,
and this is built by

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.010
using the Drive API.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.420
So they list the folders, and
if you click on one, it goes

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.830
inside the folder and gives you
the sub-folders and so on.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.860
But let's say this is OK.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.890
Any folder, I don't
really care.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.820
I selected the root.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.190
You can select a sub-folder if
you want to categorize your

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.590
photos somewhere.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.670
And that's a first step, and
then you have to select which

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.460
file you want to
save to Drive.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.360
It can be any file, or it can
be the one we just took from

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.160
the camera.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.020
So this links the action
with the previous step.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.310
So I select the camera and the
new photo I just took.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.830
Say OK, and that's
basically it.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.320
I said if I take a photo, do
save the photo to Drive, and

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.500
then this equals a new Atooma.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.480
And you have to name.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.920
I can name it Drive Upload.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.120
And on the top here, you see the
summary with nice icons, a

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.300
summary of the rule
you created.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.140
And then you have to
tag your Atooma.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.280
So all Atoomas are tagged, and
so you have to select as many

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.780
tags as you want for
categorization.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.770
I was kind of surprised here,
because I read one of the

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.300
categories as [? one of the ?]
tags is called Drive and I

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.030
thought that was Google Drive,
and it's actually not.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.640
It's when you're driving.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.240
So I wish we had these clear.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.300
But let's say this can be
Photo Sharing, and maybe

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.970
others, and Storage,
maybe, and Apply.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.450
And then I can save
the Atooma.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.610
Another small optimization I
would recommend here is to

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.410
automatically select the tags
or suggest some tags.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.990
So whenever I created the
Atooma, you know I'm going to

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.010
use the camera, you know I'm
going to use storage.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.980
So maybe you can preselect
Camera and Storage and suggest

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.970
them so that the user
doesn't have to.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.060
But of course, if I want
to change them, I can.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.450
Just small optimization, so
another step that you take out

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.200
from the user.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.510
And then I can save.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.830
The Atooma has been saved.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.500
It's not active yet.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.410
Maybe here, the app should ask
you whether you want to enable

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.720
it right now, because right
now it's not enabled.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.990
Oh, I just noticed the typo in
"Upload." Anyway, so if you

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.450
want to enable it, you can long
click on the Atooma here,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.590
or you can just click on it--

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.179
and maybe I'll edit
the typo, sorry.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.480
I don't want people to know
that I can't spell.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.800
I swear I can spell.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.960
Upload, yay.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.510
Save.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.650
So I was saying, if you want
to enable it, you can long

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.335
press there or you can enter the
details and then click on

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.360
this check box, and
now it's enabled.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.500
Now Atooma is running and this
is enabled, so let's try it.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.590
I'll leave it running there.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.120
You can configure the app to be
running anytime your phone

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.810
is running.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.650
And then I can take
a photo here.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.500
Let's say my camera, my hand.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.610
So let's take a photo
of my hand.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.370
Photo has been saved.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.780
What Atooma will do right now is
checking that a new photo's

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.480
been uploaded, been saved
to the local device, and

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.200
automatically upload to my
Google Drive account.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.710
If everything worked, I can open
my Drive account here,

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.930
and wait for it to refresh,
and check if

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.310
there are new items.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.580
And I see a new file here that
was just created, and I open

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.080
it to Gallery, and
this is my hand.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.260
This is magic.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.980
As the Atooma team says, this
is some kind of magic.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.700
You have very easy things
that you can configure,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.180
and they just work.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.130
So you can build this app
yourself if you want.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.320
We have a Quick Start that
explains how to build an app

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.290
that takes a photo
and automatically

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.580
syncs them to Drive.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.480
But this, of course, is much,
much easier than writing an

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.990
Android app yourself.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.440
And of course, you have multiple
options and multiple

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.860
things you can do with Atooma.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.180
Let me go back to the app.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.700
So now that I have this Atooma,
of course, I can

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.580
create more.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.620
Now, one thing that I can do is
I can share my Atooma with

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.610
other users.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.190
And of course, I can check
their Atoomas.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.550
So maybe you created one very
important rule or very useful

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.180
rule and you want others to use
it, so you can share it to

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.886
what is called the Wall.

00:10:35.886 --> 00:10:42.705
So if I click on My Atooma, the
bottom left corner, I see

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:45.080
an icon that says
Post on Wall.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.470
If I click on this, it
will automatically be

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.410
added to the Wall.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.030
What I was expecting here was
actually a confirmation

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:59.200
dialog, maybe for me to check
the name, like if I

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.700
had a typo as before.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.640
But still, this is already
on the Wall.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.370
I can go back, and I
can see the Wall.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.660
And you can see there is a lot
of rules here that other

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.955
people have created.

00:11:10.955 --> 00:11:15.450
You can filter by category,
so that's where

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.080
the tags become useful.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.880
So I can filter by them.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.410
Or you can see the
latest ones, and

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.070
mine is probably there.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.780
There it is, and it says
that I have it

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.460
installed and I got it.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.540
One thing that I couldn't find
is how to delete an Atooma

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.670
from the Wall.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.390
So I can delete my Atooma from
my local device, but I cannot

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.310
remove it from the Wall.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.120
And I'm not sure if that is by
design, but what if I created

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.070
a bad one and I want
to remove it?

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.570
It's probably a good idea
for owners to be

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.890
able to remove them.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.850
And it might be interesting to
have some kind of curation to

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:52.490
the content here.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:58.360
Because some Atooma names are
not very useful, and some

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.490
Atoomas are not that useful, and
some duplicates in there.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:07.800
So maybe it can be useful for
users to have some curation

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.540
here from some managers.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.390
If I go inside My Atooma, I also
found a small bug here,

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.500
and this is for the
Atooma team.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.590
So I'm in Pacific Time, and the
Atooma team is in Italy,

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.940
and they probably had noticed
that I have a

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.840
different time zone here.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:32.400
So my Atooma here shows as
created seven hours in the

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.710
past, and this is obviously
not true.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.310
So small things.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.650
Of course, this is a beta.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.100
It works perfectly, but some
things can be just better.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.890
Well, we can create another
Atooma, just

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.090
another one is very nice.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.410
I created it, it was fun.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.650
Let's go to Apps and say
every time a Google

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.380
Drive file is added--

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.020
and you might want to restrict
this to some specific file

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.760
name-- but I say, every time a
file is added to Google Drive,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.350
you can do crazy things
like text to

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.220
speech and speak something.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.640
So you can use this as a
notifier that tells you when

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.060
the new file is added.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.940
So you can speak something,
and it will just read

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.800
the text for you.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.800
So I don't know, "file added,"
and you will know.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.930
It's very loud, actually.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.380
So I tried it.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.770
Well, I'm not setting
it right now.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.220
And just another thing.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.140
Let me go back.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.020
Yeah, I don't want
to save this.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.500
And there is another tab here.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.590
It's called Me.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.270
And this is very nice because
it shows you who I am.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.430
So I logged in with my account,
my test account.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.550
It shows how many Atoomas I
have, how many I downloaded,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.450
how many I published.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.230
And you can select some settings
here, so whether to

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.390
show the notification icon,
and there are some other

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.550
settings here.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.630
You can get in touch
with the Support.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.480
And the best part here
is Connections.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.885
So in Connections, it shows
here what services you're

00:14:05.885 --> 00:14:06.800
already connected to.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.720
So my Google Drive account is
on, so I already signed in and

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.590
went through the authorization
process, so I can use the

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.450
Drive account anytime I want.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.660
But I can also add Dropbox
accounts here, or Twitter,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.550
Facebook, Gmail, or Instagram.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.700
And the first time you enable
them, you will have to go

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.040
through whatever the
authorization

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.340
process is for that tool.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:38.850
And I found another thing that I
would like to be fixed here.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.410
So let's say I go to
Instagram and I

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.960
want to enable Instagram.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.110
What happens is that
I am brought to the

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.320
Authorization page.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:46.950
Perfect.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:52.980
So I have to grant access to
Instagram so that I can get

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.070
resources from my Instagram
account.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.240
But what if I change my mind,
I get to this page and I

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.120
decide not to authorize
the app for Instagram?

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.400
A user will just go back.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.630
If you go back to Atooma, Atooma
will not properly react

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.130
to that, and it will just stay
there for a while and then

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.280
eventually try to have
you log again to

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.110
Instagram or get stuck.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.250
So it's thinking about it.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.810
Now it worked, so I'm
probably wrong.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:30.310
And I tried again, I just
clicked there, closed it.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.510
So I just get there, this black
page should go directly

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.510
to the previous page.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.580
So small things, but it would
be better to fix them before

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:43.460
the general availability
release, so the final release.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.910
Anyway, that's basically
it for Atooma.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.550
It's very useful.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.220
I would totally recommend
you to try it.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.150
And their integration with
Drive is very smooth.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.490
You have multiple things
you can do with Drive.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.410
You can add file, delete file,
check for storage space.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.050
Or, for instance, you can say
whenever the storage space is

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.930
very low, send me a message,
things like that.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.170
It can automate your
daily activity.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.890
And I also spoke to the Atooma
team yesterday, and I asked

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:19.470
about new features from
Drive at least.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.260
And they mentioned the option
to save Gmail attachments

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.460
directly from there, so directly
from Gmail to Drive,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.990
things like that, or to get a
notification when someone

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.380
edits a collaborative Google
Docs or Spreadsheet.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.770
So that's another event you can
use to trigger something.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.500
And that's very useful, because
you have a Google

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.600
Document, and you don't know
if someone is checking it,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.920
editing it, changing something,
and you can use

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.530
Atooma as a way to be notified
of any changes.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.150
For what concerns the technology
they're using,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.000
obviously, they're using
the Drive API.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.430
I didn't ask, but I'm pretty
sure they're checking the

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.780
Changes feed.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:08.060
So by checking their feed, you
will know if someone changes

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.450
something in your Docs.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:15.190
And they're not using it yet,
but we recently announced an

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.599
early access program for Push
notification for Drive.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.089
So if you're interested in
this, you can go to our

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:25.480
website, developers.googl
e.com/drive/eap,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.890
Early Access Program.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.610
And from there, you can ask to
be added to this early access

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.230
program, which gives you access
to push notification,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.140
and real-time collaboration,
and other features that we

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.280
cannot really talk about here.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.475
So I'm very sure Atooma will be
interested in that, and I

00:17:43.475 --> 00:17:46.030
will invite them to
check this out.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.910
Because right now, they
have to pull changes.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.910
With that, they will get some
real-time push notifications

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.960
so that they can notify users in
real time, and that's even

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.370
better than pulling.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.350
And with that, that's
basically it.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.350
You'll find Atooma on the Play
Store, so just go to

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.940
play.google.com and search
for Atooma, or go to

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.400
www.atooma.com, and you
will find a lot of

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.020
information about it.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.850
If you have feedback about this,
please reach out to us,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.540
but also, of course, reach out
to the Atooma team, and I'm

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.090
pretty sure we will both be
happy to get your feedback.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.130
Thank you very much, and see
you next time on Google

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:27.970
Developers Live.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.220
Bye.
