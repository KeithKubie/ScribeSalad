00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.220
Or maybe I think briefly of making one of those quinoa breakfast bowls that are so hip right now

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.320
but my lazy temperament or my belief that I'm running late

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.620
pushes me to choose the 90 minutes in the microwave option.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.060
[off camera, "wow" and laughter]

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.980
[laughs] and fire explosion!

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.400
[intro theme plays]

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.420
But when you think about it, the issue of who is who

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.860
isn't really that much more clear cut in real life.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.280
Who is who

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.440
Ha, [off camera "Ha"]

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.380
Ha, [off camera "Ha"]

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.940
Ha

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.840
So then there's contemporary Australian moral philosopher

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.660
[Deeper voice] moral philosopher

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.500
Life was that that ep- hmm, mmm, nah

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.960
[Monotone] I am my own lies.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.780
Certain points, to make the chain mail

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.280
[Laughter off camera]

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.080
I don't- I don't understand what this means

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.560
Well, he'd still me by, he'd still me brabrabra

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.900
Not only that, you might say Batman is the very essence of Batman [laughs]

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.980
[Laughter off camera]

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.200
But this principle says that if an-

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.420
[Fart noises]

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.240
There's a way to say it, but I'm not gonna get there.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.240
[Off camera "I mean-"]

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.280
As your osteoblasts are continuously...

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.360
[Off camera "And the science people in the audience go Oho"]

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.000
[Laughs] Did you say osteoblasts? I'm here, I'm here.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.460
[Laughter]

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080
Oedipus killed a stranger in a fit of rage who turned out to be the-

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.980
something.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.920
To get up off the co-uch, co-uch

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.680
After Bruce Wayne was reported dea-du-de-du-de

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.540
So if you look at the bundle that is me now

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.200
compared with the bundle my mom and dad brought home from the hospital

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.120
they'd be [incoherent sounds]

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.920
[Off camera "right"]

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.060
That was a whole- a whole new problem

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.340
I feel like I've never had that particular problem before.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.620
[Laughter]

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.540
[Incoherent sounds]

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.200
It says that personal identity persists over time because you remain in the same body from birth to death.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.680
Birthhh to d-death

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.320
[Fart sound]

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.060
Vrrr

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.320
It would mean that fully rational, healthy, functioning, adult humans might not have personhood

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.940
just because no one happens to care about them.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.640
Except for themselves...

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.960
[Off camera "but if you're not a person, can you declare personhood on someone?"]

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.920
Ohh-hoh then no one is a person.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.500
If you start with no one being people then no one gets to be people.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.160
But others are convinced that there are some parts of the human experience

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.360
that simply can't be boiled down to brains.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.120
Don't boil brains.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.860
To speak english rather than b- rather than bublublebleh

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.380
These five factors are known as the cognitive criteria [burps]

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.080
[Burps]

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.700
[Burps]

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.920
[Burps]]

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.600
[Burps]

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.520
Think about- [burps]

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.180
Two different kinds of stuff [burps]

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.060
Do that again.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.880
But political libertarians are all about freedom from government informa- information

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.420
Don't tell me information, government!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.420
And next time, we're gonna think about these issues some more with some helps from one of my favorites kinds of potential persons.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.080
[Sigh]

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.480
Lemonade make me salivate.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.060
[Slurping noises]

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.680
[Laughter]

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.240
Probably got that one on camera.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.020
[Off camera "Yeah!"]

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.920
If you value quality of life, then you don't think there's something inherently valubub- valublout

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.420
Nor are humans in persistent vede- vedededede

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.260
And the sa-me

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.520
aww-waaww

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.200
[Fart noise]

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.140
So a 26 week old fetus would have less personhood than a 34 week old fetus,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.380
which would have less personhood than a new born baby, [silly voice] which would have less personhood than a toddler

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.280
Print!

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.900
Then the fact is, there is no box- nope, that's not what it says.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.880
[Fart noise]

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.700
Hard d-d-deter, hard, hard determinism

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.680
[Garbled] hard determinism

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.840
Hard d-d-determ

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.720
Hard d-

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.800
[Laughter]

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.140
Don't put that in the outtakes, I'm too embarrassed.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.800
[Laughter]

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.940
Epicurus argued that nonexistence is not only stupid, but it gets the-

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.020
[Muffled laughter off camera]

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.600
That's not what it says.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.900
[Laughter off camera]

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.900
I said that wrong.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.700
[Laughter]

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.020
Nonexistence is stupid! Let's not do it.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.140
[Off camera "It's really stupid to not exist"]

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.760
[Laughter]

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.540
[Off camera "What are you doing?"]

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.260
Stop not existing!

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.320
[Laughter]
