00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now that we've seen this one way, let's see this from a different perspective.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
[Brendan Eich, CTO, Mozilla] [Wes Weimer, Professor, University of Virginia]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let me ask you a question that's actually of personal interest and curiosity to me.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm teaching in this class a number of elements of functional programming,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
list comprehensions in Python, filtering a list to retain only some required elements,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I noticed that in JavaScript you included the ability to create

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
an anonymous function with the function keyword.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And for students initially, that might be a little bit confusing because

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
declaring a function at the top level also uses the function keyword,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but we can get past that with the grammar.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm curious, why did you think it was important to include the ability

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to have anonymous functions?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
JavaScript had to live in the shadow of Java,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but it was its own language, and the original pitch--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the sort of fraudulent pretense for getting me to Netscape--was to do Scheme.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, I didn't have time to do Scheme, and I didn't do anything as pretty as Scheme,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but JavaScript is a language with first class functions,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and functions are the main building block, so it's important not simply to have

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
function declarations and require you to name them and put them at a certain level

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in nesting but to allow you to express them freely as anonymous functions

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
or even named function expressions, and this is incredibly popular today.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is used in lieu of modules and to make sort of super constructors

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and class systems in JavaScript today

00:01:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
using functions and function expressions.
