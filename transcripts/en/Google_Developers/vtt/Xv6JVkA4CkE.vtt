00:00:01.852 --> 00:00:02.810
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Hi.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.320
I'm Natalie Villalobos,
and here at Google, I

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.840
have the extreme honor of
working with incredible women

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.340
in the technology industry.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.860
And today, I have Macy
Kuang visiting the "Coffee

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.067
with a Googler" stage.

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:13.650
Welcome, Macy.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.566
MACY KUANG: Thank you.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.770
Thanks for inviting me.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.129
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So I'm really

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.990
excited to talk to you today
about what you're working on.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.879
Can you give our
audience a little peek

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:23.920
into some of the projects
that you have going on?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.090
MACY KUANG: So I have done a lot
more things, majorly in games.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.350
I'm the GDE for wearables,
so I have done a lot of apps

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.250
for Glass and for Wear.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.790
Right now, I'm working on VR
games for Google Cardboard.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.320
So the game concept is
you're in a dungeon,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.860
and you try to find enemies
nearby you by the audio.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.270
So they're kind of
invisible, but you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.802
have to look around and
hide and seek and find them.

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:51.760
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: How
do you get rid of them?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.944
MACY KUANG: You have to
pretty much kill them.

00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:56.264
That's very violent but--

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.457
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Cool.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.290
And I guess, stepping
back, how did you even

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.460
get into creating that project?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.394
How did you get into
the technology industry?

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:07.790
MACY KUANG: I have been always
interested in technology.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.630
I used the computer when
I was the age of three,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.860
because my mom, she got her
hands on computer really

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.240
early on.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.830
But then she kind of
stopped letting me use it

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.030
when I became a teenager
because where I grew up,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.580
computer was considered
as a really bad thing.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.810
But maybe that's
why it made me want

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.370
to use computer more because
it was forbidden and stuff.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.990
So after I came
to North America,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.110
I started to learn
how to use computers,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.480
and I took a class
in programming.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.830
It was really overwhelming.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.980
I really loved it.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.140
I have art background.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.580
I can draw.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.000
With the add-on of
programming skills,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.950
actually, I can combine
good-looking things

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.630
and technology together,
make them become

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.142
some form of useful tools.

00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:57.600
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, something

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.210
beautiful, design and develop.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.200
MACY KUANG: Exactly.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.866
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So that app that you

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.360
were talking about
for Cardboard,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.860
can we get it in
the Play Store yet?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.693
MACY KUANG: Not yet.

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:06.630
It's in beta testing.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.440
Actually, I sent an open invite
to all my Google+ friends,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.710
and we have around 20 people
in my beta testing group.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.469
Once it's ready,
everyone can have it.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.510
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Nice.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.420
I'm excited for it.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.920
Thank you.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.310
So you mentioned an acronym.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.474
You said GDE.

00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:24.140
MACY KUANG: Yes.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.973
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
What does GDE stand for?

00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:30.580
MACY KUANG: So GDE is the
Google Developer Expert program.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.830
I'm honored to be nominated
by one of the local GDE

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.330
organizers.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.330
I ran a couple of events related
to Google Glass at that time,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.189
and I was being selected.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.480
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Super cool.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.396
MACY KUANG: Thank you.

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:47.860
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And so
what do you do as a GDE?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.780
So you're doing these cool
projects with Cardboard.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.670
I think you had also
mentioned earlier

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.750
that you do some workshops,
like some technology workshops,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.404
so you're also a teacher.

00:02:57.404 --> 00:02:58.070
MACY KUANG: Yes.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.030
I really like
technology and I would

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.240
like to share my experiences.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.620
And also, if I can, I would
like to educate as many people

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.590
as I can.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.940
As a GDE, we don't really
have a restricted curriculum.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.940
It was more like an
endorsement from Google.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.560
However, I think
being a Wearable,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.280
GDE is really, really
exciting because our group

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.270
is very small.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.150
So we actually are able to
have Google Hangout every month

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.730
with the Google X team.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.300
So, for example, we speak with
Timothy Jordan pretty much

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.450
every month, and we
are always ready when

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.620
something new is coming up.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.620
So it's kind of
fulfilling my eager,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.790
and also just it's really
good to know the people who

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.100
are working behind them.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.141
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:47.310
That's really cool access.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.280
So you and I met a
couple years ago.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.030
MACY KUANG: Right.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.700
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I think
probably over a Google Hangout.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.950
And at the time, we
were talking about how

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.020
we can increase the visibility
of women in technology,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.315
especially-- there's
so many women out there

00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:03.940
that I think want to
be in the industry

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.481
and are also already
in the industry.

00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:07.585
And so you created
a YouTube show.

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:10.550
I mean, it's a channel, but
you have a regular show.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.280
Can you tell us more about that?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.920
MACY KUANG: So thank you
a lot for inviting me

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.080
to that program.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.450
I had an idea of running a
YouTube channel for the longest

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.470
time, but no one
really encouraged

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.410
me to go forward with it.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.710
So at that time, I think it
was you emailed me saying,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.340
we are doing a program
to encourage women have

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.030
more visibility on YouTube.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.100
I was like, wow, that's
exactly what I wanted to do.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.420
And since we have a
community of other women

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.170
who are making similar content,
I feel like I'm not alone.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.860
I'm not the only one
who is fighting for it.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.580
And I created my first video.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.270
I got so much support
from the community.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.720
At first, it was just
women, and eventually

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.430
everyone, guys, girls, all over
the world watching my videos.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.180
Just during I/O, there
were people from Brazil

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.540
that came to me because
they're students

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.170
watching my video somehow.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.520
I'm very proud of
what I have done.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.516
And really, thanks for
the Women Techmakers.

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:13.890
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So tell
us, what is your show called?

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.670
Because I know that the
audience is really stoked.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.570
I'm sure they want to watch it.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.236
MACY KUANG: Yes.

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:18.860
So my show is called
"Code to Create."

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.264
So coding to create things.

00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:22.430
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.010
And I guess it's like that
blend, again, of your art

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.260
background with your
development background.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.040
MACY KUANG: Yes.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.450
So I'm trying to cover things
that's difficult for me.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.780
My goal is try to create
a video Stack Overflow.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.030
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Nice idea.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.988
MACY KUANG: Things that's
really hard, but hard

00:05:39.988 --> 00:05:41.650
to explain in a text format.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.500
So I try to bring them
into a video format that

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.797
is easier for people to
consume and understand,

00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:49.880
especially for developers.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.570
We have so many buttons
and things that you click.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.900
It's very hard to explain
over just images and text.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.330
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
And so you're

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.364
a Google Developer Expert.

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:03.780
You're creating really awesome
applications for Cardboard,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.190
for Wearables.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.090
It's awesome.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.840
Tell me, what do you
think is the future

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.470
of wearable technology?

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.780
MACY KUANG: Actually, I think
it can end up in a lot of ways.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.650
It's really hard to
predict, but I think

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.970
there are two major trends.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.590
One is all the wearables
become less visible.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.110
So you would just
look really normal,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.810
and Glass is to look just
like regular glasses.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.460
Clothes just look
like regular clothes

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.884
but with some chips in it.

00:06:30.884 --> 00:06:32.550
I think another trend
is people are just

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.180
going to get used to it.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.180
Like they know you're
wearing something,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.380
but everybody's
wearing, it and they

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.690
will accept it like everybody
carries their phone around.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.175
I think that's just
something people are possibly

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:45.750
going to get used to it.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.020
So I think the final decision
has to be made by everybody.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.206
It's not just the people
who are creating the tech,

00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:53.830
but also the people
who are using them.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.575
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:57.030
Well, thank you so much for
spending so much time here.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.690
Thank you so much for coming
to I/O. You are an industry

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.540
leader, and I'm so thankful
you joined us on the show.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.840
MACY KUANG: Thank you.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.140
Thanks for having me.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.440
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Thank you so much.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.990
Thanks.
