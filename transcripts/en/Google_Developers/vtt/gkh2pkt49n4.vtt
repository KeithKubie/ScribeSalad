STEPHANIE HANNON:
Healthcare.gov has taught us

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.870
that billions of
dollars is being

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.060
spent on technology
that just doesn't work.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.570
It's not just health care.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.640
It's food stamps.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.910
It's the DMV.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370
It's our schools.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.140
Code for America,
sometimes called

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.210
the Peace Corps for
Geeks, is trying

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.670
to address this by matching
software geniuses with US

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.240
cities to reboot local services.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.950
We're excited to welcome
Jennifer Pahlka to the studio

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.509
today.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.550
She's the founder
of Code for America.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.730
And she also recently spent
a year at the White House

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.742
as the US deputy
chief of technology.

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:41.950
We're so excited to have you.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.366
Thank you for being
a great friend

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.817
and collaborator to Google.

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:46.900
I think it'd be fun to
start by having you tell us

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.930
in your own words what
Code for America is.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.570
JENNIFER PAHLKA:
Code for America,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.278
as you said is the
Peace Corps for Geeks.

00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:53.540
It was really
started, because we

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.380
were in the middle of what we
call the Web 2.0 revolution.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.430
And yet, the technology
in government

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.630
is stuck back in the 1980s.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.603
And that's a problem
for taxpayers.

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:05.269
As you said, we're
spending so much more

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.000
on technology than we should,
really orders of magnitude

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.790
more.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.160
But it's also a problem
because when services

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.940
don't work, like healthcare.gov,
or like when you go to the DMV,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.780
or when you try to enroll
your child in school,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.560
you really have this experience
of not trusting government.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.185
And we must trust our government
to have a functioning society.

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:25.559
STEPHANIE HANNON:
I'm sure you're

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:27.530
combating a lot of
perception with your program

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.220
that government can't change.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.497
So I think hearing a few
of your success stories

00:01:31.497 --> 00:01:33.830
or some of the innovative
technology that has been built

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.760
would be really great.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.259
JENNIFER PAHLKA:
We see all the time

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.170
that while there's
great software

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.129
technologists and developers
and designers that

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:41.503
want to come help,
there are also

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:43.606
great people inside
government who want their help

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:44.980
and want to try
things a new way.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.690
They know that it's not working.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.119
So I'll give you
an example, when

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.160
we worked in the city and
county of San Francisco

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
last year with a
team of folks, who

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.254
were looking at the
problem of food stamps.

00:01:54.254 --> 00:01:55.920
Now, there's a lot
of different problems

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.960
that happen with food stamps.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.876
But they were particularly
looking at the fact

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:01.170
that when you enroll in
this program, most often

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.890
you fall right off of the rolls.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.590
So you spend a lot
of time applying.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.320
And then suddenly,
you're not on it.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.889
And your EBT card, your food
stamps card, doesn't work.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.499
It turns out that it's really
about a lot of very confusing

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.040
notices that you
get in the mail that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.800
aren't written in
human language.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.659
They're very long
and very confusing.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.950
We enrolled in the program
and couldn't figure them out

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.800
either.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.810
And so you haven't
complied with something

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.980
that they're asking for you,
some piece of information.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.630
And they drop you off the rolls.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.110
We ended up doing a very
simple intervention, which

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.940
was to text message people
when they're about to fall off

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.560
the rolls and telling
them to call the office.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.250
And that meant that
40% more people

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.222
stayed in the program,
which is great.

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:41.680
So that's a lot of
money that we're

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.270
saving in a better
experience for the citizens.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.860
But more importantly,
what we found out

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.730
is that the people that we
worked with in government

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.130
then understood the
importance of enrolling

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.820
in their own programs.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.330
When they moved on
to new programs,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.570
they said the first
thing I'm going to do

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.800
is sign up for it so I
understand the experience

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.400
that my users are having.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.430
That's fantastic.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.790
That means we have this whole
new generation of people

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.620
who work in government who
care about the user experience.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.190
And they know the
technology is going

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.880
to have to change
dramatically in order

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.577
to have that better experience.

00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:13.660
STEPHANIE HANNON: So you
talk about text messaging

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.786
as an important
channel, text messaging.

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:17.660
And I think a lot of
people in Silicon Valley

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.249
would jump to building an app.

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.290
Can you talk about the
importance of that channel

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.570
for the audience the
fellows are trying to serve?

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.945
JENNIFER PAHLKA:
Right now, we're

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:27.560
seeing that a lot of people
who need government services

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.380
don't have internet at home.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.680
So if they're going to be
accessing these services,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.170
it'll be possibly on a
smartphone, but generally

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.380
a low-end one.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.740
And so it really has
to work in that format.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.840
But very often they'll
only have a feature phone.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.970
So a lot of what we do must
use just text messaging.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.770
One of the first programs we
did in the city of Philadelphia,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.110
for instance, was about
getting better feedback

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.899
on the city plan.

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.690
They were in the middle
of a very long term

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.784
plan for Philadelphia.

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:56.950
And they knew they needed
feedback from the citizens

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.500
about things like where
there were food deserts,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.200
or which rail lines
needed to be extended.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.510
But the people who show up for
the input sessions at city hall

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.620
tend to be not the
people who are affected

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.870
by the changes that were
going to be made in the plan.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.850
So they knew that they had
this specific questions.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.680
And they went out
and put posters up.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.070
So there was a poster
in a certain area saying

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.779
where do you shop for your
food if it was a food desert.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.512
Or in a bus shelter asking,
should this offline bus line

00:04:24.512 --> 00:04:26.560
be extended?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.370
Would you ride this line
if it were extended?

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.800
And the way respond is
to write back in text.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.700
Well, you're getting
exactly the people

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.570
you know you're
trying to ask of.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.040
And they're very
easily able to respond.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.100
And that just changed
completely how they got feedback

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.220
for the plan in ways that are
so much more useful and so

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.975
much cheaper.

00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:46.350
STEPHANIE HANNON:
A lot of people

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.020
are frustrated
with their schools.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.700
Can you talk about
any fellow projects

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.025
that have worked in that space?

00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:52.190
JENNIFER PAHLKA: In
our very first year,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.764
we worked with Boston
public schools.

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:55.430
And we worked on a
really small problem.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.300
But it's one that is
right at the beginning

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.450
of your experience
with schools, which

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.312
is selecting a
school for your kid.

00:05:01.312 --> 00:05:03.020
They had just changed
the rules in Boston

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.870
about where kids could go.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.944
And they had this 28-page
brochure with tiny, tiny type

00:05:07.944 --> 00:05:09.610
that you were supposed
to read, and then

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.670
figure out where
your kid could go.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.040
Truly, it was a mapping problem.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.080
And it was about the distance
between school and your home.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.710
And so we did a
very simple web app

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.440
that lets you type
in your address

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.440
and the age of your kid.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.898
And it would tell
you which schools

00:05:22.898 --> 00:05:24.140
you were eligible to attend.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.290
And it really just
changed the relationship

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.827
between the parents
and the schools

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.910
where they really felt
like they were starting off

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.000
on the right foot.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.740
Now, so much more has happened.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.580
And we're working
with Rhode Island

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.670
this year to make sure that
when you start filling out

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.304
all of those forms when your
kid enrolls in school, that you

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:42.720
only have to write your name
and your address once instead

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.162
of 40 different times.

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:45.620
It's little things
like that that I

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.580
think are adding up to
people feeling better

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.370
about the experience they're
having with public schools.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.745
STEPHANIE HANNON:
So your fellows

00:05:51.745 --> 00:05:54.850
come from some of the most
agile, fast-moving technology

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.460
companies.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.918
What's been really
shocking to them

00:05:56.918 --> 00:05:59.740
as they've tried to work with
government, or big lessons?

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.360
JENNIFER PAHLKA:
Well, our fellows

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.240
come from a lot of places.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.190
A lot of them come from
Google, which is great.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.565
And we're very
glad to have them.

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:05.700
We would love to have more.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.820
But yes, they do tend to be in
places that build stuff quickly

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.960
and have a philosophy of build
it and iterate it and also

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.920
measure it as
you're building it,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.480
which is something that doesn't
happen often in government.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.820
They are often shocked at
the level of risk aversion

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.920
in government.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.110
We've done things like
trying to get data out

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.470
about the locations of
fire hydrants in the city.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.510
And we'll be told sometimes,
oh, we can't let that data out

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.920
because it would be in the
hands of the terrorists.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.180
Or right now, we're trying to
solve the problem of people

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.227
using EBT, that Electronic
Benefit Transfer cards, which

00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:43.560
is what you get for food stamps.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.030
If they use those cards in
places that charge a fee,

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.160
a lot of their benefits go
to a bank instead of to food.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.650
And we were asking for the
locations of free ATMs.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.980
And we're told, oh, that's not
data that we can make public.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.450
Well, there's really
no risk to it.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.000
And if you come from the
world where it's always best

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.670
to have it open, it's a very
difficult response to hear.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.900
We really try to get our
fellows to understand

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.600
that it's a different culture.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.160
And that they have
to work with them.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.715
And that the public servants
that throw up barriers

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:16.260
to opening things are doing
it because they genuinely

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.590
believe that they're
protecting the public.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.300
And you must tap into
that notion of service,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.060
even if it's misguided,
and understand

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.120
that they have the same
intentions that we do,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.037
which is to serve the
public as well they can.

00:07:29.037 --> 00:07:31.328
STEPHANIE HANNON: I've heard
so many great case studies

00:07:31.328 --> 00:07:33.320
in specific cities your
fellows have worked in.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.170
And I'd love to know more about
how you make them sustainable,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.300
and how you scale them.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.800
How can you take a success
like Honolulu Answers

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.210
and bring it to a lot of cities?

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.168
JENNIFER PAHLKA: The
program that you mentioned

00:07:44.168 --> 00:07:46.800
was in Honolulu, where they
tried to fix the website.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.840
It was a very large,
clunky website

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.830
with a lot of information that
wasn't useful to users at all.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.870
And they actually
used volunteers

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.280
in the community in a very
simple, basic interface

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.950
to rewrite the answers that
most citizens were coming

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.990
to the website to get answered.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.374
And this was a huge success.

00:08:03.374 --> 00:08:05.040
They pulled the whole
community together

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.120
to rewrite this website
in simple, clear language.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.290
And then that spread now really
just through the community

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.230
to all sorts of cities
that want to do this.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.330
And the city may or
may not participate.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.850
In Oakland, where
I live, the city's

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:18.975
very much involved with it.

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:21.040
In fact, they host
Oakland Answers.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.540
And the community is there
to not only write the site,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.360
but keep it updated
and maintained.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.860
Our Oakland Brigade-- our
volunteers that live and work

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.900
in Oakland in part of the Code
for America Brigade-- maintain

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.600
the technology, but
the citizens really

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.539
maintain the content in it.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.190
We have this notion of for
the people, by the people.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.760
It really must be
the people who come

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.390
to the table to make this work.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.900
And that works in some cases.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.940
A really great way that
Code for America technology

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.860
has been sustained
is through companies.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.070
We've had seven companies
spin off of Code for America.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.150
Textizen, the one I mentioned
that allows you to text message

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.550
the city about the city plan,
is now a very vibrant company

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.160
working with hundreds of
cities around the country.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.030
Another one is Open
Counter that simplifies

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.500
the business permitting process.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.000
It makes it so much easier
than it is without that.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.970
And we're just now working
with a new company called

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.506
Transit Mix that actually
lets you mix and match

00:09:15.506 --> 00:09:16.880
transit lines in
your city and is

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.860
being used by city employees.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.840
When we build businesses
around these technologies

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.650
and allow people not just to
use them on a volunteer basis,

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.170
but to buy them as a vendor,
we can see really great growth

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.390
and sustainability.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.340
But we've also
seen great success

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.560
where we've helped
governments bring

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.380
in the skills and the
talent they need to maintain

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.760
the technology that Code
for America builds for them.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.730
And that, in some ways,
is my favorite path

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.960
to sustainability because
it means that you've

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.980
got people in there now that
are going to help that city make

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.050
far better choices in the
future about a whole wide range

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:50.920
of things.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.670
And that's true
sustainable change.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.920
STEPHANIE HANNON: I think
by now a lot of our audience

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.927
is wondering how they
can help or get involved.

00:09:56.927 --> 00:09:57.885
You mentioned brigades.

00:09:57.885 --> 00:09:59.718
I'll think it'll probably
be helpful to tell

00:09:59.718 --> 00:10:01.040
a little bit more about those.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.540
JENNIFER PAHLKA:
So we have brigades

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.140
in about seven cities
around the country.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.639
And all that means
is that there are

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.310
people in that city who have
some degree of technical skills

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.890
from incredibly
talented technologists

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.890
to people who are just
comfortable using technology

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.840
but know that that's the
best way for them to help

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.420
make their communities better.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.805
So they get together generally
Tuesday or Wednesday nights,

00:10:21.805 --> 00:10:23.430
generally in city
hall, because they're

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.450
working with local government.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.580
And they work on
open data portals,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.210
or they work on
standing up applications

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.960
that help people
in their community.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.800
And it is a really great
way to get involved

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.300
and to understand a little bit
better the problem that we're

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.340
trying to solve.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.910
We always say, we the people
will solve this problem.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.275
We also, as the people,
need to understand

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:43.150
how government works.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.919
And often we don't
want to do that.

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:47.210
This is a great way not only
to understand the problem,

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.390
but to get to meet the
people in government

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.430
who are really trying to help.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.910
So I would encourage anybody
to join their local brigade.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.600
And there are several
in the Bay Area.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.100
But also, if you live somewhere
where there isn't a brigade,

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.880
to start one and lead one.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.570
That takes time.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.160
But it's a lot of fun.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.180
And you'll end up with
a community of people

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.310
that you really enjoy
and feeling really

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.130
good about the work that
you guys can do together.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.910
There are, of course,
a lot of other ways

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.250
to get involved from the
highest commitment, which

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.570
is to go work in government.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.880
We always encourage
people to think

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.231
about taking a couple of
years out of your career,

00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:23.730
whether you're
spending it at Google

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.470
or sort of bouncing
around, to take some time

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.190
and apply to work in government.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.120
There's some fantastic
positions open

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.130
where you really can do good.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.810
We always hear from
folks that they

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.070
know that this will
make a difference.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.150
They just need to know that
they have a real chance.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.360
And there are now
so many more places

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.330
where you can go into government
and have a real shot at making

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.280
a difference than there
were several years ago.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.910
And of course, the Code
for America fellowship

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.290
is a great way to work with
government, but through us,

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.570
which is easier.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.990
There's a lot fewer constraints.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.630
You're doing it for a
limited amount of time.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.940
And you have a lot
more freedom than when

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.350
you're working in government.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.550
It's an annual program.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.090
And we'll be recruiting for
it again in a couple months.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.090
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.150
So let's look at the
civic Open Data space.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.420
I think there's been a
ton of energy around it.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.560
But it hasn't realized
its potential yet.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.810
And I wonder if you could
talk a little bit about that

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.480
and what could make a big
movement in that space.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.930
JENNIFER PAHLKA: That
movement has been so exciting

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.138
for the past couple of years.

00:12:23.138 --> 00:12:26.400
And it's been a lot of what has
drawn the attention of the tech

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.790
community to government
in the first place.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.420
So I think it's had
success in certain ways.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.580
And I think early
on, hackathons were

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.470
able to sort of show what's
possible in a way that's

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:40.970
sort of opened the door to
governments getting on board,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.240
for people in
government saying, OK.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.470
If we open this
data, the community

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.856
can build us an app that is so
much cheaper and so much better

00:12:48.856 --> 00:12:50.480
than we would've
gotten if we'd done it

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.110
through a procurement process.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.140
So, so many great early wins.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.791
But because it is
hard to open data,

00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:57.290
and because it's
hard for government

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.350
to understand how to
get that data open

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.980
with the characteristics that
will make it useful-- and you,

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.012
yourself, Steph, has said
it needs to be licensed.

00:13:06.012 --> 00:13:06.970
It needs to be updated.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.420
And it needs to be structured.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.800
Well, it's one thing to open it.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.425
It's another thing
to make sure that it

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:15.240
meets all those criteria so
that it continues to be useful

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.740
for developers, and
then, of course,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.292
through the developers
for the citizens.

00:13:19.292 --> 00:13:21.000
There's more that
government needs to do.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.220
But there's also more that
the developer community

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.190
needs to do to
demand these things

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.215
and to help governments
do these things.

00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:28.937
I think of one the
companies that we've

00:13:28.937 --> 00:13:31.020
worked with through our
Accelerator program called

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.260
Captricity.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.060
They can take data that's
currently locked in paper forms

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.930
and getting them into structured
data very, very quickly

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.080
through a wonderful combination
of OCR and Amazon Mechanical

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.720
Turk.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.000
And they're getting huge
amounts of government data

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.650
into a structured format
so that people can use it.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.130
They had a great
success in my time

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.660
in DC clearing the backlog
of adverse effects of drugs

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.700
at the FDA.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.720
It took them six months to
contract to do this work.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.084
And they had structured data
in their hands in six hours.

00:14:03.084 --> 00:14:04.000
STEPHANIE HANNON: Wow.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.220
JENNIFER PAHLKA: So the
tools really are there for us

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.480
to be able to have
this data available.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.340
And, of course, when
you release that data,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.020
think of what the
community can do

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.110
to help flag when there's been
a bad batch of some sort of drug

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.330
or some pill.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.654
And the FDA can
actually act on that.

00:14:19.654 --> 00:14:21.320
That's exactly the
kind of thing that we

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.410
need the community
to come to the table

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:27.000
and say, yes, we can make
this data unbelievably useful

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.395
to save lives.

00:14:28.395 --> 00:14:30.770
STEPHANIE HANNON: So you spent
a year in the White House.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.605
What was your biggest
learning there?

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:34.980
JENNIFER PAHLKA: I think my
biggest learning in the White

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.890
House was that we are at a
very unique moment in time.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.510
I happened to be there during
the failure of healthcare.gov.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.470
My boss was Todd Park, who
went off to rescue the site

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.560
and did so really heroically
along with the help

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.900
of many others,
many Googlers, who

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.500
worked incredibly hard to do it.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.680
But what I saw
during that rescue

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.590
were policymakers
understanding that they

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.520
need the technical world.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.300
They need geeks
to make this work.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.820
When I was there, I was
asked to go start working

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.580
on the problems of
immigration because the people

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.490
in the Domestic Policy council
realized that if the Affordable

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.290
Care Act-- having worked
so hard to get it past--

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.870
was vulnerable because we can't
build a website that works,

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:25.460
what happens when we finally
get immigration reform passed?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.010
Will the systems not scale?

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:30.930
Will we be at risk of
losing that policy as well?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.720
That's something that
nobody wants to have happen.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.840
But the good news
is now they realize

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.810
that we can't rely on
the ways that we've

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.690
been trying to do technology.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.140
Sure, you can have
a vendor that's

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.610
going to tell you, no problem.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.670
The site will work.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.000
Well, they've been there.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.720
And they don't
trust that anymore.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.720
But they trust people
like Mikey Dickerson,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.960
who came from Google
to help save the site.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.350
They trust the people
who build technology

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.870
that does work for us
in our daily lives.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.150
And they want them there.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.990
And I think for the first
time they want them there

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.630
and they're willing to give
them the power to do it right.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.130
And that's the first
time in history

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.171
we've been in that place.

00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:09.120
So I just want us to take
advantage of that moment.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.160
Since they want us
there, let's show up.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.040
Let's be there.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.370
And let's make this work because
they've never before realized

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.384
how important geeks are.

00:16:19.384 --> 00:16:22.050
STEPHANIE HANNON: So digital and
technology people in government

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:22.570
is critical.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.070
Do you think we're
going to see more

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.700
of that in elected officials?

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.866
JENNIFER PAHLKA: I think
that people will demand it.

00:16:27.866 --> 00:16:30.600
I think the general
public is realizing

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.270
that if we can't implement
the policies we create,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.100
we can't govern.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.870
And if we continue to have
a political class that's

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.840
so disconnected from how
the world works today--

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.780
we just manage through software.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.960
That is the reality.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.935
It's not some other thing.

00:16:44.935 --> 00:16:47.060
And if our political class
doesn't understand that,

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.960
they're not going to do a good
job helping run the country.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.140
I think we will
increasingly see people

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.120
in bureaucracy and
in elected positions

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.320
with not necessarily
technical skills,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.360
but with a fundamental
understanding of how

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.620
the digital world works.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.454
That's what we need.

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:04.328
It's a difference between
knowing what's easy

00:17:04.328 --> 00:17:06.420
and knowing what's
hard, and the difference

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.160
between thinking of technology
as something you buy

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.950
and something that you work
on in service of a user.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:13.950
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.520
So if our viewers want to learn
more about Code for America,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.300
where can they go?

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.425
JENNIFER PAHLKA: They can
go to codeforamerica.org.

00:17:19.425 --> 00:17:22.530
They can go look at
our TEDTalk online.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.380
And they can ask
other people that they

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.700
know at Google who've been
involved with the program.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.140
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.870
Well, we're so grateful
you came today.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.810
Thanks, Jen, for
your time with us.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.268
JENNIFER PAHLKA:
Thank you so much.

00:17:32.268 --> 00:17:33.430
It's great to be here.
