00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.850
&gt;&gt; I'm with IDEO, one of the largest design companies in the,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.480
in the world. I'm with Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO, and,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.020
Tim has written this very interesting book, Change By Design, which includes

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.880
among other things, a big section on the importance of design thinking.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.210
So Tim, design thinking. One of the points you argue, is that it doesn't just

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.200
make you a better designer, it makes you better at anything. Tell us about that.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.530
&gt;&gt; I've always thought as, the one of

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.640
the wonderful things about being a, being a designer

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.620
is not just that I get to lots, work on lots of exciting projects, but it helps

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.250
me in my life, right? So I, and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.380
when I want something as simple I'm going to throw

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.940
a dinner party for some friends so I

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.430
start. Instead of just turning up at, you know,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.000
7 o'clock and thinking about what I'm going to make. I actually design

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.080
that, I try and design that experience. I think well who am I

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.250
going to bring together and what's the space going to be like and how does

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.380
the food and the space work together. All of these things that I

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.460
naturally think about as a designer. And I think that's what design thinking

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.310
does for you. It's a set of tools that allows you to approach

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.870
life, particularly the parts of life where it might be advantageous to solve

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.650
the problem differently, that allows you to approach that with some level of

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.940
confidence because you got some ways of going about it.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.520
And we have many, we're taught at school many ways

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.836
of analyzing problems, of put, picking them apart and studying

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:21.590
little pieces of them. Often that's very valuable. But, but design

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.640
thinking gives you a different way of tackling a problem.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.110
Often, often ones that are centered around the needs of the

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.100
people you're trying to solve for. That might be yourself.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.840
It might be a customer in in if, if, if you're

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.730
in a professional environment, it might be you're

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.510
colleagues. Int in in a work, work environment. It's

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.770
centered around that. And so it starts with thinking

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.190
hard, looking hard, listening hard and trying to study

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.470
people. And understand, in this instance, wh, what

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.150
their issues might be, what their problems might be.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.529
w, how they're thinking, how they, how they are,

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:58.910
how they are navigating the world or dealing with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.090
the world at, at, at, at hand. And then

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.592
using that as the starting point for having ideas.

00:02:03.592 --> 00:02:06.010
&gt;&gt; Mm hm, I actually, I often describe it,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.730
don't solve the problem. In fact, as a consultant never solve

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.720
the problem you're given, but figure out what the real problem is.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, figure out what the question is. I mean, many of us think we're

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.340
talk about, when people talk about creativity

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.000
or design, I think it's all about solving

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.690
the problem and, and being creative about

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.250
that. But I find generally the most interesting

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.350
solutions come out of the most interesting

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.710
questions and, and so that insight about what

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.200
the problem might really be, is often the most important than the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.610
biggest creative step. And so, if you just assume you know the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.240
question then especially if it's the same question that everybody else is,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.040
is asking. Then you'll probably get to the same answer that everybody it

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.530
getting to. But if you study a little bit and think a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.250
little bit, and maybe look at it, look at the, look at things

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.740
from a slightly different perspective, really get under the skin of the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.830
people that you are trying to serve, it's surprising how often you end

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.690
up completely re-framing the question.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.050
&gt;&gt; And so, as you point out, this could be

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.620
used by anybody, a business person, an artist, a journalist, anybody.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, you, you can think about how you use it. I mean, one

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.950
of the things I talk about in, in, in, in, in my book is, is ways

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.490
of applying design thinking to your own life.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.260
I mean, think about your career. How can

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.820
I apply a design thinking approach to my

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.570
career, to the choices I make, or, or, or,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.690
absolutely how you apply it in your, in, in your,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.925
in your workplace. No matter what you do. You might, you

00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:30.710
might work in the finance department, have a company, and be

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.220
thinking, well how could I be, find more creative solutions to

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.170
the way that we, the processes that work within our organization. Or the way

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.480
that we come together as, as, as, as people. And so I think whatever your

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.570
background, if you have the, the tools to hand, the thinking tools to hand,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.610
and the confidence to use them. that, that, that design can be a great help.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
