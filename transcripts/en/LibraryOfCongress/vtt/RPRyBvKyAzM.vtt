&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, WENDY FOR

00:10:35.055 --> 00:10:39.561
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY WHO CAME
FOR THE RESCHEDULED EVENT.

00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:44.059
THANK YOU, LISA TAYLOR, YOU HAVE
BEEN INCREDIBLY HOSPITABLE AND

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.273
ORGANIZED IN HELPING WITH MY
RESEARCH AND THIS EVENT.

00:10:46.788 --> 00:10:49.284
IT'S A THRILL TO SPEAK AT THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, OBVIOUSLY

00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:52.199
ONE OF THE GREAT RESEARCH
INSTITUTIONS IN THE WORLD.

00:10:53.117 --> 00:10:55.114
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE
VETERANS HISTORY COLLECTION HERE

00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:57.420
WAS SO FUNDAMENTALLY CRUCIAL TO
MY RESEARCH.

00:10:57.849 --> 00:11:01.542
WHEN I WAS GETTING STARTED,
RESEARCHING CODE GIRLS AND WHEN

00:11:01.543 --> 00:11:05.146
I WAS IN FACT SHOPPING THE BOOK
PROPOSAL, TO EDITORS IN NEW

00:11:05.337 --> 00:11:07.346
YORK, APPARENTLY ONE OF THE
EDITORS SAID THAT HE THOUGHT

00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:13.448
THAT IT WAS A GREAT STORY BUT
FELT IT MIGHT BE THIN BEER

00:11:13.647 --> 00:11:16.840
BECAUSE SO MUCH TIME PASSED
SINCE WORLD WAR II, IF THERE

00:11:17.036 --> 00:11:19.950
WERE ANY WOMEN CODE BREAKERS OUT
THERE THEY WOULD BE IN MID

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:24.036
'90s, MAYBE WOULDN'T REMEMBER
MUCH, WOULDN'T BE MUCH RECORD

00:11:24.037 --> 00:11:27.375
SINCE IT WAS TOP SECRET WORK.
SO I GOT UP EVERY DAY DURING

00:11:28.373 --> 00:11:32.761
RESEARCH AND SAID I A HE I'LL 
SHOW YOU.

00:11:32.989 --> 00:11:35.688
I HAVE THE HELP OF ALLIES LIKE
THE VETERANS HISTORY COLLECTION

00:11:35.689 --> 00:11:39.104
HERE, I LITERALLY EMAILED
THROUGH THE WEBSITE SAYING I'M

00:11:39.105 --> 00:11:42.097
WORKING ON THIS BOOK, DO YOU
HAVE ANYTHING, ININSTANTLY GOT A

00:11:42.098 --> 00:11:45.994
REPLY FROM MEGAN HARRIS SAYING
YES, WE HAVE WONDERFUL RECORDS,

00:11:45.995 --> 00:11:49.194
WE HAVE ORAL HISTORIES, WE HAVE
SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS, SHE

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:52.297
PROVIDED ME WITH A LIST OF THE
NAMES OF WOMEN THEY TAKEN ORAL

00:11:52.298 --> 00:11:56.907
HISTORIES FROM, INCREDIBLY WELL
ORGANIZED, I CAME HERE FOR

00:11:57.309 --> 00:12:02.006
SEVERAL DAYS AND LISTENED AND
READ TO THE WOMEN'S WHO TOLD

00:12:02.297 --> 00:12:08.915
THEIR STORIES, MANY NO LONGER
WITH US BUT FORT FORTUNATELY 

00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:10.398
STORIES
ARE COLLECTED AND RESIDE HERE

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:13.709
DIGITALLY SO IN THE END I WAS
ABLE TO COLLECT ALMOST MORE

00:12:14.205 --> 00:12:17.015
MATERIAL THAN I COULD COPE WITH
IN REPORTING THIS BOOK.

00:12:17.322 --> 00:12:21.134
FOR LIVING WOMEN AND FROM
WONDERFUL ARCHIVAL RESOURCES

00:12:21.626 --> 00:12:23.737
LIKE THIS COLLECTION AND ABLE TO
SUBSTANDIATE THE RECOLLECTIONS

00:12:23.738 --> 00:12:30.032
OF WOMEN WHO ARE STILL ALIVE
WITH THE PAPER RECORD, WITH ORAL

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:33.838
HISTORY AND OTHER SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION SO I'M SO GRATEFUL

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:37.025
FOR THIS INSTITUTION FOR MAKING
AMERICAN HISTORY ACCESSIBLE TO

00:12:37.026 --> 00:12:40.124
RESEARCHERS, TO CITIZENS, TO
EVERYBODY AND FOR HOLDING EVENTS

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:43.930
LIKE THIS WHERE WE CAN CONTINUE
GET THE MESSAGE OUT AND SUPPORTK

00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:47.041
AUTHORINGS WHICH IS VERY
IMPORTANT:  SO IT'S THRILLING TO

00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:48.957
BE HERE.
IT'S ALSO THRILL TO BE HERE

00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.658
DURING WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH.
ORIGINALLY I WAS GOING TO BE

00:12:51.863 --> 00:12:54.763
SPEAKING AT THE BEGINNING OF
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH AND NOW WE

00:12:54.764 --> 00:12:58.461
HAVE MANAGED TO SNEAK IN THE
RESCHEDULED EVENT WHEN IT'S

00:12:58.556 --> 00:13:03.967
STILL MARCH, THAT'S MEANINGFUL
BECAUSE WE'RE T A WATER SHED

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:10.064
MOMENT IN TERMS OF RECEPTIVITY
TO WOMEN WITH'S'S HISTORY.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.679
IT SHOULD BE EVERYBODY'S HISTORY
MONTH BUT THIS MONTH HAS SPECIAL

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.196
MEANING AND I THINK WE'RE IN A
GREAT MOMENT.

00:13:15.618 --> 00:13:19.312
BOOK LIKES HIDDEN FIGURES SO
SUCCESSFUL IN OPENING UP THE

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:21.809
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WOMEN HAVE
MADE TO AMERICAN MILITARY

00:13:22.508 --> 00:13:25.807
HISTORY, TO AMERICAN SCIENCE,
HAVE REALLY PERSUADE PUBLISHERS

00:13:25.808 --> 00:13:30.110
THAT THERE'S AN AUDIENCE FOR
THESE BOOKS, PEOPLE RECEPTIVE TO

00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:32.836
THESE STORIES.
YOU NAY KNOW THE NEW YORK TIMES

00:13:32.837 --> 00:13:36.129
START AD SERIES CALLED
OVERLOOKED GOING BACK TO

00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:39.230
ARCHIVAL RECORD AND REALIZING
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WOMEN

00:13:39.328 --> 00:13:42.639
PASSED FROM THE SCENE AND DIDN'T
GET OBITUARIES INCLUDING

00:13:42.936 --> 00:13:47.335
CHARLOTTE BRANTE, WOMEN OF THAT
STATURE WEREN'T RECOGNIZED

00:13:47.924 --> 00:13:50.042
DURING THAT U TIME SO THE NEW
YORK TIME HAD A NEW SERIES WHICH

00:13:50.043 --> 00:13:52.743
THEY'RE GOING BACK AND PROVIDING
OBITUARIES OF WOMEN WHO SHOULD

00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:54.946
HAVE GOTTEN RECOGNITION IN THEIR
TIME.

00:13:55.243 --> 00:13:57.236
AND I FEEL THE PUBLISHING
INDUSTRY IS DOING THE SAME THING

00:13:57.237 --> 00:13:59.237
TODAY, SO IS IT'S THRILLING TO
BE PART OF IT.

00:14:01.058 --> 00:14:04.161
SO WHEN TALKING ABOUT CODE
GIRLS, ABOUT THESE THOUSANDS OF

00:14:04.162 --> 00:14:09.263
WOMEN WHO CAME TO WASHINGTON TO
JOIN THE U.S. MILITARY AND

00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:13.365
SUPPORT THE WAR EFFORT, I LIKE
TO START WITH THIS SLIDE,

00:14:13.573 --> 00:14:17.666
BECAUSE IT REALLY ILLUSTRATES
THE PLIGHT OF THE EDUCATED WOMAN

00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:23.275
IN 1942.
THIS PHOTO SHOWS THE MAY COURT

00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:27.093
AT GOWNER COLLEGE IN THE SPRING
OF 1942, SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW

00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:31.896
GOUCHER COLLEGE THEN WAS AND ALL
GIRLS SCHOOL, THE WOMEN WHO WENT

00:14:31.897 --> 00:14:37.995
THERE WERE CALLED GOUCHER GIRLS,
LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE,

00:14:38.097 --> 00:14:40.914
D. CM, IT'S A CO-EDUCATIONAL
UNIVERSITY BUT AT THE TIME IT

00:14:40.915 --> 00:14:44.599
WAS A CITY SCHOOL, MANY YOUNG
WOMEN WHO ATTENDED THERE WERE

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.719
CITY GIRLS WHO GREW UP IN
BALTIMORE, WHO WALKED TO

00:14:47.902 --> 00:14:52.008
CLASSES, IN SOME CASES COULDN'T
AFFORD TO BOARD BECAUSE THEY HAD

00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:57.215
GROWN UP DURING THE DEPRESSION
AND WERE VERY DEVOTED AND

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.307
MOTIVATED TO GET A GREAT LIBERAL
ARTS EDUCATION.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.821
GOUCHER WAS A WELL RESPECTED
UNIVERSITY, ITS DEAN DOROTHY

00:15:07.526 --> 00:15:12.919
STIPSON WAS A NOTED EXPERT ON
COPERNICUS, THE FIRST AMERICAN

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.920
WOMAN TO WIN PULL LESSER

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:20.719
TOP NOTCH SCHOOL.
THESE WOMEN WERE MORE UNUSUAL

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.919
THAN THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN AT
THIS TIME IN AMERICAN LIFE 4% OF

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.920
AMERICAN WOMEN ATTAINED A FOUR
YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE.

00:15:28.132 --> 00:15:31.531
THE REASON THAT PERCENTAGE WAS
SO SMALL WAS IN PART BECAUSE SO

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:36.042
MANY SCHOOLS WERE SO CLOSED TO
WOMEN, SO MANY CAMPUSES DIDN'T

00:15:36.043 --> 00:15:39.240
ADMIT WOMEN, THE IVY LEAGUE FOR
MOST PART WAS CLOSED TO WOMEN,

00:15:39.241 --> 00:15:42.736
MANY, MANY PRIVATE UNIVERSITS,
MANY STATE UNIVERSITIES AND MY

00:15:42.737 --> 00:15:46.335
HOME STATE OF VIRGINIA, THE
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA DID NOT

00:15:46.336 --> 00:15:51.050
GIVE FULL DEGREES TO WOMEN UNTIL
THE 1960s AND SO THERE WERE

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.246
NOT A LOT OF INSTITUTIONS TO
CHOOSE FROM AND OF COURSE THESE

00:15:54.247 --> 00:15:57.737
WONDERFUL WOMEN'S COLLEGES HAD
BEEN FOUNDED IN LATE 19th

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.550
CENTURY AT A TIME WHEN MANY
BELIEVED HIGHER EDUCATION WAS

00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:06.335
BAD FOR WOMEN, IT MADE WOMEN
SORT OF UPPITY AND OBNOXIOUS AND

00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:09.143
THERE WAS ACTUALLY A BELIEF THAT
EDUCATION WASN'T GOOD FOR WOMEN,

00:16:09.144 --> 00:16:11.144
TOO MUCH LEARNING WASN'T GOOD
FOR WOMEN.

00:16:11.735 --> 00:16:15.336
THERE WAS A HARVARD PHYSICIAN
WHO ARGUED THAT TOO MUCH

00:16:15.838 --> 00:16:18.133
EDUCATION MADE WOMEN INFER
UNTIL, THAT IT SWELLED THEIR

00:16:18.334 --> 00:16:23.272
BRAINS AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR
WOMBS, HE ARGUED THAT AND PEOPLE

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:26.258
BELIEVED IT.
SO THESE WOMEN COLLEGES HAD BEEN

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:30.975
CREATED AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD
SOMETHING TO PROVE, THAT WOMEN

00:16:30.976 --> 00:16:34.397
DO STERVED EDUCATION, IT WAS
WORTH EDUCATEK WOMEN AND IT WAS

00:16:34.398 --> 00:16:38.127
GOOD FOR WOMEN TO BE EDUCATED.
ANOTHER REASON THE NUMBERS WERE

00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:41.412
SO SMALL IS FAMILIES REALIZED
THIS THERE WAS NOT ECONOMIC PAY

00:16:41.413 --> 00:16:44.909
OFF TO EDUCATING DAUGHTER THE
WAY THERE WAS FOR A SON BECAUSE

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.311
PROFESSIONAL FIELDS OPENED TO
EDUCATED WOMEN WERE SO LIMITED.

00:16:48.312 --> 00:16:52.607
IF YOU WERE A WOMAN MOTIVATED TO
BECOME A DOCTOR OR LAWYER OR

00:16:53.009 --> 00:16:55.906
ARCHITECT OR BUSINESSWOMAN OR
ENGINEER OR SCIENTIST, YOU WOULD

00:16:55.907 --> 00:16:58.113
BE LUCKY THE FIND A SPOT IN A
GRADUATE SCHOOL.

00:16:58.826 --> 00:17:01.833
MANY, MANY GRADUATE SCHOOLS WERE
CLOSED TO WOMEN, MANY FIELDS

00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:04.928
WERE VIRTUALLY CLOSED TO WOMEN,
SO THE ONLY JOB YOU COULD EXPECT

00:17:04.929 --> 00:17:09.840
GRADUATING FROM A FINE COLLEGE
REALLY RELIABLY WAS TEACHING

00:17:09.935 --> 00:17:11.427
SCHOOL.
THAT'S GREAT IF YOU WANT TO BE A

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:14.130
SCHOOLTEACHER BUT IF THAT'S
ANOTHER FIELD YOU'RE INTERESTED

00:17:14.131 --> 00:17:19.131
IN IT PRESENTS A NARROW FIELD OF
ENDEAVOR FOR WOMEN AND EVEN THEN

00:17:19.132 --> 00:17:23.334
ONLY UNTIL YOU GET MARRIED CAN
YOU EXPECT A SCHOOL TEACHING

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.958
JOB.
BACK THEN THERE WAS A MARRIAGE

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:29.152
BAR SO IF A WOMAN GOT MARRIED
SHE WAS REQUIRED TO QUIT

00:17:29.543 --> 00:17:31.543
TEACHING AND STAY HOME WITH HER
HODS AND FAMILY.

00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:32.911
SO THERE WAS -- HUSBAND AND
FAMILY.

00:17:32.912 --> 00:17:35.703
SO THERE WASN'T A GREAT ECONOMIC
PAY OFF TO GETTING A COLLEGE

00:17:35.798 --> 00:17:38.199
DEGREE FOR WOMEN AND PARENT
COMING OUT OF THE DEPRESSION,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.710
THEY MADE THAT CALCULATION.
OF COURSE, THE OTHER REASON FOR

00:17:41.711 --> 00:17:45.402
A WOMAN TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR
WHICH THERE MIGHT BE AN ECONOMIC

00:17:45.403 --> 00:17:48.809
PAY OFF WAS TO GET THE
PROVERBIAL MRS DEGREE.

00:17:49.117 --> 00:17:52.924
WHICH WAS A THING BACK THEN, THE
IDEA THAT IF YOU WENT TO COLLEGE

00:17:52.925 --> 00:17:56.419
THEN YOU COULD DATE MEN, AT
NEIGHBORING MEN'S SCHOOL, MARRY

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.431
A MAN FROM A GOOD FAMILY OR WITH
GOOD PROSPECTS AND YOU CAN GET

00:18:00.432 --> 00:18:03.922
YOURSELF SITUATED IN LIFE, MAYBE
TEACH A COUPLE OF YEARS, PUT HIM

00:18:03.923 --> 00:18:07.023
THROUGH LAW SCHOOL OR WHATEVER
BUT THERE WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC

00:18:07.024 --> 00:18:11.268
PAY OFF TO MARRIAGE.
SO THESE YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE

00:18:11.456 --> 00:18:15.952
ACADEMICALLY MOTIVATED,
CHALLENGED BY THEIR CLASSESES

00:18:15.953 --> 00:18:19.347
WERE PRESSURED PARTICULARLY IN
SENIOR YEAR TO GET ENGAGED, GET

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.958
THAT RING, TO HAVE THEIR FUTURE
ASSURED.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.575
AND SO THESE SCHOOLS HAD
CEREMONIES LIKE THE MAY COURT,

00:18:26.576 --> 00:18:29.967
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE MAY
COURT WAS SOME REMNANT OF PAGAN

00:18:29.968 --> 00:18:34.775
FERTILITY RITUAL WHICH THE YOUNG
WOMEN SELECTIVE BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:18:34.776 --> 00:18:39.374
BEAUTY OR THEIR PERSONALITY OR
THEIR FAMILY OR THEIR ACADEMIC

00:18:39.375 --> 00:18:41.375
STANDING WOULD BE ELECTED TO THE
MAY COURT.

00:18:41.408 --> 00:18:43.408
YOU SEE THE QUEEN UP THERE IN
THE CHAIR.

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:46.790
AND THEY WOULD BE SORT OF
SYMBOLICALLY USHERED INTO THE

00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:48.914
MARRIAGE MARKET.
ALL THE WOMEN'S COLLEGES HAD

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:52.014
RITUALS LIKE THIS.
WELLSLY COLLEGE IN MASSACHUSETTS

00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:57.022
HAD SENIOR CLASS ROLE AND THE
LEGEND OF THE HOOP ROLL IS

00:18:57.333 --> 00:18:59.033
WINNER WOULD BE THE CLASS'S
FIRST BRIDE.

00:18:59.034 --> 00:19:05.324
SO THAT WAS A GREAT DISTINCTION.
AND SO -- AND I INTERVIEWED MANY

00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:07.325
OF THESE WOMEN AND THEY REMEMBER
THE INTENSE PRESSURE TO GET

00:19:07.817 --> 00:19:11.622
MARRIED AT THE TIME AND WELLSLY
HAD A SECTION OF THE YEARBOOK

00:19:11.623 --> 00:19:15.224
THAT LISTED WOMEN AND THEIR
ENGAGEMENTS AND WHO THEY WERE

00:19:15.225 --> 00:19:18.222
ENGAGED TO AS WELL AS WOMEN WHO
HAD GOTTEN MARRIED EVEN BEFORE

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:21.821
GRADUATING AND HAD LEFT COLLEGE
IN MANY CASES IN ORDER TO GET

00:19:21.822 --> 00:19:23.738
MARRIED.
SO AGAIN, THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE

00:19:23.739 --> 00:19:28.239
OF HOW HARD THESE WOMEN HAD
WORKED TO GET THEIR SCHOOLING,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.432
BUT SORT OF THE VERY LIMITED
FIELD OF LIFE PROSPECTS THAT

00:19:32.433 --> 00:19:34.433
THEY WERE LOOKING AT UPON
GRADUATION.

00:19:34.866 --> 00:19:38.454
BUT WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR PHOTO IS THAT

00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:41.662
UNBEKNOWNST TO ANYBODY,
INCLUDING THEIR COLLEAGUES ON

00:19:41.663 --> 00:19:44.367
THE PLATFORM, TWO OF THESE
WOMEN, THIS IS JACQUELINE

00:19:45.161 --> 00:19:46.982
JENKINS, THAT WAS HER NAME AT
THE TIME.

00:19:46.983 --> 00:19:51.982
LATER ON WHEN SHE MARRIED SHE
WOULD BE JACQUELINE JENKINS NYE,

00:19:52.787 --> 00:19:54.787
E,
THE MOTHER OF BILL NYE THE

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:58.889
SCIENCE GUY SO YOU CAN GET A
SENSE OF HER INTELLECTUAL CHOPS

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:05.686
AS WELL AS HER FRIEND GWENNETH,
THESE TWO YOUNG WOMEN WERE

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.999
SECRETLY SELECTED AND TAPPED BY
THE U.S. NAVY AND THEY WERE

00:20:09.188 --> 00:20:11.398
RECEIVING TRAINING IN CRYPT
ANALYSIS, A FIELD THEY NEVER

00:20:11.603 --> 00:20:14.987
HEARD OF, NOBODY HAD HEARD OF,
THEY WERE RECEIVING WEEKLY

00:20:15.186 --> 00:20:20.910
INSTRUCTION IN A LOCKED
CLASSROOM AT THE TOP OF GOUCHE

00:20:22.303 --> 00:20:25.098
HER
HALL, ONLY MAYBE CHAPTER AHEAD

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:29.495
IN THE CORRESPONDENCE COURSE THE
U.S. NAVY COMPILED TO TEACH THEM

00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:32.991
THIS ARCANE FIELD, THAT HAD BEEN
AROUND SINCE TIME OF JULIUS

00:20:33.503 --> 00:20:37.200
CAESAR OR PROBABLY SINCE TIME
LEARNING TO WRITE OR COMMUNICATE

00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:42.191
AS ALL AS HUMANS BECAUSE IT IS
HUMAN INSTINCT TO SEND SECRET

00:20:42.192 --> 00:20:44.608
COMMUNICATIONS TO SOMEBODY WHO
YOU HAVE AN URGENT MESSAGE FOR

00:20:44.609 --> 00:20:46.609
AND NOT HAVE ANYBODY ELSE LISTEN
IN.

00:20:47.027 --> 00:20:51.826
SO THIS FIELD HAD BEEN AROUND
REALLY FOR CENTURYIES BUT NOT SO

00:20:51.827 --> 00:20:54.729
MUCH IN THE UNITED STATES AND
NOBODY REALLY IN THE MAINSTREAM

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.133
HAD HEARD OF IT.
SO THEY WERE BEING TAUGHT ALL OF

00:20:58.134 --> 00:21:03.332
A SUDDEN IN GREAT SECRECY, THEY
COULDN'T TELL THEIR BROTHERS,

00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:06.038
BOYFRIENDS, FAMILY MEMBERS, THEY
COULDN'T TELL THEIR ROOMMATES

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:08.069
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
THEY WERE LEARNING HOW TO TAKE

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.756
FREQUENCY COUNTS, LEARNING
BEHAVIOR OF LETTERS IN THE

00:21:11.066 --> 00:21:14.064
ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND THE FRENCH
LANGUAGE, THEY WERE LEARNING HOW

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:19.562
AL TA
ALPHABETS COULD BE SCRAMBLED TO

00:21:19.563 --> 00:21:22.469
DISGUISE SECRET COMMUNICATIONS.
THE REASON THAT WAS HAPPENING IS

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:27.977
BECAUSE IN DECEMBER OF 1941 ON
DECEMBER 7TH THE PACIFIC FLEET

00:21:27.978 --> 00:21:30.582
WAS ATTACKED AT PARTIAL HARBOR,
IT WAS A GREAT SHOCK AND

00:21:31.578 --> 00:21:33.777
SURPRISE TO THE NEIGH, THE
WORLD, -- NATION, THE WORLD, IT

00:21:33.778 --> 00:21:37.788
WAS A SURPRISE ATTACK, WE HADN'T
SEEN IT COMING, WE LOST

00:21:38.287 --> 00:21:41.985
THOUSANDS OF YOUNG AMERICAN
SERVICEMEN.

00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:47.503
AND SO WE WERE LAUNCHED FORMALLY
INTO WORLD WAR II, IT HAD BEEN

00:21:47.504 --> 00:21:50.410
RAGING IN EUROPE FOR SEVERAL
YEARS, WE KNEW THAT WE WERE

00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:53.105
GOING TO JOIN THE FIGHTING AT
SOME POINT BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW

00:21:53.106 --> 00:21:57.304
THAT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
ABRUPTLY AFTER DECEMBER 7TH.

00:21:57.723 --> 00:22:01.417
THE NEXT DAY OF COURSE CONGRESS
DECLARES WAR ON JAPAN.

00:22:01.729 --> 00:22:04.629
THREE DAYS LATER GERMANY
DECLARES WAR ON US.

00:22:05.243 --> 00:22:09.042
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN U.S. IS
LAUNCHED INTO WHAT WAS CALLED

00:22:09.043 --> 00:22:11.540
TOTAL WAR, ALL THE YOUNG MEN
SIGNED UP TO FIGHT.

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:15.157
JAPAN THOUGHT THE ATTACK AT
PEARL HARBOR WOULD BRING US TO

00:22:15.158 --> 00:22:19.659
YOU ARE KNEES, DEMORALIZE US, IT
WOULD ALLOW THEM TO KEEP

00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:22.167
HOLDINGS IN THE PACIFIC THEY
WERE CONQUERING EVEN IF THEY

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.363
WERE BOMBING PEARL HARBOR AND IT
HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON THE

00:22:25.364 --> 00:22:29.887
AMERICAN PUBLIC.
WE ROSE UP IN ARMS, EVERY FAMILY

00:22:29.888 --> 00:22:32.193
WAS DETERMINED TO CONTRIBUTE TO
WAR EFFORT, EVERY YOUNG MAN

00:22:33.082 --> 00:22:36.285
WANTED TO BE IN MILITARY UNIFORM
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL THE

00:22:36.486 --> 00:22:38.893
YOUNG MEN WERE SHIPPING TO THE
PACIFIC TO ISLANDS, THAT MOST

00:22:38.894 --> 00:22:44.723
AMERICANS HAD NEVER HEARD OF TO
THE EUROPEAN THEATER ON CONVOYS

00:22:44.724 --> 00:22:47.639
GOING TO EUROPE.
IT WAS EVACUATION OF THE MEN.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.950
SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT
SUDDENLY WE'RE FIGHTING THESE

00:22:50.951 --> 00:22:55.459
BATTLES, STRUNG OUT THOUSANDS OF
MILES AROUND THE WORLD, WE KNOW

00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.257
THAT WE HAD NO INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES, WE HAD NO WAY OF

00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:02.459
KNOWING WHEN THERE WAS GOING TO
BE ANOTHER ENEMY ATTACK.

00:23:02.586 --> 00:23:04.689
WHERE THE ENEMY IS LOCATED.
WE WANT TO ATTACK.

00:23:05.205 --> 00:23:08.905
IT'S VERY HARD TO SORT OF
BELIEVE THIS IN THE DAY IN TIME

00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:13.132
WE HAVE 17 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
IN WASHINGTON D.C., WE HAD NONE

00:23:13.709 --> 00:23:17.096
OF THOSE WHEN ENTERED WORLD WAR
II, WHEN WE NEEDED INTELLIGENCE

00:23:17.097 --> 00:23:20.852
MORE THAN WE EVER HAD WE DIDN'T
HAVE A CIA AN NSA, WE DIDN'T

00:23:21.163 --> 00:23:23.348
HAVE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, WE HAVE

00:23:23.749 --> 00:23:26.946
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES NOW WHOSE
JOB IS TO OVERSEE OTHER

00:23:27.446 --> 00:23:29.553
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.  WE DEN
HAVE THAT THEN.

00:23:29.853 --> 00:23:34.158
WE FORM THE OSS QUICKLY TO BEGIN
TO BUILD A SPY NETWORK OVERSEAS

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:38.059
BUT ONE THING WE COULD DO RIGHT
AWAY IS RAMP UP OUR ABILITY TO

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.566
INTERCEPT THE RADIO SIGNALS THE
ENCRYPTED ENCODED RADIO

00:23:43.453 --> 00:23:46.058
SIGNALINGS THAT MILITARY
COMMANDERS THAT POLITICIANS THAT

00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:48.856
DIP MATS WERE SENDING THROUGH
THE AIRWAVES THOUSANDS OF

00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:51.953
MESSAGES ON A DAILY BASIS,
ANNOUNCING THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND

00:23:51.954 --> 00:23:54.671
ANNOUNCING THEIR PLANS,
DISCUSSING THEIR STRATEGY, ALL

00:23:54.672 --> 00:23:59.068
OF THIS WAS TRAVELING THROUGH
THE AIRWAVES, RADIOS SOMETIMES

00:23:59.069 --> 00:24:06.666
BY TELEGRAPH, SEND BY MORSE CODE
AND ENCRYPTED SUCH AS LIKE OUR

00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:12.360
TEXT EMAILS, INSTAGRAMS, OUR
TWEETS, ARE ALL ENCRYPTED, THAT

00:24:12.361 --> 00:24:15.163
WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS ALL
THESE MILITARIES WERE STRUNG OUT

00:24:15.164 --> 00:24:20.860
ALL OVER THE WORLD SO ADMIRAL
DONITS COMMANDING THE U BOAT

00:24:21.161 --> 00:24:26.460
LEAGUE COMMANDING EACH U BOAT,
IS SENDING MESSAGES EVERY DAY.

00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:29.489
WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO BREAK
THOSE CODE BREAKING.

00:24:30.194 --> 00:24:32.608
THE U.S. ARM MY AND NAVY BEFORE
THE WAR WE NEEDED TO SCALE UP

00:24:32.609 --> 00:24:35.306
BASICALLY, WE NEED TO SCALE
THOSE OPERATIONS IN A MASSIVE

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:39.100
WAY, AND EXACTLY THE TIME THE
EDUCATED YOUNG MEN THAT THE

00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:41.907
MILITARY NORMALLY WOULD HAVE
TURNED TO TO DO THIS WORK WERE

00:24:41.908 --> 00:24:43.908
SUDDENLY UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE
THEY WERE FIGHTING.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:48.237
SO THE U.S. MILITARY MAKES A
DECISION, IF THE EDUCATED YOUNG

00:24:48.238 --> 00:24:50.977
MEN ARE UNAVAILABLE TO US LET'S
GIVE THE WOMEN A CHANCE.

00:24:52.187 --> 00:24:55.182
LET'S OPEN UP SOME FIELDS OF
ENDEAVOR TO SMART MOTIVATED

00:24:55.384 --> 00:24:57.374
WOMEN.
SO WHEN I WAS DOING MY WORK ALSO

00:24:57.375 --> 00:24:59.892
AT THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN
COLLEGE PARK WHICH IS A

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.678
WONDERFUL RESEARCH FACILITY, AND
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF -- THERE

00:25:04.679 --> 00:25:08.483
ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
RECORDS AT NATIONAL ARCHIVES.

00:25:08.484 --> 00:25:11.883
I FOUND THIS, WITH SOME
BUREAUCRAT AT THE U.S. NAVY GOT

00:25:11.884 --> 00:25:16.082
THE BRIGHT IDEA THE NAVY HAD A
SMALL CORRESPONDENCE COURSE

00:25:16.486 --> 00:25:21.294
GOING ON FOR YEARS WHICH THEY
WOULD RECRUIT DABBLERS IN

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.784
CRYPTOLOGY, THEY WOULD TRY TO
BRING IN HOBBIESTISTS, PEOPLE

00:25:24.785 --> 00:25:28.884
WHO MIGHT JOIN CIVILIAN CODE
BREAKING FORCE IN THE '30s SO

00:25:28.885 --> 00:25:32.198
THEY HAD A COURSE ALREADY AND
THEY PERIODICALLY PRODUCE MEMOS

00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:36.798
SAYING WHERE THEY WERE LOOKING
FOR THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE, THESE

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:38.799
PARTICULAR KINDS OF BRAINS, THEY
WANTED.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.447
SO YOU CAN SEE THIS MEMO SAYS
NEW SOURCE WOMEN'S COLLEGES.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.159
SO THOUGH THE LIGHT BULB WENT ON
AND SOMEBODY SAID LET'S SEE WHAT

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.414
THE WOMEN CAN DO.
AND IF THEY CAN DO THIS WORK.

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:54.192
AND THE RESULT OF THIS MEMO AND
THE DECISION AND THE FEAR IN THE

00:25:54.193 --> 00:25:58.297
U.S. NAVY THAT ANOTHER ATTACK
WOULD HAPPEN LIKE PEARL HARBOR,

00:25:58.298 --> 00:26:01.589
THIS WAS A GREAT INTELLIGENCE
FAILURE, THE NAVY KNEW THAT,

00:26:02.006 --> 00:26:04.813
CAREERS WERE ENDED.
PEOPLE FELT ENORMOUS GUILT, THEY

00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:07.025
COULDN'T LET THIS HAPPEN.
SO IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION

00:26:07.026 --> 00:26:10.087
AND CRISIS, LET'S BE INCLUSIVE.
LET'S BRING IN THE WOMEN.

00:26:10.933 --> 00:26:16.437
SO AS A RESULT OF THIS, WOMEN
NOT ONLY AT GOUCHER BUT AT THE

00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:20.038
SEVEN SISTERS COLLEGES ON THE
EASTERN SEA BOARD, ELITE WOMEN'S

00:26:20.039 --> 00:26:24.029
COLLEGES SEEN BY NAVY AS COUNTER
PART TO THE MALE IVY LEAGUE,

00:26:25.032 --> 00:26:30.131
SENIOR WOMEN WHO WERE IDENTIFIED
BY THEIR DEANS AND PROFESSORS

00:26:30.132 --> 00:26:34.145
OFTEN MATH PROFESSOR AND
ASTRONOMY PROFESSORS IDENTIFY

00:26:34.637 --> 00:26:37.528
YOUNG WOMEN TALENTED AT MATH
SCIENCE AND LAINGIAN ALSO SHOWED

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:40.333
GRIT, PERSISTENCE, SHOWED
WILLINGNESS TO OVERCOME

00:26:41.143 --> 00:26:44.936
FRUSTRATION, THEY WOULD SECRETLY
TAP THESE WOMEN, WOULD BE CALLED

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:46.974
IN TO THEIR GREAT SURPRISE AND
ASKED TWO QUESTIONS.

00:26:48.278 --> 00:26:50.578
DO YOU LIKE CROSS WORD PUDDLES
AND ARE YOU ENGAGED TO BE

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.592
MARRIED?
IF THEY ANSWERED YES TO THE

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.198
FIRST AND NO TO THE SECOND, THEY
WOULD BE INVITED TO TAKE THIS

00:26:58.199 --> 00:27:02.501
SECRET NAVAL CRYPT ANALYTIC
TRAINING COURSE IN SECRECY

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.700
ADULTER COURSE OF THEIR

00:27:08.208 --> 00:27:10.504
SECRET DURING
THE SENIOR YEAR.

00:27:10.802 --> 00:27:14.109
MEN WERE SHIPPING OUT WAY WANTED
SOMEBODY WAITING AT HOME AND

00:27:14.403 --> 00:27:17.303
SOMEBODY TO WRITE TO SO A LOT OF
WOMEN LIED AND THOUGH THEY WERE

00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:20.410
ENGAGED, WHATEVER THEY WERE
BEING INVITED TO DO SOUNDED MORE

00:27:20.411 --> 00:27:23.309
INTERESTING THAN SITTING AROUND
WAITING TO SEE IF THEIR BROTHERS

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.613
WOULD BE OKAY OR BOYFRIENDS
WOULD BE OKAY, THEY WANTED TO

00:27:27.614 --> 00:27:30.325
JOIN THE WAR EFFORT.
SO THEY LIED SAID THEY WEREN'T

00:27:30.326 --> 00:27:36.830
ENGAGED, TOOK COURSE AND CAME TO
WASHINGTON D.C. TO WORK IN

00:27:36.831 --> 00:27:40.129
JUNE 1942 AT THE TIME THE PADDLE
OF MIDWAY, ONE OF THE GREAT --

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.933
BATTLE OF MIDWAY, GREAT SEA
BATTLE, THE FIRST PAY BACK FOR

00:27:43.934 --> 00:27:48.830
PEARL HARBOR, SHOWED THE U.S.
MILITARY SECRETLY, BECAUSE THE

00:27:48.831 --> 00:27:52.328
PUBLIC DIDN'T KNOW OR SHOULDN'T
KNOW, HOW IMPORTANT CODE

00:27:52.429 --> 00:27:54.037
BREAKING WAS GOING TO BE TO THE
WAR EFFORT.

00:27:54.038 --> 00:27:57.237
THIS WAS A TIME WHEN WE DID NOT
KNOW THAT WE WERE GOING TO WIN

00:27:57.238 --> 00:28:01.032
WOULD WAR II, IT WAS NOT A
CONCLUSION.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.460
THERE WAS ENORMOUS CONCERN WE
MIGHT NOT PREVAIL, THE ATLANTIC

00:28:05.535 --> 00:28:10.748
COAST WAS BESIEGED BY U BOATS,
THERE WAS FEAR IN THE AMERICAN

00:28:10.749 --> 00:28:15.145
PUBLIC BUT THE BATTLE OF THE
MIDWAY WAS THE TURNING POINT AND

00:28:15.146 --> 00:28:17.740
TURNED ON BRILLIANT CODE
BREAKING THAT WARNED US THE

00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:23.446
JAPANESE WERE EN ROUTE TO AMBUSH
AND FINISH US OFF AND INSTEAD WE

00:28:23.447 --> 00:28:28.455
AMBUSHED THE JAPANESE FLEET AND
WON THAT BATTLE SO THAT SIGNAL

00:28:28.547 --> 00:28:31.759
PEOPLE NEEDED TO KNOW CODE
BREAKING WAS IMPORTANT AND THE

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.750
WOMEN STARTED POURING IN AT THE
MOMENT WHEN YOU KNOW HOW

00:28:34.848 --> 00:28:38.143
IMPORTANT THIS WAS GOING TO BE.
MEANWHILE THE U.S. ARMY ALSO

00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:40.545
NEEDS TO COMPETE FOR EDUCATED
WOMEN.

00:28:41.146 --> 00:28:45.956
BECAUSE THE SET UP AT OUR ENTRY
INTO THE WAR IS THAT THE UK HAS

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:48.452
LEAD CODE BREAKING
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATLANTIC

00:28:48.453 --> 00:28:51.957
OCEAN AND THE EUROPEAN THEATER.
SO IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE

00:28:52.361 --> 00:28:54.475
IMITATION GAME YOU HEARD THE
OTHER GREAT CODE BREAKING

00:28:55.465 --> 00:28:59.278
SUCCESS WHICH IS OUR BREAKING OF
THE ENIGMA CIPHER, ENGLAND

00:28:59.573 --> 00:29:02.977
BREAKING OF THE ENIGMA CIPHER
AND THE ABILITY TO READ THE

00:29:03.273 --> 00:29:07.574
GERMAN MESSAGES THAT WERE
CONTROLLING THE U BOATS AS WELL

00:29:07.575 --> 00:29:09.900
AS MOVEMENT.
S OF THE AIR FORCE AND ARMY.

00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:13.912
WHEN WE ENTER THE WERE WAR WE
HAVE A VESTED STAKE AS WELL

00:29:14.715 --> 00:29:17.729
BECAUSE WE'RE SENDING OUR BOYS
TO THE ATLANTIC WHICH IS RIDDLED

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.634
WITH U BOATS SO WE CARE, BUT
WE'RE GOING TO BE THE JUNIOR

00:29:21.023 --> 00:29:24.329
PARTNER IN THAT CODE BREAKING
EFFORT BUT MEANWHILE WE HAVE

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:27.524
LEAD AND REALLY SOLE CODE
BREAKING RESPONSIBILITY IN THE

00:29:27.525 --> 00:29:31.626
VAST, VAST PACIFIC OCEAN.
SO THE U.S. NAVY JUST RECRUITED

00:29:31.627 --> 00:29:35.937
THE WOMEN FROM THE SEVEN SISTERS
SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE WORKING

00:29:35.938 --> 00:29:39.742
PRIMARILY JAPANESE NAVAL FLEET
CODE, WITH MAJOR CODE SYSTEM

00:29:39.943 --> 00:29:41.943
THAT IS BEING USED BY THE
JAPANESE NAVY.

00:29:42.645 --> 00:29:45.749
BUT THE JAPANESE ARMY HAD A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM AND

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.648
THEY'RE SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE
PACIFIC, THEY HAVE TAKEN THE

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.846
FILL PHILIPPINES, ISLANDS AROUND
THE PACIFIC, LAND MASSES AND

00:29:53.245 --> 00:29:55.245
AGAIN, THEY'RE COMMUNICATING
THROUGH SIGNALS.

00:29:55.571 --> 00:30:00.361
OUR U.S. ARMY HAS RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THOSE SIGNAL SIGNAL SYSTEMS 

00:30:00.362 --> 00:30:01.578
AND
THEY NEED TO RECRUIT WOMEN AS

00:30:01.579 --> 00:30:04.267
WELL SO THEY FIGURE THEY MAKE A
DIFFERENT CALCULATION.

00:30:04.996 --> 00:30:08.582
OKAY, OUR COMPETITORS IN THE
U.S. NAVY HAVE THE EASTERN SEA

00:30:08.583 --> 00:30:11.784
BOARD AND SO WE'RE GOING TO
COMPETE FOR SCHOOLTEACHERS, TURN

00:30:11.785 --> 00:30:15.311
TO TEACHING COLLEGES.
WHICH WERE THE OTHER

00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:16.910
INSTITUTIONS THAT EXISTED TO
EDUCATE WOMEN.

00:30:16.911 --> 00:30:22.215
FOR EXAMPLE, DOROTHY RAMALI I
INTERVIEWED FOR MY BOOK WAS AT

00:30:22.216 --> 00:30:24.524
INDIANA STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE
IN PENNSYLVANIA, SHE HAD GROWN

00:30:24.525 --> 00:30:29.129
UP IN RURAL PENNSYLVANIA, SHE
WANTED TO BE A MATH TEACHER,

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.126
THAT WAS A AMBITIOUS ASPIRATION
FOR A WOMAN BECAUSE WOMEN WERE

00:30:32.127 --> 00:30:35.819
NOT ENCOURAGED TO GO INTO MATH,
THEY WERE SOMETIMES NOT HIRED AS

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.220
TEACHERS BUT THAT'S WHAT SHE
WANTED TO DO, THAT WAS HER

00:30:38.521 --> 00:30:41.934
PASSION AND SHE WAS CALLED IN BY
THE DEAN OF WOMEN AND INVITED

00:30:41.935 --> 00:30:45.526
THE TAKE THE ARMY SECRET CRYPT
ANALYTIC TRAINING COURSE.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:49.441
BUT EVEN WOMEN IN TEACHERS
COLLEGES WEREN'T ENOUGH FOR THE

00:30:49.442 --> 00:30:51.651
ENORMOUS CODE BREAKING
OPERATIONS THAT WE WERE GOING TO

00:30:51.652 --> 00:30:54.960
HAVE TO ESTABLISH.
SO THE ARMY DECIDED TO ALSO GO

00:30:54.961 --> 00:30:57.451
AFTER SCHOOLTEACHERS YOUNG WOMEN
WHO WERE ACTUALLY TEACHING

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.468
SCHOOL.
THEY WERE GOING TO BE YOUNG,

00:30:59.469 --> 00:31:02.071
HARD WORKING, THEY WERE GOING TO
BE SINGLE, THEY WERE GOING TO BE

00:31:02.072 --> 00:31:04.072
WELL EDUCATE AND THEY WERE GOING
TO BE UNDERPAID.

00:31:04.386 --> 00:31:08.188
SO THEY WERE GOING TOABLE
BE

00:31:08.296 --> 00:31:10.795
EXTREMELY MOTIVATED TO TAKE
BETTER PAY WORK WITH THE WAR

00:31:10.996 --> 00:31:14.893
DEPARTMENT SO THE ARMY STRATEGY
WAS TO -- AND I LITERALLY FOUND

00:31:14.894 --> 00:31:18.392
ORAL HISTORY, WHICH COMMANDERS
CONGRATULATED THEMSELVES FOR

00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:22.193
THEIR STRATEGY, THEY WERE THINK
THINKING THAT THEY DECIDE TO

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:26.793
SEND THEIR HANDSOMEST YOUNG ARMY
OFFICERS OUT TO LURK IN HOTELS

00:31:26.794 --> 00:31:31.098
AND POST OFFICES, RECRUITING
STATIONS PARTICULARLY AROUND THE

00:31:31.099 --> 00:31:32.989
AMERICAN SOUND.
THEY WERE RECRUITING WOMEN AS

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:38.495
CIVILIANS AND THE BUREAUCRATIC
RULES CONFINE TO NORTH CAROLINA,

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:40.801
SOUTH CAROLINA WEST VIRGINIA,
THINKING WAS SOUTHERN WOMEN WERE

00:31:40.802 --> 00:31:43.802
PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE
CHARMS OF A HANDS SOME MAN AND

00:31:43.803 --> 00:31:46.409
THAT ALL THESE HARD WORKING
SMART YOUNG SCHOOLTEACHERS WOULD

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.597
BE MOTIVATED TO COME TO
WASHINGTON TO DO SECRET WAR WORK

00:31:50.598 --> 00:31:53.694
THINKING THEY WOULD MARRY A MAN
WHO LOOKED LIKE RECRUITING

00:31:54.001 --> 00:31:57.823
OFFICER.
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT SINKING ABOUT

00:31:57.824 --> 00:32:01.524
WOMEN'S MOTIVATION IS MY CENTRAL
CHARACTER WHO IS STILL ALIVE AND

00:32:01.525 --> 00:32:06.127
GOING STRONG, REPRESENTS JUST
SORT OF HOW WRONG HEADED THAT

00:32:06.128 --> 00:32:09.412
STRATEGY WAS.
LIKE MANY YOUNG AMERICAN WOMEN,

00:32:09.413 --> 00:32:14.219
SHE WAS ENGAGED BUT UNWILLINGLY
SO, HER COLLEGE BOYFRIEND SENT

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.617
HER A RING FROM TRAINING CAMP IN
CALIFORNIA, WOMEN WERE TOLL NOT

00:32:17.618 --> 00:32:21.720
TO UPSET MORALE OF THE TROOPS,
SHE DIDN'T WANT THE GET MARRIED,

00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:26.717
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY OUT OF
COLLEGE, SHE LIKED THIS GUY BUT

00:32:26.718 --> 00:32:29.118
DIDN'T ENVISION SPENDING HER
LIFE WITH HIM.

00:32:29.227 --> 00:32:32.114
SHE WANTED AND AN EXCUSE NOT TO 
HAVE

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.934
TO GET MARRIED AND GO TO THIS
TRAINING CAMP IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:32:34.935 --> 00:32:38.428
PROS SPECK OF WAR WORK IN
WASHINGTON GAVE HER AN OUT FROM

00:32:38.429 --> 00:32:43.228
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER FOUR OR
DANEED LIFE TRAJECTORY, IT GAVE

00:32:43.229 --> 00:32:45.632
HER AN EXCUSE NOT TO GO TO
CALIFORNIA.

00:32:45.842 --> 00:32:48.548
SHE WAS ALSO MOTIVATED BECAUSE
SHE WAS THE OLDEST DAUGHTER IN A

00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:53.157
FAMILY OF FOUR, SHE HAD TWO
YOUNGER BROTHERS ALREADY IN THE

00:32:53.158 --> 00:32:58.191
U.S. ARMY, ONE RIGHT OUT OF HIGH
SCHOOL, LITERALLY THE DAY HE

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.767
GRADUATED SO LICK ALL AMERICAN
FAMILY SHE IS HAD A PERSONAL

00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:02.470
INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THE
WAR.

00:33:02.471 --> 00:33:05.566
THE FAMILY WAS TYPICAL, THEY
WERE VOLUNTEERING EVERYTHING TO

00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:07.680
THE WAR EFFORT.
PEOPLE WERE DONATES POTTS AND

00:33:07.681 --> 00:33:10.081
PANS, PICKING UP RUBBER BANDS
FROM THE STREET.

00:33:10.394 --> 00:33:15.088
THE FAMILY TRIED TO DONATE THEIR
FAMILY DOGTY TRAIN TO BECOME A

00:33:15.089 --> 00:33:17.397
WAR DOG.
SHE STILL HAS A SINGLE SPACE

00:33:17.488 --> 00:33:20.597
LETTER FROM THE ARMY WAR DOG
TRAINING CENTER SAYING THANK YOU

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.695
FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION OR FOR
YOUR OFFER, WE HAVE AN AGE CAP

00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:29.295
ON OUR WAR DOGS AND SHE WAS TOO
OLD.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.217
SO SHE HAD TO STAY HOME BUT
THAT'S HOW MOTIVATED PEOPLE WERE

00:33:33.218 --> 00:33:36.443
TO JOIN THE WAR EFFORT.
SO DOT WAS ALSO IN HER FIRST

00:33:37.037 --> 00:33:39.936
YEAR OF TEACHING AT THE HIGH
SCHOOL, ALL THE MALE TEACHERS

00:33:39.937 --> 00:33:42.841
LEFT, MANY FEMALE TEACHERS HAD
LEFT TO MARRY THE MEN.

00:33:43.239 --> 00:33:46.344
SO SHE WAS TEACHING ENGLISH,
FRENCH, LATIN, PHYSICS,

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:51.450
SOMETHING CALLED HYGIENE, SHE
WAS INCREDIBLY BURDENED BY THE

00:33:51.451 --> 00:33:55.461
LOAD, SHE WAS MAKING $900 A
MONTH TEACHING SCHOOL IN

00:33:56.149 --> 00:34:01.869
CHATHAM, SHE CAME HOME THE MOM
IN LYNCHBERG AND SAID I CAN'T DO

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:06.272
THAT ANY MORE.
THERE'S RECRUITERS IN THIS HOTEL

00:34:07.256 --> 00:34:08.263
IN LYNCH BERK, SEE WHAT THEY
WANT.

00:34:08.264 --> 00:34:12.370
&gt;&gt; DO SO WHEN SHE CAME THROUGH
THE DOOR SHE DIDN'T CARE IF THE

00:34:12.371 --> 00:34:16.086
RECRUITER WAS GOOD LOOKING, SHE
KNEW IT WAS WAR WORK, IT WAS

00:34:16.481 --> 00:34:20.887
IMPORTANT, LYNCH BESTING WAS
THREE HOURS FROM D.C, SHE HAD

00:34:20.888 --> 00:34:24.477
NEVER BEEN THERE, SHE GREW UP
DURING THE DEPRESSION, NEVER

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.481
SEEN A BIG CITY, THIS IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN WAR EFFORT

00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:33.693
TO HELP HER BROTHERS AND TO MAKE
1,660-DOLLARS WORKING FOR THE

00:34:33.694 --> 00:34:36.682
WAR DEPARTMENT, ALMOST TWICE
WHAT SHE MADE AT A TEACHER.

00:34:37.081 --> 00:34:40.177
SO LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS
SOUTHERN SCHOOLTEACHERS DOT GOT

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:43.485
ON THE TRAIN ONE MORNING AND
CAME TO WASHINGTON D.C. AND

00:34:43.677 --> 00:34:46.278
FOUND HERSELF AT UNION STATION
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY IN

00:34:46.279 --> 00:34:50.292
HER POCKET BOOK AND NO IDEA WHAT
SHE HAD SIGNED UP TO DO.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:52.679
BECAUSE THIS RECRUITING
SCHOOLTEACHERS WAS TAKING PLACE

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.388
IN PUBLIC, THEY COULDN'T ETCH
TELL THE WOMEN WHAT THEY HAD

00:34:56.097 --> 00:34:59.495
SIGNED UP FOR.
SHE TOOK A CAB TO ARLINGTON,

00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:02.787
VIRGINIA AND FOUND HERSELF WHAT
HAD BEEN A JUNIOR COLLEGE AND

00:35:02.788 --> 00:35:06.294
JUNIOR COLLEGES WERE A THING
BACK THEN, THEY WERE A WAY TO

00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:09.197
GIVE WOMEN SOME EDUCATION
WITHOUT GIVING THEM TOO MUCH

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.006
EDUCATION SO THEY BASICALLY
AMENDED TO TWO YEARS OF HIGH

00:35:13.387 --> 00:35:16.694
SCHOOL, TWO OF COLLEGEND, WOMEN
GET ENGLISH MATH, SOME FRENCH,

00:35:16.695 --> 00:35:20.598
TYPING, HORSE BACK RIDING, THE
KINDS OF THINGS THAT PREPARE

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.993
THEM FOR ADULTHOOD SO ARMY
NEEDED A BIG SECURE OFF THE

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.301
BEATEN PATH COMPOUND FOR CODE
BREAKING EFFORT SO IT KICKED THE

00:35:29.302 --> 00:35:33.207
GIRLS OUT AND REQUISITIONED
ARLINGTON HALL, IT BUILDS

00:35:34.213 --> 00:35:37.194
ENORMOUS TEMPORARY BUILDINGS
WHERE THE WRITING PATHS --

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:40.695
RIDING PATHS HAD BEEN AND IT
ROUTED THESE SOUTHERN

00:35:41.709 --> 00:35:45.404
SCHOOLTEACHERS INTO THESE
MASSIVE HOT TEMPORARY BUILDINGS,

00:35:45.405 --> 00:35:48.297
THERE WAS THE FIRST DAY IN
WASHINGTON DOT HAD NO IDEA WHAT

00:35:48.298 --> 00:35:52.113
SHE WAS SIGNING UP TO DO BUT HAD
TO SIGN A LOYALTY OATH TO THE US

00:35:52.114 --> 00:35:55.195
GOVERNMENT, SIGN A SECRECY OATH
AGREEING SHE WOULD NEVER TALK

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:58.600
ABOUT IT, IT WAS WARTIME,
PENALTY FOR REVEALING TOP SECRET

00:35:58.601 --> 00:36:00.701
WORK WAS DEATH.
SO SHE KNEW THAT WHATEVER SHE

00:36:00.702 --> 00:36:03.900
WAS GOING TO BE DOING SHE WOULD
BE SHOT IF SHE TOLD ANYBODY

00:36:04.397 --> 00:36:06.397
ABOUT IT.
SO THAT WAS HER WELCOME TO

00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:08.316
WASHINGTON.
ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO CAME TO DO

00:36:08.317 --> 00:36:11.017
THIS WORK WOULD BE TOLD IF
ANYBODY ASKED THEM WHAT THEY

00:36:11.108 --> 00:36:13.405
WERE DOING IN THESE COMPOUNDS
THEY WERE TO SAY THEY WERE

00:36:14.124 --> 00:36:16.614
SECRETARIES.
THAT THEY SHARPEN PENCILS EMPTY

00:36:16.615 --> 00:36:19.752
WASTE BASKET, UNIMPORTANT WORK.
SOME SAID THEY SAT ON THE LAPS

00:36:19.753 --> 00:36:23.446
OF THEIR COMMANDING OFFICERS,
EVERYBODY BELIEVED THAT BECAUSE

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:26.255
THEY WERE WOMEN, THE WORK THEY
WERE DOING HAD TO BE TRIVIAL.

00:36:26.256 --> 00:36:30.345
SO IN THAT WAY THEY WERE THE
IDEAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS OF

00:36:30.346 --> 00:36:32.854
THE TIME BUT PEOPLE JUST ASSUMED
THAT WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING

00:36:33.054 --> 00:36:36.457
INSIDE THESE TOP SECRET
COMPOUNDS, COULDN'T BE IMPORTANT

00:36:36.458 --> 00:36:40.856
TO THE WAR EFFORT.
BUT INSTEAD, DOT JOINS

00:36:41.057 --> 00:36:43.462
CLASSROOMS SCHOOLTEACHERS WERE
HASTE HI INSTRUCTED, IN THIS

00:36:43.758 --> 00:36:47.357
CASE IN THE GEOGRAPHY OF ASIA,
THESE ARE WOMEN WHO WOULD BE

00:36:47.753 --> 00:36:51.958
RECEIVING THE MESSAGES THAT WE
INTERCEPTED FROM THE PACIFIC, WE

00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:54.862
WOULD ENCRYPT WITH OUR OWN
ENCRYPTION, SEND THEM TO

00:36:55.879 --> 00:36:59.359
ARLINGTON HALL, WE STRIP OUT THE
AMERICAN ENCRYPTION AND THEN

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:03.070
SCHOOLTEACHERS LIKE DOT WOULD
GET STARTED ON MESSAGES.  THIS

00:37:03.071 --> 00:37:06.360
IS THE ROOM DOT WOULD HAVE
WORKED IN, YOU CAN SEE ALL THESE

00:37:06.361 --> 00:37:08.689
YOUNG WOMEN WORKING AT TABLES.
SHE STILL HAS A HARD TIME

00:37:09.183 --> 00:37:13.880
BELIEVING THAT SHE HAD JOINED
WHAT WOULD BE THE THIRD OF THE

00:37:13.881 --> 00:37:16.982
THREE MOST IMPORTANT CODE
BREAKING TRIUMPHS OF WORLD WAR

00:37:16.983 --> 00:37:21.105
II.
ONE WAS BATTLE OF MIDWAY, ONE

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:24.211
WAS BREAKING ENIGMA CIPHER, THE
THIRD NOT AS MUCH ATTENTION

00:37:24.313 --> 00:37:29.916
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A DRAMATIC
MOMENT WAS RELENTLESS SINKING OF

00:37:30.804 --> 00:37:33.415
THE SHIP THAT WAS SUPPLYING THE
JAPANESE ARMY ALL AROUND THE

00:37:33.616 --> 00:37:35.421
PACIFIC.
THE JAPANESE WERE ON ISLANDS FOR

00:37:35.422 --> 00:37:38.622
THE MOST PART, THEY HAD TO BE
REGULARLY SUPPLIED WITH WATER,

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:42.722
WITH FOOD, WITH FUEL, WITH
MEDICINE, WITH SPARE AIRPLANE

00:37:42.723 --> 00:37:46.121
PARTS, WITH REINFORCEMENT
TROOPS, ALL THAT WAS BROUGHT BY

00:37:46.122 --> 00:37:49.023
SHIP, THOSE SHIPS WERE SENDING
MESSAGES EVERY DAY SAYING WHERE

00:37:49.024 --> 00:37:52.240
THEY WERE COMING FROM, WHERE
THEY WERE GOING TO, IT WAS A

00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:57.729
COMPLICATED SYSTEM CALLED AN
ENCIPHERED CODE SYSTEM, A WORLD

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:02.642
LIKE MORE ROW FOR SUPPLY SHIP IS
A FOUR DIGIT CODE GROUP, ANOTHER

00:38:02.643 --> 00:38:05.533
WOULD BE ADDED TO THAT TO CHANGE
THE NUMBERS THAT WAS AN EARLY

00:38:05.534 --> 00:38:11.754
FORM OF ENCRYPTION.
SENT MY MORSE CODE, WE SNATCH IT

00:38:11.755 --> 00:38:14.153
OUT OF THE AIR, THE
SCHOOLTEACHERS WOULD STRIP OUT

00:38:14.154 --> 00:38:18.867
THAT ENCRYPTION, STRIPPING OUT
THE EXTRANEOUS NUMBERS TO GET TO

00:38:18.868 --> 00:38:22.566
CODE GROUP AND TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT THEY MEANT.

00:38:22.958 --> 00:38:25.873
BECAUSE THEY DID IT SO WELL AND
RAPIDLY, DOT REMEMBERS RUNNING

00:38:25.874 --> 00:38:30.363
TO GET THE MESSAGES TO THE NEXT
STAGE, WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE

00:38:30.657 --> 00:38:32.580
THOUSANDS OF SUPPLY SHIPS, THE
INFORMATION THE MESSAGES WOULD

00:38:32.581 --> 00:38:36.177
BE SENT TO AMERICAN SUBMARINE
COMMANDERS WHO WOULD BE WAITING

00:38:36.178 --> 00:38:40.092
WHEN THE SHIPS APPEARED, THEY
WERE RELENTLESSLY SUNK AND THE

00:38:40.093 --> 00:38:44.589
RESULT WAS MOST JAPANESE A ARMY
DEATHS WERE RESULT OF STARVATION

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.590
AND DISEASE.
THAT'S HOW WELL THE

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.505
SCHOOLTEACHERS DID THEIR JOB.
DOT REMEMBERS SHE WOULD GET THE

00:38:50.506 --> 00:38:53.610
MESSAGE FARCE AND TAKE IT TO THE
OVERLAPPER AND SHE WAS VERY

00:38:53.904 --> 00:38:56.818
NERVOUS ABOUT SPEAKING THAT WORD
BECAUSE WOMEN WERE TOLL NEVER TO

00:38:56.819 --> 00:38:59.409
UTTER CERTAIN WORDS ON THE
STREETS OF WASHINGTON, OVERLAP

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:04.601
WAS A TERM OF ART AND IF THEY
SPOKE IT ON THE STREET SOMEBODY

00:39:04.602 --> 00:39:07.821
WOULD OVERHEAR SO WHEN I DID MY
INTERVIEW WITH HER, MANY

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:11.106
INTERVIEWS WITH HER, SHE HAD
NEVER USED THE WORD OVERLAPPER,

00:39:11.107 --> 00:39:14.808
SHE FELT UNEASY SAYING IT EVEN
NOW.

00:39:15.414 --> 00:39:18.404
WHAT SHE REMEMBERED, ONE OF MY
FAVORITE PARTS, THE OVERLAPPER

00:39:18.405 --> 00:39:21.009
WAS A WOMAN NAMED MIRIAM FROM
NEW YORK CITY.

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:23.522
BECAUSE THERE WERE WOMEN
RECRUITED FROM NORTHERN COLLEGES

00:39:23.523 --> 00:39:26.129
AS WELL.
AND DOT REMEMBERS MIRIAM BEING

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.032
THE MOST CONDESCENDING
NORTHERNER EVER MET AND I'M FROM

00:39:30.033 --> 00:39:33.026
THE SAME PART OF VIRGINIA DOT IS
SO I SOMEWHAT IDENTIFY WITH THIS

00:39:33.027 --> 00:39:37.334
PART OF THE STORY.
AND SHE RECALLED THAT MIRIAM

00:39:37.442 --> 00:39:40.634
WOULD MAKE FUN OF HER SEWN
ACCENT AND IT'S -- SOUTHERN

00:39:41.635 --> 00:39:43.834
ACCENT.
EVEN AS AMERICAN GIS WERE ALL

00:39:43.835 --> 00:39:48.939
OVER THE WORLD, AT GREAT PEARL
AN RISK TO THEIR LIVES, THEIR

00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:52.745
STAYING IN SOUTH PACIFIC AND
PARIS, THESE WOMEN WERE COMING

00:39:52.746 --> 00:39:55.234
TOGETHER AND MANY WOMEN ARE FROM
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT

00:39:55.235 --> 00:39:57.235
THEY WERE ALSO HAVING TO
FUNCTION WITH THEM IN A

00:39:57.442 --> 00:39:59.750
WORKPLACE AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT WORK BUT ALSO A

00:39:59.953 --> 00:40:02.743
GOVERNMENT WORKPLACE.
AND MIRIAM GOT ON DOT'S NERVES.

00:40:02.744 --> 00:40:06.544
BECAUSE THE WOMEN CLASHED, THEY
WERE DIFFERENT PARTS OF COUNTRY,

00:40:06.545 --> 00:40:11.153
THE NORTHERNERS SEE THE SOUTHERN
WOMEN BEING LESS WELL EDUCATED,

00:40:11.154 --> 00:40:14.755
ALSO MEN WORKING AT THE FACILITY
TOO OLD FOR FIGHTING SO THERE

00:40:14.756 --> 00:40:19.261
WERE MANY DISTINGUISHED MEN FROM
PUBLISHKING CIRCLES WHO CAME

00:40:19.453 --> 00:40:23.346
DOWN TO WORK IN THE CODE
BREAKING OPERATION AND ONE OF

00:40:23.347 --> 00:40:26.644
THEM REFERRED TO SOUTHERN WOMEN
AS JEWELS BECAUSE HE FELT SO

00:40:26.847 --> 00:40:30.612
MANY SOUTHERN WOMEN WERE NAMED O
PAL OR PEARL OR RUBY OR EMERALD.

00:40:30.613 --> 00:40:33.093
I HAVE TO A MITT WHEN I WENT
THROUGH THE ROSTERS A T THE

00:40:33.586 --> 00:40:36.388
ARCHIVES THERE WERE A LOT OF
WOMEN NAMED RUBY AND EMERALD AND

00:40:36.389 --> 00:40:42.193
PEARL AND THEY WERE JEWELS, ONE
WOMAN I INTERVIEWED FOR THIS

00:40:42.788 --> 00:40:46.984
BOOKER, JEWEL FROM SOUTH
CAROLINA WAS A GRADUATE OF

00:40:47.012 --> 00:40:49.100
WINTHROP COLLEGE IN SOUTH
CAROLINA; SHE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL

00:40:49.101 --> 00:40:52.701
BAND DIRECTOR WHEN RECRUITED AND
MUSICAL TALENT IS A MARK FOR

00:40:53.099 --> 00:40:56.717
CODE BREAKING ABILITY BECAUSE IT
HAS THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW

00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:59.507
PATTERNS SO I HAVE TO GRANT
THERE WERE A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:40:59.515 --> 00:41:01.515
SOUTHERN WOMEN WHO HAD JEWEL
LIKE NAMES.

00:41:01.644 --> 00:41:04.439
I LOVE THIS PHOTO BECAUSE THE
WOMEN THAT YOU SEE LAUGHING DOWN

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.631
AT HER WORK SITTING NEXT TO THE
DEAD PLANT, SHE HAS BEEN

00:41:10.129 --> 00:41:14.655
RECRUITED ADS ENGLISH MAJOR FROM
A COLLEGE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK

00:41:14.933 --> 00:41:19.541
AND SHE WORKING WITH A WEST
VIRGINIA SCHOOLTEACHER NAMED

00:41:20.641 --> 00:41:23.747
WILMA, THEY BROKE A SEPARATE
CODE SYSTEM THAT APPENDED EVERY

00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:27.138
JAPANESE ARMY MESSAGE, IT WAS
THE ADDRESS OF WHERE IT WAS

00:41:27.741 --> 00:41:31.144
COMING TO, AND WHERE IT WAS
DESTINED FOR THE PERSON SENDING

00:41:31.145 --> 00:41:33.945
IT, THE RANK OF THE PERSON
SENDING IT, THE PERSON RECEIVING

00:41:33.946 --> 00:41:38.456
IT, THE RANK OF THAT PERSON.
VAST AM OF USEFUL INFORMATION

00:41:38.457 --> 00:41:42.061
FOR OUR MILITARY TO HAVE BECAUSE
WE WANT KNOW WHERE JAPANESE ARE,

00:41:42.062 --> 00:41:45.070
WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO, WHO
THEY'RE COMMUNICATING WITH,

00:41:45.478 --> 00:41:48.766
FLURRY OF MESSAGES, MAYBE
SOMETHING IS BEING PLANNED, SO

00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:51.872
THANKS TO THEIR BREAKING OF THAT
PARTICULAR MESSAGE SYSTEM, WE

00:41:51.873 --> 00:41:54.771
WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE
PENTAGON EVERY DAY WITH

00:41:55.167 --> 00:41:59.704
SOMETHING CALLED ORDER OF BALLET
THAT SHOWED

00:41:59.998 --> 00:42:05.098
BATTLE, WHERE NEW MESSAGES WERE
BEING SENT TO SO INCREDIBLY

00:42:05.604 --> 00:42:08.507
IMPORTANT INTELLIGENCE, THE
WOMEN WAS GENERATING

00:42:09.098 --> 00:42:12.092
INTELLIGENCE, THE PENTAGON WAS
BREATHING DOWN THEIR NECK TO GET

00:42:12.093 --> 00:42:15.752
THIS REPORT EVERY DAY.
TO GIVE A SENSE HOW MANY CODE

00:42:15.975 --> 00:42:17.988
ENSYVER SYSTEMS WERE IN PLAY,
THE JANUARY NEEDS DIP MATS

00:42:18.487 --> 00:42:25.382
STATIONED IN EUROPE IN ALL THE
OCCUPIED COUNTRIES ALL THE THE 

00:42:25.383 --> 00:42:27.580
AXIS
COUNTRIES, THEY WERE TALKING TO

00:42:27.581 --> 00:42:33.196
TOKYO IN A -- IT WAS A SCREEN
ROMANIZED JAPANESE INTO UN

00:42:33.792 --> 00:42:35.878
UNINTELLIGIBLE GIBBERISH, WE HAD
BROKEN THAT MACHINE SYSTEM

00:42:36.282 --> 00:42:40.593
BEFORE THE WAR THANKS TO A WOMAN
NAMED JENEVIEVE, WE WERE READING

00:42:40.594 --> 00:42:43.588
ALL THOSE COMMUNICATIONS ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT BITS WE GOT

00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:46.888
FROM THE JAPANESE DIP MATS ABOUT
EUROPE WAS WHEN THEY WERE

00:42:47.282 --> 00:42:51.083
INVITED TO TOUR THE COAST OF
FRANCE, BEFORE D DAY, THEY WERE

00:42:51.084 --> 00:42:53.989
DUTIFULLY REPORTED BACK TO TOKYO
WHERE THE COST OF FRANCE WAS

00:42:54.985 --> 00:42:57.294
FORTIFIED AND WHERE IT WASN'T SO
WE KNEW WHEN WE WERE PLANNING

00:42:57.295 --> 00:43:02.502
THE ALLIED LANDING THAT NORMANDY
WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE TO LAND

00:43:02.787 --> 00:43:06.298
THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE FRENCH
CODE SO THAT'S THE INFORMATION

00:43:06.299 --> 00:43:08.299
WE WERE GETTING FROM THE CODE
BREAKING OPERATIONS.

00:43:08.703 --> 00:43:10.802
THIS GIVES YOU SENSE OF THE
NUMBER OF WOMEN DOING THIS WORK.

00:43:10.803 --> 00:43:13.803
THERE WAS ALSO AN AFRICAN
AMERICAN CODE BREAKING UNIT AT

00:43:13.804 --> 00:43:17.013
ARLINGTON HALL, THE U.S. ARMY
WAS SEGREGATED DURING THE WORLD

00:43:17.014 --> 00:43:21.302
WAR II SO THE CODE BREAKING
OPERATION WAS SEGREGATED AS

00:43:21.507 --> 00:43:24.905
WELL, THIS WAS A SECRET UNIT, A
LOT OF WHITE WORKERS DIDN'T KNOW

00:43:24.906 --> 00:43:29.216
ABOUT IT BUT THIS GROUP OF WELL
EDUCATED VERY DEDICATED PROBABLY

00:43:29.217 --> 00:43:33.201
FORMER SCHOOLTEACHERS WHO ATTAIN
THEIR EDUCATION IN A SEGREGATED

00:43:33.202 --> 00:43:37.510
U.S. EDUCATION SYSTEM, LENDING
THEIR TALENTS TO BREAKING THE

00:43:37.511 --> 00:43:40.502
CODES AND CIPHERS OF THE PRIVATE
SECTOR.

00:43:41.112 --> 00:43:43.614
SO JUST AS BANKS AND COMPANIES
ENCRYPT FINANCIAL COMMUNICATION

00:43:43.615 --> 00:43:46.123
WHEN THEY SEND IT OVER THE
INTERNET, SO TOO WHEN ARE THEY

00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:49.663
DOING THAT BACK THEN, THIS YOU
WANTIA WAS READING THE CODES AND

00:43:49.664 --> 00:43:52.566
CIPHERS OF BANKS AND COMPANIES
TO SEE WHO WAS DOING BUSINESS

00:43:52.567 --> 00:43:56.075
WITH HITLER, WHO WAS DOING
BUSINESS WITH JAPANESE COMPANIES

00:43:56.076 --> 00:43:58.573
LIKES MITSUBISHI, BECAUSE THEY
WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

00:43:58.979 --> 00:44:01.523
THAT SO THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT
WORK AND VERY UNSUNG UNIT.

00:44:02.965 --> 00:44:07.165
THEY WERE ALSO DOING EARLY CYBER
SECURITY LOOKING FOR IS TO MAKE

00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:11.615
SURE OUR EPICRIPPED TRAFFIC THAT
WE WERE -- P ENCRYPTED TRAFFIC

00:44:11.616 --> 00:44:14.635
WAS MORE SKEWER THAN THE CODE.
SUBPOENAS WE WERE READING.

00:44:14.951 --> 00:44:18.255
ALSO PLANNING DECEPTION PROGRAMS
CALLED DUMB MY TRAFFIC TO

00:44:18.456 --> 00:44:21.548
PERSUADE THE ENEMY BECAUSE OF
THE THE SIGNALS WE WERE SENDING

00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:24.763
PERSUADE THE ENEMY WE HAD
STATIONS WHERE NONE EXISTED.

00:44:25.259 --> 00:44:32.359
BEFORE THE D DAY LANDINGS, THIS
DUMMY TRAFFIC PERSUADED GERMANS

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:36.963
THE ALLYIED TROOPS WAS GOING TO
LAND IN CAAY.

00:44:38.081 --> 00:44:40.689
SO MEANTIME THIS IS THE TIPPING
POINT, REALLY FIRST MAJOR

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.679
EXPERIMENT WITH ADMITTING WOMEN
INTO THE MILITARY AND THE

00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:48.078
DECISION WAS MADE IN 1942 TO
ADMIT WOMEN INTO THE ARMY, AND

00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:50.786
ALSO TO ADMIT WOMEN INTO THE
NAVY, IT WAS A HARD FOUGHT

00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:54.684
BATTLE, MANY DEANS AND PROFESSOR
AS T THE WOMEN COLLEGES REALLY

00:44:54.685 --> 00:44:58.691
PRESSED THE NAVY TO ADMIT YOUNG
WOMEN, THEY SAW THIS AS A

00:44:58.985 --> 00:45:00.985
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR

00:45:01.282 --> 00:45:03.790
GRADUATES, SO THE WOMEN WHO CAME
TO WASHINGTON YOU SAW THEM IN

00:45:03.791 --> 00:45:08.643
THIS REALLY -- FRILLY DRESSES AT
THE BEGINNING, THEY ALLOT ITALY

00:45:09.094 --> 00:45:12.381
-- THEY WANTED FEMALE CODE
BREAKERS TO BE SUBJECT TO

00:45:12.683 --> 00:45:15.083
MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND
HIERARCHY SO THEY WERE TRAINED

00:45:15.084 --> 00:45:18.002
TO BECOME NAVAL OFFICERS.
SO YOU CAN SEE THEM HERE,

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.108
ACTUALLY CROSSING NEBRASKA
AVENUE, THE NAVY ALSO GAVE MORE

00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:27.002
SPACE THAN IT HAD DOWNTOWN SO IT
COMMANDEERED SEMINARY ON

00:45:27.499 --> 00:45:29.606
NEBRASKA AVENUE WHERE DEPARTMENT
OF HOMELAND SECURITY IS NOW.

00:45:30.232 --> 00:45:34.520
KICKED THOSE GIRLS OUT, THE
GIRLS HAD TO TAKE CLASSES AT A

00:45:34.521 --> 00:45:36.718
DEPARTMENT STORE WHILE FINDING A
PLACE TO STUDY.

00:45:37.315 --> 00:45:39.515
THEY SET UP A MASSIVE CODE
BREAKING OPERATION, THE WOMEN

00:45:39.516 --> 00:45:43.930
WERE HELD IN BARRACKS NEAR
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY YOU CAN SEE

00:45:43.931 --> 00:45:46.848
THEM CROSSING THE STREET.
THIS IS A GREAT MOMENT FOR WOMEN

00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:50.152
TO JOIN MILITARY, ALSO A MOMENT
WHEN WOMEN WHO DIDN'T HAVE

00:45:50.343 --> 00:45:55.048
COLLEGE EDUCATION COULD ENLIST
AS ORDINARY SEAMEN, WHEN THEY

00:45:55.049 --> 00:45:59.648
TOOK THE APTITUDE TESTS IF
TESTED HIGH FOR ABILITY AND THE

00:45:59.649 --> 00:46:02.454
RIGHT INTELLECTUAL SKILLS LIKE
MATH AND LANGUAGE, THEY WOULD BE

00:46:02.455 --> 00:46:05.346
SECRETLY ROUTED TO THE CODE
BREAKING OPERATION SO THIS WAS A

00:46:05.347 --> 00:46:08.352
GREAT COMING TOGETHER OF WOMEN
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, WOMEN

00:46:08.353 --> 00:46:14.346
FROM COLORADO, NAVY LOOKING FOR
LIBRARIAN, PEOPLE WHO KNEW HOW

00:46:14.347 --> 00:46:17.352
TO KEEP GREAT RECORDS, THEY CAME
FROM COLORADO, OKLAHOMA,

00:46:18.354 --> 00:46:21.666
CALIFORNIA, THEY GOT ON TRAINS
AND TRAVELED FOR DAYS, WENT TO

00:46:21.667 --> 00:46:24.251
BOOT CAMP AND OFFICER TRAINING
CAMP AND THEY CAME TOGETHER

00:46:24.455 --> 00:46:27.258
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WORKING AT
THESE COMPOUNDS, ONE OF MY

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.163
FAVORITE ANECDOTES ABOUT COMING
TOGETHER OF THESE WOMEN, ONE

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:34.659
WOMAN I INTERVIEWED FOR THIS
BOOK, JANE KATE ACTUALLY CAME

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.960
FROM AFFLUENT FAMILY IN NEW YORK
CITY, SHE GREW UP IN AUBURN, NEW

00:46:38.961 --> 00:46:42.661
YORK AND ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE
OF THE NEW YORK CITY, A VERY

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.965
SORT OF DEBUTANTE KIND OF
SOCIETY SHE WAS EXPECTING TO

00:46:46.373 --> 00:46:51.367
HAVE TO BE PART OF.
WHEN THE WAR STARTED SHE WANTED

00:46:51.368 --> 00:46:54.076
TO DO WHAT SHE COULD.
SHE DESPERATELY WANTEDDED TO

00:46:54.182 --> 00:46:57.185
ENLIST IN THE U.S. NAVY, HER
PARENTS DIDN'T WANT HER TO,

00:46:57.186 --> 00:46:59.197
THERE WAS STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH
THESE WOMEN, THEY WERE

00:46:59.599 --> 00:47:02.488
CONSIDERED TO BE BAD WOMEN,
THERE WERE WHISPER CAMPAIGNS

00:47:02.983 --> 00:47:06.198
AGAINST THEM, THINKING WAS THEY
WERE PUT IN THE MILITARY TO

00:47:06.587 --> 00:47:09.188
SERVICE THE MEN SEXUALLY SO SOME
PARENTS DIDN'T WANT DAUGHTER

00:47:10.904 --> 00:47:13.575
JOINING UP BUT SHE WAS
DETERMINED SO SHE TO BE THE

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:17.393
SUBWAY TO WALL STREET WHERE
THERE WAS A RECRUITING STATION,

00:47:17.394 --> 00:47:20.507
SHE EXPECTED TO GO IN AS OFFICER
BECAUSE SHE CAME FROM UPPER

00:47:20.611 --> 00:47:23.701
CLASS FAMILY AND SHE KNEW SHE
HAD TO PASS AN EYE EXAM SO SHE

00:47:23.702 --> 00:47:25.702
-- SHE WAS VERY, VERY
NEARSIGHTED.

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:30.208
SHE MEMORIZED THE EYE CHART IN
ORDER TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE EYE

00:47:30.209 --> 00:47:32.797
EXAM, SHE SLIPPED THE SPECTACLES
IN IN HER POCKET.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:35.120
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE GOING
TO BE OTHER MEDICAL STATIONS

00:47:35.727 --> 00:47:38.115
INCLUDING A GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM
WHICH WAS A SHOCK FOR A LOT OF

00:47:38.116 --> 00:47:41.229
THE WOMEN.
BUT THERE WAS ALSO A PHYSICAL

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:44.832
EXAM AND MEN AT THE TIME WERE
FORCED TO UNDERGO A GROUP NAKED

00:47:44.833 --> 00:47:51.728
PHYSICAL TO JOIN THE NAVY.
THE NAVY WAS TRY TO FIGURE OUT

00:47:51.729 --> 00:47:58.442
IF THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME FOR
WOMEN AS MEN SO THEY HAD A GROUP

00:47:58.443 --> 00:48:03.334
-- JANE REMEMBERS THE SHOCK AT
BEING TOLL TO DISROBE.

00:48:03.833 --> 00:48:08.031
THE PETTY OFFICER PUT A NINE ON
HER BREAST AND SHE SAID GO STAND

00:48:08.032 --> 00:48:12.152
NEXT TO 8 AND 10.
BECAUSE SHE WAS SO NEAR

00:48:12.557 --> 00:48:16.055
SIGHINGED WED HAD TO REALLY PEER
IN ORDER TO FIGURE WHERE SHE WAS

00:48:16.056 --> 00:48:18.645
SUPPOSED TO STAND SO SHE
REMEMBERS THAT FONDLY.

00:48:19.166 --> 00:48:21.166
AND SORT OF YOU'RE IN THE NAVY
NOW.

00:48:22.278 --> 00:48:25.477
AND THIS WAS SOMETHING QUITE
DIFFERENT THAN THE DEBUTANTE

00:48:25.678 --> 00:48:28.168
SOCIETY SHE WAS RAIDED TO.
WHEN SHE -- SHE ALSO FOUND THAT

00:48:28.169 --> 00:48:31.684
SHE HAD GONE TO MUSIC SCHOOL
AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH

00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:34.771
SCHOOL, THE NAVY DIDN'T CONSIDER
THAT EQUIVALENT OF TWO YEARS OF

00:48:34.772 --> 00:48:37.785
COLLEGE SO SHE WENT IN AS
ORDINARY SEAMAN, SHE WENT ADS

00:48:37.983 --> 00:48:40.772
ENLISTED WOMAN AND BECAUSE OF
HER ABILITY WITH MATH, HER DAD

00:48:40.773 --> 00:48:45.178
WAS A PHYSICIST AND BECAUSE OF
HER CHOP SHE WAS ROUTED TO THE

00:48:45.179 --> 00:48:47.673
CODE BREAKING OPERATION AS WELL
ANDS LOVED I.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.214
HER FIRST -- LOVED IT.
HER ROOMMATE WAS FROM THE

00:48:52.511 --> 00:48:57.813
MIDWEST AND SO THAT WAS JANE'S
INTRODUCTION TO OTHER AMERICAN

00:48:57.814 --> 00:49:00.805
DECORATING SCHEMES SHE HAD NOT
GROWN UP WITH.

00:49:01.214 --> 00:49:05.923
SO THE NAVY WOMEN WORKED AT THIS
HUGE COMPOUND, I FOUND THESE

00:49:06.308 --> 00:49:09.013
PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE NATIONAL
ARCHIVES, JUST SWIMMING AROUND

00:49:09.014 --> 00:49:12.226
AND FILES YOU CAN SEE I HAD TO
GET IT DECLASSIFIED BUT

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.671
WONDERFUL PHOTO TOES OF THE
ENTERER -- PHOTOS OF THE

00:49:16.063 --> 00:49:17.636
INTERIOR OF THE CODE BREAKING
JUNE.

00:49:17.637 --> 00:49:20.505
THEY HAVE WORKING THE JAPANESE
NAVAL FLEET CODE.

00:49:20.705 --> 00:49:26.906
YOU CAN SEE MASSIVE SETS OF
JAPANESE MESSAGES JANE REMEMBERS

00:49:26.907 --> 00:49:30.207
WE CAN TELL WHAT WAS HAPPENING
IN THE PACIFIC BECAUSE THE STAFF

00:49:30.208 --> 00:49:32.428
WOULD GET LARGER.
THEY HAD THE PUSH THEM ALONG AS

00:49:32.429 --> 00:49:35.650
FAST AS THEY CAN.
THEY HAD TO STRIP OUT NUMERICAL

00:49:35.651 --> 00:49:39.456
AND CIPHER CALLED ADDITIVES TO
GET TO TO THE CODE GROUPS.

00:49:39.867 --> 00:49:42.559
THEY WERE UNDER INCREDIBLE
PRESSURE, THEY WERE SOMETIMES

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.958
BREAKS MESSAGES THAT TOLD
LOCATION AND WHEREABOUTS OF

00:49:48.456 --> 00:49:50.456
BROTHERS AND BOYFRIENDS SHIPS
THEY KNEW THE STATION.

00:49:51.365 --> 00:49:55.070
I STAKES.
I FOUND MEMOS WHICH OFFICERS

00:49:55.274 --> 00:49:58.682
WOULD SAY Y'ALL RECOVERED 2,000
ADDITIVES LAST MONTH WE NEED

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.486
MORE THIS MONTH.
WE'RE PLANNING TO PUSH BACK

00:50:01.676 --> 00:50:04.574
ACROSS THE PACIFIC, WE WANT TO
RETAKE THE PHILIPPINE, THIS WORK

00:50:04.575 --> 00:50:07.175
IS INC ABLY IMPORTANT.
WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE ENEMY

00:50:07.176 --> 00:50:09.582
IS.
SO WE NEED YOU ALL TO WORK

00:50:09.788 --> 00:50:14.280
HARDER AND FASTER AND I SEE MEMO
CONGRATULATING THEM FOR MEETING

00:50:14.281 --> 00:50:16.972
THE QUOTA AND EXCEEDING IT.
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE WORK

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:20.656
SHEETS THE JAPANESE NAVAL FLEET
CODE WAS A FIVE DIGIT ENSYVERRED

00:50:20.659 --> 00:50:22.659
CODE SYSTEM.
I LOVE THESE WORK SHEETS,

00:50:22.683 --> 00:50:25.379
THEY'RE SWIMMING IN FILES NOR
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES BUT THEY

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.880
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE BRAIN
WORK THE WOMEN HAD THE DO TO

00:50:29.578 --> 00:50:31.783
RECOVER THESE ADDITIVES.
I ALSO THIS TABLE, AGAIN IT

00:50:31.784 --> 00:50:35.086
SHOWS YOU HOW MANY DIFFERENT
CODE SYSTEMS THERE WERE, THIS

00:50:35.087 --> 00:50:38.390
WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
SYSTEM, IT WAS A LESSER SYSTEM,

00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:43.084
THAT THE JAPANESE NAVY AD HOC
SYSTEM, THEY SET UP, COMPLETELY

00:50:43.085 --> 00:50:45.085
DIFFERENT, IT WAS LETTER, NOT
NUMBERS.

00:50:45.117 --> 00:50:48.513
THERE WAS A GROUP OF WOMEN FROM
WELLSLY WHO WERE ASSIGNED TO

00:50:49.108 --> 00:50:52.216
WORK THE INTERISLAND CIPHER, IT
HAD A KEY THAT CHANGE EVERY

00:50:52.417 --> 00:50:56.913
MONTH AND THEY HAD TO BREAK THAT
INTO THE SYSTEM, THEY HAD TO

00:50:57.319 --> 00:51:00.914
DETERMINE THE NEW KEY THAT WAS
BEING USED, TO THE CONTROL THE

00:51:00.915 --> 00:51:07.013
SYSTEM EVERY MONTH.
AND THEY GOT SO GOOD AT THAT, I

00:51:07.014 --> 00:51:11.209
GOT RECORDS HOW GOOD THEY WERE,
THEY CAN WORK HARD FOUR OR FIVE

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:13.210
DAY AND GO AUTO PILOT THE REST
OF THE MONTH.

00:51:13.419 --> 00:51:16.627
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THESE WOMEN
WERE LIVING UNCHAPERONED FOR THE

00:51:16.628 --> 00:51:19.414
FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF ALCOHOL IN

00:51:19.415 --> 00:51:22.632
WASHINGTON DURING THE WORLD WAR
II AND IF THE WOMEN WERE NAVAL

00:51:22.633 --> 00:51:25.920
OFFICERS THEY COULD LIVE IF
GROUP HOUSE, NOT BARRACKS SO

00:51:25.921 --> 00:51:29.125
THEY COULD HAVE PARTIES AND THE
WOMEN HAD BIG BLOW OUTS.

00:51:29.526 --> 00:51:32.323
I FOUND AN ORAL HISTORY OF THEIR
COMMANDING OFFICER WHO VERY MUCH

00:51:32.324 --> 00:51:36.529
ADMIRED THEIR INTELLIGENCE BUT
ALSO ADMIRED THEIR PARTYING

00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:38.831
SPIRITS.
HE REMEMBERED ONE OF THE

00:51:39.141 --> 00:51:42.440
MATHEMATICIANS IN PARTICULAR A
MATH MAJOR COME AND ASK WHEN SHE

00:51:42.441 --> 00:51:46.845
COULD HAVE HER NEXT BIG PARTY,
HE WOULD LOOK AT THE MAP AND SAY

00:51:46.846 --> 00:51:50.544
THE KEY WILL CHANGE THE X DAY OF
THE MONTH, YOU CAN HAVE THE

00:51:50.838 --> 00:51:53.240
PARTY TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT
BECAUSE YOU CAN RECOVER FROM

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.050
HANG OVERS FOR TWO WEEKS BEFORE
YOU APPLY INTELLECT.

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:59.655
BUT A SENSE OF THE STATION IN
APRIL OF 1942 WE RECEIVED

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.953
MESSAGES IN THE PACIFIC SAYING
ADMIRAL YAMOMOMOTO WHO COMMANDED

00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:06.657
THE JAPANESE FLEET AND MASTER
MIND OF PEARL HARBOR WOULD BE

00:52:06.658 --> 00:52:10.755
MAKING INSPECTION TOWARD THE SOL
MAN ISLANDS, THE CIPHER WAS PART

00:52:10.756 --> 00:52:13.970
OF THIS SET OF COMMUNICATIONS.
MANY IN THE PACIFIC, AMERICAN

00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:17.372
MEN IN THE PACIFIC GOT PIZZA ON
THE FLEET CODE MESSAGES, THESE

00:52:17.373 --> 00:52:21.475
WOMEN GOT BUSY ON THE
INTERISLAND CIPHER, PUT EXACT

00:52:21.476 --> 00:52:26.461
SIGH TEN RARE DOWN TO THE MINUTE
SO WE COULD SEND PLANES UP AND

00:52:26.462 --> 00:52:30.362
SHOOT HIM AND MADE THE DECISION
TO ASSASSINATE AN ENEMY

00:52:30.679 --> 00:52:32.677
COMMANDER AND THE WOMEN
REMEMBERING THAT CHEERING WENT

00:52:32.678 --> 00:52:35.282
UP IN THE NAVAL CODE BREAKING
COMPOUND WHEN THEY KNEW THE

00:52:35.481 --> 00:52:37.585
PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN.
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND THE

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.781
JAPANESE COULDN'T KNOW THAT IT
HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF CODE

00:52:39.782 --> 00:52:43.279
BREAKING BUT THE WOMEN KNEW.
IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO POINT

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.680
OUT THEY FELT GREAT SATISFACTION
AT THE TIME WHEN THEY NEEDED

00:52:46.994 --> 00:52:50.488
THEIR WORK HAD CONTRIBUTED TO
THE SINKING OF A CONVOY OR FLEET

00:52:50.489 --> 00:52:53.797
OR TO THE DOWNING OF AN
IMPORTANT AIRPLANE.

00:52:54.009 --> 00:52:57.882
IT WAS WAR, WE WANTED TO WIN IT.
THEY DIDN'T RENEW LIVES WERE AT

00:52:57.883 --> 00:53:00.784
STAKE, BROTHERS AND BOYFRIEND,
THEY KNEW AMERICA WAS AT STAKE

00:53:00.785 --> 00:53:06.180
AND FREEDOM SO THEY WANTED TO
WIN AND WANTED TO DO WHAT HAD TO

00:53:06.181 --> 00:53:08.813
BE DONE.
LATER IN LIVES THEY WOULD HAVE

00:53:08.814 --> 00:53:11.223
MORE COMPLEX FEELINGS ABOUT THE
LETHAL WORK THAT THEY WERE PART

00:53:11.224 --> 00:53:13.123
OF.
BUT AT THE TIME THERE WERE NO

00:53:13.124 --> 00:53:17.033
SECOND THOUGHTS.
SO JUST TO QUICKLY POINT OUT, WE

00:53:17.034 --> 00:53:20.731
EVENTUALLY BECAME THE SENIOR
PARTNER IN THE BREAKING OF THE

00:53:20.732 --> 00:53:24.541
ENIGMA CIPHER THAT WAS USING TO
COMMAND U BOATS.

00:53:24.853 --> 00:53:27.843
THE GERMANS SUSPECTED THAT WE
WERE READING THEIR CODE SYSTEM,

00:53:27.844 --> 00:53:31.642
THEY CHANGED THE MACHINE THAT
WAS BEING USED BY THE U BOATS,

00:53:31.643 --> 00:53:36.540
ADDED AN EXTRA ROTOR THAT
SCRAMBLED THE MESSAGES MORE THAN

00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:40.855
BEFORE SO THE AMERICAN
INDUSTRIAL RESOURCES HAD TO GET

00:53:40.856 --> 00:53:45.865
INVOLVED TO BUILD THESE GIANT
MACHINES THAT COULD HANDLE A

00:53:46.255 --> 00:53:50.360
FOUR ROTOR MACHINE, THE OLE ONE
WAS THREE ROTORS AND WE NEEDED

00:53:50.361 --> 00:53:53.364
MORE HEAVY DUTY FASTER MACHINES
SO THE AMERICANS DESIGNED AND

00:53:53.365 --> 00:53:56.069
BUILT THESE MACHINES THAT WERE
SECRETLY TRANSPORTED AGAIN TO

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:58.070
THE NAVAL CODE BREAKING
COMPOUND.

00:53:58.193 --> 00:54:02.603
FOR ME ONE OF THE MOST MOVING
AND REALLY WOMEN WORKING THE

00:54:03.197 --> 00:54:06.389
GERMAN ENIGMA CIPHER SYSTEM AND
IT INVOLVED MATH, DESIGNING

00:54:06.693 --> 00:54:09.591
EARLY COMPUTER MENUS IN ORDER TO
BREAK INTO THOSE MESSAGES.

00:54:10.511 --> 00:54:13.209
ONE OF THE MOVING CHAPTERS TO ME
OF THE BOOK IS WHEN THE WOMEN

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:18.312
JOINED THE MIDNIGHT WATCH ON THE
NIGHT OF JUNE 6, EARLY MORNING

00:54:18.313 --> 00:54:21.917
JUNE 5 AND INTO JUNE 6.
THEY KNEW THE LANDINGS WERE

00:54:22.126 --> 00:54:25.615
GOING TO P HA, THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN, IT WAS A FULL MOON, THEY

00:54:25.616 --> 00:54:28.824
ASSUMED THAT WAS NOT IDEAL FOR A
SECRET ALLIED LANDING SO THEY

00:54:28.825 --> 00:54:30.825
THOUGHT IT WASN'T GOING THE
HAPPEN ON THE 6TH.

00:54:31.326 --> 00:54:33.727
BUT THEY REMEMBER THAT ABOUT
1:30 IN THE MORNING OUR TIME

00:54:34.039 --> 00:54:36.733
THEY STARTED GETTING MESSAGES
THE MACHINES STARTED SPINNING.

00:54:36.734 --> 00:54:40.632
THE GERMANS STARTED CHATTERING
AND THEY WERE EXPERIENCING THESE

00:54:40.633 --> 00:54:43.130
WOMEN WERE EXPERIENCE 
EXPERIENCINGS THE D

00:54:43.226 --> 00:54:47.528
DAY LANDINGS FROM THE GERMANS
AND THE FIRST MESSAGES WERE

00:54:47.933 --> 00:54:51.130
GERMAN OFFICERS SAYING SEEING
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

00:54:51.837 --> 00:54:54.738
ALLIED SHIP ONS HORIZON SAYING
MY GOD THE LANDING IS HAPPENING

00:54:54.739 --> 00:54:59.553
AND IT'S HAPPENING IN NORMANDY.
SO THE WOMEN REMEMBERED WORK

00:55:00.059 --> 00:55:03.564
FAST AS THEY COULD TO BREAK THE
GERMAN MESSAGES SO I WERE THAT

00:55:03.565 --> 00:55:08.651
IN THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCE OF --
COMMUNICATING WHAT WAS GOING ON

00:55:08.652 --> 00:55:11.955
SO THE KNEW THE LANDINGS WERE
HAPPENING, THEY HAD BROTHER AND

00:55:11.956 --> 00:55:14.668
BOYFRIENDS MAKING THE LANDING.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS

00:55:15.282 --> 00:55:17.866
GOING, THEY COULDN'T TELL FROM
THE GERMAN MESSAGE, EVERYTHING

00:55:17.867 --> 00:55:23.410
ABOUT THE D DAY INVASION SO THEY
WERE OVERWHELMEDDED BY THE E

00:55:23.703 --> 00:55:26.727
NORTY OF WHAT THEY WERE PART OF.
AT THE END OF THE SHIFT THEY

00:55:26.827 --> 00:55:30.238
REMEMBER TAKING THE BUS TO
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL AND GOING TO

00:55:30.239 --> 00:55:34.727
SAINT AL BANS CHAPEL OPEN 24/7
DURING THE WAR AND PRAYING

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:38.024
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THE OUTCOME WAS, THEY DIDN'T

00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:40.927
KNOW HOW MANY LIVES WERE LOST
AND A NUMBER HAD IN FACT LOST

00:55:40.928 --> 00:55:43.828
THEIR FIANCES IN THE INVASION,
THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT YET BECAUSE

00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:49.130
THEY HADN'T GOTTEN THE TELEGRAM.
HERE IS MY TOES OF CENTRAL

00:55:49.532 --> 00:55:53.526
CHARACTER, DOT AT THE POLL, THEY
WERE DOING SERIOUS URGENT

00:55:53.728 --> 00:55:57.726
STRESSFUL WORK THEY WERE HAVING
A GOOD TIME IN WASHINGTON

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:02.028
WRITING LOTS OF MEN MY CENTRAL
CHARGE WAS WRITING HALF A DOZEN

00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:05.631
MEN, SHE WAS SOME WAYS MORE
RELUCTANT TO CONFESS THAT TO ME

00:56:05.632 --> 00:56:07.946
THAN TALKING ABOUT THE SECRET
CODE BREAKING WORK.

00:56:08.563 --> 00:56:11.262
SHE DISENTANGLED HERSELF FROM
ENGAGEMENT AND MARRIED ONE OF

00:56:11.263 --> 00:56:16.456
THE MEN THAT SHE WAS WRITING
TOO, HAD A VERY HAPPY MARRIAGE,

00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:19.064
BECAME BEST FRIENDS WITH A
SCHOOLTEACHER FROM MISSISSIPPI,

00:56:19.065 --> 00:56:23.572
RUTH, AN INCREDIBLE
MATHEMATICIAN, WHO WENT TO WORK

00:56:23.573 --> 00:56:26.384
FOR THE NSA.
THE WOMEN REMAINED BEST FRIENDS

00:56:26.385 --> 00:56:29.287
FOR THEIR LIVES UM YOU CAN SEE
THEM WITH THEIR HUSBANDS.

00:56:29.371 --> 00:56:31.169
THEY WERE SUCH CLOSE FRIENDS
AFTER THE WAR THEY COULD NEVER

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:34.180
TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT CODE
BREAKING WORK, THEY DIDN'T EVEN

00:56:34.181 --> 00:56:38.084
KNOW THEY WERE PART OF THE SAME
CODE BREAKING EFFORT TO BREAK

00:56:38.085 --> 00:56:40.689
THE SUPPLY SHIPS.
THEY WERE TERRIFIED OF TALKING

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:43.091
ABOUT THEIR WORK EITHER BEFORE
OR AFTER THE WAR.

00:56:43.588 --> 00:56:47.188
ALL THESE WOMEN WERE TOLD AT END
OF THE WAR THANKS FOR YOUR

00:56:47.901 --> 00:56:50.089
EFFORTS, YOU U SAVED THOUSANDS
OF LIVES YOU SHORTENED THE WAR

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:52.091
BY A YEAR, NOW NEVER TELL
ANYBODY WHAT YOU DID.

00:56:53.292 --> 00:56:57.302
SO THEY WENT INTO LATER LIFE
NEVER TALKING ABOUT THIS WORK,

00:56:57.303 --> 00:57:02.138
DOT'S BROTHERS BOTH SURVIVED THE
WAR, BOTH HER BROTHERS WOULD

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:07.598
TAKE JOBS AT TOP SECRET SECURITY
CLEARANCE, THEY WOULD BRAC ABOUT

00:57:07.599 --> 00:57:13.395
THE SECURITY CLEARANCE, DOT
COULD NEVER TELL THEM ABOUT THE

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:16.501
SECURITY CLEARANCE SO THEY HAD
TO PUT UP WITH THAT FOR DECADES.

00:57:16.502 --> 00:57:20.231
BUT THEY REMAINED SO CLOSE FOR A
LISTENING TIME CHILDREN THOUGHT

00:57:20.232 --> 00:57:23.334
THEY WERE RELATED TO EACH OTHER
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THESE TWO

00:57:23.724 --> 00:57:26.916
WOMEN SHARED GREAT FRIENDSHIP AS
WELL AS SOME SECRET WHAT THEY

00:57:26.917 --> 00:57:29.630
HAD DONE DURING THE WAR.
THISES A GROUP OF NAVAL ENLISTED

00:57:29.631 --> 00:57:33.130
WOMEN WHO ALSO REMAINED GREAT
FRIENDS AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER.

00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:36.861
ONLY ONE OF THEM IS STILL ALIVE.
RUTH WHO YOU CAN SEE IN THE

00:57:37.652 --> 00:57:39.786
STRIPED SHIRT.
I AM HE RECOLLECTS EMAIL WHEN

00:57:39.787 --> 00:57:42.081
SHE COMMUNICATES WITH ME IS RUTH
THE WAVE.

00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:45.784
AT 95 SHE'S ON EMAIL BECAUSE
THEY WERE CODE GIRLS THEN AND

00:57:45.785 --> 00:57:47.899
THEY'RE CODE GIRLS NOW.
THIS WORK THOUGH THEY COULDN'T

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:53.408
TALK ABOUT IT FOR 75 YEARS,
REMAINS SO IMPORTANT TO THEM, 

00:57:53.409 --> 00:57:55.206
THEM,
THAT THAT -- SHE CHOSE THAT AS

00:57:55.207 --> 00:57:57.712
HER EMAILING ADDRESS.
I WANTED TO END WITH A COUPLE OF

00:57:57.713 --> 00:58:01.522
QUICK VIDEOS THAT GIVE YOU A
SENSE OF THE WOMEN, TALKING

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:04.218
ABOUT THEIR WORK, WHAT WAS
IMPORTANT TO THEM, AND

00:58:04.316 --> 00:58:06.316
REMEMBERING SOME OTHER MOST
MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES.

00:58:06.654 --> 00:58:08.654
SO THIS IS DOT.

00:58:17.256 --> 00:58:22.595
&gt;&gt; MY UMBRELLA AND MY RAINCOAT,
U WENT DOWN TO THE TRAIN NEAR MY

00:58:22.596 --> 00:58:26.683
UNCLE HAD TO TAKE ME DOWN THERE.
NO CAR.

00:58:27.192 --> 00:58:31.598
AND MY MOTHER AND HER SISTER
WERE STANDING THERE CRYING WHEN

00:58:31.599 --> 00:58:33.599
I GOT ON THE TRAIN.

00:58:36.558 --> 00:58:40.161
I WAS VERY SECURE THAT
EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE JUST

00:58:40.162 --> 00:58:42.950
THAT.
WASHINGTON WOULD RECEIVE ME WITH

00:58:42.951 --> 00:58:45.973
OPEN ARMS.  
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE THE MESSAGE SHE GOT

00:58:45.974 --> 00:58:48.881
IN WASHINGTON IS SHE WOULD BE
SHOT IF SHE TOLL ANYBODY WHAT

00:58:48.882 --> 00:58:51.708
SHE WAS DOING.
SO THE NEXT WOMAN, ANN WAS

00:58:52.206 --> 00:58:56.416
RECRUITED OUT OF SMITH COLLEGE
IN 1942, SHE WOULD WORK THE

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.010
JAPANESE NAVAL FLEET CODE.

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:12.310
&gt;&gt; SOMETHING YOU ASKED, YOU ADD
IT TO A FIVE DIGIT CODE GROUP.

00:59:12.311 --> 00:59:21.314
AND THE CODE GROUP HAS A MEANING
WHICH IS EITHER A WORD OR A

00:59:21.902 --> 00:59:31.704
PHRASE OR A SENTENCE OR A ROMAN
LETTER BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING

00:59:31.904 --> 00:59:34.011
IN
JAPANESE WHO DIDN'T MAKE MUCH

00:59:34.012 --> 00:59:37.706
USE OF ROMAN LETTERS BUT THEY
OFTEN DID SPELL NAMES.

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.523
&gt;&gt; SO HER MEMORY WAS SO SHARPED
SHE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THIS IN

00:59:43.524 --> 00:59:46.115
75 YEARS AND SHE REMEMBERED
JAPANESE HAD A DIFFERENT CODE

00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:49.619
GROUP OF EVERY LETTER OF THE
NAME ROOSEVELT BECAUSE THEY

00:59:49.721 --> 00:59:51.936
MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHARACTER THAT
STOOD FOR ROOSEVELT.

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:56.629
SO HER MEMORY SO SO SHARP, SHE
SHOW ME THE MATH SHE HAD TO DO

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:59.622
TO RECOVER THE ADDITIVES.
SHE GOT IRRITATED WHEN I WAS

00:59:59.826 --> 01:00:04.133
SLOW ON THE UPTAKE.
SO BECAUSE I WAS SAYING IF THEY

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:08.367
-- SO DID YOU SUBTRACT OR ADD?
AND SHE SAID WE GENERALIZE AND

01:00:08.368 --> 01:00:11.572
ADD, HOW HARD IS THAT?
I LOVE HOW PRESIZE HER MEMORY

01:00:11.573 --> 01:00:13.573
WAS OF THIS WORK SHE HAD NEVER
TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT.

01:00:14.585 --> 01:00:20.089
THE NEXT WOMAN, BETTY WORKED
THOSE -- HELPED BUILD MACHINES

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:23.773
THAT BROKE THE GERMAN ENIGMA
CIPHER AND REMEMBERS BASICALLY

01:00:23.774 --> 01:00:25.774
THE THANKS THEY GOT FOR THE
GREAT WORK THEY DID.

01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:35.238
&gt;&gt; WE BROKE THE CODE IN AUGUST
OF 1943.

01:00:35.968 --> 01:00:38.857
AND EVERYBODY SAYS WHAT DID THEY
TELL YOU?

01:00:39.466 --> 01:00:46.600
I SAID NOTHING.
ALL THAT COMMANDER -- GOOD JOB,

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.601
GIRLS.
YOU DID GOOD.

01:00:48.623 --> 01:00:54.198
FROM AND THAT'S ALL THEY SAID.
&gt;&gt; AND THE LAST WOMAN, DOROTHY,

01:00:54.199 --> 01:00:59.691
YOU SAW HER PHOTO, RECRUITED
FROM INDIANA STATE TEACHERS

01:00:59.996 --> 01:01:02.592
COLLEGE AND SHE REMEMBERS WHY IT
WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THE WOMEN TO

01:01:02.593 --> 01:01:04.593
DO THIS WORK WHEN THEY WERE
RECRUITED.

01:01:06.528 --> 01:01:08.528
RECRUITED.

01:01:11.737 --> 01:01:16.780
&gt;&gt; OUR BUS CAME AND IT WAS AT
TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING

01:01:20.852 --> 01:01:26.838
TO
GET THESE -- SEEMED TO ME IT WAS

01:01:26.839 --> 01:01:36.729
ALL THERE THERE WERE NO LEFT,
THEY ALL HAD TO

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.030
GO I THINK TO
PITTSBURG.

01:01:47.559 --> 01:01:49.559
I WAS

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:03.853
-- SO GOING ON THAT

01:02:04.894 --> 01:02:10.674
BUS.
&gt;&gt; SOTOR THINK RAMALI WAS SUCH A

01:02:10.675 --> 01:02:13.902
SUCCESSFUL CODE BREAKER THAT THE
U.S. NAVY STOLE HER FROM THE

01:02:14.307 --> 01:02:16.430
IARMY.
SHE WAS THAT GOOD.

01:02:16.822 --> 01:02:20.325
AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HER IS
THAT SHE BECAME A MATH TEACHER

01:02:20.326 --> 01:02:22.836
AFTER THE WAR, SHE NEVER TOLD
ANYBODY WHAT SHE DID.

01:02:23.154 --> 01:02:25.663
SHE WOULD END UP TEACHING AT THE
PUBLIC MIDDLE SCHOOL IN

01:02:26.253 --> 01:02:30.157
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, THAT MY OWN
CHILDREN WOULD ULTIMATELY

01:02:30.655 --> 01:02:33.964
ATTEND, AND THEN YORK TOWN HIGH
SCHOOL, I LOVE THE THOUGHT OF

01:02:33.965 --> 01:02:40.258
THESE MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS TAKING
MS. RAMALI'S ALGEBRA 1 CLASS AND

01:02:40.259 --> 01:02:43.055
HAVING NO IDEA THIS SWEET WOMAN
WHO PEOPLE REMEMBER AS

01:02:43.161 --> 01:02:47.360
INCREDIBLE MATH TEACHER HAD BEEN
SUCH A BAD AS CODE BREAKER

01:02:47.659 --> 01:02:50.452
DURING WORLD WAR II.
SHE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT UNTIL

01:02:50.453 --> 01:02:56.365
I INTERVIEWED HER.
AND SHE'S ALSO AN EXAMPLE OF THE

01:02:56.366 --> 01:02:59.775
FACT THESE WOMEN WALKED AMONG US
FOR DECADES AND IN MANY CASES

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.770
STILL WALK AMONG US, THEY NEVER
EXPECTED CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY

01:03:02.771 --> 01:03:04.391
DID.
MOST CASES THEY NEVER GOT ANY

01:03:04.392 --> 01:03:06.987
CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY DID.
THEY TOOK THE SECRET TO THEIR

01:03:06.988 --> 01:03:09.994
GRAVES.
I FELT VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:14.190
TO FIND 20 WOMEN LIVE WOMEN WHO
COULD TALK ABOUT THEIR WORK.

01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:17.000
YOU SEE HOW EXCELLENT THEIR
MEMORIES WERE AN TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:21.697
TRY AND GET THEM SOME CREDIT FOR
THE INCREDIBLE CONTRIBUTION THEY

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:25.889
MADE TO WINNING THE WAR AND TO
AMERICAN FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY.

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:31.603
THAT'S NOT AN OVERSTATEMENT.
AND AGAIN NEVER EXPECTING

01:03:31.604 --> 01:03:33.208
CREDIT.
BY THE TIME I WAS INTERVIEWING

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:36.404
THEM, THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD
LEFT OUT OF HISTORY.

01:03:37.328 --> 01:03:39.622
THEY KNEW BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT
PACIFIC CODE BREAKING AND

01:03:39.825 --> 01:03:42.316
ATLANTIC CODE BREAKING HAD
PRETTY MUCH NOT TOLD THEIR STORY

01:03:42.317 --> 01:03:46.228
BECAUSE THE WOMEN HAD BEEN SO
GOOD ABOUT NOT SPEAKING UP AND

01:03:46.229 --> 01:03:49.020
ONE OF THE WOMEN I INTERVIEWED
IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM IN ATLANTA

01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:52.327
BECAUSE SHE HAD BROKEN HER WRIST
THE NIGHT BEFORE, I LEARNED

01:03:52.734 --> 01:03:54.826
EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE GOOD PLACES
TO INTERVIEW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

01:03:54.827 --> 01:03:57.835
WAIT A LONG TIME AND THEY CAN'T
-- THE PERSON CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

01:03:57.836 --> 01:04:00.751
BUT SHE SAID THAT I JUST HOPE
THAT I LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE

01:04:00.752 --> 01:04:02.752
THE BOOK

01:04:05.248 --> 01:04:07.755
PUBLISHED.
I'M HAPPY TO SAY SHE DID.

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:11.045
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING.
BEEN AN HONOR TO WORK WITH THE

01:04:11.046 --> 01:04:12.453
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND TELL THE
STORY.

01:04:12.454 --> 01:04:14.454
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:16.577 --> 01:04:18.577
I THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR A FEW
QUESTIONS.

01:04:23.112 --> 01:04:26.102
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LIZA FOR BRINGING
TO LIGHT THE STORIES OF THESE

01:04:26.305 --> 01:04:27.800
INCREDIBLE WOMEN AN
CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MADE TO THE

01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:31.166
COURSE OF WAR, TECHNOLOGY, CODE
BREAKING AND CYBER SECURITY.

01:04:33.104 --> 01:04:36.012
BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK USING
PRIMARY SOURCES LIKE THOSE AT

01:04:36.013 --> 01:04:39.303
THE VETERANNEN HISTORY PRO--
VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT,

01:04:40.313 --> 01:04:42.313
STORIES LIKE THESE CANNOT BE
IGNORED.

01:04:42.532 --> 01:04:46.335
THEY WILL BE INCLUDED IN ANNULS
OF HISTORY.

01:04:46.523 --> 01:04:49.223
WE WERE THINKING HOW GREAT IT
WOULD BE TO HAVE THE CODE GIRLS

01:04:49.224 --> 01:04:53.044
WITH US TODAY BUT BECAUSE
THEY'RE GENERALLY IN THEIR 90s

01:04:53.045 --> 01:04:57.034
AND A BIT FRAIL, WE THOUGHT
LET'S GIVE NEXT BEST THING AND

01:04:57.035 --> 01:05:00.434
LIZA HELPED US REACH OUT TO
THOSE FAMILIES AND GET SOME OF

01:05:00.435 --> 01:05:02.679
THOSE COLLECTIONS WE DIDN'T HAVE
IN OUR ARCHIVES HERE.

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:09.731
AND IN FEBRUARY WE RECEIVED A PA
CONTACT CONTAINING ORAL HISTORY

01:05:09.732 --> 01:05:12.935
-- PACKAGE CONTAINING ORAL
HISTORY INTERVIEW, PHOTOGRAPH

01:05:12.936 --> 01:05:16.646
AND MEMOIR WRITTEN BY ELIZABETH
BENNETT.

01:05:17.062 --> 01:05:20.158
HER SON WHEN HE FOUND OUT WHAT
WE WERE DOING RALLIED HIS FAMILY

01:05:20.159 --> 01:05:23.571
TO COLLECT THESE ITEMS AND SEND
THEM TO US RIGHT AWAY.

01:05:23.864 --> 01:05:27.158
AND ONE OF THE EMAILS HE SENT TO
OUR STAFF, HE WROTE MY MOTHER IS

01:05:27.159 --> 01:05:30.874
STILL ALIVE BUT HER HEALTH HAS
BEEN POOR OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:35.360
YEARS, OUR FAMILY IS VERY
GRATEFUL TO LIZA FOR HER BOOK

01:05:35.361 --> 01:05:38.775
FEATURE IT IS CODE GIRLS AND YOU
AND THE VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT

01:05:38.776 --> 01:05:40.776
FOR PRESERVING THE STORY OF
THESE REMARKABLE WOMEN.

01:05:41.595 --> 01:05:47.092
FROMI'M SAD TO REPORT
MS. BENNETT BASS TON 16th OF

01:05:47.503 --> 01:05:51.606
MARCH AT THE RIPE AGE OF 96.
I COULD SUGGEST CHEVIED A GOOD

01:05:51.607 --> 01:05:53.494

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.430
SO THANK YOU, DOUG.
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:05.653 --> 01:06:11.247
&gt;&gt; I WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW
GRATEFUL WE ARE TO MAKE SURE

01:06:12.252 --> 01:06:18.260

TIME FOR QUESTIONS FOR -- WITH

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:58.841
YOU AND WITH LIZA.
WITHOUT FURTHER ADIEU.

01:07:03.755 --> 01:07:05.755
(OFF MIC)

01:07:07.943 --> 01:07:11.363
&gt;&gt; DID ANY OF THE WOMEN DEMAND
PROOF THAT IT WAS UNCLASSIFIED

01:07:11.364 --> 01:07:15.446
THAT THEY COULD TALK ABOUT IT OR
DID THEY JUST BELIEVE YOU?

01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:19.780
&gt;&gt; IT DID TAKE PERSUASION, IT
TOOK A HALF HOUR TO PERSUADE DOT

01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:22.777
SHE WOULDN'T BE PUT IN PRISON IF
SHE SPOKE.

01:07:23.292 --> 01:07:27.198
I TOLD HER IF SHE WAS IT WOULD
BE A NICE PRISON AT HER AGE.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.907
SOME DID TAKE SOME COAXING.
AND I WILL SAY THEY HAD BEEN

01:07:32.003 --> 01:07:38.818
RELEASED FROM THEIR RECEIVE OATH
OF SECRECY IN THE '90s BUT

01:07:39.007 --> 01:07:41.007
NOBODY TOLD THEM.
SO THEY WERE FREE TO SPEAK.

01:07:41.437 --> 01:07:44.963
&gt;&gt; YES.
YOUR PICTURES OF THE CROSSING ON

01:07:44.964 --> 01:07:47.164
WISCONSIN AVENUE, A NUMBER OF
YEARS AGO I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

01:07:47.165 --> 01:07:52.866
TO LOOK AT SOME PHOTOGRAPHS IN
THE D DOT COLLECTION AND THE

01:07:53.164 --> 01:07:57.772
FIRST DON'T WALK PEDESTRIAN
SIGNALS WERE INSTALLED IN THE

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.773
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AT THE
SIGHT.

01:07:59.797 --> 01:08:01.556
I GUESS THEY WERE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THESE WOMEN.

01:08:01.557 --> 01:08:04.909
&gt;&gt; YES.
AND THEY WERE ALSO SOME

01:08:05.007 --> 01:08:08.218
NEIGHBORS WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT
NOISE AND SINGING AS WELL AS

01:08:08.715 --> 01:08:14.647
NECKING IN THE WOODS.
&gt;&gt; 1965 I WAS SENT TO THE ARMY

01:08:15.646 --> 01:08:23.520
TO FORT MEAD AND NSA FOR EIGHT
WEEK TRAINING IN CRYPTOGRAPHY.

01:08:23.521 --> 01:08:27.035
SIX OF US, WE WALKED INTO
TRAINING THAT DAY AND WE WERE

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:32.425
TOTALLY SURROUNDED BY WOMEN.
AND I'M WONDERING IF NSA IS LIKE

01:08:32.426 --> 01:08:34.742
THAT TODAY.
AND IF THERE WERE STUDIES THAT

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.383
WOMEN ARE BETTER WIRED FOR THIS
TYPE OF WORK?

01:08:39.531 --> 01:08:43.057
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WAS
BUT I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT MANY

01:08:43.058 --> 01:08:45.444
OF THESE WOMEN DID STAY ON WITH
THE WORK AFTER THE WAR.

01:08:46.044 --> 01:08:48.546
WE DIDN'T ROLL UP OUR CODE
BREAKING AFTER WORLD WAR II

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:51.760
BECAUSE THE COLD WAR STARTED SO
WE WOULD BE BREAKING EAST

01:08:51.956 --> 01:08:56.360
GERMAN, RUSSIAN, CHINESE
COMMUNIST COLD SYSTEMS AND MANY

01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:59.947
WOMEN DID STAY WITH THE WORK AND
WENT TO WORK ULTIMATELY FOR THE

01:08:59.948 --> 01:09:03.844
NSA.
SO YOU SAW -- SHE WOULD RISE TO

01:09:03.845 --> 01:09:09.356
BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE DIRECTOR
OF NSA AND IN FIRST SUPER GRADES

01:09:09.357 --> 01:09:12.067
NSA WOMEN COMING OUT OF THE WAR.
SO THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT COHORT

01:09:12.068 --> 01:09:14.080
OF WOMEN WHO HELPED ESTABLISH
THAT AGENCY.

01:09:19.494 --> 01:09:25.219
&gt;&gt; I'M CURIOUS, HOW DOES THE
NAVY STEAL SOMEONE FROM THE ARMY

01:09:25.316 --> 01:09:28.313
AND ALSO CORRESPONDENCE COURSE
IN CODE BREAKING NOW PUBLIC?

01:09:29.322 --> 01:09:32.327
&gt;&gt; YES, SO THE CORRESPONDENCE
COURSES CAN BE FOUND AT THE

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:36.921
NATIONAL ARCHIVES, THEY STILL
EXIST AS PAPER RECORDS, I'M SURE

01:09:36.922 --> 01:09:39.540
THERE WAS AN UPDATED MODERN
VERSION BUT YOU CAN FIND THE

01:09:39.832 --> 01:09:42.534
ONES FROM 1942.
I DID STUDY THEM WHEN I WAS

01:09:42.535 --> 01:09:45.040
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT
WORKED.

01:09:45.564 --> 01:09:48.674
AND THE WAY THE NAVY STOLE HER
FROM THE ARMY WAS IT PAID MORE

01:09:48.675 --> 01:09:51.660
MONEY.
BECAUSE SHE HAD A -- SHE HAD A

01:09:51.661 --> 01:09:54.859
COLLEGE DEGREE SO SHE KNEW SHE
COULD GO INTO NAVY AS OFFICER

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.461
AND GET AN OFFICER'S ALLOWANCE,
IT WASN'T THE SALARY WAS MORE

01:09:58.462 --> 01:10:02.362
BUT SHE COULD GET OFFICER'S
ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING AND THAT

01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:06.055
MORE MONEY, $50 OR WHATEVER IT
WAS ENABLED HER TO BUY A CAR.

01:10:06.056 --> 01:10:09.359
THE OTHER GOAL IN LIFE WAS TO
SEE ALL THE CONTINENTS IN THE

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.667
WORLD WHICH SHE DID BUT SHE WAS
WITH HER -- ABLE TO DRIVE TO THE

01:10:14.668 --> 01:10:16.668
WEST COAST AND THAT WAS
THRILLING FOR HER.

01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:26.242
&gt;&gt; I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.
WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL WAS GIVEN THE

01:10:26.243 --> 01:10:29.754
CODE TO BREAK DOWN, DID THEY
ALREADY -- WERE THEY WORKING

01:10:30.037 --> 01:10:35.337
LIKE FROM TEMPLATE SO OKAY IF
THIS IS X IT'S B, THIS IS A 4

01:10:35.338 --> 01:10:37.785
MEANS THAT OR LITERALLY BREAKING
DOWN THE CODE ITSELF?

01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:40.760
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE BREAKING THE
MESSAGE SO THEY WOULD GET THE

01:10:40.761 --> 01:10:44.958
MESSAGE AND THEY WOULD SEE THE
MESSAGE, BUT THEY WERE -- SOME

01:10:44.959 --> 01:10:49.472
OF THE SYSTEMS WERE NUMERICAL
AND THEY HAD TO DO MATH, SOME OF

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:53.165
THEM WERE THEY WOULD BE LOOKING
AT LETTERS SO THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.961
VARIATION AND THEY HAD TO
UNDERSTAND THAT PARTICULAR

01:10:56.162 --> 01:10:58.162
SYSTEM AND BREAK IT IN REAL
TIME.

01:10:59.467 --> 01:11:02.367
SO THE TRAINING COURSES GOTTEN
AT COLLEGES OFTEN REALLY HAD

01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:05.267
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL
CODE SYSTEMS THAT THEY HAD TO

01:11:05.268 --> 01:11:09.591
WORK ON.
THEY HAD TO LEARN T ON THE JOB,

01:11:09.592 --> 01:11:12.707
THERE WAS SO MUCH INNOVATION AND
CHANGE TAKING PLACE DURING THE

01:11:12.708 --> 01:11:16.501
WAR.
&gt;&gt; WERE THERE ANY WOMEN YOU

01:11:17.004 --> 01:11:20.201
WANTED TO INTERVIEW OR THAT YOU
WISH YOU COULD HAVE INTERVIEWED

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.819
THAT HAD ALREADY PASSED ON?
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, THAT'S WHY I WAS SO

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.326
GRATEFUL FOR THE ORAL HISTORIES
AND COLLECTIONS AT THE LIBRARY

01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.327
OF CONGRESS.
IT WAS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:32.259
SOMETIMES THE INTERVIEWER
WOULDN'T ASK THE QUESTION THAT I

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:36.387
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE KNOWN.
AND ONE OF THE WOMEN TALKED

01:11:36.591 --> 01:11:40.511
ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF LOSING
HER HUSBAND IN THE D TEHERANING.

01:11:40.512 --> 01:11:45.316
HE'S A GLIDER PILOT AND IT WAS
-- D DAY LANDING.

01:11:45.647 --> 01:11:49.231
SHE COULDN'T GO TO HIS FUNERAL
BECAUSE SHE WAS WORKING THOSE

01:11:49.232 --> 01:11:53.032
MACHINES AND THEY HAD TO
CONTINUE AFTER LANDING BECAUSE

01:11:53.033 --> 01:11:57.337
WE WERE GOING TO BE TRACING THE
GERMANS THROUGH EUROPE, THEY

01:11:57.531 --> 01:11:59.835
WOULDN'T RELEASE THE WOMEN FROM
THEIR STATIONS SO SHE COULDN'T

01:11:59.836 --> 01:12:02.936
GO TO HER HUSBAND'S FUNERAL, I
FELT LIKE THAT INTERVIEWER WAS

01:12:02.937 --> 01:12:06.044
UP COMFORTABLE TALKING TO HER
ABOUT THAT LOSS BECAUSE SHE SAID

01:12:06.045 --> 01:12:08.148
SHE LOVED HIM FOR THE REST OF
HER LIFE.

01:12:08.562 --> 01:12:10.355
SO THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I
WISH THAT OBVIOUSLY I COULD HAVE

01:12:10.356 --> 01:12:14.161
TALKED TO THE WOMEN IN PERSON
BUT I WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR THE

01:12:14.162 --> 01:12:16.162
ORAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS.

01:12:22.564 --> 01:12:28.176
&gt;&gt; DID YOU EVER HEAR BACK FROM
THE EDITOR WHO SAID IT WAS --

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:31.286
&gt;&gt; NO, BUT I HOPE HE'S
REGRETTING THOSE WORDS.

01:12:31.691 --> 01:12:35.686
I ACTUALLY FOUND THEM VERY
MOTIVATING SO IF ANY HIGH SCHOOL

01:12:35.687 --> 01:12:38.289
STUDENTS ARE LISTENING OR
COLLEGE STUDENTS AND TEACHER

01:12:38.494 --> 01:12:40.786
SAYS YOU CAN'T DO THAT OR
THERE'S A YOUNG WOMAN OUT THERE

01:12:40.787 --> 01:12:44.482
WHO SAYS YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T
GO INTO STEM, DON'T LISTEN TO

01:12:44.483 --> 01:12:48.012
THEM.
AND USE IT AS A MOTIVATION

01:12:48.306 --> 01:12:52.472
BECAUSE I GOT UP EVERY MORNING
THINKING OKAY, I'LL SHOW YOU.

01:12:56.848 --> 01:13:01.957
SO THE BOOK HAS BEEN AUCTIONED
AND I'M TOLD THAT THERE WERE A

01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:06.551
LOT OF STAGES IT HAS TO GO
THROUGH BUT THERE IS, HIDDEN

01:13:07.678 --> 01:13:10.578
FIGURES HAS BEEN WONDERFUL FOR
WOMEN'S STORIES, CONVINCING

01:13:11.579 --> 01:13:14.293
PUBLISHERS AND STUDIOS THAT
THERE IS AN APPETITE FOR WOMEN'S

01:13:14.294 --> 01:13:19.411
STORIES.
WE HAVE PEOPLE LIKE REECE WITHER

01:13:19.701 --> 01:13:22.794
WITHERSPOON TALKING ABOUT WOMEN
FRONTED NARRATIVES SO I'M

01:13:23.294 --> 01:13:25.294
OPTIMISTIC.
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE.

01:13:25.617 --> 01:13:29.309
&gt;&gt; I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR
PROCESS LIKE DID YOU FIND ALL

01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:34.509
THE INFO BEFORE OR DID YOU HAVE
SOME NARRATIVE THAT IT FIT INFO?

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.431
&gt;&gt; THAT IS SUCH A GREAT
QUESTION.

01:13:36.432 --> 01:13:39.738
SO NORMALLY I WOULD HAVE SPENT
TIME READING BOOKS ABOUT CODE

01:13:39.739 --> 01:13:42.745
BREAKING, I WOULD HAVE SPENT
TIME IN THE PAPER RECORDS TO

01:13:43.249 --> 01:13:45.838
EDUCATE MYSELF AND THEN I WOULD
HAVE GONE TO THE WOMEN.

01:13:46.056 --> 01:13:50.862
WHEN I HAD A REALLY THOROUGH
GROUNDING BUT BECAUSE OF MY

01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:57.455
ACTUARIAL, BECAUSE THEY WERE IN
MID 90s, I WANTED TO BE DONE

01:13:57.655 --> 01:13:59.580
FIRST.
WHILE TALKING TO THEM I WOULD BE

01:13:59.581 --> 01:14:03.175
WONDERING IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO
FIND AN ACTUAL PRINTED RECORD

01:14:03.176 --> 01:14:05.266
THAT WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THEIR
MEMORIES.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.875
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT
WOULD BE OUT THERE AND AGAIN I

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:11.576
WAS AMAZED AT HOW MUCH THERE WAS
IN THE,NANAL ARCHIVES AND

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:14.680
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS THAT ENABLED
ME TO SUBSTANTIATE.

01:14:15.094 --> 01:14:18.592
YOU SAW ANN STEELLY, SHE
REMEMBERED A SHOW THE WIKI

01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:21.391
MESSAGE, A NOON POSITION
MESSAGE, THE JAPANESE NAVAL

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:27.706
CAPTAINS WOULD SEND A MESSAGE
SAYING WE'LL BE AT NOON NEXT DAY

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:32.105
DAY, A PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR
A AMERICAN SAW MARINE COMMANDER

01:14:32.106 --> 01:14:34.940
TO HAVE.
WHEN I GOT THE FOR ARCHIVES I

01:14:34.941 --> 01:14:37.827
FOUND MESSAGES ALL OVER THE
PLACE, REMARKABLE HOW ACCURATE

01:14:37.828 --> 01:14:40.948
THEIR MEMORIES WERE.
I HAD TO DO IT BACKWARDS.

01:14:42.633 --> 01:14:46.841
&gt;&gt; ARE THERE LISTS OF PEOPLE WHO
WORKED IN THOSE GROUPS THAT I

01:14:46.842 --> 01:14:50.651
KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE PROBABLY
WONDER AND WOULD LIKE TO LOOK UP

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:53.473
A NAME OR SOMETHING?
&gt;&gt; GREAT QUESTION.

01:14:53.991 --> 01:14:56.499
THERE AREN'T GOOD -- THERE'S NOT
A SINGLE GOOD ROSTER.

01:14:57.012 --> 01:15:01.113
I WISH NSA HAD RESOURCES OR THE
CRYPT LOGIC MUSEUM HAD

01:15:01.114 --> 01:15:03.831
RESOURCES.
THEY HAVE MORE FUNDING, I'M THEY

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:05.832
WOULD TRY TO PUT TOGETHER A
ROSTER.

01:15:06.246 --> 01:15:08.540
THEY'RE SCRAMBLE FILES I MIGHT
SEE SOME OF THE WOMEN WHO CAME

01:15:08.541 --> 01:15:13.044
DOWN IN 1942 WHERE THEY WERE
LIVING AND -- BUT THERE'S NO ONE

01:15:13.045 --> 01:15:16.142
CENTRAL PLACE THAT WE -- WHERE
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE NAMES.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:19.557
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY IN YOUR
FAMILY OR EVEN SOMEBODY YOU KNOW

01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:22.459
WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS WORK OR
SAID SHE WAS A SECRETARY DURING

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.969
THE WAR, THAT INFORMATION, THOSE
PERSONNEL RECORDS ARE PUBLIC.

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:30.858
I HAVE A WEBSITE,
WWW.LIZAMUNDY.COM, I HAVE A TAB

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:33.267
FOR RESOURCES FOR CODE BREAKSER
AND FAMILIES.

01:15:33.577 --> 01:15:36.292
YOU CAN REQUEST ANYBODY'S
WARTIME PERSONNEL RECORD AND

01:15:36.687 --> 01:15:40.645
FIND OUT, IF THEY WERE A
CRYPTOGRAPHER OR CRYPTOLOGIST,

01:15:40.646 --> 01:15:43.933
THAT MEANS THEY DID THIS WORK.
YOU CAN GET THEIR BACKGROUNDS

01:15:43.934 --> 01:15:46.739
RECORDS, COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS,
IT'S KIND OF REMARKABLE WHAT'S

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:50.537
AVAILABLE AND IT'S NO HARD.
-- IT'S NOT HARD.

01:15:54.749 --> 01:15:58.569
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE SEED OR THE IDEA
THAT DREW YOU TO WRITE THIS

01:15:58.661 --> 01:16:02.992
STORY?
&gt;&gt; MANY FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE

01:16:02.993 --> 01:16:05.991
WONDERFUL HISTORY OFFICES AND
HISTORIANS THAT GENERATE AND

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.190
RECORD THE HISTORY OF THEIR
AGENCY.

01:16:08.191 --> 01:16:15.106
SO THE NSA KNEW ITS ORIGIN STORY
INCLUDED THESE WARTIME WOMEN AND

01:16:15.107 --> 01:16:19.393
JUST AS NASA KNEW ITS ORIGIN
STORY INCLUDED THE AFRICAN

01:16:20.297 --> 01:16:24.695
AMERICAN WOMEN MATHEMATICIANS.
SO I READ A DECLASSIFIED HISTORY

01:16:24.696 --> 01:16:28.295
OF SMALL CODE BREAKING PROJECT
DURING THE WAR WRITTEN BY NSA

01:16:28.296 --> 01:16:32.898
HISTORIAN, IT WAS OUT ON THE
INTERNET, IT HAD BEEN

01:16:33.604 --> 01:16:36.224
DECLASSIFIED IT MENTIONS THIS
WAS RUSSIAN COLD

01:16:39.501 --> 01:16:42.197
RUSSIAN CODE BREAKING THAT
MENTION AD LOT OF PEEP WORKING

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:44.502
THAT PROJECT WERE WOMEN, A LOT
FORMER SCHOOLTEACHERS FROM THE

01:16:44.503 --> 01:16:46.506
SOUTH.
THAT SEEMED REALLY INTRIGUING.

01:16:46.507 --> 01:16:51.328
SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO
SPEAK WITH AN NSA HISTORIAN WHO

01:16:51.329 --> 01:16:54.947
WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL TO ME AND
A COURT RAYTOR AT THE CRYPT

01:16:55.237 --> 01:16:59.635
LOGIC MUSEUM WHICH IS ATTACHED
TO NSA AT FORT MEAD, TWO WOMEN,

01:16:59.636 --> 01:17:03.036
AND IT WAS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN
WAITING FOR SOMEBODY TO COME

01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:05.847
ALONG WHEN WAS INTERESTED AND
THEY SAT WITH ME FOR TWO HOURS

01:17:05.848 --> 01:17:11.045
AN  EXPLAINED THE LARGER STORY
THAT WAS MOSTLY WOMEN BREAKING

01:17:11.046 --> 01:17:13.849
JAPANESE AND GERMAN CODES DURING
THE WAR AND THEN I JUST HAD TO

01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:17.594
FIGURE OUT WHETHER I COULD FIND
PEOPLE AND FIND ARCHIVAL

01:17:17.595 --> 01:17:19.595
RECORDS.

01:17:21.014 --> 01:17:27.197
SO SHOUT OUT TO FEDERAL AGENCY
HISTORIANS, THEY ARE WONDERFUL.

01:17:27.198 --> 01:17:29.198
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:33.226 --> 01:17:37.397
&gt;&gt; SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, I THINK
WE HAVE DESCENDENTS OF CODE

01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:40.370
GIRLS IN THE AUDIENCE AS WELL
AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.772
THEIR FAMILY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO
OUR HISTORY.

01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:44.870
[APPLAUSE]
