00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.640
In the home stretch.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.910
Problem 14.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.200
If n and p are integers greater
than 1-- I didn't

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.420
write that they're integers--
and if p is a factor of both n

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:33.130
plus 3 and n plus 10, what
is the value of p?

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.610
So n and p are integers greater
than 1 and p is a

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.400
factor of both n plus
3 and n plus 10.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.860
This is interesting.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.890
So that means that n plus 3 is
equal to some number times p,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.710
where k is just some
random number.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.560
And we also know that n plus
10 is also equal to some--

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.700
maybe, probably, definitely
some other number times p.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.720
And so we could subtract
3 from both

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.730
sides in this equation.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.330
We'd get n is equal to k
times p, some number

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
times p minus 3.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.300
And we also could do it here.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.640
We can subtract 10
from both sides.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.520
We say n is equal to some other
number times p minus 10.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.660
And I don't know where
this is going.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.550
I'm just really playing
around with this.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.630
So let's see.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.130
So both of these things
are equal to n.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.560
What are we trying
to solve for?

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.460
We're trying to solve for p.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.560
So some number times p minus 3
is equal to some other number

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.480
times p minus 10.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.360
Let me see where that gets me.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.300
So kp minus 3 is equal to
m times p minus 10.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.870
Let's add 10 to both sides
of this equation.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.340
You'll get kp plus 7 is
equal to m times p.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.460
Now, this is interesting.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.460
So if I multiply some integer
times p, right?

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.590
So this is some multiple
of p, right?

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.860
This is actually n plus 3.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.910
But if I have some multiple of
p right here and I add 7 to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.610
it, I get another
multiple of p.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.210
So that means that 7 has
to be divisible by p.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.060
There are only two numbers
that 7 is divisible by.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.885
1 and 7.

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:42.210
And it's not going to be 1,
because it tells us that n and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.030
p are both greater
than 1, right?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.120
So p has to be 7.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.670
p is equal to 7, which
is choice B.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:59.960
And so the way I think about it
is just when you add 10 to

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.590
a number-- think
of it this way.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.090
Ignore this whole n plus 3.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.390
Let's just say n plus 3, let's
just say that we'll

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.030
call this Q, right?

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.020
We're saying p is a factor
of Q, right?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.110
And then if Q is n plus 3, then
this would be Q plus 7.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.590
I hope I'm not confusing you.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.540
So this is divisible by p.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.040
And then when you add 7 to it,
it's also divisible by p.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.490
So p has to be 7, because when
I add 7 to-- think of it this

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:43.020
way: if n plus 3 was-- let's
say this was 21.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.000
Not n, n plus 3 was 21, then
n would be what, 18?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.220
n is 18, n plus 3 is 21, and
n plus 10 would be 28.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.330
And these are both
divisible by 7.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.340
So that's another way
you could do it.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.350
You could actually just
try out the numbers.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.500
But hopefully, that'll give
you the intuition.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.590
But the big clue is some
multiple times p plus 7 is

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.800
equal to another multiple
times p.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.140
So we know that p has to be 7
because p has to be divisible

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.830
into 7 and greater than 1.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.570
And there's only one number
that's greater than 1 and that

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.510
is a factor of 7.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.360
And that's B.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.950
Or that's 7, sorry.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.160
Next problem.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.950
That was tricky, I think.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.860
Problem 15.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.680
In the queue shown above,
points A, B and C are

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.840
midpoints of the three edges.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.110
Which of the following angles
has the least measure?

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.980
Oh man, this is going to
be a lot of drawing.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.670
This might take the whole
time, but I'll

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.430
try my best. OK.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.760
B, C and E.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.080
I'm going to draw it big
just so-- actually, I'm

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.330
drawing it too big.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.540
I'll do it the best I can.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.590
OK.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.315
And then they have these dotted
lines in the back.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.570
OK, now they have--
let me draw this

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.510
in a different color.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.760
This is point x.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.620
This is point y.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.970
They draw a bunch of points.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.850
B, C, and E are the midpoints.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.170
So this is point B.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.100
This is point A.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.430
This is point C.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.700
Point D.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.720
Point E.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.020
And everything they drew
essentially starts at x, goes

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.785
to one of these points, and then
goes back to y, right?

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:12.590
It goes from x to B
to y, x to A to y.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.520
All the choices go to each
of these points and

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.290
then go back to y.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.510
And what they want to
know is, which angle

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.740
has the least measure?

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.130
So the way we could think about
this is, all of these

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:31.136
angles-- we could just draw this
part-- sorry, if this was

00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:33.680
x, this is one of the messier
things I've ever drawn, this

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.020
is y and then the other angles,
you know it's going to

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.955
go to some point and
then come back.

00:06:37.955 --> 00:06:40.800
And what we want to know
is, when do we

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.540
get the least angle?

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.540
Think of it this way, the longer
this base angle is, the

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.000
longer this is, the
smaller the angle.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.730
Because this is the angle
we're measuring.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.950
So we want to make
this angle, this

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.235
length as long as possible.

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:59.900
The length from whatever letter
we are to y, right?

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.150
So B to y is very short,
so this angle

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.980
would be pretty big.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.420
A to y is even bigger.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.195
C to y is even bigger
than that.

00:07:07.195 --> 00:07:10.530
D to y is actually the biggest.
This is the biggest

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.900
distance, right?

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.746
So this will be the
smallest angle.

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:23.282
So that's ydx or xdy,
so that's choice D.

00:07:23.282 --> 00:07:26.750
And remember, the underlying
intuition is, if I were to--

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.500
let me do the colors so you know
what I'm saying-- this

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.440
line, if I were to draw that,
that would be here.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.520
I'm saying that corresponds
to that right there.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.155
That's x.

00:07:37.155 --> 00:07:38.130
That's y.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.610
And then we're taking a
point from x to one of

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.980
these points, right?

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:47.770
xby, xay, xcy, and whatever
point it is, the way we get

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.460
the smallest angle is
if we make this

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.330
line as long as possible.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.830
And you can visualize that.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.090
Take this point further and
further out and this angle

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.040
gets smaller and smaller
and smaller.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.130
So if you look at it that way,
what is going to be the

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.110
longest distance y to which
of these points?

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.480
y to C is the same as y to E.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.905
y to B is very short.

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:12.990
y to A id a little longer.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.260
y to C is a little longer.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.320
y to D is the longest
distance.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.365
So the least angle will be,
if this point is D, xdy.

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:23.428
And that's choice D.

00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:26.510
Let me see if I can squeeze
problem 16 in here.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.360
Otherwise, I'll do it
in the next video.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.930
Problem 16.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:41.130
if xy is equal to 7, x minus y
is equal to 5 then x squared y

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:46.370
minus xy squared is
equal to what?

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.430
All right, so we know what
xy is and we know

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.410
what x minus y is.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.220
So let's watch this.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.360
Factor an x out of here.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.830
You get the same thing as x
times xy, minus-- let's factor

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.890
a y out of here.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.410
This is the same thing
as y times xy, right?

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.430
All I did is I factored
a y out.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.790
And now let's factor
the x minus y out.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.680
This is the same thing as xy
times x minus y, right?

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.500
I'm just factoring the xy out.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.460
You could do it in reverse.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.840
You can distribute the xy and
you'd get this up here.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.070
And this equals what?

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.730
xy is 7.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.190
And x minus y, it gives
us right there, is 5.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.420
7 times 5 is 35.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.885
That's choice D.

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:32.600
And we are done with Test 7.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.260
I will see you in Test 8.
