1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.750
Jocko.
Oh,

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.260
I was wondering what your advice is for disagreeing up the chain of command.

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.950
Obviously this needs to be done with some tact I eat in private,

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.500
not in front of others,
but in those private conversations.

5
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:13.570
How should one respectfully disagree?

6
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.480
<v 1>Again,
s again,
similar question.</v>

7
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:21.040
A better technique than disagreeing is just to ask questions.
You know,
boss,
Hey,

8
00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.440
I want to make sure I get this right.
Can you explain it to me again?
Can you,

9
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.760
can you watch me do it right?
So your boss actually sees what the problem is.

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.800
That way you're,
you're not being authentic.
Gee,
Hey boss,

11
00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:35.650
can you explain why you chose this course of action?
I really want to learn from,

12
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.720
from what you do,
what you,
the way you do it.

13
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.280
I again,
does that sound like a kiss ass?
Yes.
Cause I'm exaggerating.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.060
You know what I mean?
He boss,
you're still incredibly smart.
No,

15
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:53.270
I'm not talking about that because bosses don't like ask us issues or at least

16
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:58.130
good bosses.
Good bosses don't actually even good bosses.

17
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.580
They might keep their kiss asses around,
but they don't respect him.

18
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.090
So you don't gain influence by being a kiss ass.
It's not a good situation.

19
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.790
So I'm not talking about kissing ass,
but you know,
hey boss,

20
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:11.240
I'm really want to understand this and make sure I understand it.
Can you,

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.370
can you explain to me why this is the best way to make this,

22
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.730
to do this versus the other way?
You know,

23
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.550
that's the kind of question that's not kissing ass.
That's actually,

24
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.560
you know what it is actually legitimately wanting to know.

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.010
Like I legitimately want to know,
maybe you wait,
what if we,

26
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:26.840
instead of assuming that we know better than our boss,

27
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:29.660
what if we assume that my boss knows better than me?
Let's make that assumption.

28
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.700
And if you communicate with that assumption,

29
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.670
then you're probably going to communicate in a much better way than

30
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.220
communicating with the assumption that my boss is an idiot and I know better

31
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:39.800
than him.
Yeah.
Which is not a good way to communicate.

32
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.173
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.760
<v 0>Funny when you,
now that you kind of said that about the kiss ass guy,</v>

34
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.090
cause that comes up a lot because I don't want to be kissed ass and yeah,

35
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:53.900
you don't the kiss ass guys the same thing as being friends zoned.

36
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.140
You know what friends owned mean?
Yeah I do.
It's the same thing.
Yeah.

37
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.240
So like the girl,
right?
Typically it's the guy who gets friend zoned.
Right?

38
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.170
Cause he's like too nice.
He's too nice.
He's too whatever.
He'll,
it's,
he's like,

39
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:10.490
he's essentially a,
you're like a brother to me.
Yes ma'am.
That's what he is.

40
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:13.340
So of course the girl is going to keep them around for all this like good

41
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:17.240
feelings superficially by the way you mentioned launch,
all of that stuff,

42
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.770
all the superficial stuff.

43
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.170
He's not going to get anywhere of legitimacy with her actual decision makings if

44
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.600
you translate that into the,
you know,
work environmental,
whatever.

45
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.880
Well yeah the boss,
I mean a certain kind of bosses,

46
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.130
like a certain girls going to keep a guy around for that reason.

47
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.850
Certain boss is going to be like,
y'all keep him around.

48
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.300
I feel a little bit bad even firing the guy like that a little bit cause he's

49
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:41.570
just so nice to me and gives me all these compliments and even in,
in a,

50
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.000
in a weird way,
I think the kiss ass guy kind of knows that too.
You know?

51
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.140
Like why would he ever fire me even though he's not that good at his job or

52
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:52.580
whatever.
Right.
Um,
because you know,
he can fire me guns just too nice to him.

53
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:54.980
You know,
there's that feeling is floating around is what I'm saying.

54
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.220
But it's the same deal.
Right?
Like it's too many compliments.

55
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.590
Too much of a yes man.

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.120
<v 1>I'll keep you around for very superficial reasons,
but that's it.</v>

57
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.310
You don't get past.
Yeah,
that's,
and that's not a good no place to be in.

58
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.190
No,
it's not sir.
That's why I'm not saying kiss ass and,

59
00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:14.530
and the way I just explained that of,

60
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.880
of actually assuming that your boss knows more than you is,

61
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.090
is a good way to approach the situation as opposed to approaching the situation.

62
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:23.800
Like you know more than your boss.

63
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.540
Why act like that the outcome isn't going to be inferior.

64
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.070
The outcome is inferior.

65
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.120
The outcome of acting like your boss or assuming that your boss knows more than

66
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.910
you know the outcome is you treat them with respect.

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.380
Because the other way you could try and treat them with respect,
respect,

68
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.420
but inadvertently you sound like,
you know,
some people I just,
we,

69
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.360
we talk about normal face,
right?
Some people they cannot even ask a question

70
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.750
in an in a respectful way,
right?
They can't even,
what was I saying over here?

71
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.810
They can't even say,
you know,
hey boss,

72
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.770
can you explain this to me cause I really want a hundred.
I can't even say that.

73
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:03.551
You know,
hey boss,

74
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:05.260
can you explain this to me because this doesn't make any sense.

75
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.970
You know what I mean?
Like they can't even,

76
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.490
they can't even ask a question in a respectful way.
Yeah.

77
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.000
That's a skill you should master as a leader and as a follower,

78
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.470
as a leader and as a follower.
How to ask questions in a respectful way.

79
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.330
Lafe pointed this out.
Life pointed out.
We were talking about the fact of,

80
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.060
of,
I would say [inaudible] is a story.

81
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:31.390
He's told a bunch of times of going through the kill house and he's in the back

82
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.660
of the train and you shouldn't be in the back of the train.

83
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.340
You should be somewhere where you can lead everyone.

84
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.180
Cause when you're in the back of the train,

85
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:39.150
you don't know what's happened in the front of the train of assaulters.

86
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.970
A big group of people moving through kill house and I didn't.
And he goes,

87
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:46.450
you know,
Jocko didn't say,
Hey,
stop doing that and do it this other way.

88
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.050
He's like,
he asked me questions and he's like,
they were real questions.

89
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.560
I wasn't like,
Hey Lafe why the hell are you in the back of the train?

90
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.160
Is that a respectful question?
No,
it's not a respectful question,
but it's like,

91
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.830
hey leaf w what are you doing in the back of the train?

92
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.750
This is a respectful question.
I,

93
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.200
I'm actually assuming that maybe life who doesn't have the experience that I

94
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.260
have,
who's my subordinate as a platoon commander.
To me,

95
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:12.100
that big task unit commander,
my assumption is not that I know more than him.

96
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.020
My assumption is that he's got a reason for that.

97
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.500
My assumption is that he knows more than me.
Yeah.
Which,
well,
this is one of the,

98
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:20.890
one of Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life.
It's like a,

99
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.040
I think it's assumed the person that you're talking to knows more than you.

100
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.520
What I'm saying is the same thing up and down the chain of command.

101
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.900
You assume that your boss or your subordinate,
no.

102
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:33.880
Something that you don't know and if you can,

103
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.440
if you can ask questions in that way,
instead of asking questions,
boss,

104
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.710
what are we doing this for?
Yeah.
Or life.
Why are you doing that?

105
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.460
Why are you in the back of the train?
That's stupid.
No,
it's like,
hey life,

106
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.480
why are you in the back of the train?
What do you,
what is,

107
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.640
what is your purpose of being back there?
I genuinely,
genuinely want to know,

108
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.990
and this isn't like,
I'm not even saying I'm acting like that.
I truly,

109
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:58.430
genuinely want to know what the dealers,
yeah,

110
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.150
so make the assumption up and down the chain of command that your boss,

111
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.950
your subordinate,
knows more than you,

112
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.850
and then ask good questions with true,

113
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.970
genuine curiosity that you want to know the answers to.

114
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.610
It's a good way to go about it.
