00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.350
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well,
good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.100
Hope everyone didn't
have too big a lunch.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.200
This afternoon we've got a
really great program for you,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.900
mostly focused on the Carta
Marina and nautical charts.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.570
Obviously, the Carta
Marina is, itself,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.660
a large printed nautical chart,
very different from the 1507 map

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.480
and to a certain extent is
somewhat the understudied sister

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.200
of the 1507 map, which has
its own little nickname,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.790
The Birth Certificate of America,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.840
and various other sundry
theories associated with it.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.930
The Carta Marina seems to have
been largely ignored except

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.030
for a few people who have actually
done very intensive work on it.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.600
Our first speaker today, this
afternoon, Joaquim Gaspar,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.180
is one of those scholars
who not only does intensive

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.790
and deep scholarship but
one of those scholars

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.230
who transform a discipline,
transform the study

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.790
of a particular type of object.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.780
Joaquim, whose Dissertation
Committee I was

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.090
on when he received his Doctorate,
I'm not being one-sided here

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.690
but it was a very good
defense, basically has begun

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.390
to apply very analytical
tools to some

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.490
of the interesting
technical questions associated

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.890
with not only things like
Portolan Charts but also mysteries

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.350
like the Mercator projection, how
was it mathematically constructed.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.800
He's done a lot of work and
published in many essays

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.380
and in Amargo Mundi
[Assumed Spelling]

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.850
and several other journals.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.470
If you've never read
his dissertation

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.240
on Portolan Charts I would
suggest it as required reading.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.810 position:56%
He has just recently received one of
the first Millionaire Research Grant

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.660
from the European Research Council
in the history of cartography

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.400
since the European
Research Council was founded

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.270
to study the technical
developments of the Portolan Chart.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.510
And so, without further
ado, Joaquim?

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.170
[ Applause ]

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.470
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar:
Thank you very much.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.650
Before I start, let me just say
how wonderful I feel to be here

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.710
and I have to thank
John for inviting me.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.560
Well, the title is not exactly
the same as in the program.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.030
Anyway, I probably should say
it will be equally exciting.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.030
Can you hear me?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.330
Not too loud?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.430
No, okay. I'd like to start my talk

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.020
by showing side-by-sides
two different kinds

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.930
of modern maps depicting the
same region of the world,

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.660
the well-known Chesapeake Bay.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.390
A nautical chart on the left and
the topographical map on the right,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.770
the differences are obvious.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.180
In the topographical map the
formation is concentrated inland

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.450
leaving the wet areas
almost totally empty.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.900
In the nautical chart most of
the formation is located at sea

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.180
and in the coastal areas
closest to the sea,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.300
leaving the dry land
virtually blank.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.040
The reasons for these
differences are, of course,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.880
related to the different
purposes of maps and charts.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.790
While topographical maps are
intended to depict all kinds

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.670
of general information relative
to the surface of the earth,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.640
nautical charts are constructed
with the specific goal

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.220
of supporting marine navigation.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.290
But, of course, these are
old news for those of you

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.160
who are acquainted
with maps and charts.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.760
However, when we look into
the historical evolution

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.380
of nautical cartography we
realize that the differences

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.120
between these two types

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.760
of representations are much
more profound than expected.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.700
This is the subject of
my presentation today.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.900
I will show using examples
taken from various periods

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.860
that historically maps and nautical
charts not only have different

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.290
geneses but also were
constructed with different purposes

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.350
and according to different
principles.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.780
The fundamental difference
between maps and charts was

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.420
in a limited way already expressed
by the late American photographer,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.200
Hester Robinson [Assumed Spelling],
who stated in his well-known book,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.640
Elements of Cartography and I
quote - maps are to be looked

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.450 position:56%
at while charts are to be worked on.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.430
Although Robinson's definition
is wonderfully expressive

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.760
and synthetic it doesn't
tell the whole story

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.740
or even the most exciting parts.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.320
In my talk I will show how
closely connected are the geometry

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.780
and the construction processes of
nautical charts throughout history

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.520
to the navigational methods
they were intended to support

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.650
and how the confusion between
what should be considered

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.950 position:56%
as an accurate map and accurate
charts often led to misunderstanding

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.570
and conflict between pilots,
cartographers and cosmographers.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.210
Only in the present day
can we see more clearly

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.050
through the myths caused by
some subtle technical questions

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.220
that the protagonists of the
past were unable to interpret

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.180
and fully understand the reason
for those misunderstandings,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.470 position:56%
which is the intrinsically
different nature of maps and charts.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.960
This is a nautical chart drawn

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.730
by a generous cartographer named
Angeli Locheti [Assumed Spelling]

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.150
in 1339 depicting the
Mediterranean, the Black Sea

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.030
and the Atlantic coast
of Europe and Africa.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.010
It is just one example of the many
similar charts that were produced

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:33.500
in the workshops of Genoa, Venice
or Majorca from some uncertain date

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.920
of the early 13th Century on,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.920
the so-called Portolan
Charts of the Mediterranean.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.670
When we compare this representation
with the typical world maps

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.010 position:56%
of the Middle Ages, usually drawn
by aerodyglatics [Assumed Spelling],

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.490
the differences in accuracy
and detail are remarkable,

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.800
so remarkable that the number of
historians probably influenced

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.360 position:56%
by the old myth of the Dark Ages had
fallen into the trap of considering

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.680
that the accuracy of those
charts was not within the reach

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.730
of the medieval cartographers.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.940
The way out of this
alley was to postulate

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.100
that the medieval Portolan
Charts were, in fact,

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.100
copies of lost prototypes made

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.670
by some ancient civilization using
sophisticated chudatic [Assumed

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.970
Spelling] methods.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.360
However, no piece of historical
evidence has ever been produced

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.330
in support of such extraordinary
claim and the medieval origin

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.130
of Portolan Charts is
now conceptually accepted

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.840
by most historians of cartography.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.300
Furthermore, the popular idea

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.550
that Portolan Charts
are extremely accurate

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.680
by present day standards
is not correct.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.950
Although the general outline of
the Mediterranean with its bays,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.270
capes and islands is
easily recognizable in them,

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.770
a closer look into
their overall geometry

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:09.060
and detail reveals
important inaccuracies.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.400
The most obvious, although
by no means the only one,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.210
is the orientation of the
Mediterranean, itself.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.890
When we compare the
chart of Angeli Locheti

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.090
and the modern representation
of the Mediterranean,

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.670
such as this one taken
from Google Earth,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.120
we realize that the north-south
direction in the old chart

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:40.410
as defined by its vertical top-down
lines is tilted counterclockwise

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.780
by an angle close to 10 degrees.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.080
Why is that?

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.930
Could the cartographers of the
14th Century make such a mistake

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.080
when they were perfectly
aware that the direction

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.410
of the geographical map would be
easily determined by [inaudible]?

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:05.200
In the beginning of the
15th Century some 400 years

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.230 position:56%
after the first Portolan Charts
were created Ptolemy's geography was

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.770
translated into [inaudible] and
maps of the known world based

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.450
and its extensive list

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.490
of coordinates were
produced, like this one.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.580
Comparing the representation
of the Mediterranean

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.280
in the medieval editions
of Ptolemy's geography

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.310
with the corresponding
representations

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.980
in the contemporary
Portolan Charts one realized

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.090
that while Ptolemy's maps
are correctly oriented

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.710
to geographical maps, like this
one, Portolan Charts continued

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:49.020
to be tilted counterclockwise as
in the chart of Angeli Locheti.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.070
Once again, or could the
cartographers persist

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:57.110
on the same mistake, this time
defined the recognized authority

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.410
of Ptolemy.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.630
The enigma is even more
perplexing when you realize

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.090
that the overall accuracy and
detail of the Portolan Charts,

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.380
except for this particular
feature, was much better

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.450
than the one of Ptolemy's maps.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.990
The explanation for this
apparent inconsistency is

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:30.710
that we are comparing two
distinct cartographical models.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.250
While most of modern maps
and Ptolemy's representation

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.930
of the world on the left are based
on the geographical coordinates

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.610
of the places, latitudes and
longitudes, Portolan Charts

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.980
on the right were based on
navigational information collected

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:54.040
at sea, course between ports
measured with a magnetic compass

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.100
and distances estimated
by the pilots.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.340
Let me underline the following
point, which is critical

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.010
for understanding the
argument of my old [inaudible],

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.940
the geometry of a map constructed
on the basis of latitudes

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.970
and longitudes is usually very
different from the one of a chart

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.260
by its magnetic courses and
distances between places.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.560
Let me explain.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.170
As we all know, the direction
indicated by the North Pole

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.330
of a magnetic compass,
the red one in the figure,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.470
does not usually coincide with
the direction of the true north,

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.460
the geographical north, to the
angle between the two directions,

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.740
the angle delpha in the figure
we call magnetic declination

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.040
[Assumed Spelling].

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.920
At the time the earliest Portolan
Charts were constructed during the

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.030
13th Century the average
value of magnetic declination

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.750
in the Mediterranean was
about eight to 10 degrees,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:01.350
which is also the average
tilt of those charts.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:06.050
This is not by chance, of course,
because charts were oriented

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.320
with the compass top north on top.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.050
Not only charts were
constructed using the courses

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.700
between ports measured with
the magnetic compass at sea,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:22.710
but also they were used to support
navigation exactly the same way.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:29.120
Putting things in simple terms, the
course actually steered by a ship,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.160
navigating from one port
to another as indicated

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.250 position:56%
by the magnetic compass should match
the corresponding ports measured

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.550
on the chart.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.680
That would not be the case
if a common map were used.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.000
Thus, both Ptolemy's representation
of the world and the modern map

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.360
on the left are not directly
comparable with the Portolan Chart

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.730
on the right because they belong
to distinct cartographic paradigms.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.490
While the first two are intended
to represent the landmasses

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:09.150 position:56%
of the world as flexible as possible
using whatever map projection is

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.530
considered the more appropriate,

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.850
Portolan Charts were
specifically conceived

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.790
to support the practice
of navigation.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.110 position:56%
Can we say that Portolan Charts were
inaccurate because the direction

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.400
between places measured on
them did not match the true

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.260
geographical directions?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.380
It is the very concept of
accuracy which is at stake here.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.340
In the present day a map
is considered accurate

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.140
when the coordinates of the
places, the latitudes as well

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.480
as the longitudes, are accurate.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.530
Can we apply this same concept
to a medieval nautical chart

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.290
which was not made on the
basis of the latitudes

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.310
and longitudes of the places?

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.210
If not, what criteria
should we apply

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.330
to assess the accuracy
of those charts?

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.480
Taking into account the fact that
Portolan Charts were constructed

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.910
with the purpose of supporting
navigation the natural way would be

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.610
to evaluate to what extent they
would fit to that same purpose.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:16.450
Let me give another example
taken from a different period.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.240
This is, of course, the
Cantino Planisphere,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.980
drawn by an anonymous
Portuguese cartographer in 1502

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.370
and immediately taken to Italy
by an emissary of the Duke

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.620
of Fihad [Assumed Spelling],
Alberto Cantino.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.250
The Cantino Planisphere is one
of the most precious monuments

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.760
of our cartographic
heritage, depicting the world

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.980
as it became known to the European
nations after the great discoveries

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.460
of the 15th Century, to
Africa, Newfoundland,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.630
Central America, Brazil and India.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.490
Notice how these regions
are already represented

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.400
in their approximate
geographical locations

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.250
and how much detail
some of them show.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.180 position:56%
Also, and following the
introduction of astronomical matters

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.910 position:56%
of navigation during the second half

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.850
of the 15th Century this is
the earliest [inaudible] chart

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:21.590
where places were represented
according to their latitudes.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.440
With the Cantino Planisphere a
new cartographical standard was

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.080
established, promptly adopted
by many other world maps

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.820
of the beginning of
the 16th Century.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.480
Like the Caveri Planisphere
and the two printed world maps

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:44.200
of Martin Waldseemuller engraved
in 1507 and 1516 now kept

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.710
in The Library of Congress,
of course.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.500
Once more, the question I would

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.480
like to propose regarding these
early nautical Planisphere is the

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.770
following, how accurate are they?

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.790
Very often historians have tried
to give an answer to this question

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.720
by comparing the coastlines
depicted on these maps with those

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.090
of modern representations.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:13.220
If we apply the procedure
to the outline of Africa

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.020
in the Cantino Planisphere on the
right by using a satellite image

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:24.630
of the earth as the model on the
left the result is surprising.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.100
Notice how in the old
charts the contour

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:34.190
of the Continent appears
grossly displaced and stretched

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:40.770
into east-west direction, making
the Isthmus of Suez look enormous.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.920
How can we explain this
mistake, which was replicated

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.810
in all cartography of the
16th Century and beyond,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.840
including Waldseemuller's
Carta Marina.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.990
Various explanations were
given by the historians.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.140
Some have considered that
the apparent distortion

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.630
of Africa is the normal result
of the poor surveying techniques

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:09.230
of the time when longitudes could
not be determined accurately.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.600
Others postulated that the
exaggeration was to the extent

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.420
of the Continent was copied
from Ptolemy's geography.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.990
We will see that both
explanations are wrong.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.230
In order to put ourselves
firmly within the navigational

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.950
and cartographical
reality of the time

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:44.270
and avoid inaccuranism let us
imagine the following experiment.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:48.440
Suppose that we take part in the
surveying maritime expedition

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.490
in the beginning of the 16th
Century with the purpose

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.990
of representing the coast
of Africa on the chart.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:02.310 position:56%
Departing from Lisbon the idea is
to sail around the African Continent

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.370
up to Cape [inaudible]
keeping the ship as close

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.440
to the coast as possible.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.910
All we have available

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.740
as navigational instruments is a
magnetic compass to steer the ship

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.920 position:56%
and the nautical astrolight [Assumed
Spelling] to observe the sun

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.320
and determine latitude onboard.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.220
We are further requested to keep a
navigational record containing the

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.610
courses steered and the latitudes
determined along the route,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.090
as in this table.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:36.560
After the trip is completed
the next step will consist

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.190
in representing graphically
the ship's tracks

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.920
on the modern map using the courses

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.050
and the latitudes noted
in the ship's log.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:52.870
The first track in the log is the
one connecting Lisbon to the Island

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.170
of Matheta [Assumed Spelling].

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.820
The course is approximately
southwest and the latitudes

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.900
of Matheta is 32 degrees north.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.230
The second is between
Matheta and the Island

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:08.050
of Timoleaf [Assumed Spelling]
in the Caribbean Islands.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.380
The third between Timoleaf
and [inaudible] Islands and so

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.210 position:56%
on around the southern tip of
Africa and back to Cape [inaudible].

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.340
The result is totally
unexpected as it seems

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.520 position:56%
to contradict our direct experience.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.660
The coastline was in sight most of
the time and Cape [inaudible] was,

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.680
indeed, reached at
the end of the voyage.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:38.660 position:56%
Something went very wrong, but what?

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.810
Well, knowing that our experiment
has taken place in the 16th Century

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.990
and that we have used an
ordinary magnetic compass

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.630
to measure the courses
it is expected

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:55.000
that those directions were
affected by magnetic declination.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.270
If that were not the
case the track recorded

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.640
in our log would look
like this, of course.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.240
However, in the beginning

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.720 position:56%
of the 16th Century magnetic
declination had the peculiar special

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:15.480
distribution in the area, it
was east in the Atlantic Ocean

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.600
and west in the Indian Ocean.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.830
This made all compass
courses in the Atlantic

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:26.200
to have negative errors
causing the corresponding tracks

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.230
to appear rotated counterclockwise.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.320
And all compass courses
in the Indian Ocean

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.390
to have positive errors making
the corresponding tracks

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.090
to appear rotated clockwise.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:49.140
This fully explains why the
route that we have to insert

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.890
from the ship's log to the
modern map looks distorted.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.110
Thus, can we conclude that
our compass was faulty?

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.470
Not really, because it behaved
exactly how it was supposed

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.770
to behave.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.500
Although the pilots of the 16th
Century were perfectly aware

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.000 position:56%
of the phenomenon of magnetic
declination no corrections were made

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.320
to the courses measured
by the compass.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.020
More importantly, and
this is a critical point

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.210
to understand the nautical
cartography of the time,

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.310
no corrections were made

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.170
to the directions used
to make the very charts.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.570
Thus, it won't come as a
surprise that our track

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.500
around the African
Continent, which was determined

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:38.570
with a magnetic compass, almost
exactly matches the coastline

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.480
in the Cantino Planisphere.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.290
Now coming back to the initial
question about the accuracy

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:49.890
of this chart, it seems now clear
that once again the usual criterion

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.890
of cartography accuracy on
the latitudes and longitudes

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.040
of places should not
be applied here.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.040
That was a mistake not only
of the present day historians,

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:07.390 position:56%
but also of the cosmographers of the
16th Century, as we will see next.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.750
Around 1560 the Portuguese
cartographer, Lopo Homem,

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:16.880
in a note addressed to The
Crown harshly complained

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.080
about the new official cartographic
pattern that was enforced

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.730
by the [inaudible], the
Mathematician [inaudible].

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:29.550
According to him such a pattern
was prepared using the eclipses

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.720
of the sun and moon in order to
show that from Lisbon to India

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.800
and to [inaudible] there was
less distances than shown

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.930
on the traditional charts.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.880
However, and these are
the words of Lopo Homem,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.470
the charts made according to
the new pattern and I quote,

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:53.580
were so widely distanced from all
truth and navigational science

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.850
that many ships had been lost
and the pilots were forced

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.530
to buy their charts in Castile.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:07.650
At the time this letter
was written everybody knew

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.070
that the longitudinal distance
between Lisbon and India as shown

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.310
in the contemporary
charts was exaggerated.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:20.390
In a treatise written some 30 years
before the same [inaudible] had

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.120
already complained about
the fact which he attributed

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.480
to the incompetence of the pilots,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.810
although [inaudible]
was absolutely right

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:35.100
about the exaggerated longitudinal
distance between Lisbon and India,

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.140
he was absolutely wrong that
the pilots were to blame.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.270
In 1547 he was appointed

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.370
as cosmographer major
becoming responsible

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.970
for the royal cartographic pattern.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:54.110
Then he finally had the opportunity
to correct what he considered

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:59.140
to be a major mistake and so he
did by ordering the longitude

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.970
of [inaudible] in India to be
determined by astronomical methods.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:09.090
The result was a new representation
in which the longitudinal distance

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:13.660
between Lisbon and India
was substantially shortened

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.620
as in [inaudible] himself.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:22.660
Why did the cartographer
consider this model widely distant

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.900
from all truth and
navigational science?

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.010
What kind of effort would make
a chart so unfit for navigation?

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.380
Clearly, he was not
referring to the distances.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.000
Usually not to trust on
the contemporary charts,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.960
but to the orientation
of the coastlines,

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.740
which no longer reflected the
compass courses between places.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.460
Who was right and wrong
in this dispute?

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.540
He would use scientific methods to
determine the longitude of India

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:58.420
and then forced his interpretation
onto the official cartographer,

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.140
Lopo Homem, who complained
directly to The Crown

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.010
and supported his position

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:08.590 position:56%
with practical arguments
concerning the safety of navigation.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:12.750
The answer to this question
depends on the use of charts.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.490
If they were, indeed, intended

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:18.480
to support navigation
then [inaudible] was wrong

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.630
and Lopo Homem was right.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:32.910
In no way could the two be
reconciliated at the time.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:38.370
In 1569 Mercator presented
his map of the world

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:44.560
with the revealing title from the
Latin, New and Improved Description

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.320
of the Earth Properly Adjusted
for the Use of Navigation.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.510
And in his map meridians and
parallels from a regular mesh

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:59.310
of rectangles where the spacing
between parallels increases

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.430
with latitude in such a way that
the [inaudible] lines or lines

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.700
of constant course are represented

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.620
by straight segments
making the correct angle

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.600
with all the meridians.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.680
In theory the solution would
facilitate enormously the planning

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.030
and execution of navigation.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:23.930
But was Mercator's world map
truly adapted to navigation

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.390
at the time it was proposed?

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.000
As a matter of fact, it was not.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.150
More than 200 years had still

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:35.990
to pass before the novel
perception could be fully adopted

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.890 position:56%
by the pilots, not because the
pilots were conservative or ignorant

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:46.050
but owing to its incompatibility
with the navigational maps

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.820
of the time still based on
latitudes and magnetic courses.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.760
Only after the longitude problem
was solved and the distribution

00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:00.120
of magnetic declination was known
could the old cartographic model

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.620
originated in the Cantino
Planisphere be abandoned for good

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.920
and replaced by the
Mercator projection.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.990
But the story is not
over, when we look closely

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:17.060
into the geographical content of
Mercator's world map we realize

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.080
that places are not really
represented according

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.470
to their latitudes and
longitudes as they should.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:32.270
If we compared its depiction of
Africa on the right with the one

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.620
on Mercator's map on the left
we realize with amazement

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:43.480
that the same old east-west
displacement is still present.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.710
How should we interpret
this unexpected mistake?

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.450
The fact is that Mercator
could do no better

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.550
than transferring directly the
coastlines of the maps and charts

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.610
of this time to the novel
perception with no concern

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:02.200
for their distortions, assuming
wrongly that both the latitudes

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.800
and the longitudes of the places
were approximately correct.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.690
Could he have made a better chart?

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:13.460 position:56%
Not really, in order to construct an
accurate Mercator representation a

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.960
new survey was required, this
time based on the latitudes,

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.740
the longitudes and the true
direction between places.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.950
As we know, such an endeavor
could only be started

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.610
after the longitude problem
was solved near the end

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:29.910
of the 18th Century.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.720
And then coming to the
end of my presentation,

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:42.090
three different navigational
cartographic models were developed

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.700
throughout history.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:49.170 position:56%
The Portolan Chart based on magnetic
courses and estimated distances.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.990
The Latitude Chart based on
magnetic courses and latitudes.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.930
And the Mercator Chart based
on geographical coordinates

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.680
and true [inaudible]
line directions.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.260
Not only were these three models
were designed to support specific

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.530
and distinct navigational methods,

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.560
but also they were
mutually incompatible.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.220
We know that the content of
nautical charts was routinely used

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.950
to construct lavish depictions of
the world to be offered to emperors

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.410
and popes and to be
employed by them as symbols

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.710
of glory and national power.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.180
At the time, however, none of
those people were aware of the fact

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:39.040
that such representations were not
real maps and that the continents,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:45.290 position:56%
the islands and the coastlines were
distorted in weird unsuspected ways.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:51.410
These distortions were noticed
by the [inaudible] who insisted

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:55.360
to have them corrected,
being systematically opposed

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:01.200
by cartographers and pilots who
invoked the safety of navigation.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.530
Only today can we fully understand
the subtle technical reasons behind

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.930
these disputes and conclude, first,

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.910
that historically nautical
charts can only be understood

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:18.130
in the context of the navigational
methods they were intended

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.380
to support and, second,

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.520
that a nautical chart
should not be considered

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.750
as a [inaudible] geographical map

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.410
but as a diagram to
support navigation.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.210
Thank you.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:42.100
[ Applause ]

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.400
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well, we will move

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.660
on from nautical charts
to actual navigation.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.560
Our next speaker, Don McGuirk,
is a retired Physician,

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.040
has been a map enthusiast
for a very long time.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:01.040
He has published extensively
in things like Terra Incognita.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.640
He's been a long-term member
of The Phillips Society,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.880
the Washington Map Society, and the
Society of History of Discoveries.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.720
His talk today is going to focus
on the Carta Marina and Columbus.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.520
Don?

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:24.390
[ Applause ]

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.050
&gt;&gt; Don McGuirk: Good afternoon.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.120
These lights are bright.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.250
Can you hear me okay like this?

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:37.470
Okay, are my slides up?

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.720
Thank you.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:46.080
So our topic this afternoon will be
how the Waldseemuller Carta Marina

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:53.630
answered perhaps the
great - start again.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.870
[laughter] How the Waldseemuller
Carta Marina answered perhaps the

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.470
greatest unsolved cartographic
puzzle of the period.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:03.060
And this quote was by a friend
of many here in the audience,

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.620
Ken Nebanzol [Assumed Spelling].

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.330
And what was that great
unsolved cartographic puzzle?

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:15.060
The Northwest Continent
on the Carta Marina.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:20.650
Now this Northwest Continent
was on several earlier maps

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:26.170
than the Carta Marina,
the Cantino, the Caveri,

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:31.910
the Waldseemuller 1507,
and the Ruysch map.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.530
Now if you look at North
America and you look

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.860
at the Carta Marina this certainly
does look like North America.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.760
You can understand how many
people feel very strongly

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.950
that this represents the
geography of North America.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:52.450 position:56%
It just looks right, but you have to
be careful and I agree 100% with one

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:56.140
of the earlier presenters who
said you've got to be very careful

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.410
about what you say
is correct geography

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.090
when you look at early maps.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.870
And I'll give you an example
here, so here is North America

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:09.650
and here is a chart
showing some geography.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.980
And I will tell you that this
geography is directly west of Spain

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:20.760
and a little south, and on this
map I believe you can see Cape Cod,

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.150
the Peninsula of Florida, the Gulf
of Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:28.490
and you can even see the
Mississippi and the Rio Grande.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.150
And yet this is not North America,

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:36.960
this is the Asian coast
on the Fra Mauro map.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.960
So you have to be very careful.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.400
And if you take a close look,
some people might say, well,

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.700
maybe it was North America.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.560
Well, this North America, the Gulf
of Mexico actually says the Gulf

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.690
of the Ganges, and North America
is populated with a number

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.150
of Chinese cities,
so don't think so.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.830
So let's look at the 1507 first.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.570
You can look at both of
them upstairs, if you wish.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:10.510
And on the 1507 map you notice
that the continent isn't named

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.760
and just southeast
of this continent,

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.030
the northwest continental landmass,
you see an island named Isabela.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.710
Now, on the other hand, if you go

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:22.830
to the 1516 Waldseemuller
there's been some changes.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:28.080
Now you can see that the continent
has been named, it's named Cuba,

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.170
and Columbus discovered Cuba and
he actually said it's part of Asia,

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.760
and that's what this map says.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:39.480
And if you look at the Island
of Isabela it's no longer named.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.180
Now I think a logical conclusion
might be, it doesn't have to be

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:48.900
but might be that between 1507
and 1516 Waldseemuller or one

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:53.180
of his cohorts discovered
information that suggested to him

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:59.120
that this was Columbus' Cuba,
this giant continental landmass.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:05.880
Now I understand it seems a
little unlikely, if you will,

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.120 position:56%
that this giant continent
represents the small Island of Cuba,

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.420
but there are a number
of individuals

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.830
who have held the minority
opinion that it is.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:23.050
And here's a list of 17 of
those, starting very early.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.780
The most outspoken of
these 17 was George Nunn,

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.160
who wrote several articles
on this topic.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.510
And some of the names on this list
are sitting here in the auditorium,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.390
and I can only hope they
haven't changed their minds

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.150
since the last time
I talked to them.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:43.120 position:56%
So instead of making assumptions
let's create a map using information

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.710 position:56%
contemporary to Columbus' first two
voyages to test the minority opinion

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.960
that this northwest
landmass represents Cuba.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:56.100 position:56%
So here we are in our Lisbon studios
and we're going to make a map,

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.490
and we have found three pieces
of information that are going

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.790
to help us make this map.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:04.290
In other words, recreate what
Columbus said about Cuba.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.480
And those three pieces of
information are, number one,

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.570
the Diario or the log of his
first voyage, number two,

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.670 position:56%
a group of letters that Columbus
wrote to the King and Queen of Spain

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:20.270
and we'll just call the
collection the Libro Copiador,

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.700
and the third is a
manuscript document written

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.230
by a gentleman named
Fernan Perez de Luna

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:30.800
and we'll name is document
Informacion y Testimonio.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.210 position:56%
So from these three we will exact
the following geographic information

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.870
regarding the land that
Columbus named Cuba -

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:46.310
the shape of Columbus' Cuba,
the size of Columbus' Cuba,

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:51.110
the relative position of Columbus'
Cuba with the Island of Isabela

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.940
that we've already looked at.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.150
So, first, let's talk about
the shape of Columbus' Cuba.

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:03.470 position:56%
In letter four of the Libro Copiador
work we read, these coasts run,

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:06.170
and he's talking about the
continental landmass or, I'm sorry,

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:10.300
the Cuba that he's discovering,
these coasts run to the west,

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.730
the one trending away from the
Arctic and the other toward it

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:18.940
which begins narrow and widens out
as one proceeds much like the sail

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.910
of a lateen rigged caravel.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:28.280
Well, here's an image of a lateen
sail and here's our Carta Marina.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:35.650
From Perez de Luna, from his
Informacion y Testimonio,

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:41.240
he says Cuba is shaped like a
triangle and he calls it un giron,

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:46.010
extending from east to west and
the point is in the eastern part.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:52.340
Here is a picture of a giron
and here's our Carta Marina.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.180
So if we combine these two
descriptions into a sketch map,

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.450
because we're going to do a sketch
map before we do the real thing,

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:03.960
Columbus' Cuba might
look something like this.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.110
Second, the size of Columbus'
Cuba, north and south,

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.090
let's talk about the
north extent first.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:15.050
From his log of his first
voyage he says I am distance

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:19.140
from the equatorial line 42 degrees
and again he says the same thing,

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.500
I was 42 degrees north
of the equatorial line.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.670 position:56%
Now you know and I know that there's
no way he could be at that latitude,

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.770
but you're in your studio reading
the information that he has written

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.550
down and that's what he's saying.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:37.670
Anyone recognize this memorial?

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.860
Plymouth Rock.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.580
Anyone want to guess where
42 degrees north latitude is

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.700
on the east coast?

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.380
Plymouth, Massachusetts.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.460
But there's more, from the first,

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.380
letter one of the Libro Copiador
he said I traveled along the north

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.160
shore of Cuba and the northwest
region still lay before me

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.470
at least another 50 or 60 leagues.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:07.470
Now from Plymouth you see
another 50 or 60 leagues northwest

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.970
or north you're going to start
seeing signs that read this,

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:17.310
that's how far north he's saying
he thought this Cuba reached.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.840
How about the southern extent?

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.470
Well, this is a little bit
trickier, but here at La Isabela,

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.680
which is a city, quote-unquote,
on Hispaniola we are more

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.780
than 26 degrees above
the equatorial line,

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.700
so a little above the
Tropic of Cancer.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:37.420
Now on a second voyage he comes
back, he leaves Isabela and he goes

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.360
on to sail west along the south
coast of Cuba, so the south coast

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:48.260
of his Cuba should be a little
bit above the Tropic of Cancer.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:57.850
So now a sketch map might look
something like this, Carta Marina.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.200
Okay, returning to the shape

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:07.210
of Columbus' Cuba we have some
more information from da Luna.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:12.950
He says Cuba - I'm sorry,
Columbus pronounced it

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:18.670
to be continental land,
Asia, by its shape.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.520
This statement by de
Luna strongly suggests

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.820
that it was this same shape, a
triangle, that Columbus expected

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.210
to find on the coast of Asia
close to the Tropic of Cancer.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:34.340
Now does this shape occur on
the east coast of Asia on maps

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.660 position:56%
and globes contemporary to Columbus?

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.380
Yes, it does.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.860
So here's some images of the
east coast of Asia about the time

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:50.000 position:56%
of Columbus' sail, the Yale Marteles
[Assumed Spelling] map shows the

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.520
peninsula shaped landmass just
north of the Tropic of Cancer.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.760
Here's a better view
of that same geography.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.450
Thank you, Chet, for
allowing me to use this image.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:10.460
And the Behaim globe also shows
a triangular shaped landmass

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:17.880
on the coast of Asia right
at the Tropic of Cancer.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:25.480
Waldseemuller, Carta Marina,
Behaim globe, not dissimilar.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:32.360
So does Columbus believe he has
discovered an anticipated Asian

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:40.100
peninsula or is there
additional information recorded

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.030
that he thought he was coasting
this very specific Asian peninsula,

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.670
the Mangi peninsula?

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:51.540
Such information is
available, again,

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.620
from his log from his first voyage.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:58.830
While he's on the north shore of
Cuba he states and it is certain

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:02.850
that this is tierra firma,
continental land, and that I am,

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:06.570
he says, off Zayto and Quinsay,
100 leagues more or less

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.510
from one and from the other.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.690
Well, let's go back
to our Behaim globe.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:18.570
Here is Zayto and here is
Quinsay on that very peninsula,

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.480
not exactly where they're supposed
to be but on that peninsula.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.000
If we go to the recreated map

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.500
from the Toscanali [Assumed
Spelling] letter here's the Mangi

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:34.670 position:56%
peninsula, here's Zayto - I'm sorry,
here's Quinsay and there's Zayto.

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.180
Well, you could ask
the question, well,

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.730
did Columbus ever even see
any globes or world maps?

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:45.850
And from this first log we find
out that while discussing Japan

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:51.980 position:56%
and in the spheres that I saw and in
the world maps it is in this region,

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.510
so he's seen both globes
and world maps.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.320
And any of those at
this particular time

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.000
in history almost certainly would
have had the Mangi peninsula

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.300
that we've already shown.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:09.070
Well, let's talk a little bit
about this Island of Isabela

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:12.160
and its relationship
to Columbus' Cuba.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:20.620
From Perez de Luna, Columbus
came to seek the land

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:24.320
of the said Cuba nearest
to the Island of Isabela.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.110
Now this is an important statement,
he calls it the land of Cuba,

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.510
not the Island of Cuba, and he says

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.350
that Isabela is the
island closest to it.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:40.520 position:56%
but Columbus in his log of his
first voyage states that Hispaniola,

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.280
Haiti and the Dominican Republic
is the island closest to Cuba.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.690
So now you, as a young
cartographer, have a problem.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.950
There appears to be
a contradiction here.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:55.540
Two possibilities I would
suggest, either de Luna

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.000
or Columbus has renamed
Hispaniola, Isabela,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.110
or there is another
island named Isabela

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:05.190
that is even closer to
Cuba than Hispaniola.

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:09.910
Well, the answer to this question
can be found in both letters to

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:12.680
and letters for the Libro Copiador.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:18.260
And within those two letters
Columbus uses the name Isabela 15

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.640
times when discussing
the Island of Hispaniola.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.460
Columbus has renamed Hispaniola,
Isabela, on his second voyage.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.640
Some additional proof
that this is Isabela,

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.820
that Hispaniola is Isabela
is found on this title page

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.500
of a book on Marco Polo's travels.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.810 position:56%
And on this title page about halfway

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:46.830
down on the left-hand side
there's a woodcut of a city

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.250 position:56%
and this information above the city.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.860
Santo Domingo on the
Island of Isabela.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.850
Now if we look at a modern
map of Hispaniola we find

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.700
out that Santo Domingo is still
there, it's still the capitol

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.790
of the Dominican Republic.

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:14.370
So Santo Domingo was founded
by Bartholomew Columbus in 1496

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:18.360 position:56%
and it was the first seat of Spanish
colonial rule in the New World,

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.720
so it was a very important city.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.910
Now if you understand

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:29.540
that Hispaniola is Isabela then
your maps look something like this,

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:42.420 position:56%
King Hamy map 1502 Cuba, Isabela,
Maggiolo map of 1511, Cuba, Isabela,

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:48.750
Leonardo da Vinci mappamundi
of 1514, Cuba, Isabela,

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:54.200 position:56%
Maggiolo Naples 1516, Cuba, Isabela.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.880
Now if you don't understand

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.390
that Hispaniola is Isabela then
your maps look something like this,

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:05.550
Cuba, Isabela, Hispaniola.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:12.290
Waldseemuller 1506, Carta
Marina, Cuba, unnamed Isabela

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:16.320
and Hispaniola, and it might
be that Isabela is now unnamed

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.290
because with this additional
information Waldseemuller doesn't

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:25.170
know what to do with that landmass
in between Cuba and Hispaniola.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.180
Several other maps appear
to confirm the hypothesis

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.930
that the northwest landmass
represents Columbus' Cuba,

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:35.550
the Ruysch map and the Piri Reis.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.540
Let's start with the Ruysch map

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:42.300
and on this map there is
a continental landmass,

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.030
but on this map it's much
smaller than the other maps.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:52.040
And if you look closely
at this northwest landmass

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.480
on the Ruysch you will see

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:59.140
that it wasn't the first
geography on this part of the map.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.720 position:56%
If you look very closely you can see

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:07.350
that before the triangular landmass
was there was another geography

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:10.580
there that has been pounded
out of the brass plate

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:15.800
or copper plate and
has been replaced.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:21.170
And if you look very
carefully it says to Cuba.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:27.530
And here is a recreation of
I assume it was isla to Cuba,

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.200
it might have been tierra to Cuba,
but I assume it was isla to Cuba,

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.260
that was there before
the triangular landmass.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.300
Now there are some
historians who claim

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:42.110
that Ruysch forgot to
put Cuba on his map.

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:45.120
Well, this erasure proves that
there's no way that happened,

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:51.110
he just chose to use the triangular
shaped landmass to represent Cuba.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:56.300
I want you to look quickly
at this toponym [inaudible]

00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:00.990
and we'll come back to
that in just a little bit.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:06.790 position:56%
How about the Piri Reis map of 1513?

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.570
And I might need to thank Greg
McIntosh [Assumed Spelling]

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:13.300
for giving me this slide because
what he's done is translated some

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.940
of the toponyms into Spanish.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.910
And you can see at the
top it says this is Asia

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:22.710
and Asia is labeled Cuba.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:28.500
There are two place names or
toponyms on this map, Puerto Grande

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.640
and Punta de Hornofay, both names

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.820 position:56%
that Columbus used while he was
discovering the south coast of Cuba.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:41.520
And to the east Hispaniola, looking
a lot like Japan on early maps,

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.390
and the first, quote, city, end
quote, of the New World Navidad.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:50.390
So this would suggest that
the mainland was Cuba.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:57.210
So what are the other toponyms
on the continental landmass?

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:59.010
If this continental
landmass is meant

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:03.110
to represent Columbus'
Cuba the toponyms

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.920
of this continent should
be associated

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.010
with his exploration of Cuba.

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:13.300
There is one place name
in particular that we want

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.670
to take a look at and
that's Cavo doffim de abul,

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:19.220
Cape of the end of April.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.750
Now this toponym strongly
suggests that the explorer

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:27.960
of this landmass discovers an
eastern cape on this continent

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.870
on April 30th, makes sense.

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:37.960
And here we have that same
toponym on the Waldseemuller 1507

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.210
with the Island of Isabela.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:44.830
No less than the great
historian, Henry Harrisse,

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.650
declared this toponym could
not possibly be associated

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.950
with Columbus.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:54.130 position:56%
Those quotations prove conclusively
that the inscription Cape at the end

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:57.430
of the April has nothing
whatever to do with the Island

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.470
of Cuba or any part thereof.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.880
Well, let's test Harrisse's
assertion.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.730
From the Libro Copiador,
letter four,

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:12.500
on April 30th I reached Cabo alpha
et omega, the easternmost cape

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.810
of Cuba are also called Cabo Maisi,

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:19.400
and I sailed west along the
southern coast of Cuba as far

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.670
as the port I called Grande.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:30.340
And here's a map of the east end of
Cuba and here's Cabo Maisi defined

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:34.400
by Punta Maisi and Punta
Camato [Assumed Spelling].

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.470
And to the far left of the map
Biea Guantanamo [Assumed Spelling],

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.250
the Bay of Guantanamo.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:45.450
So on April 30th Columbus
sailed from Maisi all the way

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:51.090
to Guantanamo, and look at the
geography in between, okay?

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.870
Returning to Columbus'
log of his first voyage

00:50:54.870 --> 00:51:00.140
on 5 December 1492 he departs
from Cuba on his way to Hispaniola

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.450
and he says, that one
passed Cabo Maisi,

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:09.860
he saw that the coast turned
south and trended southwest

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.680
and he soon saw a handsome and
high cape in the same direction

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:18.570
and it was distant from the other
one, Cabo Maisi, seven leagues.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:24.280
In other words, about 18
nautical miles from southwest

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.540
of Cabo Maisi there was
a handsome and high cape.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:36.950 position:56%
Well, let's go back to our geography
here of east Cuba, Cabo Maisi,

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:43.200
Guantanamo Bay, and here
is another cape defined

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.600
by Punta Negra and Punta Caleta.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.710
This is the handsome and high cape.

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:57.130
And if you look at a map of Cuba
showing elevations you can see

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:05.460
that Cabo Maisi is very shallow
or very low lying, whereas,

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:12.120
the southwest cape is quite high.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.870
So here we have a photograph
of Cabo Maisi

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.590 position:56%
and you can see that it's very flat.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:27.740
And if you look to the far left
skyline you can see what appears

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:34.740
to be a high cape, right there.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:40.060
And if you take a photograph
from the road on that cape

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:46.060
and looking back at Cabo Maisi
you can see how shallow it is,

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:48.760
how flat it is.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:54.490
So now we get to the question,
this is the Caveri world map

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:59.720
and outlined here is the
Cape of the end of April.

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:07.230
Now I would ask you does
that toponym name Cabo Maisi,

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:10.960
which many historians
have thought was the case,

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:16.780 position:56%
or instead does it really
represent the handsome and high cape

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:23.450
to the southwest that he passed
and perhaps named or someone

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:28.380
in his entourage named
Cape of the end of April?

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.930
I would suggest the latter
is probably more likely.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:36.490
There are other toponyms on
this landmass that appear

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:40.600
to support Columbus'
exploration of this landmass,

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.960
and I will go through
three of them quickly.

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:51.740 position:56%
First, Costa Alta, now this toponym
is very difficult for people who say

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.950
that this continental landmass
represents North America

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:57.130
because there are no high
coasts in the southeast coast

00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:59.220
of North America, there
are just none.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:04.440
On the other hand, on arriving
at Cuba on October 28th,

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:12.140
1492 he says all this land is high,
uses the word alta, like Sicily.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:17.510 position:56%
And here is an image of the coast of
Sicily and here is an image of Cuba

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:22.080
at about the same place that
Columbus first arrived at Cuba.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:30.060
Las Cabras, the goats, now this has
to be or very likely a misspelling,

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.440
which happens a lot on these
early maps for the toponyms,

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.990
because there were no goats in the
New World and Columbus says that.

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:44.190
So I would suggest to you that this
toponym was originally Las Abras,

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.710
literally translated, the opens.

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:51.090
And on his first forage Columbus
used the term abras twice while

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:56.480
sailing the north coast and in
each case Columbus was referring

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.840
to an opening to the
sea between mountains.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:06.120
And here is an image of what
that geography would look like.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.880
Finally, Rio de las Almadias,
River of the Dugouts.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:15.200
In Columbus' log of his first
voyage he uses the word almadia

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:21.010
or almadias 24 times when referring
to the vessels of the natives.

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:27.180 position:56%
And specifically on November 1st he
says more than 16 dugouts, almadias,

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.920
came to the ship and
the river that he was

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.660
in was very deep, Rio
de las Almadias.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:44.020
And so these four toponyms match
very well with Columbus' voyage

00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:49.030
to Cuba and also matches
the placement

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.870
of Spanish flags noting a
discovery for the King and Queen

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:56.860
of Spain displayed on
both Waldseemuller maps.

00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:01.050 position:56%
To review information from Columbus'
exploration of Cuba matches well

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:04.510
with the shape of the
northwest landmass,

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:07.380
the size of the northwest landmass,

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.200
the position of the northwest
landmass with respect to the Island

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.840
of Isabela, and matches
the toponyms reviewed,

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:17.760
especially the toponym Cape of the
end of April at the eastern end

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.410
or the northwest landmass.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:24.540
Hopefully, the above information
may have convinced you of the fact,

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:28.170
not fiction, that the
northwest landmass depicted

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:30.290
on the Waldseemuller Carta Marina

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:33.320
and other early world maps
is representative of Cuba,

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:38.100
a/k/a Columbus' Asia, what Taviana
[Assumed Spelling] called Columbus'

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.310
erroneous opinion of reality.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:46.240
If it has I'm sure Columbus
would be quite pleased.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.540
Thank you for your kind attention.

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:49.510
I'll be happy to answer
questions later.

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.370
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well, our
next speaker, Chet Van Duzer,

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:06.650
needs no introduction to this
audience for the most part.

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:08.750
Chet has been studying
the Waldseemuller maps

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.430
for many, many years.

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:16.610
I first knew of Chet probably a
decade ago when he gave a talk

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:18.730
at the first Waldseemuller
conference.

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:22.580 position:56%
He was recommended to me by
someone who had seen him give a talk

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:27.280
on the subject in Europe and
I had never heard of him.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.740
Most people in cartographic circles
at that point had never heard

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.920
of him, but he has made
a significant impact

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.660
on the discipline now.

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:39.500
Chet and I were Kluge
fellows together and we worked

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:42.440
on a book together on
the Waldseemuller maps,

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.420
and during that period
of time we kind

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.850
of outlined what we thought were
the central research problems

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:52.450
that were still left in
Waldseemuller scholarship.

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:56.880
During that period I felt a little
bit like, there's a book actually

00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:02.480
by the novelist Thomas Bernhard,
which details the exploits

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.540
of a pianist who winds up
accidently being in a piano class

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:10.590
with Glenn Gould and he decides
at that point that he needs

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:14.220
to relegate all of the playing
of the piano to Glenn Gould.

00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:17.390
At the time I was a Kluge
fellow, I realized that I needed

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:20.370
to relegate all of
the possible solutions

00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:22.920
to the Waldseemuller
questions to Chet,

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:26.510
and that is what I have
assigned him tonight, so.

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:34.170
[ Applause ]

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:36.490
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Well,
that's a lot to live up to.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:38.680
Thank you, John, and
thanks to The Library

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.960
for organizing this conference.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.170
And I'd also like to thank
the Kislak Foundation

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:47.510
for bringing the Carta Marina to
The Library of Congress and also

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:51.720
for funding the fellowship
through which I had the opportunity

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.420
to spend a lot of time
studying the map.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.540
Here it is, as the title of
my talk indicated I'm going

00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:04.290
to address two particular
aspects of the map this afternoon.

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:10.060
The first is the originality of the
Carta Marina, both as a departure

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:14.670
from the 1507 map, so I'm going
to contrast it with the 1507 map,

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:19.950
and also as an independent
creation, look at all the work

00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:23.100
by Waldseemuller that
went into its creation.

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:27.740
And then also we'll look at the
diffusion of the Carta Marina.

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:31.600
So it's ben claimed that
the one surviving copy,

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.200
which is here in The Library
of Congress, is a proof

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.890
and that the map did not circulate,
and I hope to provide some evidence

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:42.320
to show that that's not the case,
that it did in fact circulate.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.820
So beginning with the
originality of the Carta Marina

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:50.600
versus the 1507 world map, so again
the Carta Marina is a departure

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.920
from the 1507 world map.

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.700
The 1507 map is based
on Ptolemy's geography.

00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.410
Here's the map, I think we're
all familiar with it by now.

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:04.430
He proclaims his debt
to Ptolemy in its title,

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.440
A Map of the Whole World According
to the Tradition of Ptolemy

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.790
and the Explorations of
Amerigo Vespucci and Others.

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:14.350
As we perhaps, most
of us know at the top

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:18.810
of the map there are portraits
of Ptolemy and Vespucci,

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:23.980
indicating his debt to both of
them, Ptolemy is on the left there.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:28.010
Here is a Ptolemaic world map, just
so we can know what we're talking

01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:30.510
about when we talk
about a debt to Ptolemy.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:32.680
And just orient ourselves briefly.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.160
Here's Europe, North Africa,

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.870
the Arabian Peninsula
and the Indian Ocean.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:45.740
And, in fact, the 1507 map
is based on a particular map,

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.740
which is also based on
Ptolemy, namely the world map

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:53.900
by Henricus Martellus at Yale,
which was made in about 1491.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:01:02.610
And just to look at this process
of movement from, if you will,

01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:06.650
from Ptolemy through
Martellus to Waldseemuller,

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:10.730
we can see that Martellus
has expanded the area

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:13.740
of the world depicted on his
map with respect to Ptolemy.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:19.100 position:56%
So he shows the southern part of
Africa, which Ptolemy does not show.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.970
He extends this geography all
the way to the North Pole,

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:28.630
which Ptolemy did not do, and he
shows not only the eastern coast

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:32.670
of Asia but further out to the
east, all the way to Japan.

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:38.130
So instead of showing 180
degrees of longitude he shows 270,

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:41.390
so a substantial expansion
of the part

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:42.910
of the earth's surface depicted.

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:48.270
If we compare the Martellus world
map and Waldseemuller's world map,

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:53.710
of course, the main difference
is the addition of the New World

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:57.910
and also Waldseemuller very boldly

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:01.040
on his 1507 map portrays
all 360 degrees

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.530
of the earth's circumference.

01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:07.330
These two maps are very similar
and the similarities were noted

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:12.020
when the Martellus map surfaced
in Bern in the late 1950s.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.870
They are of similar dimensions,
both cartographers take advantage

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:20.300
of the lower margins to
include large text blocks.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.580
The depictions of North
Africa are very similar,

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:28.100
that's not too surprising as both
are based on Ptolemy's geography,

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.400
but the depiction of eastern
Asia on the two maps is very -

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.630
the similarity of the
depiction of eastern Asia

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:36.300
on the two maps is
very striking, indeed.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:40.350
As a couple speakers
mentioned earlier,

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:43.280
Marco Polo does not give
latitudes and longitudes,

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.250
and on both maps eastern
Asia is based on Marco Polo.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:52.990
And it's supremely unlikely that
two people would extrapolate Marco

01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:56.360
Polo's data so similarly
when Marco Polo says

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:03.420 position:56%
such city X is 15 days' journey west
of city Y, that leaves a lot of room

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:07.360
for interpretation and it's very
unlikely two cartographers would

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.930
interpret that information
similarly.

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:12.200
So we can see some dependence here,

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.090
and both cartographers also
placed the Island of Japan

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:19.990
at the eastern edge of the map.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:24.370
So in other work I've shown
an even close relationship

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:28.210
between the Martellus map
and Waldseemuller's 1507 map.

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:30.130
I don't have time to go
into those details today,

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:34.820
but I would like to look at the
part of Waldseemuller's 1507 map

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.460
that does not come from
Martellus, which is the New World.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:44.280
And what Waldseemuller did is
took the New World from the chart

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.700
of Caverio and adjusted that data

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.810
to the Ptolemaic projection
he was using.

01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:54.270
So what I'm saying, to
sum up a little bit,

01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:57.850
is the 1507 map is
basically information

01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:59.560
from two maps joined into one.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.670
So it's the Yale Martellus
map, information from that map,

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:08.170
and the depiction of the New
World taken from Caverio's chart.

01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:12.420
So the Carta Marina, moving on
to the issue of originality,

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.760
is based on an entirely
different cartographic system.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.140
So in the course of nine
years Waldseemuller decided

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:22.850
that the Ptolemaic system was
not the best system to use

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:24.150
in representing the world.

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:26.960
He chose instead to use
nautical chart cartography,

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.620
so an entirely different
cartographic foundation.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.510
Here, again, is the Carta Marina.

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:36.620
And he proclaims this
difference in the title,

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:37.920
it's called a nautical chart

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.880
that comprehensively shows the
Portuguese voyages in the shape

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.670
of the whole known world,
its regions and its limits

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:47.390
as they have been determined in
our times, and how they differ

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:49.050
from the tradition of the Ancients

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:52.200
and also areas not
mentioned by the Ancients.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.450 position:56%
So it's very clear that he's setting
aside Ancient cartography here

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:57.520
and I think we can
read into that Ptolemy,

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.540
he is setting Ptolemy aside.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:03.140
So he says it's based on
nautical charts and, in fact,

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.220
we know which nautical
chart it's based on,

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.520
it's based on the Caverio chart.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.890 position:56%
That's a bold claim, how can we know

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:12.250
that he had this specific
chart in his workshop?

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:16.200
In fact, if one looks at some of
the place names they're copied

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.060
from this chart, even down to
spelling errors and corrections.

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.410
And if we compare the
two charts we can see

01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:24.670
that what Waldseemuller has done

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:29.140
in implementing this new
cartographic system is follow the

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.310
outlines of the Caverio
chart very closely.

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:36.690
So the outlines and position of
Greenland are just about identical,

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:41.370
the Island of Pseudo-Labrador
just about identical,

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:47.720
the coast of South America very
similar, the non-Ptolemaic shape

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.690
and central location of Africa.

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:56.050 position:56%
These two south Asian peninsulas
are just about identical in outline,

01:05:56.050 --> 01:06:00.120
and the nodes of the rhumb line
network, a characteristic feature

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.250 position:56%
of nautical charts, are in
identical positions on the two maps.

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:09.450
So we can see this outline, he's
copied the outlines and format

01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:12.780
of this chart, this
nautical chart very closely.

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:18.320
So in making a world map
based not on Ptolemy,

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.220
but rather on nautical
charts he's set aside one

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:25.880
of the figureheads of
his 1507 world map.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.850
As we heard earlier from Don,

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:34.020
in the Carta Marina he follows
Columbus' thought quite closely,

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:39.120
and on the 1507 map he names the
New World after Amerigo Vespucci.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.580
As Don said, the name America does
not appear on the Carta Marina,

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.500
so he's come to realize that
Columbus' role in the discovery

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.230
of the New World was very important

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:51.060
and so he set aside
Vespucci, as well.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:55.570
So in the course of nine years
he's set aside the two figureheads

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:59.940
of his 1507 map and this is,
again, a really powerful indication

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.250
of how far he had come in these
nine years and what a departure

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:08.550
from the 1507 map the
Carta Marina is.

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:11.330
While I have said that the
Carta Marina is original,

01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:14.810
but I've just shown that
he followed the outlines

01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:19.050
of Caverio chart very closely,
so how is the map original?

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:22.010
If we zoom in a little
bit we can see

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.340
that on the Caverio
chart there's really just

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:28.170
about zero geographical
detail in the interior.

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:33.770
I'm now going to switch to exactly
the same part of the Carta Marina.

01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:36.070
There's geographical
detail everywhere,

01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:39.410
and that's where the originality
of the Carta Marina resides.

01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:44.780
He took the outlines from Caverio's
chart, but all this information,

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.120
all these details he's filled in
was the fruit of his own research.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:53.360
And, as you can see, I'll switch
between those images again, Caverio

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:57.930
and the Carta Marina, it is a very
rich collection of information.

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:01.450
And, again, this is where
the originality resides.

01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:07.220
So let's look at where he
gathered some of that information.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:11.920 position:56%
Looking at the whole chart, there's
a large text block in the lower left

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.090
in which Waldseemuller goes
through some of his sources,

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:16.620
lists some of his sources.

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.600
And what I'm going to do now, so
he tells us where he took some

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:24.900
of the information, he doesn't tell
us everything, but what I'm going

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.490
to go through and show
is which parts

01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:30.140
of the map come from which sources.

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:34.510
So one of the sources that
he mentions is Marco Polo,

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:38.250
the famous Venetian traveler of the
13th Century, who left descriptions

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:42.890
of the Middle East, Central
Asia, China and the Indian Ocean.

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:49.010
On the 1507 map all of
the eastern Asian part

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:51.370
of the map came from Marco Polo.

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:54.040
The situation on the Carta
Marina is very different,

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.900
there's just a few sparse legends,
which I've indicated with red dots,

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.880
that come from Marco Polo and
this is another indication

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:06.190
of the radical departure that the
Carta Marina is from the 1507 map,

01:09:06.190 --> 01:09:08.930
a completely different
use of sources.

01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:14.910
One of his other sources
was John of Plano Carpini,

01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:18.370
who as a Papal Legate
took a northern route

01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:22.760
to go see the Great Khan
in the 13th Century.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:30.720 position:56%
It's unlikely that - I'm sorry, here
we have - there's a problem here.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.540
Yes, so I'm sorry, here
are the legends that come

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.550
from John of Plano Carpini.

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:39.680
It's likely that Waldseemuller
took this information not directly

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.750
from Plano Carpini, but rather
by excerpts from Plano Carpini

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.830
that appear in Vincent of Beauvais.

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:50.310
There are very few manuscripts
of Plano Carpini's work.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:53.540
There are many more manuscripts
of Vincent of Beauvais

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.520
and his book was published
in Strasbourg in 1473,

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.430
so it's a much more
readily available source

01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:00.850
for the same information.

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:06.440
Another of his sources was Odoric
of Pordenone, an Italian missionary

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.010
and diplomat who traveled to
China in the early 14th Century.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:18.520
And here I show a map of the
places visited by Odoric,

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.050
and what we'll see that
you can see clearly

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:25.690
that the places he
visited are southern Asia.

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:28.720
When we look at the texts on
the Carta Marina that come

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:33.510
from Odoric we can see that
they are not in southern Asia,

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:38.060
and what we are to conclude is that
Waldseemuller had a better source

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.450
for southern Asia, a more
recent source so that

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:44.220
in southern Asia rather than
use Odoric, whom he did use

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:47.890
for some information, he
chose a more recent source

01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:49.190
who we'll get to later.

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:54.760
Another of his sources was Pierre
d'Ailly, a French Cardinal,

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:56.170
theologian and cosmographer

01:10:56.170 --> 01:11:01.320
who wrote a book called
the Amago mundi in 1410.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.540
Waldseemuller used that book
as a source for his description

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:09.840 position:56%
of the Caspian Sea and also for
some of the monstrous races in India

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.170
and I'll zoom in here and
show some of the illustrations

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:14.470
of those monstrous peoples.

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:21.420
Another of his important sources
was a book called Paesi novemente

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.340
retrovati or Newly
Discovered Countries,

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.730
a collection of travel narratives

01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:28.020
that was first published
in Italy in 1507.

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:32.730
One of the works in that
book was the travel narrative

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:37.790
of Alvise Cadamosto, a
Venetian merchant and navigator

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:40.130
who explored the western
coast of Africa for Portugal

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.120
in the middle of the 15th Century.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.170
And, as we would expect,
the text from Cadamosto are

01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:48.480
on the western coast of Africa.

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:53.720
Another source that appears in
that same book is the narrative

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.550
of Joseph the Indian or Priest
Joseph, a Christian priest

01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:59.730
from India who sailed
back to Portugal

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:03.150
with Cabral [Assumed Spelling],
and I've highlighted the texts

01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:05.140
that come from Joseph the Priest.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:08.790
One of those is the description of
Calicut that's included on the map,

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:11.750
the long text block there.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:15.260
The same book, the Paesi novamente
retravate [Assumed Spelling],

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:19.460 position:56%
was the source of a large text
block in the lower right-hand corner

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:23.440
of the map that goes through
the prices and sources

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.700
of spices available in Calicut.

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.770
And I think that text is
very interesting in terms

01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:34.050
of indicating the practical
orientation of the Carta Marina.

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:39.100
Another of his really crucial
sources was Ludovico de Varthema,

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:44.210
the Italian traveler and a keen
observer who visited Egypt,

01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:47.930
the Middle East, India and the
Islands of the Indian Ocean early

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.950
in the 15th [Assumed
Spelling] Century.

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:55.110
His narrative appears in the
Paesi novamente retravate,

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:59.370
but I'm quite confident that the
edition, well at least one edition

01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:04.610
of the work that Varthema consulted
was this illustrated edition

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:05.910
of 1515.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:12.310
We can see here the long texts on
the map that come from Varthema,

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:16.110
and we see that they are
concentrated in southern Asia

01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:20.870
and this gives us a hint as to why
Waldseemuller did not use much text

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:24.140
from Odoric because he had
a better, more recent source

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.990
of information in southern Asia.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.620
So in addition to looking at
the sources of some of the text

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.150
on the Carta Marina,
I'd like to look at some

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:35.820
of the sources of images.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.530
So, again, looking at the
originality of the map,

01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:41.620
looking at the research
that Waldseemuller, himself,

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:46.570
did to compile the information
that appears in the map.

01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:50.400
This is the image of
Mecca on the Carta Marina.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.250
It comes from precisely that
1515 edition of Varthema

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:55.550
that I mentioned earlier.

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:58.060
You can see the strong
similarity of the buildings.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.760
And, again, the book was published
just one year before the Carta

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.060
Marina was printed so Waldseemuller
was using the most recent sources

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.550
available to him.

01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:13.660 position:56%
This image of suttee in India, the
practice whereby a wife was supposed

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:18.590
to join her husband on
his funeral pyre, again,

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:22.580
comes from the same book, the
illustrated edition of Varthema.

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:26.920
One clue that confirms that
is the presence of this demon

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.990
in the two illustrations.

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:33.000
Here's a rhinoceros
on the Carta Marina.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.950
We're all familiar with the 1515
Dur [Assumed Spelling] illustration

01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:39.940
of the rhinoceros, some
little details indicate

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:43.820 position:56%
that his source was rather
Burgkmair's print of the rhinoceros,

01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:47.180
which was also printed in 1515.

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.120
I'll just put them
side-by-side there.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.800
So, again, making use of not
only the most recent text,

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.630
but also the most recent
illustrations.

01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:59.510 position:56%
And looking now at the southern part

01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:02.100
of the Carta Marina there's
a wonderful illustration

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.650
of King Manuel riding a sea monster

01:15:04.650 --> 01:15:08.570
and this proclaims visually
a symbolic indication

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.200
of Portuguese control
of the sea route

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.590 position:56%
around Africa from Portugal to Asia.

01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:19.930
And the source of that image I
suspect was Jacopo de' Barbari's

01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:22.230
View of Venice, where if we zoom

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:25.650
in a little bit we have
Neptune riding a sea monster

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:27.930
as protector of Venice.

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:30.340
But there's an additional
significance to the image

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:34.390
of King Manuel that I
want to touch upon here.

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:39.900
If we go back to Waldseemuller's
1507 map there are texts

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.660
about sea monsters, there are
no images, and the texts come

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.070
from medieval sources and they're
the sort of thing one would expect,

01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:49.420
they don't indicate - they indicate

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.680
that the ocean is a
dangerous place to travel.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.370
This image is entirely different,
it proclaims human control

01:15:57.370 --> 01:16:01.440
of sea monsters and, thus, symbolic
human domination of the seas.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.710
And I would suggest that this
contrast suggests a change

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:10.150
in Waldseemuller's conception of
the ocean from a place of danger

01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:13.780
to a place across which
human trade can be conducted.

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:20.700
And in, again, just nine years
that's a remarkable shift.

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.050 position:56%
So that's what I have to say about
the originality of the Carta Marina.

01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:27.000
I want to move on to the
fusion of the Carta Marina

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.380
and this suggestion, which
was made by Joseph Fisher,

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:35.860 position:56%
that the map did not circulate,
that the one surviving copy that was

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.200 position:56%
in the Schoner Sambelband [Assumed
Spelling] that is now at The Library

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.410
of Congress was a proof sheet.

01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:48.790
And one argument in favor
of that understanding is

01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:51.310
that there is only
one copy of the map,

01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:53.360
why is it that we have
only one copy?

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.620
And the same question holds
true for the 1507 map?

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:02.740
But, in fact, that's a very common
condition of 16th Century maps.

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:07.830
So I've compiled a little list here
of 16th Century maps that survive

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:11.080
in either 01 or 02 exemplars.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:17.300
So Giovani Contarini, Waldseemuller
owned 1511 Carta intineraria,

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.550
Rosselli's printed nautical chart.

01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:20.890
You can read through the list.

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:23.630
This list was very easy to compile

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:26.920
and makes no pretense
at completeness.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:32.520
It's very common that 16th
Century printed maps survive in 01

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.220
or 02 exemplars, and
just to continue to list

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.420
through the end of the century.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.360
Again, I could have made
this list much longer.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:43.440
So even some copies of
the Carta Marina printed

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:50.330
by Lorenz Fries survive
in 01 or again 1 exemplar.

01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:53.410
It's a very common condition, so
I don't think that can be taken

01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:58.280
as any evidence whatsoever that
the Carta Marina did not circulate.

01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:02.860
Well, what about providing some
evidence that it did circulate?

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:07.650
Well, the Carta Marina was used
as a model for Lorenz Fries' maps

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:15.000
of 1525, 1530 and 1531, so three
different editions, reprintings,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.630
if you will, with some
modifications of the Carta Marina.

01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:23.270
There's no exemplar of the
1525 edition that survives.

01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:30.590
We can look and compare one sheet
of the Waldseemuller 1515 map

01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:35.530
with the 1530 edition by Fries,
we can see they're very similar.

01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:39.260
So Fries went to the trouble
of printing another edition

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:43.550
of the Carta Marina, and it
strikes me as supremely unlikely

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:45.660
that he was using the one copy

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:49.140
that was also preserved
by Johannes Schoner.

01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:54.570
And just to show there's
only one surviving exemplar

01:18:54.570 --> 01:19:00.660
of the 1531 edition by Fries,
again, I think the fact

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:05.170
that the map was seen
as popular enough

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:07.890
to reproduce this way
indicates that there was more

01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:11.070
than just the one copy
that's come down to us.

01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:16.410
We can also see some interesting
hints of the availability

01:19:16.410 --> 01:19:19.990
of Waldseemuller's Carta
Marina to Norman cartographers

01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:23.700
at the middle of the 16th Century.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:27.510
So if we look at eastern Africa
and the Arabian Peninsula

01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:31.970
and the Vallard Atlas of 1547,
which is in the Huntington Library

01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:37.860 position:56%
in California, and we zoom in on
the Arabian Peninsula here is what's

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:44.110
probably Mecca in that chart
and it is very similar, indeed,

01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:49.080
to Mecca on Waldseemuller's
Carta Marina.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:55.280 position:56%
And I want to point out the crescent
at the top of both buildings,

01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:00.950
so we know that Waldseemuller took
his image from the image of Medina

01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:05.110
in the 15 edition of
Varthema, is it possible

01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:08.470
that that image was rather the
source for the Vallard Atlas?

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.670
But given that it does
not have the crescent

01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:14.310 position:56%
at the top I think the answer is no.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:20.900
And is it possible that the source
was rather the image of Mecca

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:25.450
from one of Fries'
reprintings of the Carta Marina?

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:27.560
And, again, I think
the answer is no.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:31.650
The image of Mecca in the
Vallard Atlas is more complex

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:36.460
architecturally than the
image in Fries' Carta Marina.

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:40.920
So I think Waldseemuller's Carta
Marina is the only plausible source

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:47.160
for this image and this indicates
the map had circulated to France.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.730
Looking at another similar example,

01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:55.190
this is Pierre Desceliers' 1546
world map at John Rylands Library,

01:20:55.190 --> 01:21:00.130
and I want to zoom in on the
image of suttee in India.

01:21:00.130 --> 01:21:03.900
Here it is, the image is a
bit indistinct so this piece

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.750
of evidence is not as strong
I think as that of Mecca,

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:11.900
but I want to point out we can see
the woman in the fire raising one

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:17.340
of her arms and we now have
multiple other sources,

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:19.560
potential sources to compare.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:25.190 position:56%
So here's the image of suttee in the
1515 Varthema, it doesn't strike me

01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:28.250
as a very close correspondence,
the woman is facing the other way,

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:31.390
is raising her other
arm, for example.

01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:35.060
Here's the image on
the Carta Marina,

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:38.490 position:56%
Waldseemuller's Carta Marina, again,
I think this image is much closer,

01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:43.540
there's just two people around the
woman, she's raising the same arm,

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.370
her attitude seems very similar.

01:21:47.530 --> 01:21:53.160
Here is the image on Fries' copy
of Waldseemuller's Carta Marina,

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.510
the woman's attitude
is quite different,

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:59.030
her arm is down instead of up.

01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:03.190
And, finally, the image in the
1522 Ptolemy, which was also based

01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:05.030
on Waldseemuller's Carta Marina

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:07.300
and the image here is
entirely different.

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.810
So really the image on
Waldseemuller's Carta Marina seems

01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:16.180 position:56%
like the most plausible source for
the image on the 1546 map and, thus,

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.170
further evidence that the
Carta Marina was available

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:20.800
to Norman cartographers.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:29.020
One more Norman example, here's
Pierre Desceliers' 1550 world map.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:36.010 position:56%
We zoom in on North America, this is
a representation of Roberval's Fort

01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:39.210
in Canada and it's familiar.

01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:43.870
It seems to have been copied
from the image of Mecca

01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:46.570
on Waldseemuller's Carta Marina.

01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:52.170
And we can go through again, I
want to highlight the presence

01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:57.230
of the buttresses there, and we
can go through the other candidates

01:22:57.230 --> 01:23:01.560
and I think it's fair to say, again
it's not completely solid evidence,

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.130
but I think it's fair to say that
Desceliers' image most likely comes

01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:09.480
from Waldseemuller's Carta
Marina and not from any

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.290
of the derivative images
of the city.

01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:15.370
And one more piece of evidence

01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:18.070
that the Carta Marina
did circulate appears

01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:22.010
in Abraham Ortelius' the
Theatrum orbis terrarum,

01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:26.130
first printed in 1570.

01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:29.750
Ortelius includes in the
work a catalog of his sources

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:33.540
and I've showed the first
page of that catalog here.

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:37.790
And zooming in on this
entry we can see

01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:41.640
that he cites Martin Waldseemuller,
universal navigation chart,

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.280
which many call a marine
chart, published in Germany,

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.880
and he adds that he thinks
this Waldseemuller is the same

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.470
as the aforementioned ilacomylus,

01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:53.010
which is Waldseemuller's
Latin pen name.

01:23:53.010 --> 01:23:56.700
So Ortelius cites the Carta
Marina as one of his sources,

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.840
that proves that the chart
did, in fact, circulate.

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.940
So a few conclusions.

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:10.690 position:56%
I think the development in
Waldseemuller's cartographic thought

01:24:10.690 --> 01:24:13.770
in the course of nine years is
something that's really remarkable

01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:20.150
and the originality and
all the work that went

01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:23.560
into the Carta Marina is
also quite impressive.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:28.870
The combination of research,
of not only textual sources

01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:33.960
in a substantial library of
contemporary geographical thought,

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.930
but also research for images, not
only in texts, in printed books,

01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:43.610
but also in other maps
is quite impressive.

01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:48.990
And, again, I think I've been able
to show, I hope I've been able

01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:53.410
to show that the map did, indeed,
circulate, that it was not confined

01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:56.570
to the single copy
that's come down to us.

01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:58.970
What we have was not
maybe a proof copy,

01:24:58.970 --> 01:25:04.690
but the map had a broader printing
history and it did circulate.

01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:07.510
Thank you very much.

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:15.040
[ Applause ]

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.340
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: If the
speakers want to come

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.780
up we can take some questions?

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:23.650
Are there any questions?

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.220
&gt;&gt; This is for Chet Van Duzer.

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:37.710 position:56%
What's remarkable about the 1507 map
is the presence of the Pacific Ocean

01:25:37.710 --> 01:25:46.020
and a well-defined west coast of
South America, but the 1516 map,

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:49.040
which is a nautical
chart, lacks that.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.720
So how do you explain that omission
and the fact if it's designed

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.780
for sailors it doesn't
have what he knew in 1507?

01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:04.030
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yes, I would say
that it's not actually an omission,

01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:07.620
it's a reflection of a
difference in intended audience

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.880
and purpose for the two maps.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.380 position:56%
So the Carta Marina in general
depicts less of the earth's surface,

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:18.670
not only in the West but
in all its other corridors.

01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:22.640
And I think that Waldseemuller
decided to make a more practical

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.850
and less theoretical map, one
that showed the parts of the earth

01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:29.470
that people were actually visiting

01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:33.410
or that there was an
immediate prospect of visiting

01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:36.300
and also a greater emphasis on
where trade was being conducted.

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:43.250 position:56%
Hence, I think the long list of
spices with their prices and sources

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:47.380
in the lower right-hand corner
of the map is a strong indicator

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:54.290 position:56%
of what I see as a greater interest
on practicality of the Carta Marina.

01:26:54.290 --> 01:27:01.460
So, again, I think the fact that he
doesn't try to show the West coast

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:08.460
of the New World is sort of a frank
admission that he doesn't know

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:13.530
about it and trying to create
a world map that focuses more

01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:15.610
on practical matters, I would say.

01:27:15.610 --> 01:27:17.850
&gt;&gt; Don McGuirk: I'd
like to add that on

01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:22.020
that far Pacific coast
there is a notation

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:27.190
that says beyond here is unknown,
so it doesn't necessarily mean

01:27:27.190 --> 01:27:28.930
that that's the West coast,

01:27:28.930 --> 01:27:32.330
the cartographer just
doesn't know whether beyond

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.970
that there is land
or sea or whatever.

01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:38.530
So if you take a close
look that notation is there

01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:41.860
and that may very well
be what he means,

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.910
he doesn't know what's beyond here.

01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:45.210
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Bill?

01:27:45.210 --> 01:27:53.880
&gt;&gt; Yes, my question is for Chet,
but I'd be interested if any

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.740
of the other speakers
have any opinion.

01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:04.850
What is your speculation as to why
there are only zero or one or two

01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:11.430 position:56%
of so many important maps that
presumably were relatively expensive

01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:14.420
and required a great
deal of effort to produce

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:18.710
and have essentially disappeared?

01:28:20.530 --> 01:28:24.370
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Wall maps, in
particular, don't survive well.

01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.760
So not for Waldseemuller's
Carta Marina

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:32.640
but for the Fries' re-editions, if
you will, they came with a pamphlet

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:37.060
that has instructions for
pasting the sheets onto the wall.

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:42.190
So one pastes the sheets onto the
wall and 15 years later or less

01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:45.980
or more, it doesn't matter, but
one remodels and the map goes away.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:49.960
And so the only reason the Carta
Marina has come down to us was

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.860
because it was preserved
in a different way,

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.650
placed into a codex
by Johannes Schoner.

01:28:55.650 --> 01:29:01.870
Not all the maps I listed were wall
maps, a large portion of them were.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:05.870
They were all large, I believe,
and large maps in general,

01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:08.600
aside from the question
of pasting them to walls,

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:12.820
just don't survive well, yes.

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:16.990
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: You can also
bring that up-to-date today,

01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:20.140
a map is only as good as sort
of the modern information

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:22.020
that kind of flows into it.

01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:24.720
Without some historical sense
that we need to keep these

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.530
for historical purposes
they quickly became obsolete

01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:30.940 position:56%
and probably used to start the fire.

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:38.600
So it's just like now, a
1972 roadmap, who cares?

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.540
So I think a lot of it has to
do with just the obsolescence

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:46.420
of the information on them.

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:51.270
You know, Schoner had a different
purpose, he used those maps

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:56.430
for probably astrological purposes
as opposed to geographical purposes

01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:58.580
and he basically tells
us in his bookplate

01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:01.480
that he was saving
them for posterity.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.250
So he very well knew what he was
doing with them, so without a bunch

01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:08.810
of Schoners around it's, you
know, they just go to the wind.

01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:13.500
&gt;&gt; I think that's an
interesting discussion,

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.850
but unfortunately we
also have information

01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:21.590
that suggested a thousand copies
of the 1507 map were produced.

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:27.460 position:56%
That's a huge number to be destroyed
indiscriminately it seems to me.

01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:31.140
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Assuming
you take him at his word.

01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:39.490
And what cartographer
doesn't lie or perhaps blow it

01:30:39.490 --> 01:30:41.580 position:56%
out of proportion what he was doing?

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:45.630
And even on that text block we're
not really sure exactly what he's

01:30:45.630 --> 01:30:51.600
referring to, you know, was he
referring to the 1513 Ptolemy,

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.190
a thousand copies of the
maps that were in there,

01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:57.660
you know, that sort of thing?

01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:01.370
The bigger questions with this map
that we didn't touch on, at all,

01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:04.000
and maybe Chet will touch
on a little bit of work

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.450
that we had started doing,
is we don't know where either

01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:08.140
of these maps were printed.

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:11.720
We don't know who did
the wood blocks.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:15.160
There's lots of mysterious
things doing

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.450
with the type faces on the map.

01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:20.790
These look like they weren't
these small little projects

01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:23.600
that we have imagined them to be.

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.540
This little teeny group
of cartographers

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:28.770
in Santiae [Assumed Spelling]
working away on these maps.

01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:33.760
Just the sources that Chet has
identified, and that's only a few

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:37.530
of the many, many, many, many
other sources that he pointed out,

01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:40.530
the access to this information had

01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:43.440
to be someplace else
besides this little village.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.440
And so if you want to
say a little something

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.280
about the type face research,

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:53.650
just to show the kind
of big project this was?

01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:58.420
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Well, when
I was at The Library working

01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:01.700
on my fellowship and John
was right across from me

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:05.520
in The Kluge Center we got
started looking at the type faces

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.470
and there are implications for
where the maps were printed,

01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:12.280
but I don't think we were
able to really take it

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.580
as far as we should have.

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.880
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: No, we weren't,

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.660 position:56%
but it turned out that there were
some 22 different printer type faces

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:21.960
on that map.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.250
In other words, the type
faces are usually associated

01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:26.570
with a single printer at this time

01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:31.790
and there's 22 different type faces
associated with different printers

01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:33.610
that appear on the Carta Marina.

01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:36.960
And then there was some symbology
that was also somewhat strange,

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:42.410
there's a backslash which we could
only find used by one printer

01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:46.020
who didn't really seem to have
anything to do with this group.

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:50.270
So there's a lot of mystery
about these two maps.

01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:53.220
For me there are always going

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.860
to be these bizarre perfect
filogical [Assumed Spelling]

01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.040
objects, there's just
enough information to kind

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:02.850
of grasp both the scholars
and the crazies who think

01:33:02.850 --> 01:33:04.780
that it was ancient aliens.

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:08.960
But when you start looking
at it just the sand just goes

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:13.400
through your hands and
it's very frustrating.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.100
Any other - Wes?

01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:22.280
&gt;&gt; This one is at least,
first, for Dr. McGuirk.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:29.570
When you look at the place names on
what at first looks like Florida,

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:36.350
but you're arguing is Cuba or
at least as thought by Columbus,

01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:40.820 position:56%
do any of the place names there line
up with any of these Asian sources

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:45.950
that Chet talked about or are they
all following Columbus' records

01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:47.250
of his voyage?

01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:49.490
Because you only hit
a few place names,

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:50.990
but there's an awful lot there.

01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:54.730
&gt;&gt; Don McGuirk: No, I think, and
I don't know if Chet has looked

01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:58.960
at this or not, but I think
the first, the northern three

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.740
or four are probably either
from Marco Polo or from voyages

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.240
by the English or maybe
even Portuguese [inaudible].

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:12.580
You get to a certain point
and it lines up very well

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:16.110
with Columbus but, no, my
thought was that the top three

01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:20.290
or four were probably Portuguese
or English or even Marco Polo.

01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:24.110
There's one that I'm
pretty sure was Marco Polo.

01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:27.830
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: I
haven't looked at them,

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:39.270
but that would certainly
be a lot of fun.

01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:40.570
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Ben?

01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:43.800
&gt;&gt; You showed how the distortion
of Africa is from the problem

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.900
of using the magnetic
declination, so when you look

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:51.010
at those maps Brazil
is also very distorted,

01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:55.280
so do you think you could apply the
same analysis to the distortions

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.130
of Brazil to explain
them on those maps?

01:34:59.130 --> 01:35:03.890
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar: I'm not
sure I understood perfectly.

01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:07.060
You are talking about the
misrepresentation of Brazil

01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:12.580
or the misplacement of Brazil?

01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:14.060
&gt;&gt; And misplaced.

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.360
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar: And stretched?

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.660
&gt;&gt; And stretched.

01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:20.100
So do you think if you did that
same kind of nice analysis you did

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:24.330
to explain that for Africa, you
could also do the same for Brazil?

01:35:24.330 --> 01:35:26.050
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar: Yes, absolutely.

01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:30.410
Well, there was a Portuguese
nobleman who made the voyage

01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:32.940
to Brazil, is called [inaudible].

01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:40.720
He was also a viceroy of India
during the middle 16th Century.

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:44.870
He explained in detail, it's
amazing his explanation,

01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:48.840
the reason for the misplacement
and the stretching and Africa

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.320
and the misplacement of Brazil.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:56.060
He interprets correctly that was
the affect of magnetic declination

01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:58.870
on the [inaudible]
measures by the pilots

01:35:58.870 --> 01:36:02.690
and transferred directly
to the charts.

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:08.460
That happens exactly with
Brazil, Brazil is closer to Lisbon

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:13.180
than it should be because of
magnetic declination, yes.

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:17.390
Not only Brazil, but Newfoundland.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.700
&gt;&gt; This is a question
for Chet or any of you.

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:26.180
obviously, all of these
maps are coming

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:31.410
out of the European Christian
tradition, but Chet showed a number

01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:35.160
of these representations
of the Caba and Mecca

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:42.150
and literally the Islamic passion
for calculating correctly the qibla

01:36:42.150 --> 01:36:44.790
from anywhere in the world,
latitude and longitude,

01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:47.960
to point towards that,
is there any evidence

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.540
for Islamic sources connected
with the qibla feeding

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:56.220
into this grand plan in any way?

01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.990
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: I
would have to say, no.

01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:04.180
There's a tradition in nautical
charts of representing the tomb

01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:09.950
of Muhammad as floating in
the air and it was believed,

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:15.180
the texts on the nautical charts
indicate that Muslims went to Mecca

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:19.210
to worship the tomb of Muhammad,
which of course is not in Mecca.

01:37:19.210 --> 01:37:25.220
So I would think that if any
information had been flowing

01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:29.120
from Islamic sources about Mecca
they certainly would not have made

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.420
that mistake.

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:33.350
In fact, Varthema, the one traveler

01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:35.260
that Waldseemuller
may have had a use

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:37.390
of was the first European I believe

01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:41.630
to have visited Mecca
and written about it.

01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:46.120
So if you're interested in the
history of European knowledge

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:52.980
of Mecca Varthema would be
a good source to consult.

01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.490
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Les, go ahead?

01:37:57.490 --> 01:38:03.110
&gt;&gt; Yes, this is for Mr. Gaspar.

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:09.970
The question is with respect to
the magnetic declinations off

01:38:09.970 --> 01:38:15.210
of the coasts of Africa what
was - did you measure what

01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:18.640
that declination would
be based upon, you know,

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.790
your analysis of those areas?

01:38:27.490 --> 01:38:31.190
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar: We have two
sources, one historical source,

01:38:31.190 --> 01:38:37.420
which is the [inaudible]
has just mentioned

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.940
in 1538 from Lisbon to Indian.

01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:47.470
It is the first known
exact observations

01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:49.000
of magnetic declination.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.820
It's about 40 or 50 [inaudible].

01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:57.600
Those were my preferred values
for making the calculations,

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:02.310 position:56%
but we have other sources which are
not historical which are the outputs

01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:10.750 position:56%
of more than geomagnetic models that
are based on the few measurements

01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:14.190
of old values of magnetic
declination.

01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:17.230
They measure it on the lava flows

01:39:17.230 --> 01:39:22.890
and all the sedimentary
deposits in lakes, et cetera.

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:28.270
And I would say they are very
accurate, but they are accurate

01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:30.700
within two, three or four degrees.

01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:35.340
So my modeling was based
on these two sources.

01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:39.460
But you asked something about the
values of magnetic declination.

01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:42.350
Well, we have a hint, we
have a historical hint,

01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:44.610
which is the name given to a Gulf

01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:50.100
in the Cantino Planisphere near
the very southern tip of Africa,

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:53.860
Gulf desgulish [Assumed
Spelling], Gulf of the Needles,

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:59.280
that was the place where the
magnetic needle pointed exactly

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.700
to the north.

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:04.820
We are absolutely sure about
that because several sources

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:07.340
at the time referred to it.

01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:10.380
And we also know from
[inaudible] that the values

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:13.190
of magnetic declination
in the Atlantic,

01:40:13.190 --> 01:40:16.800
in the south Atlantic
were very high,

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:20.830 position:56%
up to more than 20 degrees eastward.

01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:24.670
And that on the other side in
the Indian Ocean they reach

01:40:24.670 --> 01:40:35.680
about 15 degrees west, the
maximum value in the Indian Ocean,

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:42.230
and about 20 or 22 degrees in
the eastern side in the Atlantic,

01:40:42.230 --> 01:40:53.760
and about zero in the
Cape of Good Hope.

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.960
&gt;&gt; Mr. Gaspar, how do you
reconcile when you go all the way

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.900
around Africa and you
are in the Red Sea,

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:06.960
which is beautifully colored red,
the Portuguese makes its entry

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:10.010
so that you have this distortion,

01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:14.450
you refer to the declination
of the magnetic needle.

01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:19.090
However, when the Portuguese
make it into the Gulf of Suez

01:41:19.090 --> 01:41:23.610
or into the area of
Suez and depicting it

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:27.160
on the map far distorted
to the east, however,

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.770
knowing that Alexandria
[inaudible] and other places

01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:35.800
in the Mediterranean are far
more west, didn't they discover

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.930
that on a short distance which was
known to them already in the time

01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:50.960
that it couldn't be such a long
stretch or didn't it occur to them?

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:54.670
I'm just curious.

01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:57.380
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar: You had the
microphone to close your mouth,

01:41:57.380 --> 01:41:59.190
so I couldn't understand the words.

01:41:59.190 --> 01:42:00.490
I'm sorry.

01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:05.600
&gt;&gt; Okay, the short version
is the Red Sea was navigated

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:08.190
by the Portuguese, as well.

01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:11.810
Can you hear me now better?

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:15.500
Okay, it's now better?

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:21.680
Now better?

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.030
[laughter] Okay, just tell
me how should I hold it?

01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:29.250
Okay, the question is
when the Portuguese are

01:42:29.250 --> 01:42:37.410
in the Red Sea defining Suez or
defining Akaba [Assumed Spelling],

01:42:37.410 --> 01:42:40.400
places like this, which
were already known

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:45.740
about where the relative
position is to the Mediterranean

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:51.260
and when you have distortion
over in reality a short distance

01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:58.240
but on the map a very wide
distance did anybody notice

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:04.890
that this can't be?

01:43:17.130 --> 01:43:19.710
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar: Of course,
they knew they were distorted.

01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:21.700
They knew in the Mediterranean,

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:26.010
they knew to determine exactly
the direction of the north,

01:43:26.010 --> 01:43:27.690
the direction of the pull.

01:43:27.690 --> 01:43:30.570
And I talked a little
bit about that.

01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:34.730
Not only before the translation
of Bartholomew's geography,

01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:37.330
they already knew where
the north is,

01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:43.950
but after Bartholomew's
geography they had

01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:49.370
to have a very strong reason to
defy the authority of the classics

01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:52.110
and maintain the Mediterranean
tilted.

01:43:52.110 --> 01:43:55.160
And the very strong
reason was navigation.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:44:00.320
So only in the end of the
17th Century was the tilt

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.330
of the Mediterranean corrected.

01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:05.030
That one thing, yes, they knew.

01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:07.540
Maybe they didn't know the reason,

01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:12.050
but they knew it was distorted,
they knew it was tilted.

01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:16.380
The same thing for Africa,
not only for the stretching

01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:22.430 position:56%
and the distortions of the
coastlines but also for the mismatch

01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:26.190
between Africa and
the Mediterranean.

01:44:26.190 --> 01:44:29.900
Of course, the Isthmus
of Suez was enormous,

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:34.730
but those charts were intended
not to depict the world,

01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:39.140
not to depict the landmasses,
but to navigate.

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:42.790
So the orientation
of the coastline had

01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:45.470
to match the orientation
of the compass.

01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:48.990
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: I think
what is unique in some ways

01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:53.280
about Joaquim's work and
maybe this isn't coming

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:58.210 position:56%
out clearly is Joaquim has basically
put forth an instrumental theory

01:44:58.210 --> 01:45:00.070
of the Portolan Chart.

01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:02.410
In other words, you can't
look at the Portolan Chart

01:45:02.410 --> 01:45:04.270
like it's a geographic map.

01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:06.510
If you look at a Portolan
Chart you've got

01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:09.960
to realize what the
technology of navigation was.

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.690
This was supporting the
technology of navigation,

01:45:13.690 --> 01:45:15.900
so it doesn't matter
how the chart looks.

01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:21.870 position:56%
It could look totally baffling to
us as far as accuracy and distances,

01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:25.060
but when then you took it and
you used it with the tools

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:29.110
that were available for
navigation it worked as a diagram.

01:45:29.110 --> 01:45:34.340 position:56%
And all of these things have to be
brought together into the discussion

01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:38.650
of what is principally a
nongeographic instrument,

01:45:38.650 --> 01:45:41.930
and that really is the
difference in his work.

01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:47.380
He has taken this out of the
history of cartography and put it

01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:51.670
where it should be into the history
of navigation and technology.

01:45:51.670 --> 01:45:56.470
And so all of those old
filogical tools, what the shape

01:45:56.470 --> 01:46:00.580
of the coastline was, all that
kind of stuff are very immaterial

01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:04.150
to these charts when you put them
in the context of navigation,

01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:08.310
and that's the departure and
that really is the central -

01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:10.810
when you look at Joaquim's
very technical work

01:46:10.810 --> 01:46:16.230
and when he backs this up with his
mathematics it is 100% convincing

01:46:16.230 --> 01:46:19.560
that to a certain extent we had
been looking at these things

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.840
in very primitive ways
for very long.

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:27.720
And so you can't throw out all of
the filogical and toponym work,

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:31.600
but really this technical
instrumental thing has kind

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.510
of revolutionized the study
of what a Portolan Chart is.

01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:38.510
And I think you had a question?

01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:43.040
[ Applause ]

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.930
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar: I
couldn't say it better.

01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:47.820
Well, but this is not
an easy question.

01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:52.470
The way charts were constructed
it's not easy, it's not immediate,

01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:58.360
it's not by chance that historians
didn't reach the right explanation

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.650
before the present day.

01:47:00.650 --> 01:47:04.390
Because it's a subtle technical
question, you've got to know

01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:07.580
about navigation, about
theoretical cartography

01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:08.930
and about history, of course.

01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:10.230
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: And, by the way,

01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:12.490
Joaquim before he got his
Ph.D. was a naval navigator

01:47:12.490 --> 01:47:15.610
in the Portuguese Navy so, hence.

01:47:17.050 --> 01:47:19.230
The microphone?

01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:22.890
&gt;&gt; Related to that question

01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:27.070
and because I'm not technical I
can't answer this, but if they got

01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:33.410
to the same location in Egypt
or in that general area by going

01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:36.450
through the Mediterranean
and also by navigating

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:41.070
around Africa are the
errors offsetting in that

01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:43.460
or would they actually get
two different locations

01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:45.500
for the same point?

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.210
&gt;&gt; Joaquim Gaspar: That
is an excellent question.

01:47:47.210 --> 01:47:48.510
Thank you.

01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:52.770
Well, they would get
different things, of course.

01:47:52.770 --> 01:47:55.840
They got different things,
as a matter of fact,

01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.440
because the eastern side of the
Mediterranean didn't match the tip

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:05.110
of the Red Sea, didn't
match the Isthmus of Suez.

01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:08.990
Firstly, because of
magnetic declination,

01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:14.330
but not only because there is
another problem is even a more

01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:19.290
subtle problem which is the
fact that the earth is round

01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:23.140
and they didn't consider
the roundness of the earth.

01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:28.570
So everything you put on the
plane, every measurement you make

01:48:28.570 --> 01:48:30.710
in the spherical earth and put

01:48:30.710 --> 01:48:34.600
on the plane is geometrically
inconsistent.

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:41.280
And the final position of some
port depends on the way you use

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:44.140
to plot that part on the chart.

01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:47.140
Did I answer your question?

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:49.510
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: And
one last question?

01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:50.810
Arthur, go ahead?

01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:56.220
&gt;&gt; I'm a little confused
at the end of all of this.

01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:58.480
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: You're
where you started then?

01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:04.940
&gt;&gt; Well, I've come full circle
to back where I've begun.

01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:10.350
The [inaudible] map was 270
approximately degrees and one

01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:13.380
of the revolutions of the
Waldseemuller 1507 map was

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:16.190
that it was a 360-degree view.

01:49:16.190 --> 01:49:20.250
When we go to the 1516 map
and we're maybe somewhere

01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:23.270
in between 270 and 360 degrees.

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:26.060 position:56%
It's obviously not a 360-degree map.

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:27.680
So all this is quite clear.

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.290
Also, the fact that the
area that you've identified

01:49:32.290 --> 01:49:37.830
as the Asian Peninsula on
the 1516 map is very similar

01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:43.560
and probably copied from the
1507 map, is that correct?

01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:46.440
But then we get to the two
cartouches [Assumed Spelling]

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:50.630
which clearly show two
separate hemispheres, I think,

01:49:50.630 --> 01:49:56.210 position:56%
in the 1507 map, an eastern
hemisphere and a western hemisphere.

01:49:56.210 --> 01:50:01.170
The western hemisphere shows
what is apparently South America

01:50:01.170 --> 01:50:03.370
and something else north.

01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:08.480 position:56%
If you look at the eastern cartouche
it also shows a fairly complete

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.810
picture of what was purported
to be Asia with a vast distance

01:50:12.810 --> 01:50:16.280
between that and Chibango
[Assumed Spelling] or Japan.

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.750
How do you reconcile
those cartouches

01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:22.730
with the other information
that you're presenting?

01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:27.380
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Well, I
will give you one example.

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:28.870
For instance, when you look

01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:33.500
at the 1507 it shows a
fairly large continent.

01:50:34.690 --> 01:50:38.890
That continent is only there,
that space is only there

01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:42.560
so you can put the toponyms there.

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:46.160
Anyone that explored that
coast would not have gone more

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.290
than half a mile inland.

01:50:49.290 --> 01:50:53.880
So on the 1507, although it looks
like a fairly significant strip

01:50:53.880 --> 01:51:00.200
of land there, it's only there to
allow space to put the toponyms in.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:01.920
And, again, on the west coast

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.070
of that it says they don't
know what's beyond here.

01:51:05.070 --> 01:51:10.130 position:56%
So really from that point to the end
you don't know whether it's land,

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:11.870
you don't know whether it's sea.

01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:15.110
So when you combine those
two it really isn't a -

01:51:15.110 --> 01:51:18.080
he put 360 degrees there,

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:21.960
but he didn't put 360
degrees of information there.

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.260
Does that make sense?

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:24.560
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: So, Arthur,

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:26.490
are you really asking
what the retraction is?

01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:30.510
Is there some sort of
backward movement here or?

01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:49.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:52.150
&gt;&gt; To the east of that there's
the Island of San Paolo and then

01:51:52.150 --> 01:51:57.220
to the east of that there is Asia
or what purports to be Asia I mean

01:51:57.220 --> 01:52:03.550
in contemporary vision, and I just
don't understand how you reconcile

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:05.120
that with your arguments?

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:08.290
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: With
the arguments that it's ...

01:52:08.290 --> 01:52:09.980
&gt;&gt; That it's Asia?

01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:12.140
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: That
it's Asia - oh, okay,

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.440
now I understand your question.

01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:16.150
&gt;&gt; And, also, I mean if
you - and this is according

01:52:16.150 --> 01:52:19.930
to my conversations
with John Hessler,

01:52:19.930 --> 01:52:29.000
if you re-project the Ptolyemaic
view to a more regular view,

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.710
to the one that's portrayed

01:52:31.710 --> 01:52:35.820
in the cartouches those
two are the same shape.

01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:41.940
The shape of that what
you call narrow landmass,

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:45.900
which is now re-projected
to become the larger mass

01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:49.520
in the right-hand cartouche,
that's pretty close

01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.570
to what we might consider to
be the shape of South America.

01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:55.540
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yes, let
me - and I can only talk

01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:02.060
to the northwest continent - so
if you take Columbus' concept

01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:04.820
of the size of the
earth it's much smaller.

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:09.280
Martellus, right, wasn't that
the gentleman, he believed that -

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:14.840
he did his own research on how
many miles there were to a degree

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:16.930
and his was much shorter.

01:53:16.930 --> 01:53:19.840
I can't give you the exact
numbers, but we could talk

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.740
about it later, I can
find it for you.

01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:28.040 position:56%
So if you take his concept of how
big, the circumference of the earth,

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:30.930
number one, and then
you take his concept

01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:37.340
of how far east Asia extended,
he believed along with Martellus

01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:42.150
that Asia extended
much further east.

01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:46.760
So if you take Columbus'
view of the size

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:51.470
of the earth plus the
eastern extent of Asia,

01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:57.540
that triangle of Asia is
right where Florida is.

01:53:57.540 --> 01:53:59.280
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well, I guess
we will leave it at that,

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:01.160
and you can see that
we've solved all

01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:03.220
of these riddles of
cartography today.

01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:08.810
I just want to invite all of
you, this evening is the annual,

01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:12.780
2016 annual JI Kislak lecture.

01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:18.450
It is going to be given by the
writer and renowned historian,

01:54:18.450 --> 01:54:21.230
David Sobel, who is sitting
in the audience right here.

01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:26.760 position:56%
It is going to be on mapping the
southern hemisphere, another mystery

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.510
of cartography and astronomy.

01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:34.230
And I would love for
all of you to come.

01:54:34.230 --> 01:54:37.130
At the present moment, however,
I can invite all of you to go

01:54:37.130 --> 01:54:40.250
out the door and make a left
directly into the Widdall Pavilion

01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:43.240
and help yourselves
to a glass of wine.

01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:44.650
And thank you, all, for coming.

01:54:44.650 --> 01:54:46.760
[applause]

01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:50.410
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
