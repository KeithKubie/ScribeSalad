00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.140
hello and welcome back so as you recall

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
hello and welcome back so as you recall
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.669
hello and welcome back so as you recall
in our last lesson we went ahead and

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679
in our last lesson we went ahead and
 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.860
in our last lesson we went ahead and
created these awesome leaderboards but

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
created these awesome leaderboards but
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.020
created these awesome leaderboards but
it turns out that they're pretty boring

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
it turns out that they're pretty boring
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.939
it turns out that they're pretty boring
because nobody has submitted any scores

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
because nobody has submitted any scores
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.950
because nobody has submitted any scores
to any of them and that's because we

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
to any of them and that's because we
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.330
to any of them and that's because we
haven't hooked up the logic to do that

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
haven't hooked up the logic to do that
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.300
haven't hooked up the logic to do that
yet so gosh we should fix that let's do

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
yet so gosh we should fix that let's do
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.790
yet so gosh we should fix that let's do
that in this lesson so I'm going to stop

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
that in this lesson so I'm going to stop
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980
that in this lesson so I'm going to stop
our application here or I guess it is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
our application here or I guess it is
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.950
our application here or I guess it is
stopped all right go and so like in the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
stopped all right go and so like in the
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.130
stopped all right go and so like in the
last chapter we created a a Jeevan

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
last chapter we created a a Jeevan
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.560
last chapter we created a a Jeevan
manager class that basically dealt with

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
manager class that basically dealt with
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.450
manager class that basically dealt with
achievements I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
achievements I'm going to go ahead and
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.700
achievements I'm going to go ahead and
create our own leaderboard manager class

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710
 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.860
it's going to be a subclass of Venice

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870
it's going to be a subclass of Venice
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.110
it's going to be a subclass of Venice
object and here we go now I'm actually

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
object and here we go now I'm actually
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.880
object and here we go now I'm actually
going to do kind of the hacky thing that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
going to do kind of the hacky thing that
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.830
going to do kind of the hacky thing that
we did in the last lesson where we're

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
we did in the last lesson where we're
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840
we did in the last lesson where we're
going to start off by submitting a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
going to start off by submitting a
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.759
going to start off by submitting a
hard-coded string representing our

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
hard-coded string representing our
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010
hard-coded string representing our
leaderboard I'm doing that mostly just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
leaderboard I'm doing that mostly just
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.120
leaderboard I'm doing that mostly just
because I think it's easier to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
because I think it's easier to
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130
because I think it's easier to
understand the creation of our score

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
understand the creation of our score
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.859
understand the creation of our score
object this way and then we'll go ahead

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
object this way and then we'll go ahead
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289
object this way and then we'll go ahead
and clean it up in the next lesson so

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
and clean it up in the next lesson so
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.679
and clean it up in the next lesson so
this is going to have one public method

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
this is going to have one public method
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.920
this is going to have one public method
at least for now and that will be submit

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
at least for now and that will be submit
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.820
at least for now and that will be submit
score and there's our in that represents

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
score and there's our in that represents
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.310
score and there's our in that represents
our score two liter board and this is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
our score two liter board and this is
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620
our score two liter board and this is
our NS string that's going to represent

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
our NS string that's going to represent
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.970
our NS string that's going to represent
our leaderboard ID now to implement this

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980
 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.900
there it is now as you recall in our

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910
there it is now as you recall in our
 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.730
there it is now as you recall in our
achievement manager the way we dealt

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
achievement manager the way we dealt
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740
achievement manager the way we dealt
with achievements was by creating a gpg

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
with achievements was by creating a gpg
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.500
with achievements was by creating a gpg
achievement object that we created using

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510
achievement object that we created using
 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.780
achievement object that we created using
the class method achievement with ID and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
the class method achievement with ID and
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850
the class method achievement with ID and
we passed in our unique string

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
we passed in our unique string
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350
we passed in our unique string
associated with our achievement

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
associated with our achievement
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.210
associated with our achievement
basically going to do the same thing

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220
basically going to do the same thing
 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.150
basically going to do the same thing
with our leaderboard manager although we

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160
with our leaderboard manager although we
 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.230
with our leaderboard manager although we
don't actually create a leaderboard

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
don't actually create a leaderboard
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.960
don't actually create a leaderboard
object we create a score object and this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
object we create a score object and this
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.170
object we create a score object and this
score is associated with a specific

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180
score is associated with a specific
 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.300
score is associated with a specific
leaderboard that is going that the score

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310
leaderboard that is going that the score
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.550
leaderboard that is going that the score
is going to be submitted to so let me

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
is going to be submitted to so let me
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.770
is going to be submitted to so let me
show you what I mean so we're going to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
show you what I mean so we're going to
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.390
show you what I mean so we're going to
call gpg score scored to submit equals

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
call gpg score scored to submit equals
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.290
call gpg score scored to submit equals
gpg score score with leaderboard ID at

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
gpg score score with leaderboard ID at
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.440
gpg score score with leaderboard ID at
this point we can say scored to submit

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450
this point we can say scored to submit
 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.740
this point we can say scored to submit
value equals the score that we've passed

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
value equals the score that we've passed
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.040
value equals the score that we've passed
in and then we tell our score to submit

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050
in and then we tell our score to submit
 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.560
in and then we tell our score to submit
itself to the leaderboard so we would

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570
itself to the leaderboard so we would
 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.980
itself to the leaderboard so we would
say score to submit submit score with

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990
say score to submit submit score with
 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.720
say score to submit submit score with
completion handler we get back in our

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
completion handler we get back in our
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.270
completion handler we get back in our
completion handler two things we get an

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
completion handler two things we get an
 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.150
completion handler two things we get an
error object and a gpg score report the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160
error object and a gpg score report the
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.070
error object and a gpg score report the
air object is what you would expect it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
air object is what you would expect it
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.690
air object is what you would expect it
would display an error if something

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
would display an error if something
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.390
would display an error if something
shows up the gpg score report is fairly

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
shows up the gpg score report is fairly
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.910
shows up the gpg score report is fairly
interesting let's take a look at this so

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920
interesting let's take a look at this so
 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.850
interesting let's take a look at this so
first we'll do if error I don't know NS

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860
first we'll do if error I don't know NS
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.280
first we'll do if error I don't know NS
log this is terrible and we'll have our

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
log this is terrible and we'll have our
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.930
log this is terrible and we'll have our
error localized message there we go look

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
error localized message there we go look
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.550
error localized message there we go look
lies description otherwise

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560
 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.610
that's just display this is your score

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620
that's just display this is your score
 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.620
that's just display this is your score
report but if you'll kind of notice here

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630
report but if you'll kind of notice here
 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.630
report but if you'll kind of notice here
we could actually look at the report

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640
we could actually look at the report
 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.979
we could actually look at the report
itself it's got a bunch of interesting

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989
itself it's got a bunch of interesting
 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.509
itself it's got a bunch of interesting
properties you can see here see it's got

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519
properties you can see here see it's got
 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.670
properties you can see here see it's got
a few bullion's for is this the high

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
a few bullion's for is this the high
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.589
a few bullion's for is this the high
score for the local player for all time

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599
score for the local player for all time
 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.930
score for the local player for all time
is this this players high score for this

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940
is this this players high score for this
 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.940
is this this players high score for this
week is it you know the high score for

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950
week is it you know the high score for
 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.460
week is it you know the high score for
this player for today and if it isn't if

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470
this player for today and if it isn't if
 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.050
this player for today and if it isn't if
it isn't any of those things if the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060
it isn't any of those things if the
 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.940
it isn't any of those things if the
player had submitted a higher score

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950
player had submitted a higher score
 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.949
player had submitted a higher score
earlier we can then ask you know what

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959
earlier we can then ask you know what
 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.300
earlier we can then ask you know what
was that high score that the player

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310
was that high score that the player
 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.970
was that high score that the player
submitted earlier and so if we wanted to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980
submitted earlier and so if we wanted to
 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.770
submitted earlier and so if we wanted to
for instance bring up our own

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780
for instance bring up our own
 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.449
for instance bring up our own
notification that said hey

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459
notification that said hey
 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.460
notification that said hey
congratulations you beat your old score

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470
congratulations you beat your old score
 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.440
congratulations you beat your old score
we could do that here we could do that

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450
we could do that here we could do that
 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.360
we could do that here we could do that
by basically analyzing the score report

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370
by basically analyzing the score report
 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.520
by basically analyzing the score report
and doing something interesting with it

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530
and doing something interesting with it
 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.949
and doing something interesting with it
in this case i'm not going to i'm just

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959
in this case i'm not going to i'm just
 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.379
in this case i'm not going to i'm just
going to put out to the log but that's

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389
going to put out to the log but that's
 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.460
going to put out to the log but that's
still pretty interesting i suppose and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470
still pretty interesting i suppose and
 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.020
still pretty interesting i suppose and
then i'm going to jump it to our game

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030
then i'm going to jump it to our game
 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.050
then i'm going to jump it to our game
model here and i suppose after we've

that's fantastic and let's go in and
 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:25.020
that's fantastic and let's go in and
play an easy game due to higher than 25

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030
 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.550
good Hey look at that four guesses

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560
good Hey look at that four guesses
 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.680
good Hey look at that four guesses
actually it's uh that's pretty good I

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690
actually it's uh that's pretty good I
 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.520
actually it's uh that's pretty good I
don't know if I'm going to be able to

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530
don't know if I'm going to be able to
 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.469
don't know if I'm going to be able to
beat that but we can look at the log

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479
beat that but we can look at the log
 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.120
beat that but we can look at the log
here and we can see that we've got our

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130
here and we can see that we've got our
 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.420
here and we can see that we've got our
score report back and our boolean is

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430
score report back and our boolean is
 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.430
score report back and our boolean is
reporting yes this is the high score for

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440

these values are all null I don't

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289
these values are all null I don't
 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.899
these values are all null I don't
believe this is an indicative of the

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:55.909
believe this is an indicative of the
 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:57.250
believe this is an indicative of the
fact that this is the first time I've

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260
fact that this is the first time I've
 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.230

are always set to know if what you've

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550
are always set to know if what you've
 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.670
are always set to know if what you've
submitted is a new high score so you'll

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680
submitted is a new high score so you'll
 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.680
submitted is a new high score so you'll
either get the bullion's you know equal

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690
either get the bullion's you know equal
 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.620
either get the bullion's you know equal
to yes or you will get hey this is the

that you did not beat now if we were to
 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.270
that you did not beat now if we were to
go back and play this again let me just

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280
go back and play this again let me just
 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.500
go back and play this again let me just
show you something here let me play

show you something here let me play
 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:25.600
show you something here let me play
really fast due to now you'll notice

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610
really fast due to now you'll notice
 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.790
really fast due to now you'll notice
that my score report came back as know

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800
that my score report came back as know

that my score report came back as know
the entire thing is null this is a

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:29.659
the entire thing is null this is a
 

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:31.269
the entire thing is null this is a
little quirk with the system I've talked

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:31.279
little quirk with the system I've talked
 

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.410
little quirk with the system I've talked
with the team I think we're going

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:32.420
with the team I think we're going
 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.120
with the team I think we're going
to change this behavior but what's

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.130
to change this behavior but what's
 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.220
to change this behavior but what's
happening right now is the system is

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.230
happening right now is the system is
 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.410
happening right now is the system is
smart enough to know one this is a

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:38.420
smart enough to know one this is a
 

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.210
smart enough to know one this is a
leaderboard where the lower score is

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220
leaderboard where the lower score is
 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.430
leaderboard where the lower score is
better and that i have just attempted to

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440
better and that i have just attempted to
 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.800
better and that i have just attempted to
submit a score that's higher than what i

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:44.810
submit a score that's higher than what i
 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.290
submit a score that's higher than what i
submitted just just before in this case

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300
submitted just just before in this case
 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.270
submitted just just before in this case
this isms as well i'm not going to

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280
this isms as well i'm not going to
 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.590
this isms as well i'm not going to
bother submitting the score of five

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:50.600
bother submitting the score of five
 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.020
bother submitting the score of five
guesses because i know that it's not any

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.030
guesses because i know that it's not any
 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.970
guesses because i know that it's not any
better than the score of four that i

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:54.980
better than the score of four that i
 

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.210
better than the score of four that i
submitted you know just a minute ago the

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.220
submitted you know just a minute ago the
 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.370
submitted you know just a minute ago the
unfortunate side effect of that is that

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:00.380
unfortunate side effect of that is that
 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.260
unfortunate side effect of that is that
i do not get a score report when the

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:02.270
i do not get a score report when the
 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.850
i do not get a score report when the
library decides that is not going to

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:03.860
library decides that is not going to
 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.220
library decides that is not going to
submit it for me i'd like to see us

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:06.230
submit it for me i'd like to see us
 

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.530
submit it for me i'd like to see us
generate a kind of a fake score report

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:08.540
generate a kind of a fake score report
 

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.330
generate a kind of a fake score report
anyway and hopefully that will happen

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:10.340
anyway and hopefully that will happen
 

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.150
anyway and hopefully that will happen
but i guess that may be the main lesson

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:13.160
but i guess that may be the main lesson
 

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.700
but i guess that may be the main lesson
to take away here is don't count on a

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:15.710
to take away here is don't count on a
 

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.970
to take away here is don't count on a

you might need to check and see if it's

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:20.660
you might need to check and see if it's
 

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.840
you might need to check and see if it's
nil and if it is you know take the

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:22.850
nil and if it is you know take the
 

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.270
nil and if it is you know take the
appropriate actions so so there you go

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280
appropriate actions so so there you go
 

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.640
appropriate actions so so there you go
if i were to stop this by the way and

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:27.650
if i were to stop this by the way and
 

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:33.280
if i were to stop this by the way and
