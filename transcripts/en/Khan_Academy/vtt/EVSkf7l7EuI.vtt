00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.870
Voiceover: In the last video
we had a little bit of review

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.203
of classical economics
and then we talked about

00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:07.403
how Keynesian thinking was a departure,

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:09.473
especially, and why it
might have made sense

00:00:09.473 --> 00:00:11.453
in the context of the Great Depression,

00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:13.536
where the economy was operating well below

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:14.703
its potential.

00:00:14.703 --> 00:00:15.951
What I want to do -

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:18.535
It may be true anytime that
the economy is operating

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:20.136
well below its potential.

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:21.370
What I want to talk about in this video

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.136
is how Keynesian thinking
can sometimes be dangerous.

00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:25.702
One thing I do want to
emphasize over the course

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:29.067
of this video is Keynesian
policies are often associated

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:31.804
with people on the left,
with policies on the left,

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:34.119
democrats in the United States.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:37.069
The republicans also, for the most part,

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.869
especially mainstream republicans,

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:41.003
especially the last
several administrations,

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.804
they have practiced what
can only be described

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:45.138
as Keynesian policies.

00:00:45.138 --> 00:00:47.704
When the economy started
to recede, they tried

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:51.119
to stimulate it by shifting
aggregate demand to the right

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.869
somehow and we'll talk about
that they tried to do it

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:54.703
in a slightly different
way, through tax cuts,

00:00:54.703 --> 00:00:56.804
instead of government spending increases,

00:00:56.804 --> 00:01:00.004
but it was Keynesian in
its underlying thinking.

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.870
Now just as a bit of a
backup, I'm going to talk

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.204
a little bit more about that
cycle that we talked about

00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:06.137
in the last video.

00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:10.620
If you have person A, person
B, person C, and person D

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.953
or maybe their firms.

00:01:11.953 --> 00:01:17.403
B supplies A, A supplies D, D supplies C,

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:20.008
and C supplies B, and for
the sake of simplicity,

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.138
we said that they're all
supplying 2 units of their good

00:01:23.138 --> 00:01:26.170
and service to each other.

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:29.619
Let's just say that C has a
bad dream, feels pessimistic,

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.536
ate something bad and all of
a sudden isn't feeling good

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:35.369
about the future and wants to buy less,

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.137
just out of caution.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.536
Maybe he wants to hoard a bit of cash,

00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:40.806
just in case C needs it.

00:01:40.806 --> 00:01:45.140
He buys a little bit
less from D, but D says,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.536
"Gee, my business is
bad, now I can't afford

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:50.284
"as many goods and
services," buys less from A,

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:53.005
A does the same thing from
B, and then B's business

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:57.203
is bad, so buys less stuff
from C, goods and services

00:01:57.203 --> 00:02:01.314
from C, and now C feels
like they're psychic,

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:02.848
even though we see that it was actually

00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:06.585
a self-fulfilling prophecy,
that C's pessimism actually led

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:08.917
to that reality actually occurring.

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:11.119
In a worst case, it actually
could get worse and worse.

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.480
C could say, "Wow, I was
pessimistic and I was right.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.896
"My business actually did get bad."

00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:18.918
Maybe it even got worse
than C had expected

00:02:18.918 --> 00:02:21.674
and then C could then say,
"I'm going to buy even less.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:26.507
"Maybe I'm only going to
buy a half from D now,"

00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:28.423
and then D says, "Maybe I'm
only going to buy a half

00:02:28.423 --> 00:02:31.174
"from A," and that cycle
could go down and down

00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:33.130
and down until each of them
are just buying exactly

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.596
just what they need to get
by, even though they all

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:37.532
could be producing more,
the economy could be

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.464
producing more and could
be wealthier and they all

00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:41.331
could be way better off.

00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:45.864
This is, at least in my mind,
a pretty good description

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:47.486
of what happens in a depression,

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:49.664
especially the Great Depression.

00:02:49.664 --> 00:02:52.798
So there might be a
rationale to say, "Hey, look,

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:55.598
"why doesn't the government
come here at some point

00:02:55.598 --> 00:02:58.866
"in this economy and stimulate demand?"

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.653
Why doesn't the government come here?

00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:02.820
Let's say B is already buying 1 from C,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.819
the government comes and
says, "Hey, I'll buy another 1

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.389
"from C," and then C says,
"Hey, things are good again.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.455
I can buy 2 from D," D can buy 2 from A,

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:18.990
and then A can buy 2 from
B and then B can buy 2

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.020
from C and so things have gotten back

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.389
to their potential state.

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.791
The economy is revving.

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.519
In an ideal state, the
government would say,

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.353
"Hey, my work is done now.

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:31.520
"I can now take a step
back and I don't want

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.853
"to overheat the economy.

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:34.603
"I don't want to push
aggregate demand too far

00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:39.055
"to the right and cause
inflation," so they will take

00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:40.186
a step back.

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:42.456
The danger here is that
this is not so easy

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:43.656
for governments to do.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.603
This was some type of stimulus, some type

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:46.990
of government spending.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.353
Although maybe it was a tax decrease,

00:03:50.353 --> 00:03:52.056
so maybe B could've
increased their demand,

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:54.186
but either way, once you
do a policy like this,

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:55.790
and let's say it was government spending,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.519
it's very hard to unwind.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.853
This government spending might have been

00:03:58.853 --> 00:04:00.721
for a project that some people like,

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:02.520
it might have employed many, many people.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.789
Those people are voters.

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:05.853
They're not just going to
sit there while you cancel

00:04:05.853 --> 00:04:08.185
this government project.

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:11.603
There's a risk that maybe
there is a justification

00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:14.521
for a Keynesian policy,
but when it's time to undo

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:17.185
that Keynesian policy,
to undo that stimulus,

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:18.604
it's very hard to do it.

00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:20.537
It's kind of a sticky policy.

00:04:20.537 --> 00:04:22.516
What you might have is when times are bad,

00:04:22.516 --> 00:04:25.984
you do Keynesian stimuli,
but when times are good,

00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:28.516
you're not willing to undo it
and if that Keynsian stimuli

00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:30.693
involves more and more deficit spending

00:04:30.693 --> 00:04:32.275
or more and more government spending,

00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:34.611
then the government size
is just going to grow

00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:36.650
relative to the economy, or
the deficit is just going

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.193
to grow relative to the
economy and you're never going

00:04:38.193 --> 00:04:41.861
to unwind it, because
unwinding is unpopular.

00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:44.108
I want to be clear that this
is true of both the left

00:04:44.108 --> 00:04:45.112
and the right.

00:04:45.112 --> 00:04:48.047
In the stereotypical
sense, the left might say,

00:04:48.047 --> 00:04:50.778
"Hey, let's do a Keynesian
stimulus by spending more,"

00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:53.248
so the government spends
more and let's hold

00:04:53.248 --> 00:04:56.049
our revenue constant, our tax revenue,

00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:57.715
let's hold it constant.

00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.649
Obviously, the government
would have to borrow

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:02.597
more money to fund this, or
sometimes they might even

00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:05.398
increase taxes if they actually
wanted to be more purist

00:05:05.398 --> 00:05:07.730
about it, but this is
the variety that you see

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.328
and this would be a true stimulus.

00:05:09.328 --> 00:05:12.061
This is using the fiscal
lever to put more demand

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.326
in the economy, but in
the right you often see

00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:15.551
the other side.

00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:18.326
You see taxes being
lowered, essentially saying

00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:19.468
instead of the government spending it,

00:05:19.468 --> 00:05:21.472
why don't we let people
decide where to spend it

00:05:21.472 --> 00:05:24.741
and they might spend it
in a more efficient way,

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.742
but it's going to be a
stimulus, because spending

00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:27.991
is held constant.

00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:30.825
Then you have the double
where you do both sides

00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:32.794
of it, where you lower the taxes,

00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:34.657
you lower the inbound revenue,

00:05:34.657 --> 00:05:36.414
and you increase spending.

00:05:36.414 --> 00:05:39.194
This is true, this has been
done by both republican

00:05:39.194 --> 00:05:40.832
and democratic administrations.

00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:42.794
Lowering taxes, but
then going and starting

00:05:42.794 --> 00:05:45.261
a hugely expensive war and obviously

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.575
this would increase deficits.

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:48.432
There might even be a
justification for doing any

00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:52.825
of these, a Keynesian
justification if the economy truly

00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:55.993
is operating well below its potential.

00:05:55.993 --> 00:05:58.194
The tough thing is it might be justified,

00:05:58.194 --> 00:06:01.075
you actually don't know
exactly where that potential is

00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:03.460
and you might not be able
to unwind this once you get

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.075
to your potential and
then you might overheat

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:07.073
the economy, might lead to inflation,

00:06:07.073 --> 00:06:10.594
and that actually might
undermine the productivity

00:06:10.594 --> 00:06:12.537
of the actual economy.

00:06:12.537 --> 00:06:15.258
The other negative of a Keynesian mindset

00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:17.126
is what happens over the long run.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:19.323
In the short run this
might make a lot of sense.

00:06:19.323 --> 00:06:22.159
Let's prime the pump, let's
get the cycle to happen

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:24.407
in the right away again,
but in the long run,

00:06:24.407 --> 00:06:26.409
it's essentially just trying
to get people to consume

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:27.491
and consume more.

00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:29.063
You'll often hear, when
the economy slows down

00:06:29.063 --> 00:06:30.742
a little bit, you'll hear the president,

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:32.575
you'll hear politicians
say, "Hey, we're just trying

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:33.741
"to get people to spend more

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.128
"through some combination
of these Keynesian policies.

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:37.792
"We're going to lower taxes,
we're going to increase

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:40.460
"spending,"but you'll never hear them say,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.074
"Hey, we want people to save more,

00:06:42.074 --> 00:06:43.459
"so that we can invest more,

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:47.261
"so that in the classical
sense we can increase

00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.491
"our total productive capacity."

00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:51.927
The US has gotten a free pass on this,

00:06:51.927 --> 00:06:54.194
because the US has been
doing, essentially,

00:06:54.194 --> 00:06:56.407
the deficit spending has been able to do

00:06:56.407 --> 00:07:00.992
the Keynesian stimuli and
that's why the US consumer

00:07:00.992 --> 00:07:03.324
keeps spending more and
more, saving less and less.

00:07:03.324 --> 00:07:05.077
The government is doing the same thing,

00:07:05.077 --> 00:07:07.159
but the US has also
been getting investment

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.492
because it's the foreigners
who've been saving

00:07:09.492 --> 00:07:11.126
and then plowing that
money and they've been,

00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:13.928
essentially, investing
in the US, so that the US

00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:17.260
could increase its productive
capacity, but that is a risk

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.325
for a country if it's not
blessed with that free pass

00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:22.861
that the US has gotten for
the last several decades

00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:25.075
is that when you have some resources,

00:07:25.075 --> 00:07:26.909
so in a given year, you
have some resources.

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:28.075
Let's say it's your time.

00:07:28.075 --> 00:07:31.833
You could either hunt and eat rabbits

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:34.826
or you could spend your time to invent

00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:36.530
new rabbit trapping devices.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.593
This is the hunting and eating the rabbits

00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:40.927
and this is spending some time to go

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.742
and figure out ways to be more productive

00:07:42.742 --> 00:07:44.993
at hunting rabbits,
building some bow and arrows

00:07:44.993 --> 00:07:46.258
or something like this.

00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:48.462
You always have a tradeoff
between consumption

00:07:48.462 --> 00:07:50.393
and investment.

00:07:50.393 --> 00:07:52.593
Keynesian policies,
they're all about, hey,

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:55.196
let's get consumption as high as possible

00:07:55.196 --> 00:07:57.260
and that might be a good
idea in the short run,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.194
especially if we are operating
well below our potential,

00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:03.124
well below our full capacity utilization,

00:08:03.124 --> 00:08:05.128
but it could be a risk in the
long run, if you don't get

00:08:05.128 --> 00:08:08.196
the free pass, because you
might have underinvestment

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.198
and in the classical sense,
you're never able to move

00:08:11.198 --> 00:08:13.467
your potential to the right.
