00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now that you see how this works when µ = 0.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'd like to change it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When µ is not equal to 0 we call this a random walk with drift,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
since it tends to drift in one direction or the other.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In this case, we're going to have it drift to the right,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
specifically, we'll say that it now has a mean of 1 and a variance of 2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Apologize in advance. I'm sure my drawing isn't quite to scale.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, to really test your understanding, I'd like you to tell me

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
at 1 second and 10 seconds what are the mean and variance

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of the object's position?
