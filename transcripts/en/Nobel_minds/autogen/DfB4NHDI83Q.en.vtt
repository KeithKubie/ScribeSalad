00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.230
formed a type of rucksacks Trotec same
 

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.230
formed a type of rucksacks Trotec same
structure where you have the ring can

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.240
structure where you have the ring can
 

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.200
structure where you have the ring can
move freely along the axial but cannot

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.210
move freely along the axial but cannot
 

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.870
move freely along the axial but cannot
come loose because of the two large

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880
come loose because of the two large
 

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.270
come loose because of the two large
stoppers at each end here and this is

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:21.280
stoppers at each end here and this is
 

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.010
stoppers at each end here and this is
another type of mechanical bond as you

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.020
another type of mechanical bond as you
 

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.130
another type of mechanical bond as you
may understand and here what you can see

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.140
may understand and here what you can see
 

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.440
may understand and here what you can see
also is that you have a shuttle effect

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:28.450
also is that you have a shuttle effect
 

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.980
also is that you have a shuttle effect
so that this ring can move between two

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:31.990
so that this ring can move between two
 

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.530
so that this ring can move between two
different stations in this axial on this

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:34.540
different stations in this axial on this
 

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.900
different stations in this axial on this
actual so you can see it can move like

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:36.910
actual so you can see it can move like
 

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:42.030

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:17.870
one component in a machine that is very
 

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.170
one component in a machine that is very

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.840
very important is the motor component
and especially maybe the rotary motor

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:22.850
and especially maybe the rotary motor
 

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.020

that we can rotate only in one direction
 

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.360
that we can rotate only in one direction
and that is a fundamental challenge and

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:31.370
and that is a fundamental challenge and
 

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.590
and that is a fundamental challenge and
that challenge was met in 1999 by Ben

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600

ferry ha and his group so what they

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:38.870
ferry ha and his group so what they
 

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.960
ferry ha and his group so what they
could do in this particular case was

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:40.970
could do in this particular case was
 

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.000
could do in this particular case was
that they made a molecule they built in

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.010
that they made a molecule they built in
 

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.400
that they made a molecule they built in
a symmetry in the molecule and they had

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:45.410
a symmetry in the molecule and they had
 

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.470
a symmetry in the molecule and they had
to rotor blades as you can see here

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480
to rotor blades as you can see here
 

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.290
to rotor blades as you can see here
connected to what is called an isomer

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:50.300
connected to what is called an isomer
 

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.210
connected to what is called an isomer
risible borne a bond that can change and

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:54.220
risible borne a bond that can change and
 

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.650
risible borne a bond that can change and
using this structure they can get

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:56.660
using this structure they can get
 

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.110
using this structure they can get
unidirectional directional rotation and

00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120
unidirectional directional rotation and
 

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.570
unidirectional directional rotation and
the way this works is that when you

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:01.580
the way this works is that when you
 

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.260
the way this works is that when you
shine light to this molecule the rotor

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.270
shine light to this molecule the rotor
 

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.340
shine light to this molecule the rotor
blade will flip over like so almost 180

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:09.350
blade will flip over like so almost 180
 

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:13.030
blade will flip over like so almost 180
degrees there you see and that will

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040
degrees there you see and that will
 

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.760
degrees there you see and that will
create tension in the molecule as you

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:15.770
create tension in the molecule as you
 

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.650
create tension in the molecule as you
can see here that doesn't the molecule

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:17.660
can see here that doesn't the molecule
 

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.300
can see here that doesn't the molecule
has a light tension it wants to release

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:19.310
has a light tension it wants to release
 

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.060
has a light tension it wants to release
the tension

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.070
the tension
 

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.819
the tension
and that happens in a thermal step which

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:22.829
and that happens in a thermal step which
 

00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:23.810
and that happens in a thermal step which
is irreversible

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820
is irreversible
 

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.329
is irreversible
pretty much irreversible and then you

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339
pretty much irreversible and then you
 

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:28.639
pretty much irreversible and then you
have another pulse of light coming in

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:28.649
have another pulse of light coming in
 

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:31.370
have another pulse of light coming in
you get another flip of the rotor you

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.380
you get another flip of the rotor you
 

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.800
you get another flip of the rotor you
create more tension and then in the

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:33.810
create more tension and then in the
 

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.470
create more tension and then in the
final step you have a thermal relaxation

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480
final step you have a thermal relaxation
 

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.329
final step you have a thermal relaxation
relaxation again and then you're back at

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339
relaxation again and then you're back at
 

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:41.720
relaxation again and then you're back at
very started and this cyclic moment you

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:41.730
very started and this cyclic moment you
 

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.689
very started and this cyclic moment you
can do over and over again in a very uni

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:44.699
can do over and over again in a very uni
 

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:48.400
can do over and over again in a very uni

much much larger objects as you can see

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:24.510
much much larger objects as you can see
 

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.490
much much larger objects as you can see
here here you have a glass rod and this

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500
here here you have a glass rod and this
 

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.889
here here you have a glass rod and this
class Sorensen micrometer size that

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899
class Sorensen micrometer size that
 

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.809
class Sorensen micrometer size that
means this is ten thousand times larger

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:32.819
means this is ten thousand times larger
 

00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:36.079
means this is ten thousand times larger
than the little molecular motor and as

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:36.089
than the little molecular motor and as
 

00:14:36.089 --> 00:14:39.079
than the little molecular motor and as
you can see the motor action can

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:39.089
you can see the motor action can
 

00:14:39.089 --> 00:14:41.210

what I said when we started machine

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960
what I said when we started machine
 

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.640
what I said when we started machine
working for the first time this was also

00:18:59.640 --> 00:18:59.650
working for the first time this was also
 

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.530
working for the first time this was also
a shock because for the first time we

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:01.540
a shock because for the first time we
 

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.690
a shock because for the first time we
saw a really movement of things you know

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:03.700
saw a really movement of things you know
 

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.180
saw a really movement of things you know
and we saw that there was a kind of the

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:06.190
and we saw that there was a kind of the
 

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.390
and we saw that there was a kind of the
motor-pod function so I was I could

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400
motor-pod function so I was I could
 

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.560
motor-pod function so I was I could
hardly believe that it worked yes thank

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:13.570
hardly believe that it worked yes thank
 

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.380

active sites where they do the most
 

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.700
active sites where they do the most
where they do what they are meant for

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:46.710
where they do what they are meant for
 

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:51.030
where they do what they are meant for
yeah absolutely right and it's a bit

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.040
yeah absolutely right and it's a bit
 

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.850
yeah absolutely right and it's a bit
early days of course but once you are

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:53.860
early days of course but once you are
 

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.280
early days of course but once you are
able to control movement you have a

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.290
able to control movement you have a
 

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.650
able to control movement you have a
motor you can think of all kinds of

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:58.660
motor you can think of all kinds of
 

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.700
motor you can think of all kinds of
functions so indeed

00:19:59.700 --> 00:19:59.710
functions so indeed
 

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.299
functions so indeed
we think of transporters like in your

00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:03.309
we think of transporters like in your
 

00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:05.460
we think of transporters like in your
body there are many motors and machines

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:05.470
body there are many motors and machines
 

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.620

that make it possible that yourself

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:07.630
that make it possible that yourself
 

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.019
that make it possible that yourself
divided that your muscles work that that

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:10.029
divided that your muscles work that that
 

00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:13.320
divided that your muscles work that that
is transport in themselves etc but you

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:13.330
is transport in themselves etc but you
 

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.080
is transport in themselves etc but you
can think also which broader think about

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.090
can think also which broader think about
 

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.899
can think also which broader think about
nano machines microrobots think about

00:20:18.899 --> 00:20:18.909
nano machines microrobots think about
 

00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:22.139
nano machines microrobots think about
tiny robots that you the doctor in the

tiny robots that you the doctor in the
 

00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:24.060
tiny robots that you the doctor in the
future will inject in your blood things

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.070

and then go to search for a cancer cell

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:26.740
and then go to search for a cancer cell
 

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.269
and then go to search for a cancer cell
or are going to deliver a drug for

go ahead yeah now first of all that
muche I feel a little bit like the

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:24.700
muche I feel a little bit like the
 

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.299
muche I feel a little bit like the
Wright brothers huh we were flying a

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:27.309
Wright brothers huh we were flying a
 

00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:29.519
Wright brothers huh we were flying a
hundred years ago for the first time and

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:29.529
hundred years ago for the first time and
 

00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:31.919
hundred years ago for the first time and
then people were saying you know why do

00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:31.929
then people were saying you know why do
 

00:21:31.929 --> 00:21:34.529
then people were saying you know why do
we need a flying machine and now we have

00:21:34.529 --> 00:21:34.539
we need a flying machine and now we have
 

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:37.769
we need a flying machine and now we have
a Boeing 747 and Eva's so that is a bit

00:21:37.769 --> 00:21:37.779
a Boeing 747 and Eva's so that is a bit
 

00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:40.470
a Boeing 747 and Eva's so that is a bit
how I feel but yes the opportunities are

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480
how I feel but yes the opportunities are
 

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.930
how I feel but yes the opportunities are
great because if you think what kind of

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:42.940
great because if you think what kind of
 

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.970
great because if you think what kind of
materials we can make these days with

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:44.980
materials we can make these days with
 

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.460
materials we can make these days with
the camera chemistry and when you are

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:47.470
the camera chemistry and when you are
 

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.100
the camera chemistry and when you are
able to introduce dynamic functions and

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.110
able to introduce dynamic functions and
 

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.200
able to introduce dynamic functions and
built machines or build materials that

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.210
built machines or build materials that
 

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.529
built machines or build materials that
can change function there is endless

00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:54.539
can change function there is endless
 

00:21:54.539 --> 00:21:56.970
can change function there is endless
opportunity so we will build smart

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:56.980
opportunity so we will build smart

they'll adapt themselves that they'll

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.450
they'll adapt themselves that they'll
 

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.409
they'll adapt themselves that they'll
have properties that can change because

with them and we are of course this is
 

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.279
with them and we are of course this is
the start of a new period where we are

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:26.289
the start of a new period where we are
 

00:23:26.289 --> 00:23:28.799
the start of a new period where we are
really going to to try to use these tiny

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:28.809
really going to to try to use these tiny
 

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:30.930
really going to to try to use these tiny
machines for all kinds of new

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:30.940
machines for all kinds of new
 

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.339
machines for all kinds of new
applications and so thank you please

now obviously the 19th century discovers

00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919
now obviously the 19th century discovers
 

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:47.210
now obviously the 19th century discovers
a 19th century yielded the aeroplane

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220
a 19th century yielded the aeroplane
 

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.159
a 19th century yielded the aeroplane
lots of beautiful innovations but also

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:50.169
lots of beautiful innovations but also
 

00:23:50.169 --> 00:23:53.629
lots of beautiful innovations but also
some very deadly ones this could also

00:23:53.629 --> 00:23:53.639
some very deadly ones this could also
 

00:23:53.639 --> 00:23:56.430
some very deadly ones this could also
lead potentially would you imagine -

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440
lead potentially would you imagine -
 

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.469
lead potentially would you imagine -
well I'll put it another way

00:23:58.469 --> 00:23:58.479
well I'll put it another way
 

00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:00.299
well I'll put it another way
what are your worst nightmares with this

00:24:00.299 --> 00:24:00.309
what are your worst nightmares with this
 

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:01.710
what are your worst nightmares with this
discovery what do you fear from your

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720
discovery what do you fear from your
 

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.389
discovery what do you fear from your
discovery now I don't know if I have

00:24:06.389 --> 00:24:06.399
discovery now I don't know if I have
 

00:24:06.399 --> 00:24:08.009
discovery now I don't know if I have
really nightmares the nice thing is

00:24:08.009 --> 00:24:08.019
really nightmares the nice thing is
 

00:24:08.019 --> 00:24:09.869
really nightmares the nice thing is
about that we can design all these

00:24:09.869 --> 00:24:09.879
about that we can design all these
 

00:24:09.879 --> 00:24:12.930
about that we can design all these
synthetic motors and machines and so

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:12.940
synthetic motors and machines and so
 

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.060
synthetic motors and machines and so
that we can induce all kinds of

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.070
that we can induce all kinds of
 

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:18.419
that we can induce all kinds of
autonomous functions so so far when we

00:24:18.419 --> 00:24:18.429
autonomous functions so so far when we
 

00:24:18.429 --> 00:24:20.549
autonomous functions so so far when we
build a material a gamma core whatever

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559
build a material a gamma core whatever
 

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:23.399
build a material a gamma core whatever
you know they are there but they don't

00:24:23.399 --> 00:24:23.409
you know they are there but they don't
 

00:24:23.409 --> 00:24:25.440
you know they are there but they don't
have any dynamic functions and also

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.450
have any dynamic functions and also
 

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.420
have any dynamic functions and also
normal function in the future

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:27.430
normal function in the future
 

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.220
normal function in the future
all kinds of material that they'll have

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:29.230
all kinds of material that they'll have
 

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.050
all kinds of material that they'll have
autonomic functions he was like a

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:31.060
autonomic functions he was like a
 

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.780
autonomic functions he was like a
bacteria also in the future sir you just

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:33.790
bacteria also in the future sir you just
 

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.330
bacteria also in the future sir you just
like a cell in your body or a bacterial

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:36.340
like a cell in your body or a bacterial
 

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.720
like a cell in your body or a bacterial
cell or so and I think we have to think

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:39.730
cell or so and I think we have to think
 

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.100
cell or so and I think we have to think
about how we can handle these things

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.110
about how we can handle these things
 

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.770
about how we can handle these things
safely but I'm not so worried about that

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:46.780
safely but I'm not so worried about that
 

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.960
safely but I'm not so worried about that
because once we are able to design this

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:48.970
because once we are able to design this
 

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.210
because once we are able to design this
tiny of micro machines and and these

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:51.220
tiny of micro machines and and these
 

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.160
tiny of micro machines and and these
nano robots we will also have the

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.170
nano robots we will also have the
 

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.140
nano robots we will also have the
opportunity to build in all kinds of

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:55.150
opportunity to build in all kinds of
 

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.660
opportunity to build in all kinds of
safety devices if that is needed and so

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:57.670
safety devices if that is needed and so
 

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.810
safety devices if that is needed and so
for the time being I think we reuse

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:00.820
for the time being I think we reuse
 

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.700
for the time being I think we reuse
these materials and so every three

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:02.710
these materials and so every three
 

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.250
these materials and so every three
demands as any chemical you know with

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:05.260
demands as any chemical you know with
 

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.280
demands as any chemical you know with
with with any tear if we would fall into

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:08.290
with with any tear if we would fall into
 

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.860
with with any tear if we would fall into
you this time here motors and so in a

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:10.870
you this time here motors and so in a
 

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.960
you this time here motors and so in a
biological context they have to go to a

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:12.970
biological context they have to go to a
 

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.200
biological context they have to go to a
failure a careful evaluation with

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:16.210
failure a careful evaluation with
 

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.000
failure a careful evaluation with
respect to toxicity and all these things

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.010
respect to toxicity and all these things
 

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.750
respect to toxicity and all these things
so we are aware of intent right yes the

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760
so we are aware of intent right yes the
 

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.260
so we are aware of intent right yes the

Peace iam and get this fast we say in
Swedish congratulations thank you so

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:33.370
Swedish congratulations thank you so
 

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.360
Swedish congratulations thank you so
much how come when did you first start

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:36.370
much how come when did you first start
 

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.880
much how come when did you first start
to think about that I would like to make

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:38.890
to think about that I would like to make
 

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.100
to think about that I would like to make
research about molecular machines how

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.110
research about molecular machines how
 

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.860
research about molecular machines how
did you come up with idea yeah yeah

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:43.870
did you come up with idea yeah yeah
 

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:45.810
did you come up with idea yeah yeah
that's a very interesting point we

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:45.820
that's a very interesting point we
 

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.910
that's a very interesting point we
started when I was in my early days of

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:47.920
started when I was in my early days of
 

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.050
started when I was in my early days of
my career I started building switches

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.060
my career I started building switches
 

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.090
my career I started building switches
just like phrases thought out and

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:54.100
just like phrases thought out and
 

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.610
just like phrases thought out and
champion survives so we could you know a

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:56.620
champion survives so we could you know a
 

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.770
champion survives so we could you know a
switch you switch between zero and one

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:58.780
switch you switch between zero and one
 

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.700
switch you switch between zero and one
just like in your in a light switch and

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:02.710
just like in your in a light switch and
 

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.950
just like in your in a light switch and
the whole idea was to do have an

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960
the whole idea was to do have an
 

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.040
the whole idea was to do have an
alternative for information storage and

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.050
alternative for information storage and
 

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.770
alternative for information storage and
we wanted to use right and to switch

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:10.780
we wanted to use right and to switch
 

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.930
we wanted to use right and to switch
between two escapes in the molecule and

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:12.940
between two escapes in the molecule and
 

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.000
between two escapes in the molecule and
then certainly we discovered there

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.010
then certainly we discovered there
 

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.520
then certainly we discovered there
besides switching we could also make a

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:17.530
besides switching we could also make a
 

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.160
besides switching we could also make a
movement that continued in one direction

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.170
movement that continued in one direction
 

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.890
movement that continued in one direction
and that was the start of our rotary

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:22.900
and that was the start of our rotary
 

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.190
and that was the start of our rotary
motors and once you I built a rotary

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200
motors and once you I built a rotary
 

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.500
motors and once you I built a rotary
motor then you know you can control

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:28.510
motor then you know you can control
 

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.930
motor then you know you can control
motion at the nano scale because our

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:30.940
motion at the nano scale because our
 

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.660
motion at the nano scale because our
motors are only one nanometer one

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:32.670
motors are only one nanometer one
 

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.120
motors are only one nanometer one
billionth of a meter in size and so once

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.130
billionth of a meter in size and so once
 

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.070
billionth of a meter in size and so once
you can control motion you can think

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080
you can control motion you can think
 

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.160
you can control motion you can think
about all kinds of dynamic functions

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:40.170
about all kinds of dynamic functions
 

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.910
about all kinds of dynamic functions
like bull

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:41.920
like bull
 

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.510
like bull
weren't like transporters like tiny

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520
weren't like transporters like tiny
 

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.050
weren't like transporters like tiny
machinery so it started all which

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:49.060
machinery so it started all which
 

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.900
machinery so it started all which
switches the simple idea the arrow once

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:51.910
switches the simple idea the arrow once
 

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.120
switches the simple idea the arrow once
which simple ideas are the best ones so

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:56.130
which simple ideas are the best ones so
 

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.910
which simple ideas are the best ones so
I think that was the last question so

00:26:59.910 --> 00:26:59.920
I think that was the last question so
 

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.420
I think that was the last question so

panel before we close we seem to be
 

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.410
panel before we close we seem to be
running out of time but if there are any

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:25.420
running out of time but if there are any
 

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:31.170
running out of time but if there are any
quick questions to the panelists if not

you charge the Nobel Committee for

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:32.790
you charge the Nobel Committee for
 

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.760
you charge the Nobel Committee for
chemistry and have just announced

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:34.770
chemistry and have just announced
 

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.250
chemistry and have just announced
another price of this year which is

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260
another price of this year which is
 

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.350
another price of this year which is
about the tiny molecular machines how

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360
about the tiny molecular machines how
 

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.220
about the tiny molecular machines how
small only yes very very small they're

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:46.230
small only yes very very small they're
 

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.740
small only yes very very small they're
so small you can't see them you can't

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:48.750
so small you can't see them you can't
 

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.360
so small you can't see them you can't
see them by eye you can't even see them

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.370
see them by eye you can't even see them
 

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.240
see them by eye you can't even see them
by a light microscope so they are on the

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:53.250
by a light microscope so they are on the
 

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.380
by a light microscope so they are on the
nanometer so one to ten nominator large

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:56.390
nanometer so one to ten nominator large
 

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.580
nanometer so one to ten nominator large
and ananna meter if you take a

00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:58.590
and ananna meter if you take a
 

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.620
and ananna meter if you take a
millimeter and divide it in 1 million

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:00.630
millimeter and divide it in 1 million
 

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.460
millimeter and divide it in 1 million
parts each part is an automated 1

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:04.470
parts each part is an automated 1
 

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.610
parts each part is an automated 1
million part for the first row there

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:07.620
million part for the first row there
 

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.890
million part for the first row there
were 10 1 to 10 thousand times smaller

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:09.900
were 10 1 to 10 thousand times smaller
 

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.150
were 10 1 to 10 thousand times smaller
than the human hair yes you mentioned

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:14.160
than the human hair yes you mentioned
 

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.150
than the human hair yes you mentioned
also that the dream is always to

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:17.160
also that the dream is always to
 

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:24.200
also that the dream is always to
construct such tiny machines that's a

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.210
construct such tiny machines that's a
 

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.610
construct such tiny machines that's a
very good question because I think that

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620
very good question because I think that
 

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.240
very good question because I think that
dream started in the end of the 1950s we

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:29.250
dream started in the end of the 1950s we
 

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.190
dream started in the end of the 1950s we

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200
find - lectures where he gave a
 

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:37.540
find - lectures where he gave a
challenge to the scientists to construct

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:37.550
challenge to the scientists to construct
 

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:41.450
challenge to the scientists to construct
molecules that could act as machines and

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460
molecules that could act as machines and
 

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.700
molecules that could act as machines and
there are two obstacles one obstacle is

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:43.710
there are two obstacles one obstacle is
 

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.650
there are two obstacles one obstacle is
the thing that you need to have parts

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:45.660
the thing that you need to have parts
 

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.720
the thing that you need to have parts
that are freely movable either

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:47.730
that are freely movable either
 

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.180
that are freely movable either
physically movable or you need some kind

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:50.190
physically movable or you need some kind
 

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.610

that's one challenge and the other

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:54.900
that's one challenge and the other
 

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.200
that's one challenge and the other
challenge is that molecular systems

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:57.210
challenge is that molecular systems
 

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.690
challenge is that molecular systems
always want to reach equilibrium and

00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700
always want to reach equilibrium and
 

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.820
always want to reach equilibrium and
fluctuate around it and they do have all

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:01.830
fluctuate around it and they do have all
 

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.250
fluctuate around it and they do have all
the random motions so it's a main

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260
the random motions so it's a main
 

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.170
the random motions so it's a main
challenge to create motion in one

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:06.180
challenge to create motion in one
 

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.660
challenge to create motion in one
defined direction so when you put in

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:08.670
defined direction so when you put in
 

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.880
defined direction so when you put in
energy you want your system to either

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:10.890
energy you want your system to either
 

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.930
energy you want your system to either
rotate or move in the direction you have

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:13.940
rotate or move in the direction you have
 

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.180
rotate or move in the direction you have
decided they're not randomly

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:17.190
decided they're not randomly
 

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:20.360
decided they're not randomly
want to have them silent in equilibrium

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.370
want to have them silent in equilibrium
 

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.520
want to have them silent in equilibrium
but they also wanted to stop the

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:22.530
but they also wanted to stop the
 

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.530
but they also wanted to stop the
movement the brown Brownian movement

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:24.540
movement the brown Brownian movement
 

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.350
movement the brown Brownian movement
yeah or at least overcome it because you

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360
yeah or at least overcome it because you
 

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.840
yeah or at least overcome it because you
can't really stop it it's there too but

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:29.850
can't really stop it it's there too but
 

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.390
can't really stop it it's there too but
you have to come around it one way they

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:32.400
you have to come around it one way they
 

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.490
you have to come around it one way they
found to come around it was to use a

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500
found to come around it was to use a
 

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.040
found to come around it was to use a
symmetric molecules so that when you

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.050
symmetric molecules so that when you
 

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.050
symmetric molecules so that when you
waste or energy they come in a

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.060
waste or energy they come in a
 

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.930
waste or energy they come in a
frustrated or ten state and when they

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940
frustrated or ten state and when they
 

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.420
frustrated or ten state and when they
relax they will be more prone to relax

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:44.430
relax they will be more prone to relax
 

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.520
relax they will be more prone to relax
in one direction compared to the other

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:46.530
in one direction compared to the other
 

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.400
in one direction compared to the other
because of their asymmetry and once they

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:49.410
because of their asymmetry and once they
 

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:59.780
because of their asymmetry and once they
have relaxed they can't get back how

00:33:59.780 --> 00:33:59.790
have relaxed they can't get back how
 

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.790
have relaxed they can't get back how
come they move they move because we give

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:01.800
come they move they move because we give
 

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.470
come they move they move because we give
them energy so they are not autonomous

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480
them energy so they are not autonomous
 

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.280
them energy so they are not autonomous
they are moved at will from the user so

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:07.290
they are moved at will from the user so
 

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.040
they are moved at will from the user so
we put in a light source we put in heat

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.050
we put in a light source we put in heat
 

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:13.190
we put in a light source we put in heat
or we put in chemical energy so they are

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200
or we put in chemical energy so they are
 

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.410
or we put in chemical energy so they are
like the man-made motors you have to put

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:15.420
like the man-made motors you have to put
 

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:21.140
like the man-made motors you have to put
in some kind of fuel plants for example

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:21.150
in some kind of fuel plants for example
 

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:32.210
in some kind of fuel plants for example
they also live by light living more I

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220
they also live by light living more I
 

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.420
they also live by light living more I
don't think that this type of event will

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:35.430
don't think that this type of event will
 

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:37.280
don't think that this type of event will
eat in living Wally bee been living me

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.290
eat in living Wally bee been living me
 

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.220
eat in living Wally bee been living me
the something can also replicate itself

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:39.230
the something can also replicate itself
 

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:49.990
the something can also replicate itself
and there is nothing in those molecules

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000
 

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.330
machines and molecules that there is

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:56.340
machines and molecules that there is
 

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.670
machines and molecules that there is
also a lot of science fiction about that

00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680
also a lot of science fiction about that
 

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.300
also a lot of science fiction about that
and then the nano robots are the main

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:02.310
and then the nano robots are the main
 

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.180
and then the nano robots are the main
heroes of science fiction stories and

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:05.190
heroes of science fiction stories and
 

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:09.109
heroes of science fiction stories and
also they pose a threat when they start

00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119
also they pose a threat when they start
 

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:11.570
also they pose a threat when they start
to self-replicate themself so what do

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:11.580
to self-replicate themself so what do
 

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.310
to self-replicate themself so what do
you think about those machines are they

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320
you think about those machines are they
 

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.220
you think about those machines are they
we promise or a big threat I think

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:16.230
we promise or a big threat I think
 

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.530
we promise or a big threat I think
they're mainly a big promise because

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540
they're mainly a big promise because
 

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.940
they're mainly a big promise because
they don't have this problem with your

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:19.950
they don't have this problem with your
 

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.770
they don't have this problem with your
cell replication so they cannot really

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780
cell replication so they cannot really
 

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.490
cell replication so they cannot really
take over and they are all controlled by

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500
take over and they are all controlled by
 

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.350
take over and they are all controlled by
an energy input so if you don't want

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:27.360
an energy input so if you don't want
 

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.940
an energy input so if you don't want
them to do something you can just stop

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:28.950
them to do something you can just stop
 

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:33.550
them to do something you can just stop
the energy input they will stop working

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560
the energy input they will stop working
 

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.130
the energy input they will stop working
with us here so what is the next thing

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140
with us here so what is the next thing
 

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.560
with us here so what is the next thing
what what is really the dream and the

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:39.570
what what is really the dream and the
 

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.340
what what is really the dream and the
vision now I think this very nicely when

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:43.350
vision now I think this very nicely when
 

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.080
vision now I think this very nicely when
we called him that this is the start of

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:45.090
we called him that this is the start of
 

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.440
we called him that this is the start of
a new molecular era so we think this is

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:48.450
a new molecular era so we think this is
 

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.170
a new molecular era so we think this is
a very right time to award this event

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180
a very right time to award this event
 

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.570
a very right time to award this event
price because this is when it takes off

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:53.580
price because this is when it takes off
