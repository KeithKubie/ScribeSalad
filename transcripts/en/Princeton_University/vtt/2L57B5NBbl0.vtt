EMMA WATKINS: In high school,
I was really drawn to theater

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.290
because you could be
a very big person,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.540
but you would be couched
behind a character.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.000
But what I then
decided is that I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.250
would take on the experience
of being a playwright,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.080
and suddenly, the
experience reversed.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.290
And I had the opportunity
to see my words,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.540
but spoken by somebody else,
which was exhilarating.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.000
But it's also
completely terrifying

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because suddenly you're
vulnerable in a completely

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.499
new way.

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.851
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.990
I had taken a really
exceptional English class

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.480
with a professor who was
very interested in mythology

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.500
and feminism.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.240
I explored Sondheim's
"Into the Woods"

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.490
and was looking at the
way fairy tales are

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.110
reimagined in that play.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.710
It was an opportunity for me to
really see how a music theater

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.400
piece can explore
this older material,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.040
and to innovate with it,
and introduce new themes.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.740
So when I decided to
propose my thesis,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.530
I began looking at
mythology that was closely

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.970
linked to my own family.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.490
And so my father
is Welsh and was

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.620
really interested in telling me
little snippets of folk tales

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.840
as bedtime stories.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.300
I found a female protagonist who
was really interesting to me.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.110
So this was Rhiannon, and
she's a very outspoken

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.950
female character.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.780
She read as incredibly
modern, and it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.750
was surprising to find that
in a mythological tale.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.360
I was really interested in
bringing forward her voice

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.920
from the mythology
in the same way

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.840
that Sondheim takes
the fairy tales

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.300
and create something of his own.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.820
The really exciting thing
about the Lewis Center,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.690
the entire theater
season is almost entirely

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.790
created around senior
thesis projects.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.120
And so you get to work with so
many incredible collaborators.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.482
And most of them are students.

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:47.940
So I had a student
director working

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.939
on the project, and a
student lighting designer,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.580
and a wonderful team of
student musicians and actors.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.600
And I had the opportunity
to travel to Wales to really

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.250
research and visit
the places where

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.810
the mythology takes place.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.774
The idea of that was to bring
the folk music of Wales,

00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:05.940
to bring the storytelling
tradition that's currently

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.580
alive in Wales into the
theater because we're

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.180
creating a show in a
black box in New Jersey.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.280
But I wanted to make sure
that the story was rooted

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.150
in the place that it came from.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.110
So next year, I have the
extraordinary opportunity

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.020
to continue studying
contemporary storytelling

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.990
performances and revivals
of mythology in Wales.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.900
And so I'm hoping to
continue revising Rhiannon

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.510
and to create new work
based on mythology,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.940
and looking at how
mythology can be

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.850
used to address contemporary
issues of feminism,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.870
environmentalism.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.249
And I think at so
many other schools,

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.040
you're working with
preexisting repertoire.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.190
You as a thesis student, you
very much create something

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.900
and are given the opportunity
to run with this dream project.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.490
They give you the
resources to do so,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.630
and I just felt really excited
and proud of what we had made

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.850
and sad to see it go.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.080
But also just very grateful
for the opportunity

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.390
to have made something with
such an extraordinary group

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.960
of people and with such
fantastic mentors behind us

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.780
and supporting us.
