Before answering this question,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.689
I want to urge you to carefully
read all of the answers.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.330
It's entirely possible that more than
one will technically be correct.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.070
We're looking for the best answer.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.400
So by now it should be clear that
chronic diseases are very important.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.350
So let's make sure you understand
their key characteristics.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.350
Which of these is not a chronic disease?

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.150
Check any and all that apply.
