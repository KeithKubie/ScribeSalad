00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.450
The Billion Dollar Speech that Sank a Major
Company

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.510
Have you ever said something that you ended
up immediately regretting or wanted to take

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.670
back straight away?

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.410
Well, unless your words cost someone nearly
a billion dollars, then you haven’t messed

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.670
up quite as bad as Gerald Ratner did back
in 1991.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.670
Yet…

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.189
Ratner was the CEO of the Ratners Group, jewellers
that shook up the usually stiff and inflexible

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.619
jewellery market by aiming some of its products
at the working class through a chain of shops

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.050
colloquially known as “Ratners.”

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.359
Although the chain was widely ridiculed and
considered “gaudy,” “tacky” and “cheap”

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.719
by the press and other jewellers, many wanting
to buy jewellery and not break the bank flocked

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.510
to the stores, turning Ratners into a household
name throughout England in the 1980s.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.470
This unprecedented move was primarily spearheaded
by Ratner himself and it turned what was once

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.200
a small, family-owned chain into a billion
dollar business, threatening other jewellers

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.489
the world over.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.519
You see, if everyone owns and wears jewellery,
and it is sold cheaply, it loses much of its

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.830
prestige and perceived value which has long
made certain mostly worthless and common jewellery

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.150
items extremely expensive.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.740
Ratner started working for the company in
1965 when he was a fresh-faced teen.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.680
In the 19 years he worked for the company,
it made almost no market headway.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.370
When he inherited the company in 1984, he
expanded it from about 150 shops to over 2,000

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.070
in just six years, capturing over 50% of the
UK’s jewellery market.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.040
Ratner appeared to be a business prodigy.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.759
In his autobiography, Gerald Ratner: The Rise
and Fall… and Rise Again, Ratner claimed

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.469
that his success in the 1980s was down to
an experience he had when he was younger at

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.320
Petticoat Lane Market.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.229
At this market, Ratner noticed that it wasn’t
the vendors selling the best goods that got

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.850
the most sales or interest from customers,
it was the vendors who yelled the loudest

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.320
and had the most garish, eye-catching displays.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.811
Ratner eagerly applied this concept to his
own business when he took over the Ratner

00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:06.619
Group in 1984, and he made sure that all of
the shops in the Ratners chain had bright

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.610
orange displays that loudly advertised their
prices and deals.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.810
This, combined with the rock-bottom prices
the chain was offering, saw sales explode.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.310
At the peak of his company’s success, Ratner
was invited to speak to the Institute of Directors,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.280
a group of high-powered businessmen and journalists,
about how he’d made his company so big so

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.280
fast.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.890
The speaking engagement, which Ratner himself
now refers to as “the speech,” has since

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.480
gone down as one of the biggest blunders in
business history.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.159
Though the speech was going well for a while,
the fateful moment came when a person in attendance

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.879
innocently asked Ratner how his company was
able to afford to sell things so cheaply;

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.470
his now infamous response was as follows:
“…We also do cut-glass sherry decanters

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.800
complete with six glasses on a silver-plated
tray that your butler can serve you drinks

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.720
on, all for £4.95.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.360
People say, ‘How can you sell this for such
a low price?’

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.000
I say, because it’s total crap.”

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.349
He went on to say that some of the earrings
sold by the Ratner Group were

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.450
“cheaper than an M&amp;S prawn sandwich but
probably wouldn’t last as long.”

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.459
Though Ratner claims he intended the comments
as a joke (though from the sound of it a joke

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.480
at the expense of his customers) and thought
because it was a private event that nothing

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.819
said would be reported to the public, the
journalists listening didn’t see it that

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.250
way on either count, and the very next day
his comments were national news.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.299
The effect on the company’s profits were
practically instantaneous.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:37.330
Almost overnight shares in the company dropped
by £500 million or around $800 million (about

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.939
£936 million / $1.6 billion today) and customers
began avoiding Ratners stores like the plague.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.400
The phrase “doing a Ratner” entered the
English lexicon as a term for really screwing

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400
up.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.900
Just a year after Ratner’s speech, Ratners
stores began closing down by the hundreds,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.599
resulting in thousands of jobs being axed.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.829
The company claimed that the dramatic loss
of profits was due to “a shift in consumer

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.850
spending habits,” which is kind of true
in a sense, but it’s pretty obvious from

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.319
the five hundred million pound punch to the
gut they received just a year prior, that

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.970
it was really due to Ratner’s speech.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.770
Ratner resigned in November of 1992 and the
company, in an effort to distance itself further

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.450
from Ratner, unceremoniously re-branded themselves
as the “Signet Group” in 2002.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.600
Though his speech had cost his company hundreds
of millions of dollars, Ratner himself came

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.570
out of the scandal relatively unscathed, as
noted in this interview with him, “I sold

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.100
my shares on the day I left.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.550
I didn’t make anything.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.120
The only good news was that the £1billion
owed to the bank stayed with the company rather

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.300
than me.“

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.290
He then managed to acquire a few million pounds
by mortgaging his house and investing the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.710
money in various business ventures, such as
a health club business that he sold in 2001

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.330
for £3.9 million (adjusted for inflation
about £5.6 million today or about $9.4 million).

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.760
These days, he runs a jewellery business with
an estimated value of about £35 million or

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760
$59 million.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.630
When he’s not doing that, Ratner occasionally
earns extra money by giving speeches at business

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.630
conventions.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.980
“I tell people that having a setback, whether
it’s going bankrupt, being divorced or ill,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.910
doesn’t mean it is the end of you.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.260
Getting my audience to laugh puts me on a
huge high and people now realise I am no longer

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:39.180
the arrogant snob they thought I was.”
