00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the question is: suppose that Alice forgets the value that she used

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the initialization vector--she encrypted some file, she has the ciphertext

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and she has the key. Can she still recover n, even though she forgot the IV?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
--the Initial Value--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So the answers are: "No," she can't recover any of them;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"Almost," that she can recover all of them except for the very first block;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
"Almost," that she can recover all of them except for the first and the second block;

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or that she can only recover the very last block of n.
