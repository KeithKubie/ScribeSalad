00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.910
I made a slight error
in the electron

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.150
transport chain video.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.040
And I just wanted to correct
it in this one.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.540
And it's also an opportunity for
me to include a little bit

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.560
of terminology that I forgot
to include in that video.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.310
So when I described the electron
transport chain, you

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.810
remember, it's just you have
some high-energy electrons in

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.520
NADH and they get transferred
from one molecule to another.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.810
And as they get transferred
they go into lower energy

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.870
states and they release
energy.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.540
And then the final electron
acceptor was oxygen.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.200
Oxygen got reduced right here.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.190
But if you look at both sides of
this equation, the mistake

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.510
was, I need two hydrogens.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.400
If I have two hydrogens on the
right-hand side of the water,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.710
I need two hydrogens on
the left-hand side.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.330
So there should be
a 2 right there.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.280
So that was what I would
consider to be a minor mistake

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.200
in the last video.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.510
But this also gives me a chance
to introduce you to

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.110
some more terminology.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.850
So this whole process, we know
that this is called oxidation.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.690
When NADH loses a hydrogen.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.820
Remember oxidation is losing,
formally electrons.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.770
But when it loses the hydrogen,
it loses the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.640
opportunity to hog that
hydrogen's electrons.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210
So this whole process of the
electron transport chain is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.450
one molecule after another
getting oxidized until you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.410
have a final electron
acceptor in water.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.280
So this is-- obviously you could
call this oxidation.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950
You know, just very generally.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.410
And then the second part of the
electron transport chain--

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.810
or maybe we shouldn't even call
this part of the electron

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.720
transport chain-- the
process where the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.620
ATP is actually formed.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.365
The adding of a phosphate group
to another molecule is

00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:33.615
called phosphorylation.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.000
So the whole process of creating
ATP through the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.590
electron transport chain.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.390
Remember the electron transport
chain releases

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.010
energy that creates this
hydrogen gradient.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.540
It pumps the hydrogens to
the outer compartment.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.640
And then that gradient, those
hydrogens that want to get

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.130
back into the matrix,
essentially going back through

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.740
this ATP synthase.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.880
This process of generating ATP
this way is called oxidative

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.130
phosphorylation.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.120
It's a good word to know.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.440
You might see it on some
standardized tests or on your

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.560
exams. And it's called
this because you have

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.770
an oxidative part.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.200
Each of these molecules gets
oxidized in the electron

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.220
transport chain as they lose
their hydrogens or as they

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.500
lose their electrons.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.890
That creates a hydrogen
gradient.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.280
And then that, through
chemiosmosis, allows for

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.430
phosphorylation.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.670
So that's another good
word to know.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.060
The transfer of these hydrogens,
these kind of going

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.740
through this membrane
selectively.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.900
This membrane, this ATP
synthase, wouldn't allow just

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.500
any molecule to go through it.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.360
It's allowing these hydrogen
protons to go through it.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.750
This process right here of this
hydrogen going through is

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.000
called chemiosmosis.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.900
Another good word to know.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.880
So the entire process
is called oxidative

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.060
phosphorylation.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.530
They don't happen at
the same time.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.470
Oxidative generates the energy
because the energy to push the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.140
hydrogens out.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.430
And then the phosphorylation
happens as the hydrogens

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.050
experience chemiosmosis and go
back in and turn this little

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.160
axle and then push the ADP and
the phosphate groups together.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.080
And then you can contrast
that with substrate.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.000
Substrate phosphorylations.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.590
Since I'm in the mood to
introduce you to terminology.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.950
Substrate phosphorylation.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.120
This is actually what happens
when the ATP is produced

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.270
directly in glycolysis
in the Krebs cycle.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.360
And this is where you have an
enzyme directly helping to

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.990
peruse the ATP without
any type of

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.620
chemiosmosis or proton gradient.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.480
So if you imagine an
enzyme, some blurb,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.420
some big protein blurb.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.110
And let's say it has the
ADP there with its

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.510
two phosphate groups.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.890
And then maybe it has another
phosphate group that attaches

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.230
at some other part of the
enzyme, this enzyme

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.180
facilitates without any kind of
chemiosmosis or oxidation.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.960
It facilitates, probably in
conjunction with other energy

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.870
releasing reactions that may be
occurring on other parts of

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.500
the enzyme.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.830
So maybe you can imagine a
little spark right there and

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.815
then that twists this
entire enzyme.

00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:36.560
This isn't exactly how
it might work,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.640
but it's a good idea.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.090
And then these two things maybe
get pushed together.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.780
When it's just an enzyme
without any of this

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.830
chemiosmosis that's driven by
oxidation, like we learned in

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.870
the electron transport chain,
we call this substrate

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.780
phosphorylation.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.350
And the substrates are just the
things that attach to the

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.750
enzyme and have something
performed on them.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.260
So anyway, hopefully you
found this little

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.710
video mildly useful.
