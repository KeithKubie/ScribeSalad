00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.970
You never know how long it’s going to take
to get a film’s story just right, and even

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.460
if the script is sound, things could change
over the course of a project’s development.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.130
A movie isn’t truly finalized until the
director is in the editing bay, working hard

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.699
on assembling the finished cut that will be
shown in theaters.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.800
This means that several scenes or sequences
can be left on the cutting room floor, but

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.220
in some cases, some of the actors aren’t
safe.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.529
Even after months of hard work, there’s
always a possibility an A-lister misses out

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.530
on a film.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.239
Here are 10 popular movies that wasted a famous
actor’s role.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.420
Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.229
When Jenna Malone was cast in Zack Snyder’s
Batman V Superman, DC fans blew up the Internet

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.749
with theories and speculation about whom she’d
play.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.319
After all the talk, it was surprising when
Malone never showed up in the theatrical cut

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.319
of the film.

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:58.280
Her part was reinstated for the 3-hour ultimate
edition on the Blu-ray, but it was far from

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.530
what fans had hoped.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.769
Instead of Batgirl or some other important
character, Malone was simply a lab tech that

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.740
Lois Lane visited during her investigation.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.759
As disappointing as that might be, her scenes
helped clear some muddled questions about

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.799
the original version, so her content was still
valuable.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.850
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.979
Sauron is the main baddie of the Lord of the
Rings trilogy, but he received a substantial

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.920
amount of help from the dark wizard Saruman.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.009
The title The Two Towers refers to that duo’s
respective homes in Mordor and Isengard.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.050
They made for a nefarious pair, so it was
a little odd when Saruman was absent from

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.670
the grand finale, The Return of the King.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.840
At least in the theatrical version, the character
has no real conclusion in the story.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.659
Director Peter Jackson cut Christopher Lee’s
scenes out as a creative decision and planned

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.820
to reinsert them later on the DVD.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.830
The actor was none too pleased by this move
and skipped the film’s premiere.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.590
The Amazing Spider-Man 2

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.700
The Amazing Spider-Man series showcased Peter
Parker’s romance with Gwen Stacey, but originally

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.530
the sequel was going to give the web head
two love interests to keep track of.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.639
Actress Shailene Woodley was cast as the fiery
red head Mary Jane Watson and shot some scenes

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:05.639
for the movie.

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.440
She was on set for the span of a few days,
filming material with Andrew Garfield to set

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.450
up further development in sequels.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.640
Eventually, director Marc Webb removed this
subplot entirely in an effort to streamline

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.709
the main story.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.909
This was probably for the best, since a major
element of Amazing Spider-Man 2 was Gwen’s

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.319
death.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.510
Bridesmaids

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.120
Paul Rudd usually plays a charming, easygoing
guy that you’d like to get a beer with,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.900
but actors are always looking for ways to
challenge themselves.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.620
Rudd thought he had such a part when he was
cast in the hit comedy Bridesmaids.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.370
His role was a small one – a real jerk of
a guy that Kristin Wiig goes out with when

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.069
she’s looking for a dating rebound.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.989
Rudd excelled at playing against type, but
he was perhaps a little too good at it.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.480
Early test screenings did not receive this
character fondly, and Rudd was ultimately

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.290
cut from the Oscar nominated film.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.160
Maybe one day he’ll get to show his mean
side in a movie.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.150
E.T.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.220
– The Extra Terrestrial

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.579
Harrison Ford has several films to his name,
but among his most famous are his collaborations

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.640
with Steven Spielberg.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.530
By the end of this decade, Ford will have
worked with the director on five Indiana Jones

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.830
movies, but the dynamic duo could have combined
forces for another one of Spielberg’s classics.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.670
Ford was cast as Elliott’s school principal
in E.T., and shot some fun and amusing scenes

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.670
with Henry Thomas.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.459
But when it came time to edit, Spielberg felt
they didn’t add much to the story and trimmed

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.459
them out.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.650
E.T. went on to become one of the most beloved
family films ever made, so the director chose

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.060
wisely.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.010
Life of Pi

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.019
Ang Lee’s Oscar winning adaptation of this
novel uses a framing device that involves

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.390
an adult Pi telling his incredible story of
survival to a journalist.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.420
In the finished film, that character is played
by English actor Rafe Spall, but he wasn’t

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.490
the first one to have a stab at the role.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.849
Originally, Lee cast former Spider-Man Tobey
Maguire, but later determined that Maguire

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.810
was too famous for amounted to a bit part
and would have distracted the audience from

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.810
the narrative.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.370
Maguire stepped aside and made way for Spall,
whom Lee apparently had no issues with.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.959
It would have been nice to see Maguire on
the screen again, but this was not the meatiest

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.010
role he could have taken.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.630
Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.780
Earth’s Mightiest are the most famous characters
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and their

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.220
popularity is rivaled by perhaps only villain
Loki.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.100
Since his first appearance in 2011’s Thor,
the God of Mischief has become a standout

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.860
figure in the franchise, with Tom Hiddelston
reprising the role multiple times to many

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.860
fans’ delight.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.700
He was the main antagonist in the first Avengers
movie, and while he wasn’t the focus of

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.890
the sequel, Joss Whedon had initially planned
for Loki to return.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.630
Hiddelston shot a cameo for Thor’s dream
sequence, but it was cut because test audiences

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.520
thought Loki was the one controlling Ultron.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.410
It made sense for the film, and Loki will
return in Thor: Ragnarok.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.410
Black Mass

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.710
This true story crime drama was seen as Johnny
Depp’s comeback role, as he earned a Best

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.750
Actor nomination from the Screen Actors Guild
for his performance.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.040
But Depp wasn’t the only big name who was
part of the project.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.750
Tough girl Sienna Miller was cast to play
Bulger’s girlfriend Catherine Greig and

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.560
spent some time filming scenes with Depp.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.960
But in post-production, director Scott Cooper
decided the film would be better off if Miller

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.290
was cut completely, feeling her removal would
narrow the scope of the sprawling narrative.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.040
Some reviewers felt that Whitey’s character
lacked some depth, and perhaps those cut scenes

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040
would have added some.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.560
Maybe Cooper should have looked for something
else to ax?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560
The Good Dinosaur

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.250
Pixar is typically a lock for critically acclaimed
box office hits, but The Good Dinosaur is

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.180
a rare misstep in their filmography.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.770
The movie was plagued by numerous production
difficulties, which caused the creative team

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.160
to overhaul the script.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.450
Back in 2014, star John Lithgow commented
that everything had been “completely reimagined”

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.180
and the actors would have to re-record voice
over to fit the new material.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.840
Unfortunately, some of the actors cast in
the initial version, like Lithgow and Neil

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.240
Patrick Harris, were unable to come back and
had to be replaced, meaning all their work

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.810
in the booth was for nothing.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.220
Furious 7

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.300
Before she became Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot
was part of a different blockbuster franchise

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.780
– The Fast and the Furious.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.510
She appeared as the character Gisele in three
installments and was supposed to return for

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.790
2015’s Furious 7.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.370
Gadot filmed scenes where Gisele takes Letty
to the hospital after Letty is injured in

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.510
a car explosion, but those parts ended up
being edited out completely.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.770
Gisele’s role in the monster hit was reduced
to archive footage from previous movies and

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.490
a still photograph, despite Gadot receiving
top billing on the project.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.770
Fans enjoyed watching her, so it’s a shame
her final performance was cut.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.400
These are just some of the actors who were
cut from their movies.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.520
Which ones did we miss?
