00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're here on Palo Street in San Francisco.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Palo Street is one of the routes for San Francisco's famous trolley cars.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, interestingly enough, the force that pushes these cars up the hill

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is actually the force of friction between the track and the wheels of the car.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, this section of the hill I'm on right now is inclined at an angle of 10 degrees.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If we assume the mass of the trolley car to be 1,000 kg,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
what I want to know is what force is necessary to keep the car

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
moving up the hill at a constant speed.
