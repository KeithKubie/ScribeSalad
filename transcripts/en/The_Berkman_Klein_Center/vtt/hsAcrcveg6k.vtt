00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.280
 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.830
The famous architect Meinhard von
Gerkan designed the striking building

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.280
shown on your screen.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.530
It serves as a train station in Berlin.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.640
It stands on an
historically important spot,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.570
in what we used to be No Man's
Land between East and West Germany.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.880
As you can see, it's quite
a remarkable structure.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.520
It was also expensive to build.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.060
It took eight years and
cost 700 million euros.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.010
To cut costs, Deutschebahn, the German
railway company that owns the station,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.930
decided not to install the
cathedral-like vaulted ceiling

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.840
that von Gerkan originally designed,
but instead installed a cheaper,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.780
flat metal ceiling designed
by another architect.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.160
Outraged, von Gerkan brought a lawsuit.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.790
Altering his plans, he insisted,
was equivalent to, quote,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.780
"ripping pages out of
a novel," end quote.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.960
The court agreed that
his original design

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.810
had been defaced, and consequently,
that his rights had been violated.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.850
On that basis, the judge
ordered the ceiling

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.400
rebuilt, even though it would
reportedly cost 30 million euros.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.380
Here's another case.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.620
The Canadian sculptor Michael
Snow created this sculpture

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.660
of a set of 60 realistic
flying geese, which

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.080
hangs in Toronto's Eaton Center,
which is a shopping mall.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.510
During Christmas season
in 1982, the mall

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.610
decided to hang a red
ribbon around the neck

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.350
of each goose as part of
its Christmas display.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.190
Snow found the ribbons, as he said,
quote, "ridiculous," end quote.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.280
They undermined his
intention, which had been

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.470
to create a naturalistic
image of birds in flight.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.530
Snow sought an injunction, compelling
them all to remove the ribbons.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.250
Judge O'Brien of the Ontario High Court
of Justice agreed with Snow's position.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.930
An artist's subjective intent
concerning the purpose and character

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.310
of his work of art
deserves weight, the judge

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.030
concluded, so long as it's
reasonable, and Snow's intent was.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.630
The judge ordered the ribbons removed.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.910
 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.800
The moral intuitions that
underlie these and other rulings

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.970
are different from the
intuitions that underlie

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.300
what we have called Fairness Theory.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.590
They're less concerned
with rewarding labor

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.910
and more concerned with
respecting and protecting

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.400
a special kind of emotional or psychic
bond between artist and creation.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.730
Both von Gerkan and Snow had been
well compensated for their efforts.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.960
In that sense, they'd already
been rewarded appropriately.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.200
But morality, and consequently, law,
many people believe, should go further,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.700
should recognize an artist's
continuing control over his creations.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.450
To do otherwise would be to
cut at the artist's soul.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.970
 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.800
The source and political
philosophy of this approach

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.090
is not Locke, but Kant and Hegel.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.540
I mean that in a special sense.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.620
As Cyrill Rigamonti has
argued, it's not clear

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.600
that the legal doctrines underlying
the cases that I just described

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.840
were, in fact, influenced
by either Kant or Hegel.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.460
Rather, when contemporary
scholars and lawmakers

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.930
look to philosophy for
sustenance and guidance

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.970
when filling out their moral
intuitions, they look to Kant and Hegel,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.340
and more broadly, to the
personality theory of real property

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.762
with which Kant and Hegel
are commonly associated.

00:03:50.762 --> 00:03:52.470
As I did with the
fairness approach, I'll

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.330
begin with a brief review of the
underlying theory of real property

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.550
and then consider its
implications for copyright.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.110
The heart of personality
theory is the proposition

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.300
that certain kinds of bonds with objects
are crucial to human flourishing,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.760
and consequently, that the law should
respect those bonds by creating

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.800
and enforcing private property rights.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.620
Arguments of this sort
come in many flavors.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.730
Put differently, over the
centuries, different philosophers

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.310
have identified a wide variety of ways
in which private property rights can

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.637
contribute to human flourishing.

00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:27.720
They're listed on the map.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.330
 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.750
The first of these is peace of mind.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.930
This is emphasized by Charles
Fried in this book Right and Wrong.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.970
Awareness that, by using
resources, you are disadvantaging

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.070
countless other people, some
of whom are desperately poor,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.410
can be morally exhausting,
Fried contends.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.490
Private property rights, by assuring
you that you own those resources,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.970
provides relief from that painful
and perhaps disabling emotion.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.695
The second argument,
highlighted by Jeremy Waldron

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:07.290
in his justly famous book The Right
to Private Property, is privacy.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.660
One of the functions
of a property right is

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.500
to provide you a place where you can
either be alone or enjoy intimacy

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.100
with others.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.180
The home, protected by
private property rights,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.990
is a haven in a heartless world.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.180
The kind of control over
information enabled by copyright

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.980
can also help shield privacy,
as it has done, for example,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.590
for the reclusive but litigious author
JD Salinger, who aggressively pursues

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.630
other writers who encroach on his
informational and artistic domain,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.240
for example, by quoting his letters
in a biography, or more recently,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.620
writing a sequel to one of his novels.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.130
The third theme, explored in detail by
John Stuart Mill and Abraham Lincoln,

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.490
is autonomy.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.390
The ability, provided by property
rights, to control resources

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.820
is necessary, so the
argument goes, to enable

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.820
persons to become independent
and self-directing.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.760
The fourth, emphasized by
the legal scholar Carol Rose,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.320
is that property rights facilitate
self-realization as a social being.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.800
By owning and trading things, people
help shape their social environments

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.800
and establish their
places in communities.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.030
Commerce, Rose contends, is
humanizing, not dehumanizing.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.350
The fifth is perhaps the most
famous, and in current scholarship,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.450
the most influential of the variants.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.670
It contends that property rights
are crucial to self-realization

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.070
as an individual, not as a social being.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.500
By owning and thus
controlling objects, a person

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.470
is able to assert his or
her will, and thereby,

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.900
to be recognized as a
free agent by others.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.370
Authors who, building on
the work of Hegel and Kant,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.090
explore this theme in depth, include
Margaret Jane Radin, Justin Hughes,

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.690
and again, Jeremy Waldron.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.440
Here's an illustrative
passage from Waldron's book.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.450
"These philosophical themes
form an important part

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.560
of Hegel's conception of freedom and
of the argument for private property

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.890
that he develops on that basis.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.920
Self-assertion can be understood
as a man's assertion of himself

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.630
against nature.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.800
Natural resources by
themselves are blankly

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.070
material with no point
or purpose of their own.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.060
If they are to have a
point or purpose, they

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.580
must be given one by being occupied
by human goals and purposes.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.890
By investing a natural
object with purpose,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.520
an individual becomes aware of the
priority of will in a world composed

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.530
largely of objects that
cannot actively possess it.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.800
Thus, he ceases to regard himself
as a mere animal part of nature

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.990
and begins to take seriously the
special and distinctive features

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:04.310
of rationality, purpose, and will."

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.980
The sixth argument is
that property rights

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.220
afford people security and
leisure, thereby freeing them

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.690
from the mind-numbing obsession
with obtaining the means of survival

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.020
and enabling them to pursue
artistic and cultural callings.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.790
Waldron and George Fitzhugh
fill out this theme.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.240
The seventh variant, explored by
the British philosopher TH Green,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.090
in addition to Mill,
emphasizes the importance

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.990
to human flourishing of responsibility.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.809
Ownership and management of
property cultivates virtues

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:43.419
like prudence and foresight, which,
in turn, are tied to full personhood.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.800
The eighth, which figures
prominently in the writings of Radin,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.110
centers on identity.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.230
Selfhood, Radin
contends, depends in part

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:57.460
upon the ability to project a continuing
life plan into the future, which,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.410
in turn, is fostered by property rights.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.490
You can readily see how this
theme might arise with respect

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.280
to artistic creations, at least
unique artistic creations.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.610
Destruction or modification
of those creations

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.840
might well threaten the author's
means of maintaining an identity, not

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.390
just a reputation, but a sense of self.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.250
The ninth theme is not prominent
in contemporary scholarship,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.270
but was once very important.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.210
The central idea here
is that property rights

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.530
enable owners to become
virtuous citizens,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:35.340
to participate in political
deliberation responsibly and selflessly.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.140
Civic virtue, in turn,
is central to personhood.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.870
This idea loomed large in the writings
of classical Republican political

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.270
theorists, including
many of the people who

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.040
contributed to the founding
of the United States.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.370
Finally, control over
resources, and in particular,

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.920
control over one's
own creative products,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.010
may facilitate self-expression,
which, in turn, is

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.980
necessary for self-fulfillment.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.510
This idea can be found in the writing
of some philosophers, like TH Green,

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.360
and also in the work of
many artists themselves.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.870
Here's an example.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.470
Gary Larson, as many of you
know, is a famous cartoonist

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.580
with a distinctive drawing style and
an irreverent, even macabre, sense

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.260
of humor.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.520
The first major paper to carry
his cartoons, the Seattle Times,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:32.377
dropped them because some readers
denounced them as sick and offensive.

00:10:32.377 --> 00:10:34.960
Fortunately, the San Francisco
Chronicle picked up the series,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.530
and the rest is history.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.560
Despite his iconoclasm,
Larson was a strong defender

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.420
of a particular conception
or kind of copyright.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.630
His stance is well
expressed in an open letter

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.760
he wrote, criticizing his
fans for copying his cartoons

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.340
and posting them on their home pages.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.630
"Years ago, I was having lunch one day
with a cartoonist, Richard Guindon.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.550
And the subject came
up how neither of us

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.920
ever solicited or accepted
ideas from others.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.590
But until Richard summed
it up quite neatly,

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.500
I never really understood my
own aversions to doing this."

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.640
Quote, "'It's like having someone
else write in your diary,'" end quote,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.710
"he said.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.220
And how true that
statement rang with me.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.400
In effect, we drew
cartoons that we hoped

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.250
would be entertaining, or at
the very least, not boring.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.630
But regardless, they would always
come from an intensely personal,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.040
and therefore, original perspective.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.820
To attempt to be funny is a very
scary, risk-laden proposition.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.979
Ask any stand-up comic
who's ever bombed on stage.

00:11:37.979 --> 00:11:40.395
But if there was ever an axiom
to follow in this business,

00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:43.630
it would be this-- be honest to
yourself, and most important,

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.440
respect your audience.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.490
So in a nutshell-- probably an
unfortunate choice of words for me--

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.570
I only ask that this
respect be returned.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.230
And the way for anyone to do
this is to please, please refrain

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.430
from putting The Far
Side out on the internet.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.260
These cartoons are my children of sorts.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.440
And like a parent, I'm
concerned about where

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.320
they go at night without telling me.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.740
And seeing them at someone's website
is like getting the call at 2:00

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.280
in the morning that goes, 'Uh, dad,
you're not going to like this much,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:21.440
but guess where I am.'"

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.790
Two aspects of this letter
bear emphasis-- first,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.950
the contention that
public self-expression

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.940
is very scary and risky,
and the law should

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.530
help create conditions that
enable and encourage it;

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:40.380
and second, the conception of one's
artistic creations as one's children.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.700
The need to control those
creations, Larson argues,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.170
is like the need to keep
track of one's kids.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.900
When we examined Locke's theory
of property, we saw that only some

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.770
of the ways in which he
fleshed out his arguments

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.120
seemed germane to intellectual property.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.770
The same is true here.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:01.050
In my tour of the 10 variants
of personality theory,

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.860
I've tried to flag
those that seemed most

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.420
relevant to the interests of artists.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:13.620
I hope, by now, it's clear that
those are numbers 2, 5, 8, and 10.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.410
To review, maintenance of
artists' ability to control,

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.720
at least in some ways,
their creations is

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.660
arguably necessary to
respect, first, their privacy;

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.730
next, their capacity to achieve
individual self-realization;

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.900
next, their identities; and
finally, their opportunities

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.220
for self-expression.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.810
The countries where belief in these
connections had the greatest influence

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.140
are located in continental Europe.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.210
Not surprisingly, those same
countries have the legal systems

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.344
that are most protective of artists.

00:13:45.344 --> 00:13:47.260
More specifically, in
those countries, artists

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:53.190
enjoy a set of entitlements,
commonly referred to as moral rights.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.030
In its full-blown version, the
concept or system of moral rights

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.850
encompasses six distinct entitlements.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.090
The first is the right
of attribution, which

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.130
is the right to be given credit
for things you have created

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.550
and not to be given credit for
works that you did not create.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.600
The second is the right
of integrity, which

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.190
is the right to prevent the destruction
or mutilation of one's creations.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.590
This is the best known and probably
most important of the rights.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.840
It underlaid the von
Gerkan and Snow cases

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.520
we discussed at the
outset of this section.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.770
The right of disclosure is the
right to decide if and when

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.270
to make one's works public.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.820
Suppose, for example, that a
painter has been commissioned

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.590
to create a portrait
of a particular subject

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.790
and has already been
paid the contract price.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.250
The painter paints the portrait,
but is unhappy with it.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.090
The subject demands
that it be delivered.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.700
May the painter refuse?

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.780
In jurisdictions that respect the
right of disclosure, the answer is yes.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.450
The painter will have to
indemnify the person who

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.550
commissioned the painting, perhaps
by returning the contract price,

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.350
but does not have to turn
over the painting itself.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.845
The right of withdrawal,
rarely exercised,

00:15:04.845 --> 00:15:07.520
is the right in principle
to demand that works

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.160
one has come to regret be returned.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.650
Suppose, for example, that Picasso
came to regret his Blue Period.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.230
He could demand that
their current possessors

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.180
return all of those paintings.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.730
Again, an artist exercising this
right would have to indemnify,

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.855
in advance, the persons obliged to
relinquish the works in question.

00:15:28.855 --> 00:15:31.770
 

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.610
The right against excessive criticism,
also rarely exercised, in principle

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:43.900
enables an author or artist to recover
against a critic who abuses him or her.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.320
Finally, the droit de suite is the right
to collect a fee when one's works are

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.600
resold, for example, when the current
owner of one of your paintings

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.820
resells it to another collector.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:01.670
Now, here's a brief reminder of ground
we covered in the first lecture.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.120
As we discussed there,
the Berne Convention

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.970
purports to require member
countries to recognize

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.330
two of these moral rights--
specifically, the right of attribution

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.630
and the right of integrity.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.700
But as we saw, the Berne
Convention lacks teeth.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.875
And the TRIPS Agreement,
which does have teeth,

00:16:17.875 --> 00:16:20.750
does not incorporate the provision
of the Berne Convention pertaining

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.130
to moral rights.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.200
The net effect is that countries,
like the United States,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.460
that are reluctant to recognize moral
rights are, as a practical matter,

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.710
free to evade their treaty obligations.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.562
Late in this lecture
series, we'll examine

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.270
what's known as the
Visual Artists Rights

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.330
Act, which is the provision
of US copyright law

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.995
that implements a quite truncated
version of moral rights.

00:16:45.995 --> 00:16:48.870
For the time being, we're concerned
not with the contours of the law,

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.780
but with the theory that provides
the best support for the moral rights

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.940
system.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.620
And that theory, as I've suggested,
is the personality theory.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.290
Scholars who follow this line
contend that intellectual products

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.800
are manifestations or extensions of
the personalities of their creators.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.410
An artist defines herself
in and through her art.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.900
The artist, consequently,
is morally entitled

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.740
to considerable control over her works.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.460
Why, exactly?

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.569
Partly because those injuries
result in corresponding impairment

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.859
of the creator's self, and partly
because maintaining a connection to

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:33.050
and control over her works is one of
the ways in which an artist establishes

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.437
and sustains an identity.

00:17:35.437 --> 00:17:37.270
The classic version of
this argument focused

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.010
on the interests and rights
of the lone artist or author.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.200
Historically, the strongest
version of personality theory

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.600
was associated with
romanticism, which, as you know,

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.470
celebrated solitary artistic
geniuses-- the novelist

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:57.540
or painter in the garret projecting
his or her vision onto paper or canvas.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.570
Nowadays, it is widely,
although not universally,

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.620
recognized that that
conception of creativity

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.370
is unrealistic or at least rare.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.170
Awareness that creativity
is more often collaborative

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:15.440
and that many artists incorporate not
merely the ideas of their predecessors,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.860
but some of their
predecessors' materials,

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.850
has prompted some scholars, writing
in the vein of personality theory,

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.520
to argue for important adjustments
to its doctrinal implications.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.230
Most importantly, if we wish to ensure
that all persons have opportunities

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.440
to engage in self-fulfilling
creative activities,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.750
we may need to liberalize the rules
governing their transformative uses

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.800
of already existing artistic products.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.650
When we discuss the efforts of scholars
to adapt Locke's labor-desert theory

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.250
of real property in the context
of intellectual property,

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.830
I suggested that those scholars
confronted serious difficulties,

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.760
arising out of the ambiguity of
key concepts in Locke's approach.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.720
The same is true of personality theory.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.560
Listed on the map are a
few of the difficulties

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.405
the scholars working this vein face.

00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:11.040
 

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.510
At the most primary
level, it's not obvious

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.650
whether an artist who invests
herself in a work of visual art

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:22.470
should be able to prevent others
from imitating her creations.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.100
Some commentators, emphasizing
the self-expression

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.360
inherent in the making of
the imitation, argue no.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.490
Others disagree.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.560
For obvious reasons, this goes
to the heart of copyright law.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.040
Assuming that an artist has the right
to control copying of her creations,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.120
may she alienate that right?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.660
For example, may a composer
assign to a music publisher

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.940
all of her rights in her composition?

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.790
As we'll see, this is conventional
in most jurisdictions.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.120
Is it legitimate?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.860
Some scholars, purporting to draw
on the writings of Kant, argue no.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.505
Others, seeking guidance
from Hegel, argue yes.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.680
Here's a more specific
contemporary question.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.620
In many American states, celebrities
enjoy the right to control,

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:17.100
and therefore, the right to charge for,
commercial uses of their identities.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.140
Shown on the screen is one
of a series of advertisements

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.920
that provoked a famous
application of that principle.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:30.310
In the late 1980s, the consumer
electronics company Samsung

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.490
introduced a set of what were intended
to be humorous ads, ostensibly set

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.870
into the future, each of which
juxtaposed a hypothetical news

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.470
headline with the depiction
of a durable Samsung product.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.320
 

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.440
Here's the one that got
Samsung into trouble.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.070
The hypothetical news story, which
appears at the top of the ad,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.480
suggested that the game
show Wheel of Fortune

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.447
would still be broadcast in 2012.

00:20:58.447 --> 00:21:00.280
However, the letters
on the game board would

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.310
be turned not by Vanna White,
the actress who had become famous

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:08.990
in this role, but by a robot, which
would literally take White's place.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.660
 

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.750
Shown on this slide, on the left
side is the real Vanna White,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.600
and on the right side, a blow-up
of the image of the robot

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.920
that appeared in the Samsung ad.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.560
White argued plausibly that
the color of the robot's hair,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.710
the color and style of its
dress, and above all, its pose,

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.430
was intended to evoke her.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.820
She brought a lawsuit, arguing
that the advertisement constituted

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.460
a commercial appropriation
of her identity.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.780
And she prevailed.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.290
The theoretical question posed by
this case and many similar cases

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.610
is whether a celebrity's persona is
a sufficiently important embodiment

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.130
of personhood that it,
like a painting, should

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.620
be shielded against non-permissive uses.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.710
Some scholars argue yes, indeed
regard the answer as self-evident.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.290
Others, like Michael Madow, disagree,
contending, among other things,

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.810
that a celebrity's fame typically owes
as much to the media and the audience

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.780
as it does to the creative
contributions of the celebrity herself

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.290
and thus should not be analogized
to works like von Gerkan's train

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.850
station or Snow's geese.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.100
These are hard questions.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.060
As I suggested when we were discussing
the application of Locke's argument

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:32.390
to copyright, it's very unlikely
that the answers to such questions

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.125
can be derived from a careful
reading of the canonical texts

00:22:35.125 --> 00:22:39.040
in this theoretical tradition,
namely the writings of Kant, Hegel,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.100
and so forth.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.140
The value of personality
theory, I suggest,

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.670
is not to provide us determinate
answers to modern problems,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.370
but rather to sensitize
us to and to help

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:55.110
us reflect upon the ways in which
control over intellectual products

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:01.130
can influence opportunities for
individual or group self-fulfillment.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.330
In that spirit, here are a few
additional ways in which personality

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.380
theory has been or might
be applied to suggest

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.760
ways of thinking about specific issues
that arise in contemporary copyright

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.260
law.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.340
How long should a copyright last?

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.550
The duration of a patent, as many of
you know, is quite short-- 20 years

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.130
from the date of the patent application.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:29.280
As we'll see in most countries
today, copyrights last much longer--

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.380
typically for the life of
the author plus 70 years.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.125
If the principal function of a
copyright is to reflect and protect

00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:40.110
an author's personhood interests
in his or her creations,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.630
perhaps that term is too long.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.500
Perhaps it should last for no
more than the life of the author.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.730
Or more narrowly, perhaps
moral rights should

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.290
expire with the death of the author.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:56.050
Another example-- as we'll
discuss in later lectures,

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.250
many jurisdictions,
including the United States,

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:03.990
have rules that confer upon employers
the copyrights in the works prepared

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.720
by their employees.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.200
These rules are highly controversial.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.700
One ground in which they
are commonly criticized

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.729
is that they fail to respect the
employee's personhood interests

00:24:15.729 --> 00:24:16.520
in their creations.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.490
 

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.330
A related criticism of contemporary
copyright law that arguably is also

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.330
fueled by personality theory is that
several doctrines in combination

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.730
inhibit the ability of creative people
to remain economically independent

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.470
and thus in control of their
creative activities and products.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:40.260
Copyright law, in other words, is
biased toward the interests of companies

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.980
and fails adequately to support
intellectual entrepreneurs.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:50.450
One of the sources of that bias, so it's
argued, is the set of procedural rules

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.880
that govern copyright
lawsuits and the remedies

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.020
available to successful litigants.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.190
Those rules operate, as
we'll see, to the advantage

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.460
of parties with deep pockets and
emotional fortitude, neither of which

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.680
is typically true of the
kind of autonomous artists

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.030
that are celebrated
by personality theory.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.120
Another example-- it's widely
thought that, in general, artists

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.090
are not good at business and thus
tend to sign away their rights

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.410
too quickly or for too little money.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:26.200
Most copyright systems contain some
rules designed to protect artists

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.530
or their families against the
consequences of their folly

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.820
or ignorance.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.510
Some scholars, drawing in
part on personality theory,

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.730
argue that those protective
devices are insufficient and should

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.610
be strengthened.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.600
Finally, as I suggested a
minute ago, some scholars

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:48.720
contend that, if all persons are to
have opportunities for self-fulfillment

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.410
analogous to those enjoyed
by a Picasso or a Wordsworth,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.870
copyright law should be amended
to increase people's freedom

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.340
to make derivative uses of
existing creative works,

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.880
such as photographs, films,
and sound recordings.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.750
This might be achieved
through adjustment

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.660
of one of the major defenses
to copyright infringement,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.130
namely the doctrine of fair
use or fair dealing, which

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.789
will be considered in
detail late in the course.

00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:18.080
In countries like the United States that
currently provide expansive protection

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.630
for moral rights, the
same adjustment might

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:26.030
require some curtailment of
the famous right of integrity.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.890
This last possibility is perhaps the
most counterintuitive and eye-opening

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.760
of the reform proposals
we've considered thus far.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.960
It entails invoking
personality theory to qualify

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.630
one of the primary conventional
doctrinal embodiments

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.436
of that same theory.

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:46.310
By the end of this series
of lectures, I hope

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.910
you are in a position to make
your own judgment concerning

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.820
the persuasiveness of this proposal.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.690
So that's it.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.380
That concludes our
examination of the first two

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.240
of the four theories of
copyright, namely fairness

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.520
and personality-based theories.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.390
In the next lecture, I'll discuss the
subject matter coverage of copyright,

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:11.200
what kinds of creations are
protectable and what kinds are not.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.130
Then, in the lecture after that,
I'll return to copyright theory

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.130
and take up what has
become the most influential

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:21.940
of the four approaches, namely the
utilitarian-based welfare theory.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.160
This, as we'll see, looms
even larger in policy and law

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.790
than the arguments
we've addressed today.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.420
Thank you.
