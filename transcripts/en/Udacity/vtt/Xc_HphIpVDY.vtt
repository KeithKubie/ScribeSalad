00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.670
Now that we have seen how LRU works,
let's do a quiz about it.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.299
Let's say that this is a single set in a
cache that is eight way set associative,

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.384
so there are eight lines in the set.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:16.239
Let's say that the blocks we have are A,
B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.590
And let's say that this LRU
counters that correspond to these

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.520
are like this where 0 is
the least recently used.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.980
What is the new content of the cache,
after we perform axises to A,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.815
then B, then A again, then D, then K?

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:40.585
You only need to say which blocks
are in each line in the cache,

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.865
not what their LRU counters are.

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.455
But you do need to track
the LRU counters in order to

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:46.805
arrive at the correct answer.
