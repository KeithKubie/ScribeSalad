00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.080
We�ve all encountered them: lines of dialogue
so bad, you can't help but groan at how cheesy

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.750
or tasteless they are. But do bad lines pop
up more often in bad movies, or are movie

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.599
fans just willing to overlook terrible dialogue
if they like the characters and story? The

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.429
following 10 films remain close to our hearts,
but we think you�ll agree that they�ve

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.210
earned their place on this list. Here are
Screen Rant's 10 Terrible Lines in Great Movies.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.210
Jurassic Park

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.101
In Steven Spielberg�s Jurassic Park, Donald
Gennaro is the lawyer sent along with the

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:39.230
movie�s �dinosaur experts� to determine
the park�s safety, but the wording of his

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.430
warning to Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm shows
some flawed logic.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.840
�Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply
concerned. Forty-eight hours from now, if

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.180
they�re not convinced, I�m not convinced.
We�ll shut you down, John.�

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.850
This over-explanitory line is butchered by
clumsy wording. It's confusing at best, and

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.400
an outright mistake at worst. Written more
clearly, later scenes of the main characters

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.000
being unconvinced while Gennaro sees only
profits would be twice as interesting. It�s

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.900
a line best ignored in a movie famed for its
quotability.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.900
North By Northwest

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.950
There aren't many �mistaken identity�
thrillers more iconic than Alfred Hitchcock�s

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.770
North by Northwest. Stars Cary Grant and Eva
Marie Saint earn the most attention, but acclaimed

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.840
screenwriter Ernest Lehman also deserves praise.
For North by Northwest, Lehman penned an exchange

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.369
racy enough to send 1959 crowds into bouts
of �the vapors.� In the original line,

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.060
Saint informs Grant that she �never made
love on an empty stomach,� clarifying she�s

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.450
referring to his stomach. Censors balked at
that witty blend of romance, sex appeal, and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.060
shock value, so audiences instead got the
meaningless exchange heard in the movie�s

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.229
final cut.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.420
�I never discuss love on an empty stomach.�
�You�ve already eaten.�

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.749
�But you haven�t.�

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:52.749
Gladiator

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.700
Ridley Scott�s action-packed Gladiator made
Russell Crowe a household name, but fans loved

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.310
to hate the film�s antagonist: Joaquin Phoenix�s
devious Emperor Commodus. There�s lots to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.479
hate about this scene � from the Moulin-Rouge-esque
camera sweep to Phoenix�s delivery �

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.479
�Why is he still alive?�
�I don�t know.�

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.479
�Well he shouldn�t be alive. He vexes
me� I�m terribly vexed.�

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:16.180
but the line left awkwardly hanging in midair
is worst of all. Saying that a man�s pulse

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.190
�vexes� him makes Commodus's self-involved
arrogance clear. The added emphasis confirms

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.920
that the filmmakers don�t trust their viewers
to get it on their own, which ruins the magic.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920
Superman: The Movie

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.920
In Superman: The Movie, Richard Donner originally
planned to have the film�s love theme, �Can

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.830
You Read My Mind?�, sung by Lois Lane in
a musical number. Ultimately, the song was

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.360
worked into Lane�s midnight flight with
Superman with her reciting the lyrics instead.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.000
�Can you read my mind?�
Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve�s chemistry

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.090
make the sequence work better than it could
have, but Kidder�s deadpan delivery, and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.010
the unexpected addition of an internal monologue
while flying alongside her new �friend from

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.320
another star,� makes for a pretty awkward
moment.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
There Will Be Blood

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.000
Daniel Day-Lewis won accolades for his work
in Paul Thomas Anderson�s There Will Be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.570
Blood, but it was Kevin J. O�Connor who
stole the spotlight with one troubled line.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.750
Audiences barely have time to recognize O�Connor
from his role in 1999�s The Mummy before

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.960
he claims that he�s the main character�s
brother... �from another mother.� Anyone

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.450
under the age of sixty knows this is as out
of place in the period as a cell phone, which

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.070
turns an otherwise revealing statement into
a punchline.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.070
Titanic

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.610
Unlike some of James Cameron�s greatest
hits - like the first two Terminator films,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.890
Aliens, and The Abyss -lines like �I�m
the king of the world� or �I�ll never

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.970
let go, Jack� have become the butt of countless
parodies and memes - and they�re not even

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.080
the film�s worst offenders. It�s the insight
into the nature of women, delivered in the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.970
voice of elderly Rose that stands out most.
�A woman�s heart is a deep ocean of secrets.�

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.710
Saying women are secretive while making not
one, but two plays on the name of the film�s

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.270
�Heart of the Ocean� necklace? That�s
the real tragedy.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.270
Batman Begins

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.080
With his Dark Knight trilogy, Christopher
Nolan adapted Batman�s mythology for modern

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.750
audiences while keeping much of the source
material intact, but each film still included

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.870
a handful of controversial moments. No line
sums up those issues better than this one.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.840
�Have you finally learned to do what is
necessary?�

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.459
�I won�t kill you. But I don�t have
to save you.�

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.670
In the film�s climax, Bruce Wayne informs
his mentor Ra�s al Ghul that he will never

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.790
kill in the name of a �greater good� before
ultimately leaving Ra�s to die.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.790
Spider-Man

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.290
Sam Raimi loves over-the-top dialogue and
action, and mainstream audiences got their

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.670
first mass exposure to his style in 2002's
Spider-Man. The result was a success, but

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.890
even though today�s comic book blockbusters
have Raimi and Spider-Man to thank for their

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.100
popularity, no character has come close to
being as cringe-worthy as Willem Dafoe�s

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.290
Green Goblin. This exchange between the Goblin
and Aunt May ended up exactly as Raimi intended,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.610
which proves that even the most inspired minds
occasionally cross the line.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.370
�Deliver us� [Green Goblin bursts through
wall] � DELIVER US��

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.540
�Finish it! Finish it!�
�FROOOOOOOM EEEEEEEVIIIIIILLLLLL!�

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.540
Man of Steel

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.780
It's a daunting task to re-imagine a global
icon, and although Christopher Nolan paved

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.150
the way with his Batman films, director Zack
Snyder received his fair share of scorn with

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.370
Man of Steel. He takes cues from Nolan�s
movies, but some of those cues are clearer

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.830
� and more flawed � than others. A kiss
from a hero after saving the day is nothing

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.710
new, but this line stuck out so much after
the decimation of Metropolis that the sentiment�s

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.720
overwhelming cheesiness is the least of its
problems.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.490
�They say it�s all downhill after the
first kiss.�

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.800
�I think that only applies if you�re kissing
a human.�

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.550
It shares DNA with Nolan�s brand of Bat-humor,
and in the Man of Steel universe, it�s completely

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.510
out of place.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.510
The Matrix

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.640
A taste was all it took for Neo to realize
the benefits of instantly downloading knowledge

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.440
into a human brain. When Morpheus comes calling
for an update on his progress Neo�s operator

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.430
explains that Neo has had no sleep, no food,
and no time off; in other words, he's �a

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.940
machine.� The metaphor makes sense, but
in the world of The Matrix, Tank is comparing

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.370
Neo to the mechanical enemy attempting to
wipe out humanity. Imagine if in Raiders of

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.440
the Lost Ark, Marion Ravenwood claimed Indiana
Jones was �a real Nazi when it comes to

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.590
archaeology.�
