00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,990
We've been digging into the
decipherment of ancient scripts,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,550
but what is a script

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,243
[inaudible]

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,320
I'm convinced we'll miss a lot along our
journey into decipherment if we don't

5
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:15,380
pack an understanding of writing
systems to take along with us.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,790
So at this point,

7
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:20,240
I plan to spend a few minutes racing
over the basics of writing with you,

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,830
but however hard I tried to
condense it and pack it in,

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,910
it's scratched for more scratched.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,090
The old Greek root for writing graph
meant scratch like scratching symbols into

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,910
rock or clay graph.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,650
Femes are written units like
the Letter v, a Semicolon,

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,990
the hung character for fire.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,580
The actual marks that get
written down are glyphs.

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,910
Here are some glyphs for the Grapheme
v and here are some glyphs for fire.

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,510
Little marks called diacritics
can modify those glyphs.

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,660
Here's an o with the nasal mark telling
you to pronounce it through the nose.

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,390
Oh, here's that same
diacritic above the letter.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,420
A diacritics are often simplified or
miniature versions of other glyphs.

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,870
So that little nasal mark comes from the
letter n put a top on other character.

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,380
Notice that a single grapheme can
be written with various glyphs.

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,710
These glyphs are all allographs
other scratches of the Grapheme v.

23
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,230
These glyphs are all allographs
of fire. Very roughly.

24
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:40,430
A set of graphemes that get used
together in writing makeup. A script,

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,120
a script together with the weighting
codes or represents language is a writing

26
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:50,180
system. Graph. Phoenix
wonders about writing system,

27
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:55,181
things like the use of certain symbols
for certain sounds or certain meanings or

28
00:01:56,091 --> 00:02:00,830
the differences between different writing
systems. Then there's gruff FedEx,

29
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,390
which wants to know about things like
the shape and composition of letters or

30
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,160
the mechanics of human handwriting.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,430
The word writing can mean any of these.

32
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,660
I really want to put some art in thought
into this separate voyage through

33
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:19,130
writing so that we can make the most
of decipherment tune in for both and

34
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,773
subscribed for language.

35
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:25,950
[inaudible].
