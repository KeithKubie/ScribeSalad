00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:01.828
- [Voiceover] So the house that's you are

00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:02.900
interested on the market

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.433
asking 310,000, you offered 300,000,

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:07.800
and so you make an offer contract,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.946
you dated, you give all
the right information,

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:11.507
you say what your offer is,

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:13.600
you give a deposit to show
that you're an earnest

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.248
that you're serious about this.

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.733
But then you list your contingencies and,

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.035
"Hey look, I want to buy this house

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:20.833
"unless it doesn't pass inspection,

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.300
"unless I'm not able to get financing,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.173
"unless I'm not to be
able to get insurance.

00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:27.233
"Unless the title is somehow not clear,

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:31.335
"but if all of this does
happen in a favorable way,

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:33.563
"then we're going to close
two months in the future."

00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:36.181
Now the seller has three options,

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.967
they could accept your offer.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:39.600
They could say, "Okay, you know I agree

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.896
"to this offer contract, and then you all

00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:41.933
"we'll both sign it.

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.063
So this is you know you
could put your signature,

00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:45.433
and the seller would put their signature

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.566
and so everyone agrees to this happening,

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.533
and then, and the your
deposit will essentially

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.200
be taken and we'll talk in a second

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.130
about where that deposit goes.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.066
Another option is that the seller

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.666
might just outright reject your offer.

00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.533
Says, "No, no, no, no, this is an insult,

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.521
"this house has been
in our family forever.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.633
"310,000 is my bargain basement price,

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.912
"I don't even want to, I
don't even want to give

00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:09.433
"credit to this offer by even

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:10.633
"you know doing anything else."

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:11.833
So they just reject it out, right?

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.446
And then the third options is that

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:15.566
they could give a counter offer.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.334
They'll say, "Okay, this is close,

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:19.933
"but I'm going to issue a
new counter offer contract,

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.866
"where instead of it being 300,000."

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.100
Now it's the seller we're talking about,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.012
they'll say, "How about 305,000?

00:01:26.012 --> 00:01:28.425
"Or how about fewer contingencies?

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:31.528
"Or how about a closing
date that is closer,

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:33.433
"closer to the period we're talking about.

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.500
"Or how about the buyer takes on more

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.366
"of some type of closing cost

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.666
"or some other type of thing
that's actually going on."

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.900
So the seller is trying
to give a counter offer

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.400
that's in some way more
favorable to the seller

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.233
than the buyer might look at that

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:48.858
and either turn it down or take it

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.225
on and on and on and on.

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.571
But let's just say for
the sake of this video,

00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:55.009
that this offer contract is accepted.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.861
So if the offer contract is accepted,

00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:02.861
then, then the buyer signs
it, the seller signs it,

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:05.467
and they move forward,

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:07.663
the transaction will move forward.

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:10.900
And this essentially releases
a whole series of things

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.166
that are going to go on.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:14.461
So let me see if I can diagram that out.

00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:18.884
So we are talking about
a world where the offer,

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.936
the offer is accepted.

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:22.833
And so the first thing
that is going to happen

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:24.863
is that we're going to
have, you're going to,

00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:26.763
you have an opening of escrow.

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:29.248
Opening of escrow.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.509
Opening of escrow and I
know what you're thinking.

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.826
What is escrow?

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.832
And I know you're thinking that because

00:02:37.832 --> 00:02:39.686
I remember the first that I was involved

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:40.833
in a real estate transaction,

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:42.233
and I thought that myself,

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:43.827
this word escrow kept popping up

00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:44.756
over and over again,

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:46.179
and I have never seen the word

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.033
until I started to having to deal

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.563
with this real estate transaction.

00:02:49.563 --> 00:02:51.367
And the whole idea of escrow,

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:53.315
let me scroll this up a little bit,

00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:58.315
is, if you have, so if you
have a buyer and a seller,

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.700
and escrow actually applies

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.740
beyond to just real estate,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.033
but the idea becomes useful
anytime you're making

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:07.633
a major transaction for something

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:09.300
that's quite valuable,
maybe the transaction

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.212
is a little bit involved.

00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:15.522
So the buyer, if you
have a buyer and a seller

00:03:15.522 --> 00:03:17.773
you might just say, you
know the buyer might say,

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:19.686
"Hey, give me keys to the house.

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:22.373
"Give me the keys, give me the keys,

00:03:22.373 --> 00:03:24.279
"and then I will give you the money.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.502
"Then I will give you the money."

00:03:26.502 --> 00:03:27.700
But the seller might say,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.266
"Hey, hey, hey, I'm not
going to give you the keys."

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:30.768
And when I really say
keys, I'm really meaning

00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:32.633
title to the house, that's
actually the important thing.

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:34.238
Keys, locks can be changed.

00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:35.894
"But give me ownership of the house,

00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:36.973
"and then I'm going to give you money."

00:03:36.973 --> 00:03:38.400
And then the seller says, "Hey, hey, hey,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.766
"no, no, this is a major asset.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:41.748
"This is my largest asset I have.

00:03:41.748 --> 00:03:43.233
"I'm not just going to give you title

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:44.533
"until I get the money first."

00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:45.260
And then the buyer says,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.733
"No, no, no, this is like
all the money I have,

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:47.867
"I'm not going to give you the money

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:49.976
"until I, until I get
the title to the house,

00:03:49.976 --> 00:03:52.589
"until I get ownership to the house first.

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:54.166
"And by the way I don't
want to give you the money

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.600
"until all of these other stuff happens,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.200
"until I can, until I
could inspect the house

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.466
"and do all of these other things."

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:01.315
And then the seller says,

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.156
"Hey wait, I don't want to let you

00:04:03.156 --> 00:04:05.961
"get all these strangers
into my house and inspect it,

00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:08.256
"unless I know for sure that
you're going to buy it."

00:04:08.256 --> 00:04:10.707
So you can see that this
can be, this could be

00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:11.933
a little bit of a law jam.

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:14.100
They want to transact,
but maybe they don't

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.833
trust each other, or maybe
they trust each other,

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.769
but they're just afraid
that maybe you know

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.933
the one person might
take the title and run

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:21.533
or one person might
take the money and run,

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.169
or they might not be serious.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.253
And so what society has developed

00:04:25.253 --> 00:04:28.433
to solve this problem, and
it's not just for houses,

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:30.200
it's for any major transaction,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.166
it could be for businesses,

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:33.753
or anything that could be fairly complex

00:04:33.753 --> 00:04:38.326
is they turn to a third
party, a trusted third party.

00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:40.281
So let me write this down.

00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:45.281
A trusted, a trusted
third party, third party

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:52.559
that is called the escrow agent.

00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:57.540
So this right over here
is the escrow agent.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.800
Escrow, escrow agent.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.600
And when we're talking about escrow,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.066
we're talking about
putting something into,

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:08.500
I guess you could say
a third party bucket,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.379
an account, and everything is going to be

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:11.251
placed there.

00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:12.563
The buyer is going to put all the things

00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:13.466
that they need to place there.

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:14.966
The seller is going to be placed

00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:16.100
everything that they placed there.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.946
And then the trusted
third party can verify

00:05:18.946 --> 00:05:21.373
that both parties have
met their obligations

00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:23.992
and then it can give the
seller what the seller needs,

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:26.056
and give the buyer what the buyer needs,

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:28.753
and then essentially
close that escrow account.

00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:30.884
So, right when you start this,

00:05:30.884 --> 00:05:33.666
when we say opening of the escrow account,

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.033
that means that, let's say this,

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:37.233
so this is the escrow agent,

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:38.552
and they're essentially going

00:05:38.552 --> 00:05:41.299
to manage the escrow account.

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:44.540
Escrow, escrow account.

00:05:44.862 --> 00:05:47.043
So as soon as the offer is accepted,

00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:49.484
you open an escrow account,

00:05:49.484 --> 00:05:51.600
and that deposit that we talked about

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.668
that goes into the escrow account.

00:05:53.776 --> 00:05:55.676
So let's put that in.

00:05:55.676 --> 00:05:58.768
So that deposit, that $9,000

00:05:58.768 --> 00:06:01.012
that was in the offer contract

00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:02.809
that goes into the escrow account.

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:04.300
Why is it important to put
it in the escrow account?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.356
Well if you give that
deposit to the seller,

00:06:06.356 --> 00:06:08.600
well maybe the seller
just cashes the check,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.476
but then later refuses to proceed

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:12.833
or doesn't allow the inspector
to come into the house

00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:14.494
or whatever else it might be.

00:06:14.494 --> 00:06:17.633
And so this is a way the
buyer can feel sure that,

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:19.600
"Okay, I'm writing this
check, but you know,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.138
"it's just not going to disappear

00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:22.500
"without me knowing about it.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.471
"$9,000 is not a small amount of money."

00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.100
And this way the seller feels good,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.800
"Okay, I trust this third party,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.147
"the buyer has an earnest.

00:06:30.147 --> 00:06:32.600
"Put the deposit there, I
know the deposit is there.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.735
"So now I can let the transaction proceed.

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:38.333
"I can let inspectors come into the house,

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:40.163
"feel good about it,
et cetera, et cetera."

00:06:40.163 --> 00:06:43.323
And so as we go through this period,

00:06:43.323 --> 00:06:45.681
as we go through this period between

00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:47.600
the time that the offer was made,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.734
this two month period,
it's not always two months,

00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:52.900
and the closing date, the closing date.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.194
And the closing really is the closing

00:06:54.194 --> 00:06:55.247
of the escrow account.

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:57.200
Once all of the parties
have met their obligation.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.928
But in that two month period,

00:06:58.928 --> 00:07:00.671
all the stuff is going to happen.

00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.686
And so you're going to have,

00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:05.246
you're going to have the inspection.

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:07.886
So house passes inspection,

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:12.886
passes inspection, the
house passes inspection.

00:07:14.148 --> 00:07:15.998
The financing comes through,

00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:18.300
and the rest of the money for the house

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.348
gets placed here.

00:07:20.763 --> 00:07:25.763
So financing, financing,
and, so the financing,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.000
so let's say this person is putting 20%,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.733
so this was the 9K deposit.

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:32.142
Actually, let me put some details here,

00:07:32.142 --> 00:07:34.316
so there's the 9k deposit.

00:07:34.455 --> 00:07:36.927
Now in order to actually
have the transaction,

00:07:36.927 --> 00:07:39.133
we have to have a whole 300,000 in there.

00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:42.133
And so let's say this buyer
is going to put 20% down

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:45.502
on the $300,000 house.

00:07:45.502 --> 00:07:47.550
So that's going to be $60,000.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.100
They've already put 9K.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.966
This is often, this
deposit is usually towards

00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:52.163
the down payment,

00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:53.500
and so they will want to put another

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.500
51K down payment. 51K, 51K down payment.

00:08:00.704 --> 00:08:02.600
And then the financing comes through,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.625
so this is going to be the remaining,

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:08.363
this is going to be
the remaining $240,000.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.794
$240,000 from the bank.

00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:13.199
And there might be some
other cost on either side.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.433
So these are kind of closing,

00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:15.933
what we call the closing cost.

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:17.233
And we'll do a whole videos on all

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:18.700
the different types of closing cost.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.833
But these might be paying the agents,

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:23.867
paying the mortgage brokers,

00:08:23.867 --> 00:08:27.300
paying for the escrow services,

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.600
the title services,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.524
the title searches et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:30.524 --> 00:08:35.455
So both sides are going to
put in their closing cost.

00:08:35.763 --> 00:08:38.353
So from the buyer and the seller.

00:08:38.353 --> 00:08:40.267
And we could talk about
in different states,

00:08:40.267 --> 00:08:42.697
there might be a different conventions,

00:08:42.697 --> 00:08:44.605
or even different transactions might have

00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:46.711
different conventions for closing cost.

00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:50.800
And so on 12/15, let's
say you go all the way

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.866
to 12/15, or we're
assuming this is happening

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:57.033
in 2015, you have your closing date.

00:08:57.033 --> 00:08:59.053
And so the trusted third party,

00:08:59.053 --> 00:09:00.767
this escrow agent is going to say,

00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.958
"Okay look, the buyer
has put everything that,

00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.538
"that they need to put in,
in order to buy the house.

00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:08.667
"The seller has met all
of their obligations,

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:10.917
"and the house has passed
all the inspection,

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.876
"all of these contingencies,

00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:15.533
"all of these contingencies
have been met."

00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:18.805
So on the closing day, on the closing day,

00:09:18.805 --> 00:09:21.540
this trusted third party, the escrow agent

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.123
will actually disperse the money.

00:09:24.123 --> 00:09:29.123
So we'll actually disperse
the $300,000 to the seller,

00:09:29.146 --> 00:09:32.400
and we'll actually issue the title

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.767
which is the ownership to the buyer,

00:09:35.767 --> 00:09:38.533
and also pay everyone else
who has to be paid here.

00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:39.633
They might have to pay themselves

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:40.789
because they're one of the,

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.076
they're one of the
services as part of this,

00:09:43.076 --> 00:09:44.566
so that will be involved
in the closing cost,

00:09:44.566 --> 00:09:46.386
though it might pay the
mortgage broker, the agents,

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.176
all of the other people who are party

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:50.163
to this transaction.

00:09:50.163 --> 00:09:51.933
And as we see in the video on titles,

00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:55.161
the title is really about filing a deed,

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:58.766
so filing a deed with the
county or with the city.

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:03.648
So this right over here
would, would be a deed

00:10:03.648 --> 00:10:07.125
which essentially gives the new owner,

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:10.589
the buyer proof that they
now own the property.

00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:12.442
So the big idea here, is this,

00:10:12.442 --> 00:10:14.746
the whole idea of escrow
is just a way for,

00:10:14.746 --> 00:10:17.033
a place to collect all of the obligations

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.130
of the different parties,

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.366
so that they can trust each other,

00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:21.133
and then on the closing date,

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:23.492
and that's really the close of escrow,

00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:25.650
because you don't need this
escrow account anymore,

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.033
it disperses the different things

00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:29.250
of the different parties,

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.456
so that the transaction is complete.
