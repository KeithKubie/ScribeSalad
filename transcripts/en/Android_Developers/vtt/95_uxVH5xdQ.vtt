Hsu: So as a company
and as a developer,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.968
most of our experience
is not mobile,

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:06.534
but actually on the desktop.

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:09.634
Client--when we were talking
about client applications.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:13.234
And Android was really nice,
because the platform provides

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:16.534
a lot of very desktop
kind of features.

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:18.601
It's not like
a watered-down mobile app--

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.834
uh, mobile
operating system, really.

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.300
You get a lot of powerful things
on the platform.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.200
One thing I would
like to see, however,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.400
is richer media APIs.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.934
The existing APIs
let us get

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.467
what we get done
on the phone now,

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:34.467
but, uh, we'd really like
to do some other things,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:38.100
and, uh, it doesn't really
have that--

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.067
that, uh, flexibility yet.
