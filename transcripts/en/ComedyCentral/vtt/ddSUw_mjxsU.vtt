- [Mosche] Hey, this
is Mosche Kasher.

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:05.572
- [Natasha] And Natasha Leggero.

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.273 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And we just got
married six months ago.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.874 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Which we think
pretty much makes us

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:11.077
qualified to give love
advice to strangers.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.545
- So that's what we did.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.748
We packed up the car, hit the
road, and spread the love.

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:18.752 line:0%
- [Both] This is
The Honeymoon Tour.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.927 line:0%
- If we were to
really dance like

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.963 line:0%
for real no one's watching,

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:34.300
this is what I think
it would look like.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.237
("Shake" by R'n'G)

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.602
(applause)

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.739
- I'm so glad you all
were watching that.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.974
(applause)

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.111
- What up, bitches?

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.845
Y'all ready to party or what?

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:20.847
Ha-ha, yeah.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.683
(laughter)

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.184
Just kidding.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:27.586
It's going to be a lot
less like that from me,

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:29.121 align:start size:94% position:6%
and a lot more like
private liberal art school

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.756
up here for a few minutes, so...

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.291
(laughter and applause)

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:36.262 line:0%
- Our only one thing comes
from my, I have a trigger

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:40.366 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
because I was cheated
on by someone.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.934
- Oh yeah.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:42.768
That's her thing, is I was
going to say infidelity?

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:43.870
- Yeah, and I can't...

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.137
(Natasha laughs)

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:46.438
It's frustrating
that I can't sleep

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:47.974 align:start size:84% position:16%
with other people when
it like seems okay.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.709 align:start size:81% position:19%
- The person I was
with would have

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.810
coffees and lunches
with a lot of girls,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.447 align:start size:97% position:3%
and a lot of them he had
had past relationships with,

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.115 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I was like
being cool about it,

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:59.218
and then it ended up being bad.

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:01.221
- So you don't love when
he has coffee with girls?

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.856 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah, but I'm not
telling him not to have it.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.658
I'm telling him
so he has coffees

00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:08.194
and lunches with guy friends.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.328
He'll say the guy's name.

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:10.829
- Uh-huh.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.198 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And when it's been a girl,
he'll be like, a friend.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.733
And I'm like, well who's...

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.336
So I have asked of him just
to tell me when it's a girl,

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:19.972 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I recently was like,
have you ever slept with her

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:21.240
or had a relationship with her,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.142
and he got really mad
at me for asking that.

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.511 align:start size:84% position:16%
I started off our
conversation by saying

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.813
this has nothing to do with you.

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:30.182
I have a trigger that
I'm trying to get past,

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:32.518
and it will go away in
time, and it would just

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:35.054 align:start size:88% position:13%
help me if there wasn't
just a vagueness.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.021
And then later--

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:36.822
- It's not going to help you.

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.057
- It wouldn't help you.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.726
- But I would just
like not a friend.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.360
Be like I'm with my
friend, Courtney.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.594
- But then you're the one--

00:02:42.594 --> 00:02:44.163
- And it's like we
69ed once in 2012.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:44.998
- No, that part--

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.566
(Natasha laughs)

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.867
- I had a boyfriend once,

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:51.571 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I thought maybe
something was going on.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.439
But then I started like
going through his stuff,

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.009
and I remember I read
like bad diary entries.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.610
And it made me so upset,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.780 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it was all kind
of his fantasy,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.382 align:start size:81% position:19%
and it kind of
ruined everything.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:07.086
And I always told myself I'll
never look at anyone's email.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.220
I just got over it.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.723
- What do you got, Ed?

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.392 align:start size:94% position:6%
- She likes to drink
bottled water constantly.

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:17.029
And instead of sipping
it like a normal person,

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.063
she'll suck it out of there,

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:19.699
so she'll crush the bottles.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.101
(laughter and applause)

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.470
- That is so specific.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.737 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like I don't know,
just like gross

00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:27.039
because like every time she goes

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.574 align:start size:84% position:16%
for a water bottle,
it's just like

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:30.909
(yelling)

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.110 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay and Sam,
what do you have to

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.313
say about this, in your defense?

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:36.816
- It doesn't sound like
that much of a problem.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:40.085 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's true, except if you
cut the little stuff out,

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.487 align:start size:84% position:16%
then you never build
up to big stuff.

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.156
Like you guys will get married,

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:45.457
you'll have spent
40 years together,

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:47.593
and then one day you'll
be like an old woman,

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:48.661
and you'll be in a rocking
chair, and you'll be like

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.096
(gurgling)

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.331 align:start size:97% position:3%
And he'll just come in
with a side of frozen lamb.

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.266
(screams)

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.500
(laughter)

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.469
I told you 40 years
ago to stop this!

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.937 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I actually feel
better after you guys,

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:00.473
because I'm like oh okay, cool.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.976
It's like oh, so I can
just like let this go.

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:08.113 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The thing about trust
is that it's either

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:10.516
the person's either worthy of
your trust, or they're not.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.584 align:start size:88% position:13%
The circumstances
around it don't matter.

00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:14.286 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's like you either
got a scum dude,

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:15.455
or you got a not-scum dude.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.688 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And sometimes
they're not even scum,

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:17.924
they're just too young
or something, you know?

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.158
- [Andree] Yeah.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.459
- It's like they're
just in experienced.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.329
- And also they say
that something like

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:27.700
70% of married couples
have a cheating partner.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.634
- [Andree] Oh my God.

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.302
- [Moshe] So it's kind of like--

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:31.203
- [Natasha] You think?

00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:31.971
- [Moshe] It is a betrayal.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:32.972
- That's crazy.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:33.939
- [Moshe] It is a betrayal,

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.475
but it's such a common betrayal,

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:38.845
it's like is it even
that big of a betrayal?

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.480
- [Andree] It's such
a French betrayal.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.881
(Natasha laughs)

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:43.282
- It's a classic
French betrayal.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:46.652
- Is there anything that
Ed could do differently?

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:47.887
- Besides the shirt, I guess?

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:50.790
(laughter)

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.558 align:start size:97% position:3%
- He's very passive-aggressive
about his roommates.

00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:56.028
Like his roommate broke a dish,

00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:58.664
so he wrote him a note.

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:00.533
Tell him, like be like

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.501
dude, you broke my dish.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.002
(laughter)

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:05.304
Or like where's my rent check?

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:07.973
(laughter)

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:08.908
- Okay, I have an idea.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.342
- [Moshe] Okay Natasha.

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:12.178 align:start size:94% position:6%
- How about you guys
move in with each other--

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.679
- [Moshe] I like it.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:14.480 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And you stop doing that
weird thing with your water.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.649
(laughter and applause)

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.183
- That seems very good.

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:19.518
That seems great.

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:21.086
Ed and Sam, we've
made love happen.

00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:21.920
- Just stop doing it!

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.755
- Thank you.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.591
