00:00:00.797 --> 00:00:02.481
- So we have a couple of functions here.

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:05.681
This is the graph of y is equal to f of x.

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:08.563
This is the graph of y is equal to g of x.

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:10.180
And we already know something.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.879
Or we know ways to represent the area

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.112
under the curve y equals f of x.

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:18.487
Between these two points x is equal to a,

00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:19.514
and x is equal to b.

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:24.514
So this area, right over here,

00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:28.597
between the curve and the x axis,

00:00:28.597 --> 00:00:30.598
between x equals a and x equals b,

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:33.648
we know we can write that
as the definite integral,

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:38.648
from a to b, of f of x, dx.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.931
And we can do the same thing over here.

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:44.146
We could call this area,

00:00:44.146 --> 00:00:46.179
let me pick a color that I have not used.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.848
Well, this is slightly different green.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.680
I could call this area right over here,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.346
the area right under the
curve y is equal to g of x.

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:55.430
And above the positive x axis,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.713
between x equals a and x equals b,

00:00:57.713 --> 00:00:59.931
we could call that the definite integral.

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:04.931
From a to b of g of x, dx.

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:08.047
Now given these two things,

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.429
let's actually think about
the area under the curve

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.181
of the function created by the
sum of these two functions.

00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:14.663
So what do I mean by that?

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:18.014
So let me, this is
actually a fun thing to do.

00:01:18.014 --> 00:01:19.313
Let me start again.

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:21.298
That's exactly what we have over here.

00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:24.313
This is the graph of y is equal to f of x.

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:25.963
But what I want to do,
is I want to approximate

00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:30.764
the graph of y is equal
to, so my goal is to graph

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:35.764
y is equal to f of x, plus g of x.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.046
So for any given x,
it's going to be f of x.

00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:47.015
So that's that the f of x.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:48.578
And then I'm gonna add the g of x to it.

00:01:48.578 --> 00:01:50.097
So what will that look like?

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:52.431
So that's gonna look like, let's see.

00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:54.979
When x is zero, g of x looks like

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.114
it's about that length right there.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:57.630
I'm obviously approximating it.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.797
So I'm gonna have to add
that length right over here.

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:01.646
So it'll probably be right around there.

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:04.730
At x equals a, it's a little bit more.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.913
And so but now my f of x curve
is gone, or has increased.

00:02:08.913 --> 00:02:10.714
But I take that same distance above it.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.714
If I add the g of x there,

00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:14.598
it gets me right about there.

00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:16.613
Once again I'm just eyeballing it,

00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:17.848
trying to get an approximation,

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:21.146
giving me an intuition actually
for f of x, plus g of x is.

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:24.014
I'm just trying to add g of x for given x.

00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:25.946
Now let's see if I'm a little bit,

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:27.964
let's say that I'm between a and b,

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:32.230
g of x is about that
distance right over there.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.230
So, if I wanted to put that
same distance right over here,

00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:42.945
it gets me right about there.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.148
And then when x is equal to
b, g of x is about that big,

00:02:48.148 --> 00:02:51.996
so I have to add that
length, which is about,

00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:54.279
looks something like that.

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.729
That actually looks a little bit too much.

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.130
Maybe something like that.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.680
So, if I were to add
the two, I'd get a curve

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.980
that looks something like this.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.847
And maybe it just keeps on
going higher and higher.

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:10.862
So, this is the curve.

00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:12.630
Or it's a pretty good
approximation of the curve

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.541
of f of x plus g of x.

00:03:15.541 --> 00:03:20.452
Now an interesting question
is, is what would be

00:03:20.612 --> 00:03:23.265
well, you know how we
can represent this area.

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:26.930
So the area under the
curve f of x plus g of x,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.830
above the positive x axis,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.180
between x equals a and x equals b,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.064
we know we can represent that as,

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:40.978
let me see, I have not used pink, yet.

00:03:40.978 --> 00:03:43.464
So, this area right over here,

00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:46.313
we know that that could be represented

00:03:46.313 --> 00:03:47.502
as the definite integral,

00:03:47.502 --> 00:03:52.502
from a to b of f of x, plus g of x, dx.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.015
Now the question is,

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:01.297
how does this thing relate to d,

00:04:01.297 --> 00:04:02.714
or how does this area relate

00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:04.713
to these areas right over here?

00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:06.513
Well the important thing to realize is

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.513
this area that we have in yellow,

00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:13.131
that's going to be this
area, right over here.

00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:16.130
That one's pretty clear.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.647
But how does this area in green
relate to this area there?

00:04:20.647 --> 00:04:22.063
And to think about that,

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:25.164
we just have to think about
well what does an integral mean?

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.096
What does it represent?

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:28.446
We've already thought about these like

00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:30.864
these really small rectangles.

00:04:30.864 --> 00:04:34.180
And we're taking the
sum of the limit of an

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.413
infinite number of these
infinitely thin rectangles.

00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:39.099
But when we're thinking
about Riemann sums,

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.648
we're thinking about okay
we have some change in x,

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.829
and then you multiply it
times essentially the height,

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:45.687
which is going to be the value

00:04:45.687 --> 00:04:47.896
of the function at that point.

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:51.698
Well over here, you could
have the same change in x.

00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:53.713
You can have the exact same change in x.

00:04:53.713 --> 00:04:56.198
And what is the height right over here?

00:04:56.198 --> 00:04:58.299
Well, that's going to be this
exact height right over here.

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:00.015
You saw that when we constructed it.

00:05:00.015 --> 00:05:03.298
This is going to be the
g of x at that value.

00:05:03.298 --> 00:05:05.680
So even though the
rectangles look like they're

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.981
kinda shifted around a little bit,

00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:09.563
and they're actually all
shifted up by the f of x,

00:05:09.563 --> 00:05:11.180
the heights of these rectangles

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.881
that I'm drawing right over here,

00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:14.930
are exactly the same thing as the heights

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.347
of the rectangles that
I'm drawing over here.

00:05:18.347 --> 00:05:22.097
They, once again, they're
all just shifted up and down

00:05:22.097 --> 00:05:24.715
by this f of x function.

00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:27.247
But these are the exact same rectangles.

00:05:27.247 --> 00:05:28.848
And they have the exact same heights.

00:05:28.848 --> 00:05:31.265
And the limit as you get
more and more of these

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:32.264
by making them thinner and thinner,

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:33.480
is gonna be the same
as the limit as you get

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.630
more and more of these as
you get thinner and thinner.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.129
And so this area right over here,

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.797
and I'm obviously not
doing a rigorous proof,

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.298
I'm giving you the intuition for it,

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:44.847
is the exact same thing as
this area right over here.

00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:46.447
So the area under this curve,

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:50.598
the definite integral from a
to b of f of x plus g of x, dx,

00:05:50.598 --> 00:05:55.598
is just going to be the sum of
these two definite integrals.

00:05:57.848 --> 00:05:59.901
And you might say, "Oh this is obvious".

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.297
Or maybe it's not so obvious.

00:06:01.297 --> 00:06:03.364
But when is this actually useful?

00:06:03.364 --> 00:06:05.241
Well, as you later actually learn

00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.397
to evaluate these integrals,

00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:07.629
you'll see that one of
the most powerful ideas

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.563
is being able to decompose
them in this way.

00:06:09.563 --> 00:06:14.297
To say, okay, if I'm taking
the definite integral from

00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:19.297
zero to one of x squared, plus sine of x,

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.563
which you may or may not
have learned to do so far,

00:06:21.563 --> 00:06:23.362
you can at least start to break this down.

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:25.030
You can say okay, well this
is going to be the same

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.796
thing as the integral from
zero to one of x squared, dx,

00:06:29.796 --> 00:06:34.796
plus the integral from zero
to one of sine of x, dx.

00:06:35.847 --> 00:06:37.180
And you see this is one
of the most powerful

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.837
principles of definite
integrals, to make them,

00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:42.162
when you start to try to compute them,

00:06:42.162 --> 00:06:45.536
or even sometimes conceptualize
what they're representing.
