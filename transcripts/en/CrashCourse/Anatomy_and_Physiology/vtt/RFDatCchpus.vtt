00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Maybe you’ve noticed that every time we
talk about a new system, we highlight its

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.840
importance by saying how you’d die without
it.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.200
Like, without your muscular and skeletal systems
you’d collapse into an inert bag of goo.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.329
Or how if we magically removed your respiratory
or circulatory system, you’d die in a couple

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:15.980
of minutes ‘cause your cells wouldn’t
have oxygen.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.500
That’s because most of our bodies’ systems
are just trying to keep us alive, minute to minute.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.540
But one of those systems doesn’t really care if
you live or die. At least, not until it’s done its job.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.070
It’s how every living thing gets its start,
but it doesn’t really kick in until puberty,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.210
and even then it’s more concerned about
investing in the future than keeping you alive.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.820
When it comes to your reproductive system,
it’s not concerned about you, so much as

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.899
it is about your alleles, your genetic code,
and the future of the human species.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.519
Which are no small stakes.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.589
This system includes our primary, internal
sex organs, the gonads -- like testes and

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.780
ovaries -- the various sex hormones they secrete,
and the gametes -- the sperm and eggs -- they produce.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.720
It also includes the glands, ducts, external
genitalia, and particular brain parts that help the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.560
gonads and gametes do what they need to do, which
basically is mate, combine alleles, and make babies.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.020
Now, all animals have their own particular
and fascinating anatomical methods for getting

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.439
their gametes together, and we could do a
whole course just on that, and never run out

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.950
of material, and let me tell you, I would
like to do that.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.409
But while we may seem kinda tame compared
to animals that turn bright red, bite off

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.320
penises, or starve themselves for a chance
to breed, our systems are still plenty complex.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.380
In fact, it’s gonna take most of the month
to get through all our various anatomical

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.270
parts and hormones, and explain how sexy time,
fertilization, pregnancy, and development

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.899
work, starting today with the female anatomy.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.590
And remember, this is nothing to be shy about
-- when we’re talking about sex, we’re

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.330
talking about the future of humanity.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.119
So, when we talk about sex, we’re talking
about spreading our alleles around. But when

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.789
we visualize sex, what most of what we picture
are our anatomies.

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.789
Who has what. And what goes where.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.590
In an anatomical female, that involves the
vulva, which includes the mons pubis over

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.079
the pubic bone, and labia majora and labia
minora — the elongated skin folds that surround

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.929
the vestibule, which contains both the urethral
and vaginal openings.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.769
Beyond that is the vagina, which I’m sure
you know is how menstrual blood and babies

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.930
leave the body, and how sperm gets in.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.080
But, as much as we tend to put all the focus
on the bathing-suit parts, those are only

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.180
the genitalia -- the external sexual organs.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.110
And they’re really just a means of getting
gametes together. Reproductively speaking,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.290
they’re the least important parts of the
system.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.500
The ground control of the female reproductive
anatomy -- the place where the orders are

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.780
given -- are of course the ovaries. Their main job is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.560
to produce and release female gametes and sex
hormones like estrogen and progesterone.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.400
You’ll remember from biology that gametes
are haploid cells, meaning that they only

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.590
have one set of chromosomes, and are formed
by meiosis.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.510
When a sperm fuses with an egg, they make
a diploid cell, which has all the genetic

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.420
instructions required to make a baby. And
pretty much everything about how our reproductive

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.580
systems work is designed to make that happen.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.099
Each ovary lives inside a fibrous sac that
consists of a layer of connective tissue called

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.890
the tunica albuginea, and another layer of
cuboidal epithelial cells called the germinal

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.939
epithelium, which is actually part of the
peritoneum that lines the abdominal cavity.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.269
The ovary itself contains a cortex that houses
developing eggs, and a medulla that contains

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.269
most of the ovary’s blood vessels and nerves.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.640
But the business of passing on alleles and
saving humanity really begins in the basic

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.269
reproductive units in the cortex -- the ovarian
follicles.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.590
These are tiny-sac-like structures that each
hold a single primary oocyte — a sort of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.810
incomplete proto-egg — along with a bunch
of supporting follicle cells around it.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.700
Females are born with essentially all of these
early versions of eggs in all of the primordial

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.030
follicles they will ever have -- around 1
million at the time of birth.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.720
But right around birth, the oocytes stop developing
-- they get stuck in the first stage of meiosis.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.310
And they stay that way for years, sometimes
forever.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.629
The actual process of egg creation, or oogenesis,
is delayed until puberty, when the rest of

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.400
the body is physically ready to reproduce.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.379
Now, this works differently for us than it
does for some other animals. Like, if you’re

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.760
a salmon or a mayfly, then all of your eggs
will mature at once, and then you’ll mate,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.920
reproduce, and usually die, in quick succession.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.819
I mean, people talk about living fast and
dying young, but that -- that’s too fast.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.489
So human eggs mature one-by-one, almost constantly,
doled out so that every month or so, a mature

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.620
egg is either fertilized, or dies to make
way for a new egg.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.310
This should all sound familiar if you were
born with female anatomy, or know anyone who

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.900
was, because it’s a big part of the well-known
monthly menstrual cycle.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.430
But the truth is, menstruation is only one
part of one cycle.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.180
The menstrual cycle is what happens in the
uterus to prepare for a fertilized egg. The

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.820
other cycle, the ovarian cycle, is all about
the maturation of the follicle and egg, and

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.699
it’s actually what drives the menstrual
cycle.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.180
Every day, even before birth, a bunch of follicles
will begin a process of maturation, very slowly

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.930
morphing from primordial follicles into what’s
known as late-tertiary follicles, which are

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.750
the ones that will support a fully developed
egg.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.060
This process takes 375 days.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.479
But out of that bunch of follicles -- usually
about 20 or so -- only one follicle will end

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.479
up supporting a single, mature egg. The rest
won’t get the hormonal boost they need to

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.229
bring the egg to completion. This is what
happens to the one that start maturing before

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.680
puberty, for example, so they undergo atresia,
a kind of programmed self- destruction.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.509
And because I keep mentioning puberty, which
you’ve probably been through yourself, it

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.880
should come as no surprise that all of this
activity is regulated by sex hormones.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.150
Starting around puberty, the hypothalamus
and pituitary set up two concurrent cycles

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.610
-- the ovarian cycle in the ovaries, which
ripens eggs and secretes sex hormones, and

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.569
the menstrual, or the uterine cycle, which
prepares the uterus to capture and nourish

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.360
any mature, fertilized eggs.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.800
When puberty begins the hypothalamus starts up the
ovarian cycle by secreting gonadotropin-releasing

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.130
hormone about once a month. This is a sex
hormone that stimulates the anterior pituitary

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.460
to release two more hormones: follicle-stimulating
hormone -- you’ll often hear it called FSH

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.319
-- and luteinizing hormone, or LH.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:45.310
The follicle-stimulating hormone lives up
to its name by stimulating the growth of a

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.540
follicle -- but only one: the one that happens
to be furthest along in development at the time.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.259
The FSH drives that one lucky follicle to
keep growing, by triggering the follicle itself

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.419
to secrete its own estrogen hormones, which
locally signal the follicle to mature even more.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.509
That surge of follicle-secreted estrogen then
ends up stimulating the pituitary to secrete

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.599
another pulse of luteinizing hormone to finish
the job.

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.800
The LH gets to work on the oocyte that’s
been dormant inside the follicle, and triggers

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.920
it to finally start dividing again -- getting it to
complete meiosis I and move on to metaphase II.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.139
This whole process takes about 14 days, at
the end of which, the follicle -- which is

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.889
now mature -- pushes up against the ovary
wall, ruptures, and, with the help of enzymes,

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.470
breaches the wall and ejects a single, now
mature, oocyte.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.880
Congratulations. You’ve just ovulated.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.669
The damaged follicle now slows its estrogen
production while morphing into a different

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.819
structure, called the corpus luteum, which
eventually degenerates.

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.410
But first it releases a final hormonal swan
song -- a bunch of progesterone, a little

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.590
estrogen, and some inhibin -- that together
stop the release of FSH and LH.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.870
They also prepare the uterus to receive the
oocyte, which is now on its way down a fallopian

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.190
tube, where it might meet a nice young sperm.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.009
The tubes are about 10 centimeters long, and
interestingly, they aren’t actually connected

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.550
to the ovaries. This means that when the egg
pushes through ovary, it has to float a short

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.400
way through the peritoneal cavity before it’s
caught by a fallopian tube.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.889
Now, only if and when an egg fuses with a
sperm does it actually complete meiosis II

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:10.919
and officially become an ovum.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:14.259
But, whether it’s fertilized or not, the
egg works its way down the tube until it enters

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.940
the uterus, a hollow, thick-walled, and very
stretchable muscular organ that sits anterior

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.060
to the rectum and posterosuperior to the bladder,
and ends with the cervix.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.879
And the uterine wall is composed of three
layers: the perimetrium on the outside; the

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:32.050
bulky, smooth muscle myometrium that contracts
during labor; and the inner mucosal lining,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.980
the endometrium, which consists of a thin,
deep basal layer, and an outer functional layer.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.320
If fertilization does happen, then the new
embryo snuggles into the endometrium for gestation

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.199
-- but the uterus is only receptive to implantation
for a short time, about a week after ovulation.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.690
If the egg isn’t fertilized, that outer,
functional layer sloughs off.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.490
And that’s the first phase of the uterine,
or menstrual cycle -- the series of changes

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.979
that the endometrium goes through every 28
days or so, in response to changing hormone

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:00.680
levels, and in coordination with the ovarian
cycle.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.169
The shedding of the functional layer is triggered
when the progesterone and estrogens that were

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:08.720
being produced by the corpus luteum start
to drop, about 10 days after ovulation. This

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.460
phase lasts about 5 days.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:15.409
Meanwhile, the FSH and LH released from the
anterior pituitary start to rise again, stimulating

00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:18.360
the next round of follicles, which begin to
make estrogen.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.150
This heralds the start of phase two of the
menstrual cycle, the proliferative, or pre-ovulatory

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.610
phase, which typically lasts from days 6-14
of the cycle.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.789
The rising estrogen levels in the follicles
stimulate the regeneration of the endometrium,

00:08:30.789 --> 00:08:35.700
building a cushy, well-vascularized habitat
for another potential fertilized egg to call home.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.200
And after the next egg is released, the final
secretory, or postovulatory phase begins.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.160
This is when the ruptured follicle forms in
the corpus luteum. And if fertilization didn’t

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.610
happen, the corpus will stop producing progesterone,
and the endometrium will start to shed its

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.830
functional layer. And it starts all over again.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.260
BUT! If, by this time, the egg has met a nice
sperm and gotten fertilized, then the pulse

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.760
of progesterone from the corpus triggers even
more thickening of the functional layer of

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.900
the endometrium, and a secretion of nutrients
that will tide an embryo over until it has

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.960
implanted itself in the blood-rich lining.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.100
Which is a big if.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.580
Like, its whole separate video “big.”
So that’s where we’re going next time!

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.570
But for now, you learned all about female
reproductive anatomy, how sex hormones affect

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:20.110
oogenesis and ovulation, and how the ovarian
and menstrual cycles mature and release oocytes,

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.970
and create a comfy uterine environment for
a fertilized egg.
