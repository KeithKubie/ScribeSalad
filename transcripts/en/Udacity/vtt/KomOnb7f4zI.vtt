Minor stimulants are things such as caffeine and energy drinks, whereas major

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:09.560
stimulants are drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine. In general,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.766
stimulants do what they word says. They stimulate. And they do so by activating

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.781
the sympathetic nervous system. You remember, our fight-or-flight nervous

00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:22.109
system. Now in general, all stimulants produce similar effects, but they do so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.788
to a different degree. For example, caffeine will increase energy, but nowhere

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:32.798
near the same level as cocaine or methamphetamine. The stimulants produce an

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:37.859
increase in energy, talkativeness, and motor behavior. In addition, they also

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.505
elevate mood and can produce feelings of power or confidence. In fact, it's

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:46.135
these powerful effects on feeling and mood that make the major stimulants such

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:52.057
as cocaine and methamphetamine drugs of abuse. These stimulants produce their

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:55.576
reinforcing effectiveness by activating the nucleus accumbens and the dopamine

00:00:55.576 --> 00:01:00.024
reward pathway. Now it's important to remember that tolerance can develop to

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:02.576
some of the drug's effects, and I'm going to send it back to Lauren to talk

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:04.620
more about tolerance.
