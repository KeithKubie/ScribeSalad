00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.100
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz:
So for session two,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.940
we're covering the U.S.
perspective and to quote one

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.540
of our esteemed panelists,
"When the protection

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.070
of moral rights is brought
up in the United States,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.910
commentators have always
emphasized the differences

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.570
between continental Europe
and the United States."

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.290
And our second panel
is going to attempt

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.770
to explore this unique
U.S. perspective.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590
We're going to try
not to delve too much

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.710
into the comparative bit
that we already covered

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.190
in the first panel.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.290
So I'll take a moment here
to introduce our panelists.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.170
I think we're mostly in
the order that I have.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.390
Allan Adler is General
Counsel and Vice President

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.590
for Government Affairs
at the Association

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.490
of American Publishers.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.730
And then let's see,
Duncan is next.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.220
Duncan Crabtree-Ireland
is Chief Operating Officer

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.770
and General Counsel
for SAG-AFTRA.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.830
And then Mickey Osterreicher
serves as General Counsel

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.780
to the National Press
Photographers Association.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.320
And then we have Michael Wolfe,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.400
who is the Executive
Director of Authors Alliance.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.430
And then Professor Yu, who is
Professor of Law and Co-Director

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.470
of the Center for Law

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.940
and Intellectual
Property at Texas A&amp;M.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.170
And there's more information

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.010
about their backgrounds
in your full program.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.580
So to get started, as we've
talked about a little earlier,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.530
the U.S. approach is
generally described including

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.800
in our program, as a patchwork
or sort of a hodgepodge

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.390
of state and federal law.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.600
So to jump in if you could each
say a little about one or two

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.840
of these kind of patches.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.980
And I think Allan, we
can start with you.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.370
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Thank you.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.650
I was very relieved to
hear Eric at the very end

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.050
of the panel issue sort of
a half lawyer's disclaimer.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.080
I was rather surprised to
see five lawyers on a panel

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.330
and no opening disclaimer
about whether

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.190
or not they're expressing
views on behalf

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.350
of a client or an employer.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.040
So I will do so, and the
reason for that is chiefly

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.640
because when the House
Judiciary Committee's process

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.740
on comprehensive review

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.950
of copyright law considered
the issue of moral rights,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.170
they did so in a hearing

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.620
in which moral rights
was one subject combined

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.530
with copyright term
and termination rights,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.870
which I think led people to look
at that hearing in two ways.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.920
One of which it was kind of
a collective checkoff box

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.030
to make sure that even
relatively obscure issues as far

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.620
as the public was
concerned would be addressed

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.460
in the comprehensive
process of review.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.670
But also I think it was a signal

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.210
that these three issues
together are issues

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.230
that despite any other pretense
the committee might make during

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.480
the process, are highly
unlikely to see any kind

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.800
of reform legislation as a
result of the hearing process.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.270
And that is in part, because
I think the issue was largely

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.400
viewed as having been put
to rest during the period

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.230
that the previous panel
discussed in the late 1980s.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.160
For the publishing
community at the time,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.740
they had mustered a sufficient
amount of fire and brimstone

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.400
to help put that issue to
rest in terms of legislation.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.920
I'll give you just a quick
example of the kind of language

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.320
that was used at the time,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.460
testimony of the AAP
before the Senate said

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.990
that the hearing raises the
threshold policy question

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.410
of whether to superimpose
vague, subjective,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.710
and wholly unpredictable new
rights upon a longstanding,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.390
balanced, and successful
copyright system.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.970
Tell us what you
really think publishers.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.150
So I think that type of view of
the issue is one that led us,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.550
at least at the AAP, when the
hearing was held two years ago

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.270
by the House Judiciary
Committee to look at the issue

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.180
of moral rights and
actually to make the decision

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.190
that we were not going to submit
a statement for the record

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.970
because we didn't have anything
new to say about the issue.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.900
When I say nothing
new it's not to say

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.500
that we don't have anything
to say about the issue at all.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.460
In the 1980s we said a
great deal about the issue,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.240
particularly in terms
of concerns not only

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.930
that the United States
had bodies of law

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.070
which addressed the issues
of integrity and attribution

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.540
as they appear in 6bis, but
also because we have laws

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.300
that distinguish the
United States from the rest

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.540
of the world, primarily,
the First Amendment

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.300
in our Constitution, which
protects freedom of speech

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.750
from freedom of expression
generally.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.580
The Congress and the Supreme
Court had no difficulty

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.130
over the years reconciling
the First Amendment

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.900
with U.S. copyright law,
notwithstanding the fact

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.050
that some view the copyright law

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.590
as basically restricting what
people can do when they choose

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.860
to use a work of original
expression as a form of speech.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.420
But nevertheless, it has
played a very important role

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.500
in shaping the way U.S.
copyright law has in fact,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.140
been implemented, and it's
also an important bulwark

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.300
with respect to the
issue of moral rights.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.600
Because if you look in
this country at the issue

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.490
of defamation law,
defamation law is a creature

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.980
of both federal law
and state law.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.460
Primarily it's a
creature of state law

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.050
but the First Amendment
makes it also to some extent,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.270
a creature of federal
law as well.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.550
At least when we're talking
about public figures or even

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.840
about private figures but
we're dealing with issues

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.000
of public concern and
public importance.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.910
So in the area of U.S. laws
that were supposed to chime in

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.710
and count for representing
the principles of 6bis

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.010
on moral rights, one looked
at the issue of integrity

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.640
and noticed that they talk
about the ability to object

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.560
to any distortion, mutilation,
or other modification of,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.190
or other derogatory action
in relation to the said work

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.470
which would be prejudicial

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.810
to the author's honor
or reputation.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.260
The interesting thing
about that in terms

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.780
of the way U.S. defamation law
works is the defamation law is

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.440
probably both broader and
narrower in a number of senses.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.480
For one thing, the interesting
thing about the 6bis language is

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.430
that when we're talking
about derogatory action

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.960
that would be prejudicial to the
author's honor or reputation,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.000
we're talking about
derogatory action

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.680
in relation to the
specific work.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.130
We're not talking just
about general statements

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.530
that would be viewed as
derogatory or defamatory

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.340
to the reputation of the author.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.680
It has to be something
that relates to the work

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.440
that then casts the author
in what would be viewed

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.650
as a disreputable light.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.700
That of course is not
at all true with respect

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.460
to defamatory law in
the United States.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.960
The way the law has grown
both as a matter of common law

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.330
and in terms of state statutory
law, it's a civil wrong.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.440
It's a tort.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.280
It can be either written
in the form of libel

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.620
or it can be spoken, which
would make it slander.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.630
It could even be expressed other

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.790
than by writing or
by oral comment.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.400
It must be published
in the sense

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.220
that a third party must
have seen, heard, or read

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.850
and understood it to be about
the subject and to be damaging

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.710
to the subject's reputation.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.230
If you read the language of
6bis, it is not at all clear

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.580
that this can't be a direct
discussion between a reviewer

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.450
for example and the
author of a work

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.540
in which the author concludes
that the reviewer's comments are

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:05.270
in fact, derogatory in the sense
that is contemplated under 6bis.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.920
But most importantly
in defamation law

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.670
in the United States,
the issue of the falsity

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.860
of the facts asserted
with respect

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.530
to the subject individual
who believes that his

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.500
or her reputation has been
harmed is an absolutely

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.920
critical matter.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.810
Even to the extent that the
First Amendment provides some

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:31.250
breathing room for people to
engage in commentary and speech

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.920
that might be viewed
as the subject

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.790
of that commentary
speech is derogatory

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.480
to their reputation and honor.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.480
Unless they can point to the
falsity of what was said,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.140
they really don't have any
kind of action with respect

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.980
to slander or libel
under U.S. law.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.250
Whereas the notion, I think of
comparative notion to defamation

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.930
in 6bis doesn't address
the question

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.580
of whether what is said contains
an element of falsehood.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.620
And as we know, we
see a number of areas

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.520
where people will engage
in what has been referred

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.480
to as libel tourism to
avoid bringing libel actions

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.790
that really belong in the United
States courts based upon the

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.600
subject matter, based upon
the vehicle that was used

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.270
to make the statements an issue.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.710
But people tend to
travel to other countries,

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.500
particularly the U.K. to
file libel actions there

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.360
because of the differences
in the coverage of defamation

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.880
and what has to be proven in
order to be able to make a case.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.530
In most areas of the United
States it's also important

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.250
that a defamatory statement be
one that isn't unprivileged.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.490
In other words, if you
are in the situation

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.820
where you are a witness
in a trial proceeding,

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.670
whether it's civil or criminal,
your testimony is privileged

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.040
with respect to any character
of it that might be viewed

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.270
as defamatory because
it is part of a process

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.480
in which what you say
is being considered more

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.110
for its relationship to the
particular cause of action

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.640
or the particular charge
defense than it has to do

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.140
with the character of
the particular individual

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.070
that the matter dealt with.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.160
So that's another
important element.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.100
And of course as I
mentioned earlier,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.850
there is this distinction
made in U.S. law

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.250
between how the law
treats a public figure

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.810
and treats a private figure.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.310
And generally speaking
as we know

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.170
under the Sullivan
doctrine, when we're talking

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.050
about a public figure,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.080
an individual who's an elected
official or somebody else

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.970
who has entered into the
public spotlight as far

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.760
as society is concerned,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.550
generally speaking they have
a heavier burden of proof

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.180
with respect to an action for
defamation, whether it's libel

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.290
or slander, in having to
demonstrate actual malice.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.040
Which is not only that the
statements involved were false,

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.080
but that the speaker either knew
they were false or spoke them

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.880
in reckless disregard
for whether

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.980
or not they were true or false.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.570
And none of this is reflected
in the language of 6bis

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.750
with respect to the idea of
harm to reputation or honor.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.320
And most importantly, perhaps,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.670
in the United States generally
speaking, with respect

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.210
to defamation, an action

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.940
for defamation does not
survive the death of the subject

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.010
of that alleged defamation.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.630
So you had a very famous
case a number of years ago

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.820
where the children of the noted
actor Errol Flynn attempted

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.960
to sue for defamation of Flynn's
character based upon a book

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.820
that was written, an
unauthorized biography of Flynn

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.440
that alleged that he
was a Nazi sympathizer.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.210
And of course the
court basically said

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.130
that those actions
had they been brought

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.810
by Mr. Flynn during his life,
might have had some validity

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.100
but they had no validity as
far as being brought by those

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.200
who were his heirs
or even his estate.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.950
So that's a fairly
substantial way

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.050
in which even though the
notion of defamation law

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.550
in the United States as
it exists serves as a kind

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:18.060
of an analog to the
integrity rights

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.540
that are protected under 6bis.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.140
They're really quite
different in practice.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.090
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz:
Thank you Allan.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.300
Duncan, Allan's covered kind
of one way that the right

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.360
of integrity and the author's
reputation can be protected.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.340
Could you tell us a little bit

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.180
about how publicity rights
also work in this area?

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.370
&gt;&gt; Duncan Crabtree-Ireland:
Sure that would be great

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.950
and I'll probably mention
the Berne Convention less

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.660
than anyone in the entire day.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.400
If you're thinking "Well I
wonder why that would be?"

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.710
In case you don't know,
SAG-AFTRA is the union

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:52.090
that covers performers, actors,
broadcasters, recording artists,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.640
and so as I think was mentioned
during the esteemed academic

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.840
panel before us, largely those
individuals have been left

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.480
out of the Berne Convention,
but thankfully, there's the WPPT

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.940
for our recording artist and
there is the Beijing Treaty.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.000
Hopefully someday
they enter into force

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.200
for our audio visual performers,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.120
and so you won't hear a lengthy
discussion of Berne from me,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.070
but I would like to just talk
for a minute about the right

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:25.850
of publicity and its importance,
particularly to performers

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.750
since that's the
perspective that I come from,

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.910
spending almost 24 hours
a day, seven days a week,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.420
365 days a year around them.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:39.520
I think for most performers,
you know, we've had a,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.430
I think for me, a very
fascinating academic discussion

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.770
so far about how the various
elements of moral rights,

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.550
the patchwork quilt work.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.590
For most performers, I think
they're more interested

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.910
in a functional approach
to these rights,

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.700
because what they're interested
in is really two things

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.570
as has been stated by
several other people.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.960
Number one, the question

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.530
of how they can protect
their non-economic rights,

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.880
whatever those rights
may be and number two,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.480
how they protect
their economic rights.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.790
And I would say not
necessarily in that order.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.510
Depending on the performer,

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.530
the reality of course
is making a living

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.640
as a performer is often the
number one consideration

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.910
for most performers.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.070
It's a very difficult
career to pursue.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:31.740
It is a lifestyle for most
performers where fighting

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.000
for the very, you
know, basic elements

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.570
of life can be a real challenge,
and so as representatives

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.250
of performers for those who
have not achieved a high degree

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.840
of career success,
basic elements

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.040
and typically compensation are
the number one consideration.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.680
And so the right for
publicity as part

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.630
of a broader moral rights
patchwork is really important

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.100
and is in fact is utilized.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.530
For those who might not
be paying attention to it,

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.280
there have been a number
of high profile cases,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.360
litigations that have
been initiated seeking

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.880
to enforce rights under
the right of publicity.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.820
And I guess I should just
say you know, what it is

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.880
or what form it takes at
least here in the U.S.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.040
From some people's perspective,

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.060
regrettably it's not
really a federalized right.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.230
This is a right that is a sort
of common law right that you see

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.230
in a number of states.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.630
Last count I think around
28 or states have some form

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.180
of either common law
or statutory right

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.130
of publicity embodied, you
know, there's a few states known

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:45.040
as being very receptive to
right of publicity statutes

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.670
that have really built a strong
framework for individuals

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:55.320
and performers, in particular,
in my perspective, New York,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.040
California, Indiana jump
to mind as a few of those.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.520
But I do think that it is
more than an academic case.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.830
There have been a number of
cases in the Ninth Circuit

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.240
for example, and in other
circuits in the U.S.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.950
where various types of
performers have sought

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.870
to pursue economic compensation
for violations for the rights

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.190
of publicity ranging from
commercial advertising types

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.090
of cases to cases involving
particularly video games

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.780
in recent years.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:31.160
There is, I think, sort of a
brand integrity element of this,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.470
particularly that you see in
these cases that have made it

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.580
into the appellate process
where we've got compensation

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.930
on one hand where we're got a
desire to really use the right

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:46.480
of publicity to protect the
types of uses that are made

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.310
of image and likeness
of individuals.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:54.280
And that's something that
otherwise really you have

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.680
to rely on a contractual
framework to protect outside

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.230
of that and maybe the Lanham Act

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.200
which thankfully
I'm not responsible

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.350
for talking about today.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.990
And so I think from a
performer's perspective,

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.320
that is a really
important option.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.600
We did see recently I mean,

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.660
I think a very interesting
litigation attempting

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:21.000
to pursue this type
of brand integrity

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.300
or personal rights protection
through a copyright angle

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.380
which of course is the
Google Garcia case and,

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.210
you know prompted, I think,
some very interesting writings

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.320
in the Ninth Circuit
level in particular.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.270
So for those who haven't checked
out Judge Kozinski's opinion

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.830
in that case and the
subsequent en banc result,

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.550
you should probably do that.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.190
But I think that, you know, from
my perspective, that's the type

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.320
of case that really never
should have been brought

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.460
in the first place,
because a better,

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.010
a lot of us were mystified
as to why the plaintiff

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.260
in that case didn't pursue a
right of publicity approach

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.830
to that issue rather than
the copyright approach

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.380
that was pursued.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.440
And so from a practical point of
view, again a functional point

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.760
of view, that's something
that we always try to discuss

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.990
with our members and
our performers which is

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.900
to really make sure that
they have an understanding

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.710
because it is a patchwork, of
the various options for seeking

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.510
to vindicate your rights and
making sure that when you do

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.600
that you don't create
unfortunate

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.000
or counterproductive
precedence or, you know,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.820
cause harm to an otherwise
precariously balanced system.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.930
I think I couldn't wrap up
without talking for a minute

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.170
about the Beijing Treaty.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:45.230
It's something that's very close
to the hearts of our members,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.200
particularly our actor
performer members,

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.920
obviously our recording artists
members have enjoyed similar

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.980
protections under the
WPPT for some time.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.070
And actually when you look at
the range of our membership,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.330
they speak out very strongly
in favor of the Beijing Treaty,

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.000
both from with the knowledge
of the specifics of the treaty

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.360
which obviously is complex and
takes some time to understand,

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.830
but also from a more fundamental
place which is the really

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.710
in some ways shocking lack
of international recognition

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.090
of performer's rights
in the audiovisual space

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:26.980
for such a long time
and the joy, frankly,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.920
that our performers have setting
aside the details as the concept

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.260
of being recognized in the way
that they haven't been so far

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.970
and even our recording artist
members have stepped up to speak

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.460
out and say it's not fair
that our actor brothers

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.310
and sisters are not protected
in the same way that we

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.480
as recording artists are
at the international level.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.520
And so that's something
that's really important to us,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.590
of course, the implementation;
someone mentioned earlier

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.510
that the president had sent
the treaty to the Senate

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.410
for ratification and, of course,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.910
the implementation package
has also been made public

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:03.610
and there are definitely some
interesting issues that really,

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.960
I think you know, relate

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.780
to primarily the
anti-bootlegging area

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.200
which is the focus

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.570
of the implementation
package that's going

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.490
to cause some interesting
debates.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.400
And I think there is some
disagreement about the necessity

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.920
of the scope of the
changes that are proposed

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.830
in the implementation package,
but ultimately, it is our hope

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.180
and desire that moral rights

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.310
for all you visual
performers get enshrined

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.800
in international law in
way that's meaningful both

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.730
on a detailed and functional
level, but also from sort

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.820
of the philosophical and
principle level to ensure

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.290
that we would then finally
have a broad range of rights

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.910
for all types of performers;
moral rights and economic rights

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.040
at the international level.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.760
So I'll think I'll stop there.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.320
Thanks.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.230
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz: Thank you.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.880
And you mentioned your relief
not discussing the Lanham Act.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.890
And Eric very helpfully

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.050
on the last panel
summarized Dastar for us.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:05.810
So Professor Yu, if I could
ask you to kind of pickup

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:10.210
that heavy load and tell
us a bit about Lanham Act

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.440
and using statutes like that
that are not copyright law

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.980
to help protect something
like moral rights.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.400
&gt;&gt; Peter K. Yu: So in terms
of unfair competition law,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.320
we should start over Section
43(a) of the Lanham Act,

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.900
and so Eric earlier
mentioned at the Dastar case

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.680
and I suspect Professor Ginsburg
will also talk a little bit

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.940
about that as well.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.170
And so for Section 43(a) we do,

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.450
it offers two different
types of protection.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.600
The first one is it protects
against false designation

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.760
of origin, so basically
the false designation

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.420
that would cause confusion
over origins, sponsorship,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.400
or association of the good.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.790
And the second thing is about
misrepresentation of the nature,

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.470
characteristics, qualities,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.770
or geographical origin
of the goods.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.040
So from a standpoint
of more rights,

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.210
the provision would prevent
you from providing your name

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.020
to some other works that's
not being created by you

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.000
or misrepresenting the
nature of the work.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.510
So, a good example would
be the Gilliam case,

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.580
which in the classroom
you should refer

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:17.650
to as the Monty Python case,
where ABC took out 24 minutes

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.820
of 90 minutes programming
and showed it and claimed

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.510
that it's basically
by Monty Python,

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.380
so when Monty Python saw
that, it was appalled

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.120
by the disjointive format of the
programming that has been shown

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.870
on TV and tried to pursue and
action based on both copyright,

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.530
as well as, Section 43(a).

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:43.350
And so with respect to 43(a)
claim, that's basically

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.350
when you're showing the older
version without authorization

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.360
and claiming that it is ours,

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.140
than you're not really
presenting a product,

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.990
but misrepresenting
what they have.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.510
And so that's a very good
example, but I think a lot

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.430
of the audience members
are very concerned

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.260
about the Supreme
Court case of Dastar.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:08.780
In that case, the
issue is basically

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.740
about the TV series that's
been put together by FOX

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.950
and that has gone
out of copyright

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.540
and that's not been renewed

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.940
and when they saw put together
videos have a condensed version

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.620
they slapped the opening
credits, they changed the,

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.400
I think, the toward the
end with the recapitulation

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.630
and re-order it a
little bit and show it

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.110
in a more condensed version but
just include Dastar right there

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.680
without mentioning FOX.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.970
So the, when case
went all the way

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.500
to the Supreme Court the issue
is whether they would be able

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.650
to pursue a Section 43(a) claim
based on misrepresentation,

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.680
and as Eric mentioned early
on, what it could look

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.810
at is basically the origin
of the good is the origin

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.340
of the video that which
is the manufacturer

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.660
of the physical goods and
that's why they're not focusing

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.580
on the origin of the
footage or origin

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.780
of the intellectual material

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.810
that has been captured
within the videotape.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.510
And I think there are
two different readings,

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.780
and I think a lot
of the commentators,

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.750
a lot of the lawyers
have been debating

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.510
as to how broad you're
going to read this,

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.570
or how narrow you're
going to read it.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.600
I think the broad
reading is that we focus

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.110
on the physical goods
and you will not be able

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.420
to claim any false
designation of origin based

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.040
on the content inside
the physical good, right.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.800
So that would be a very broad
reading of the Dastar case,

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.340
but I'm more in line
with the camp

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.310
that has a more narrow reading
and a more narrow reading is

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.920
that if you look
at the case it's

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.250
about public domain
material that's already gone

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.260
into the public that's
not protected anymore

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.840
and if you want to go even
deeper you can see that a lot

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.970
of the footage is actually
from the allied forces

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.240
and so it's not even
from FOX, right.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.260
So you have a lot of
different ingredients

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.100
that will actually lead
the court to say that,

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:02.070
"Well if you look at the
origin, than, there is no need

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.150
to actually credit
faults especially

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.820
when it has gone in
a public domain."

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.630
So that's one way to look at it.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.460
And then I also know a number

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.980
of commentators have actually
separated non-attribution

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.480
from misattribution.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.850
So non-attribution is basically
you did not include the name

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.000
to the footage, in the case,
footage that's already gone

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.180
in a public domain

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.540
and misattribution
is basically similar

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.140
to the Gilliam case were you
actually put somebody else's

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.370
name or you alter the state of
the footage and then you claim

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.920
that it's the original.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.640
And in the Dastar case
I think it goes closer

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.450
to non-attribution but not
so much to misattribution,

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:46.950
so had the Gilliam case been put
forward before the Dastar court,

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.890
I guess the outcome may
be somewhat different

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:54.000
because of an altered state, but
I think the concern for a lot

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.310
of commentators is that after
the Dastar case there are also a

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.660
lot of lower courts
that are trying

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.490
to apply the very broad
reading of Dastar and showing

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.900
that there would be very limited
protection under Section 43(a)

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.050
in terms of the attribution
interest

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.310
within the intellectual work and
I think that has caused concern

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.970
for a lot of those
people who want

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:19.030
to have stronger moral
rights protection.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.290
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz: Thank you.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.380
Keeping on the attribution
track there,

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.700
earlier in the first panel
there was mention of some

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.220
of the newer WIPO Treaties

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.730
and of course those
include protection

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.070
for Rights Management
Information or RMI.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.520
So Mickey could you talk to
us a bit about RMI protection

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.160
as a way for protecting
moral rights?

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.650
&gt;&gt; Mickey Osterreicher: Sure.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.880
So with my press
background for those of you

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.130
who are not connected
to the Internet,

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.700
right across the
street I'll let you know

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.580
that the Supreme
Court denied cert

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.770
in the Google case,
the book case.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.860
So I think that's something
people will be talking

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:58.110
about today in our area, but
that breaking news aside,

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.060
earlier somebody talked

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.140
about how it really wouldn't
make any sense to publish a book

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.850
without somebody's name on it.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.800
And yet with hundreds
of millions

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:13.670
of images being uploaded almost
daily we are seeing all those

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:18.360
images for the most part
without somebody's name on it,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.720
and the Right Management
Information is critical

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.210
to at least visual
journalists and visual creators

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.430
in terms of doing that.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:34.560
So attribution, attribution
information under moral rights;

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.980
the problem under moral
rights they have is

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.450
that it's very narrow in terms

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.720
of it's got to be
for exhibition.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.650
It has to be numbered
no more than 200 works,

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.920
more than 200 copies made
and for the most part,

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.880
those visual images in terms
of photography will not fall

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.690
under those protections,
so what else can we do?

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.790
And then we have a number of,

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.760
now we get in to all the
acronyms, and again, standards.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.410
For Rights Management
Information,

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.020
there's a Copyright
Management Information,

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:18.260
CMI and that's codified under
Section 1202 of the DMCA,

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.950
and we can talk about that.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.640
I'm not sure if you want
to talk about that now

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.580
or when you go to
the next question.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:31.490
Then, you know, then we have
IPTC and EXIF and then PLUS

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:36.480
and we don't really just yet
have a standardization in terms

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:44.100
of how we are going to allow the
people that create visual works

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.120
to have that attribution.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.040
Whether it's information
just about them and even

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.920
when there's information there
that will help people identify

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.420
who it is that created that work
often times that information

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.540
that is referred to often as
metadata is stripped out of

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.860
that of the visual works

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.540
and we have pretty much
almost instant orphan works

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.440
if you will, for an image

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.900
that could have been created
only moments ago when it goes

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.020
up on the Internet and
is seen around the world.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.110
Somebody may not know who it is

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.210
and often times these images are
being used without permission

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.560
or credit or compensation, and
that really is a huge problem.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.130
You were talking about
performing artists in terms

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.050
of visual artists trying to have

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:42.960
and earn a living doing what
they do in this brave new world

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.750
of so many millions of
images being out there,

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:52.150
that's a dilemma that we
are truly-truly faced with.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:58.990
So, you know, under DMCA
they're certainly a number

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.900
of really better protections
as far as we're concerned;

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.430
the real question is going
to be then enforcement

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:12.490
and that's seems to be a big
challenge for everybody in terms

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.060
of what they're dealing
with, setting the standards

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.030
and then enforcing them.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.630
So, I think maybe as we get

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.860
into some more questions
I'll get into more specifics.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.930
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz:
Okay, thank you.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.690
And you mentioned a little
bit there how dealing

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.710
with photographers is different
than other types of visual arts

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.200
and we've talked a
little bit about VARA

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.700
in the first panel as well.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.220
Professor Yu, was there anything
you would like to add on VARA

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.870
that you feel we haven't covered

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.290
in any either of
the panels so far?

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.310
&gt;&gt; Peter K. Yu: So, we
touch on VARA a little bit.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.060
I think this is actually a topic

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.690
where most people
are quite familiar.

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:51.260
So the Visual Artists
Rights Act which was adopted

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.970
in 1990 covered three
different types of rights.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.870
One is the attribution right,

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:58.320
the second one is
the integrity right,

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.450
and then the third one
is basically the right

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.250
against destruction of
works of recognized stature.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.520
And so when you look
at the comparison,

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.420
I think Daniel Gervais talk
about VARA in the context

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.190
of the Berne Convention,
you can see

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:16.580
that we actually offer more
protection in terms of the right

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.050
of -- against destruction of
works of recognized statute

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.390
and I think that type of right,
you can discribe that as closer

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.330
to right of destruction
or right of integrity,

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.890
but you can also make a
good comparison to a lot

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.940
of our state preservation laws.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.110
So in California, in New
York, in a lot of places.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.120
And so that's more like a hybrid
if I have to describe that,

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.310
our public court as more rights
with U.S. characteristics.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:45.820
And with respect to the Berne
Convention I think the main

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.240
concern for a lot of people is
basically we are narrowing the

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.470
scope of the protection, so
the protection is only limited

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.440
to a very limited
category of works

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.320
so that would be paintings,
sculpture, prints and drawings.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.300
And so even within
those categories,

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.370
they would have more conditions
attached to what you have,

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.060
so a good example
would be photographs.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.750
As we just heard earlier on, we
will have limits to the number

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.000
of copies, so a single copy or
200 or fewer copies and then

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.350
after that you also have
to have at least signed

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:25.610
or consecutively numbered
by the author and then

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:29.200
at the very end you also have
the purpose, it has to be

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.030
for exhibition purposes only.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.530
And so there is actually
case law talking

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:37.470
about what would actually cover
within that particular phrase,

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:41.950
so you can see that it has been
very narrow and I think in terms

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.760
of protection, that's also
more narrow than what we have

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.630
in the Berne Convention.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.590
In the Berne Convention
is usually life

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.270
of the author plus 50
years as the standard,

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.920
and in the U.S. we have life
of 70, but when you look

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.410
at the Visual Artists Rights
Act, it's basically life

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.390
of the author and that's
basically it stop right there

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:02.890
and so it's not really
implausible to the duration

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.430
of copyright, but it's
actually shorter than that.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.560
And so I think with respect to
the Visual Artists Rights Act,

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.990
what's interesting is that we
try to come up with something

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.850
that is quite unique for us
and that's also acceptable

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:18.640
at that time, but at the same
time, it doesn't fit very well

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.080
in terms of both the Berne
Convention, as well as,

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.840
the scope of protection we
get in both the attribution,

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.410
as well as, right of integrity.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.290
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz: Thank you.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.800
At the end of the last
panel, Miss Devorah mentioned

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.880
that in her opinion most
of this should be covered

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.280
by contract law.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.660
Allan could you tell
us briefly a little bit

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.980
about how contract law can play
into this and then we'll turn

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.630
to Mike and hear about some
specific types of contracts.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.790
&gt;&gt; Allan Alder: Yeah, the notion
of contract law was also one

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.520
of the reasons why
publishers generally objected

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.210
to the imposition of a
layer of moral rights on top

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.000
of the existing economic rights
and property rights framework

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.300
of U.S. copyright law.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.100
In part because they felt

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:05.870
that contracts gave the parties
both great degree of flexibility

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.220
in terms of how to develop and
conduct their own relationship

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.100
with respect to the publication
of work, but at the same time,

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.790
it addition to that flexibility,
once a contract was in place

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.620
and had been fully negotiated,
it also added a great deal

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.820
of certainty and
predictability about the way

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.020
in which the relationship
would continue and the work

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.590
at the center of that
relationship would be

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:30.460
dealt with.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.080
There is, of course,
as has been said,

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.620
there's not attribution right in
U.S. copyright law specifically

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.890
but that's an issue
that is typically dealt

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:42.780
with under contract.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.090
Many works in the United
States are published either

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.900
pseudonymously or anonymously
and that's generally dealt

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.130
with between the
author and the publisher

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.130
as a matter of contract.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:58.230
And the courts, of course,
generally tend not to try

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.790
to read between the lines

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.300
of a contract unless it's
absolutely necessary to do so.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.400
So it's the express language of
what's within the four corners

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.520
of the contract that ultimately
shape the relationship

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.060
of the publisher and
the author with respect

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.890
to a particular work and how
copyright law is implemented

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.800
with respect to that
specific work

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.190
in the context of
that relationship.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.230
One of the curious things
that we see though is is

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.380
that sometimes I think
that there is a situation

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.530
where the notion of a contract

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:35.570
or at least the way licenses are
used today, can put the issue

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:39.330
of attribution and integrity
in opposition to each other.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:44.660
I'll give you one example;
there is a pending rule-making

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:49.040
at the Department of Education
called the Open Licensing Rule

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.770
in which the Department
of Education is trying

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:58.310
to encourage the creation of
open education or resources

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:01.250
through its direct
competitive grant program.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.050
And as a result,
what it wants to do

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.360
with the rule is
impose the obligation

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.210
on any grant recipient
that any copyrightable work

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.560
that they produce
with grant funds

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.360
from the Department would have
to be available publically

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.600
as open educational
resources basically subject

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.070
to the equivalent of a
Creative Commons attribution

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.760
only license.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.320
The problem with that is that
because they essentially say

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.780
to the individual that if
you receive federal funds

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:35.200
to create a work, that work,
not only is going to be subject

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.970
to various kinds of adaptation
and repurposing and alteration

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:45.340
by other parties down the line,
but at each instance they say,

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.000
because they determine when
they developed Creative Commons

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.820
licenses that most people did at
least want to have attribution

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.550
as a requirement
of the transaction.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:59.860
They require that at each stage
of that process attribution

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.950
to the original author be
made and what that means is

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.690
that you're going to have a
circumstance where as a result

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.370
of that kind of license
agreement, that as a result

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.820
of receiving federal funding
and the contract terms

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.280
for that funding, you're
going to have this situation

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.880
where an individual author
continues to be credited

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.870
as the author of a work after it
has been substantially altered,

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.070
repurposed, adapted in ways

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.500
that that author might
find absolutely appalling

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.960
and completely at odds
with their original purpose

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.300
in publishing that
particular work.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.940
So contracts can
do a lot of things.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.490
They provide flexibility.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:38.990
They provide certainty.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:42.810
They allow the parties basically
to decide their own fates

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.960
within a particular transaction.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.850
Now we have heard
on occasion that one

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:51.070
of the reasons why moral rights
needs to cut into that kind

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:53.790
of flexibility and
freedom of contracting is

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.710
because frequently the
bargaining positions

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:00.080
of the parties, and in my field
it would be the bargaining

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.540
position between an author
and a publisher, are unequal.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.990
Well, they can be unequal but in
two very different directions.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.770
A very well-known author
with a very long track record

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:13.420
of success in publication
typically will have more

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.060
leverage than the publisher will

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.540
in determining the transactional
terms of the next publication

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.840
if that publisher wants
to become the publisher

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.420
of the author's next work.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.990
Obviously the situation is
reversed when you're dealing

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:29.040
with an author, either a
first time author or an author

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.840
who has developed a
little public reputation

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.390
and little record of
success in publications

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:39.170
with previous authors
or previous publishers.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:45.610
So, you find the situation
where contracting is something

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.790
that is more conducive
to the U.S. system.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.500
It seems to be something that
in civic code countries has

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.510
to be cabined within the terms
of civil law and that was one

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:59.990
of the reasons why
publishers continued to feel

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.430
that a moral rights
regime with that kind

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.380
of European flavor would
basically be detrimental

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.620
to the way copyright had served
the interests of this country.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.410
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz: So Mike,

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.190
Allan mentioned Creative Commons
licenses and they're something

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.680
that has sometimes been
talked about by scholars

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.430
as potentially being
Americas' moral rights.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.060
Could you share some of your
thoughts on that and then also

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.550
on the role of extralegal
norms in the area?

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Wolfe: Absolutely.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:32.940
So Creative Commons licenses,
which I'm sure many or all

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.790
of you are familiar
with are a suite

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:40.890
of public licenses designed to
allow the widespread sharing,

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:46.360
in some cases reusing and
remix, of creative work.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.990
And as Allan just recently
mentioned, one of the

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.940
or the essential condition
of Creative Commons license

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.300
in in fact an attribution
requirement.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:01.780
So every license takes the form
of usually a hyphenated string

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.180
of two character abbreviations.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.350
A CC BY would be the
CC attribution license

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:12.350
and that can be amended
by selecting from a menu

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:15.120
of options, any of a number
of different requirements.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:21.410
The licensor can elect to not
to disallow derivative works

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.660
or to require that
further, that creators

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.560
of derivative works share
them under the terms

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.110
of the same license,
share a like license.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:35.810
Or that require that any use
of the work be noncommercial

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.080
or down streaming is the
working on commercial.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.690
And I would, just to back up,
and respond a little bit to one

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:48.520
of Allan's comments about open
education resources and the use

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.410
of a bare CC BY license
and its impact

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:53.200
on specifically the
right of integrity.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.840
There, it is important to note
that if it is a CC license

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.850
that CC licenses also provide
some measure for a right

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:05.620
of disassociation and it does,
it would be a flip, a little bit

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:12.220
of a flip of a default but where
work is modified in such a way

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.920
that the author no longer feels
comfortable having their name

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.460
associated with the CC license
standard terms do require

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:26.230
that a downstream user remove
the name of the original author

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.810
where reasonably practicable

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:31.740
So these are an interesting
solution.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.680
I wouldn't call them an
American solution entirely.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.350
They are American in origin.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.490
Creative Commons was
originated in the United States,

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:42.210
but it is a global licensing
scheme and it's designed

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:47.430
to be global and
portable to that

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.970
and the CC licenses
provide for more rights.

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.880
And in fact, while they, the,

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.390
all of the licenses
have a provision

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:58.870
that waive moral rights but
only to the extent necessary

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:02.380
to reasonably effectuate
the license and only

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.040
where actually waivable
in the jurisdiction.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:11.190
There's an interesting
question of how and whether

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:18.530
in Attribution, BY, license
is equivalent to a moral right

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:21.720
of attribution overseas.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:27.550
It seems to me that not only
is the attribution right an

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:32.550
effective tool for providing the
recognition that many authors

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:37.100
who use Creative Commons
licenses specifically are

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:41.130
seeking to garner
through their work,

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:45.340
that the CC licenses also tackle
some of the more fiddly aspects

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.990
of what it means to have
an attribution regime

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.320
in an online environment.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.490
And this is a lot of what Mickey
was talking about with regards

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:56.530
to Right Management Information,
but merely having the name

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:59.640
of the author associated
with the work seems today

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.320
to be somewhat insufficient
for the purposes

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.510
of having the author
be properly credited.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:12.880
And to that end, CC
is also a scheme,

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:17.090
a digital recognition scheme
where there's a cascading amount

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.490
of copyright management
information pointing both

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:24.150
to the author, any attribution
party specified by the author,

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:28.550
the copyright notice, the
terms of the license itself

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.170
which are available on
a stand-alone website

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.250
that is easily linked
to and findable.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:38.210
A notice refers to the
disclaimer of warrantees

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:44.670
and a URI or a hyperlink
to the specified place

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.500
where the information
resides on the Internet.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.970
And given how easily Rights
Management Information can be

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:55.470
stripped, it isn't
necessarily a complete solution

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.870
to the realities of
online attribution,

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:59.920
but it takes the problem
seriously and does

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:05.210
so in a way that's readily
accessible to any user

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:09.240
of the Creative Commons suite.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.750
And there's also the
interesting effect of having,

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.940
of encouraging attribution
beyond the scope of copyrights.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.300
So even though the Creative
Commons licenses are not,

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.730
do not report to be,
broader than copyright,

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.580
they allow for the
varous exception

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.530
and any other any other
exception or limitation

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:31.570
that the Copyright Act provides.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:38.100
They still nonetheless,
encourage by taking advantage

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.370
of most individuals
risk eversion compliance

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:42.440
with their terms.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.640
So, in the instance
of over compliance,

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.790
CC licenses in some way suggest
and recommend attribution even

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:56.040
where perhaps not absolutely
required by copyright law

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.420
or by the license itself.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.140
Moving on, I'm actually
going to segue directly

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:07.050
into a topic that's not
entirely directly related,

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:11.230
and that's how extralegal
norms stand in place

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.140
of moral rights in
the United States.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.350
So, there is, as the
panel has discussed,

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:21.240
a significant patchwork of
rights that to some extent,

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.410
if not completely,
provides something akin

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:27.830
to moral rights protection
to American authors

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:31.230
and authors in the
United States.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:36.290
But the reality on the ground
is substantially lighter,

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:40.530
or just based off norms and
practices within communities

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.780
and particularly around
the norms of plagiarism

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.780
which is what I'm going
to focus on today.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:51.200
Plagiarism which comes from,
I think the Latin root is

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.370
from kidnapped or kidnapper,

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:58.740
is an extralegal norm
independently defined

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:05.230
in various communities of
practice that cautions against

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:12.880
and provides often extralegal
remedies for against the uses

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.460
of works that are in some way
fraudulent or unauthorized.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.360
And generally in the sense

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.610
of not including attribution
information that we take

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:27.800
to be an essential part of their
right, there isn't an identity

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.840
with infringement here.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.490
And if you think of the
way I've been trying

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:38.650
to consider the topic is
viewing the possible areas

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:43.400
of wrong doing as
almost as a Venn diagram

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:47.920
where infringement attribute,
a right of attribution

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.050
and plagiarism are all
mutually overlapping

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.070
and characterizing
the problem that way,

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:59.640
there is a significant portion
of the attribution right

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.530
that might cover what today in
the United States as plagiarism

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:06.110
or what might not be
plagiarism at all,

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:11.060
but is nonetheless not
copyright infringement either.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:19.400
So, plagiarism, I've
sidetracked myself a little bit,

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.740
and there are one of the virtues
of having an extralegal norm

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.960
as opposed to a formal
statutory right,

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.160
although I won't
draw any conclusions

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.110
as to whether this
affects the propriety

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:36.970
of having the statutory right,

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.370
is that within various
communities

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:42.160
of practice there can be and, in
fact, are different approaches

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.230
to the question of plagiarism.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:46.420
In the case of literary works,

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.620
academia has very strong
norms about plagiarism.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.570
Not all of which are
necessarily entirely consistent

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.880
with what we might think
of attribution for work.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.160
If a research assistant provides
significant contributions

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.270
to a paper, the fact that
their name does not appear

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.780
on the text will not generally
be considered plagiarism

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:07.910
or in violation of the norms

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:12.510
of plagiarism despite the
existence of the contributions.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:17.940
Meanwhile for student
works, there are the taking

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:22.310
of unattributed sources
is a serious infraction

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:27.130
that can result in
expulsion or any number

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.140
of academic disciplinary
measures happening

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.630
within the case of a school.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:34.530
Whereas in creative writing,

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:39.000
attribution while
considered a requirement,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.870
and there is a very strong norm

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.160
of plagiarism might not
be take the same way

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.880
as a formal academic approach to
credit, so rather than footnotes

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.330
or citations, you
might have something

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:54.370
like Jonathan Lethem's
excellent essay, "The Ecstasy

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.570
of Influence" which is
subtitled "a plagiarism"

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.170
and composed entirely of
plagiarized sentences.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.910
All of the sources of which
are credited in a sense

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:09.860
by the being listed at the
end, but not in line or by,

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.320
and not in quotation marks
with ellipses and the way

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.170
that lawyers are very
familiar with in way

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:20.040
that would meet the norms
of academic scholarship.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.890
And in film, even in the Dastar
case, that was acknowledged

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:29.090
by Justice Scalia to be
an effect of plagiarism

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:33.730
and for FOX's purported
remedy essentially

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:36.620
to be an action for plagiarism.

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:43.270
But it only, plagiarism only
extends in many cases as far

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:56.670
as norms allow and today we have
contracts will usually negate

00:49:56.670 --> 00:50:02.420
some of what we would consider
plagiarism or violation

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.530
of attribution right
in the sense

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:08.010
of a ghost writing
contract allowing

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:10.340
for only the reported
author's name

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.370
and the not the ghost
writer's name

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:16.200
and I've completely lost my
train of thought so I'm going

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.060
to wind it down there.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:18.530
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz: Thank you.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:19.240
Thank you gentlemen.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.690
I know there's a
lot more to cover.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:25.060
We have just a few minutes left
for questions from the audience.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.620
Where are my mic runners?

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:35.100
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male
Speaker: Great, thank you.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.970
I want to take exception
to a comment

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:42.180
that my friend Allan Alder made.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:47.470
I don't always disagree
with Allan, but Allan stated

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.620
and a good thing
I'm paraphrasing,

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.120
"Contracts give flexibility
and certainty

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.920
as to how work would
be dealt with."

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.410
Well, in my experience in
my previous life at ASMP,

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:03.820
it's a trade association,
over the years the one thing

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:08.670
that we could be certain
regarding most textbook

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:12.000
publishing licenses
and contracts was

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.100
that they were being exceeded.

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:17.700
There was no certainty
that the terms

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:21.320
of the contract was
being upheld.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:27.440
So, and I agree with you, the
leverage issue I'm not sure

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:32.040
that I think that tilts still
more in favor of the publisher

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.920
than the number, I guess,

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.400
authors that have significant
leverage over a publisher.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:45.020
I think it's significantly less
than the number that don't,

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.660
but as far as contracts
were concerned,

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.500
I don't think they gave
any particular certainty

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.810
as to what was happening
with the future of a work.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:57.930
&gt;&gt; Allan Alder: Well I guess,
let me try to clarify that Jim

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:02.160
because what I meant and I
think you've referend this,

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.630
is that the terms of the
contract creates certainty.

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:07.900
Now, whether or not
the terms are complied

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.840
with is another question and the
fact that you are able to point

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.510
out in a given situation that
the facts of implementation

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:20.790
of that contract don't match the
terms indicates that there is

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:24.030
at least the possibility and
the intention of certainty,

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:28.350
it simply isn't followed
through in terms of performance.

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.310
So I think that you
still have the notion

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.760
that contracts are useful

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.820
for providing certainly the
aspiration towards certainty

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.110
and predictability, but
you're still dealing

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:39.690
with the question
ultimately of whether

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.110
or not the performance will be
faithful to that aspiration.

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:50.090
&gt;&gt; Unidenfied Male Speaker:
Then we still we almost agree.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:50.970
&gt;&gt; Aurelia Schultz: Daniel.

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:54.130
&gt;&gt; Daniel Gervais: It's also
for Allan and also on contracts.

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:58.080
So you underscore the
almost sanctity of contract,

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.420
why it's so important, yet the
United States has something

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:05.340
that authors in other countries
envy which is the termination

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.260
of transfers which
seems to be a little bit

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:12.060
of government interference in
the contract and I understand

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:15.300
that some of the work around,
especially that some lawyers

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.870
in Nashville have
tried for termination

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.840
of transfers have not
all been tested in court,

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.870
but it's a pretty
strong unwaivable

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:27.900
on transferable right, is
that unemployment-American?

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.210
&gt;&gt; Allan Alder: I think

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:32.310
as you probably would agree
Daniel that's the exception

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:36.140
by far rather than proving
the general rule of the way

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:40.280
in which freedom of contract
is generally allowed to operate

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.820
within the copyright
system and more importantly,

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.610
drives the copyright
system increasingly

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:49.360
because of the increasingly
broad role that licensing

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.360
of the use of works plays.

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.530
We're seeing within the context

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:58.850
of the current copyright review
this, you know, battle playout

00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:01.690
between those who are
advocating the importance

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:05.680
of continued certainty in
definition with respect

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:09.470
to ownership of rights
with respect

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:12.880
to a particular work whereas
we're also seeing society

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:16.070
that is increasingly
content simply to have access

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:19.370
to use the work is not really
interested in ownership

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:23.980
because of the other attributes
that ownership usually has

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.110
which requires maintenance,
storage, care,

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:29.770
things of that nature,
upgrades, whatever.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:34.250
So I think that I wouldn't point
to the exceptional circumstances

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:38.790
as generally initiating the rule
which I think continues to be

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.540
that contract plays a
very important role.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.420
I mean, one point I would I
would also want to make here is

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:47.140
that when we talk about
the integrity with respect

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:51.970
to the issue of its match on the
U.S. copyright law with respect

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:55.640
to the right to control the
production of derivative works,

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.280
but there's always
going to be the question

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.490
of what actually is derivative.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:02.850
At the far end of the spectrum,
I suppose it's possible

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:05.910
that using the common
understanding of the word

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:10.490
"derivative", work can
steal completely the ideas

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:14.700
of a prior author's work but
not of course be actionable

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:15.750
as copyright infringement,

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.120
because it doesn't take
the original expression.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.780
So, you have to have a notion
of these legal concepts

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:26.410
that is susceptible
to clear definition.

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:28.580
It's always going to be
the case that we're going

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.540
to have ligation, because
as June mentioned we are a

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.330
particularly litigious society
and we'll always be trying

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:38.160
to game the fringes and
the edges of these rights.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:42.180
But today for example, we're
seeing discussion of whether

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:48.050
or not remixes and matchups are
vitiating a derivative right.

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:50.000
If that's true, I don't know

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.860
that anybody has related the
question of remixes and matchups

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:56.920
to moral rights at this point,
but it certainly seems to be

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.790
that that's another
avenue to be explored.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.570
&gt;&gt; Duncan Crabtree-Ireland:
Actually if before you go

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:02.760
onto the next question
just say --

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.830
I think one of the talks we
didn't discuss, but is thinking

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:08.060
about the importance
of contracts

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:12.300
with collaborative works
and how the, you know,

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:16.070
a lot of challenges would exist
in the absence of the prevalence

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:17.510
of contracts for
collaborative works

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:21.630
like in the audiovisual area
because how you would coordinate

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.250
and harmonize different
participants,

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.410
different moral rights
and other rights

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:32.220
without contract would be
quite a complicated scenario.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:36.620
&gt;&gt; Allan Alder: In fact, Eric's
history of in the late 1980s

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:38.520
at the time of Berne
implementation

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.970
and immediately thereafter
left out the fact

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:43.780
that in the hearings that
were held about moral rights,

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.670
the other main issue being
discussed was the impact

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:50.500
of moral rights on the work for
hire doctrine and particularly

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.470
because the Supreme Court had
just decided the Reid case,

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:56.070
and at the point there was a
real question as to whether

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:59.340
or not it was possible
to create a situation

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:04.020
in statutory copyright law that
would accommodate that notion

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:06.650
as the Europeans have it,
but still be consistent

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:13.140
with the way the Supreme
Court interpreted the work

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:16.580
for hire doctrine which
depended greatly upon the way

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:19.750
in which a written contract
essentially defined the

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:22.200
relationships of the party.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.640
&gt;&gt;Aurelia Schultz:
Thank you gentlemen.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.700
I'm afraid that's all the
time we have for this session.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.930
We have a short break
until 11:20

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:29.900
and then we'll have our
keynote, and for those

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.330
who are standing there
is room up in the front

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:34.100
and in the middle so
please do feel free

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:36.510
to fill in during the break.

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:39.000
[ Applause ]

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.630
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
