00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.520
The seventh issue has to do with scaling and

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.160
here I mean scaling in the sense of the industry scaling up.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.290
As the component entry grows and evolves, a raft of new questions arises.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.040
For example, accounting.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.210
How should component use be charged, particularly in

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.999
clients in which there are multiple components coming from different vendors.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.220
With respect to deployment and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.920
configuration, how are components packaged and how is configuration performed?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.260
There's lots of packaging technologies out there such as RPM,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.935
DMG, EPKG, Nix, and OSG.

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.130
What about disputes?

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.300
How do you deal with an unhappy customer if multiple components with

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.880
different vendors from different vendors are involved?

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.360
How about quality of service?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.030
How are quality of service guarantees satisfied when multiple inde-,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.390
independent components are used?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.950
And then there's fault containment and error handling.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.330
How do components detect and

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.760
contain faults when they are not in control, in overall control of execution?
