00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.180
In being and nothingness written in 1943 the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.100
identified a problem which he believed plagued modern life.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.960
Mauvaise Foi, literally "bad faith"

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.420
Bad faith occurs when we lie to ourselves in order to spare ourselves short term pain,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.280
but thereby suffer from long term psychological impoverishment.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.960
We force ourselves to believe something which we're not really convinced by, because it's easier.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.080
In particular, Sartre believe that what we constantly lie to ourselves about is that we don't have other options.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.480
We always do, but find it curiously more reassuring to say we don't. It lets us off the hook.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.060
Bad faith often happens around work.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.160
Sartre describes a waiter who tells himself he's just a waiter. It's his lot in life, his destiny.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160
He tells himself that he had no choice, that he has to keep on at it because he needs the money.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.920
But it's not true, insists Sartre, we are all free.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.540
There are scary, almost sickening moments of what Sartre calls Negative Ecstasy,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.140
which might come late at night, when we realize that we are in fact far more free than we ever say we are.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.380
That we could throw in the job, go and live in the woods, or reinvent ourselves.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.120
It can be harrowing, because we have to acknowledge that we may be wasting our lives and that in the end this is our own fault,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.640
however much at other times we are tempted to blame circumstances or other people.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.820
But we then typically suppress this insight. The next day we force ourselves to believe in what we're doing.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.340
The price is that we close off the opportunities for changing and improving our lives

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.240
We forget, Sartre Says, that 'Being precedes essence'

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.840
That is, who we are can't be pinned down to one particular job or relationship.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200
Our being is much bigger.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.240
It embraces in Sartre's words "all the things we are at present not, but could possibly become".

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.280
In bad faith we keep those possibilities out of our minds, we tell ourselves that the way we are at the moment is the only way we can be,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.100
so bad faith closes down on the options of freedom.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.660
Sartre detected bad faith as a feature of many unhappy relationships.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.180
He describes its origins in early dates when a couple secretly realise that they are not at all compatible,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.040
but then force themselves to believe that they can be happy together.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:41.280
In Sartre's example, a woman wants to be loved for her mind and can't bear to pay attention to her own dark suspicion that her partner is in fact more interested in her body.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.420
Meanwhile the man realises that the woman isn't interested in him sexually, but keeps telling himself that "really she must be".

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.200
They both lie to themselves and that's why they end up together and unhappy.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.280
Bad faith will lead them to throw the blame on each other saying it's the other's coldness or lack of sophistication that's the problem,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.500
when really it's their own doing.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.700
Sartre didn't see bad faith as a surprising or unusual problem. It's a natural outcome of how our minds work.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.800
He didn't want us to feel bad. He just wanted to remind us to be as free as we really are.
