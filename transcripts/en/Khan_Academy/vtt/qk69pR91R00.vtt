00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:02.164
- [Voiceover] Which of the ordered pairs

00:00:02.164 --> 00:00:04.567
is a solution of the following equation?

00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:09.693
Negative three x minus y is equal to six.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.323
What we have to remind ourselves

00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:12.647
is when we're give an ordered pair,

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:15.978
the first number is the x
coordinate and the second number

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:18.765
is the y coordinate, or the y value.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:20.262
So when they tell us the ordered pair,

00:00:20.262 --> 00:00:22.363
negative four comma four,

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:24.848
they're saying "hey look, if x is equal to

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:28.458
"negative four, and y is
equal to positive four,

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:31.372
"does that satisfy this equation?"

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:33.090
And what we can do, is
we can just try that out.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.991
So we have negative three
and everywhere we see an x,

00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.394
everywhere we see an x,

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:41.890
we can replace it with negative four.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.722
So it's negative three
times negative four,

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:48.333
minus, minus

00:00:53.224 --> 00:00:55.287
and everywhere we see a y,

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.945
we can replace it with positive four.

00:00:57.945 --> 00:00:59.988
We replace it with positive four.

00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:04.716
So negative three times x minus y,

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:08.123
which is four, needs to be equal to six.

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:09.783
Needs to be equal to six.

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:11.582
Now is this indeed the case?

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:13.579
Negative three times negative four

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.448
is positive 12.

00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:19.639
Positive 12 minus four,
positive 12 minus four

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:22.286
is equal to eight, it's not equal to six.

00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:25.466
Is not equal, is not equal to six.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.032
So this one does not work out.

00:01:28.032 --> 00:01:30.365
So let's see, negative three comma three.

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:32.467
We can do the same thing here.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.973
Let's see what happens when
x is equal to negative three

00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:40.135
and y is equal to positive three.

00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:43.611
So we substitute back in,
we get negative three.

00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:47.930
Negative three times x,
which now we're going to

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.728
try out x being equal to negative three.

00:01:50.728 --> 00:01:54.678
Minus y, minus y.

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:56.957
Y is positive three here.

00:01:56.957 --> 00:02:00.719
Minus y, gonna do that y color blue.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.143
Minus y now needs to be equal to,

00:02:04.143 --> 00:02:06.976
now needs to be equal, just like before

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.135
needs to be equal to six.

00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:11.736
So negative three times negative three.

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.814
That's going to be positive nine.

00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:17.552
Nine minus three is indeed equal to six.

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:21.075
Nine minus three is
indeed equal to six.

00:02:21.075 --> 00:02:22.575
Nine minus three is six.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.904
That is equal to six.

00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:25.425
This works out.

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:29.685
So negative three comma
three is an ordered pair

00:02:29.685 --> 00:02:33.174
that is a solution to this equation.
