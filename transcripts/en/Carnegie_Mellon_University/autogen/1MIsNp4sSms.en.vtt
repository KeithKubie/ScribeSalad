so in this paper we ask the following
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.370
so in this paper we ask the following
question when you invest in energy

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
question when you invest in energy
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.830

rebound effect occurs when we take

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:19.589
rebound effect occurs when we take
 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.579
rebound effect occurs when we take
action to reduce energy consumption but

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589
action to reduce energy consumption but
 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.919
action to reduce energy consumption but
we end up with less savings than what we

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929
we end up with less savings than what we
 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.639
we end up with less savings than what we
anticipate for example we can reduce

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649
anticipate for example we can reduce
 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.050

efficient light bulbs if we leave the
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.759

lights on for the same period of time

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769
lights on for the same period of time
 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.910
lights on for the same period of time
will indeed save 75% of the lighting

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
will indeed save 75% of the lighting
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.150
will indeed save 75% of the lighting
electricity consumption however since

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

become cheaper we may decide to leave

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
become cheaper we may decide to leave
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.119

the lights on for a longer period of
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.180
the lights on for a longer period of
time why not we're saving energy and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
time why not we're saving energy and
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.790
time why not we're saving energy and
money at the same time this will result

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
money at the same time this will result
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.180
money at the same time this will result
in having less savings from electricity

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
in having less savings from electricity
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.849
in having less savings from electricity
than what was anticipated this is called

than what was anticipated this is called
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.310
than what was anticipated this is called
a direct rebound effect and now what if

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
a direct rebound effect and now what if
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500
a direct rebound effect and now what if
we actually use the savings from that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
we actually use the savings from that
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.680

that we're not purchasing in the first
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490
that we're not purchasing in the first
place this may increase our carbon or

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
place this may increase our carbon or
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920
place this may increase our carbon or
energy footprint and so this is called

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
energy footprint and so this is called
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.650

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.960
why is looking at rebound effects
important well because if we do not

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
important well because if we do not
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.960
important well because if we do not
account for rebound effects we may be

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

this makes it challenging to determine

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
this makes it challenging to determine
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.170
this makes it challenging to determine
whether states are meeting their energy

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
whether states are meeting their energy
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.679
those goals accurately in this work we
seek to answer that same question so how

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689
seek to answer that same question so how
 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.750
seek to answer that same question so how
did we determine the indirect rebound

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
did we determine the indirect rebound
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.660
did we determine the indirect rebound

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.509
annual direct and indirect rebound
effects for each of the 50 states so the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519
effects for each of the 50 states so the
 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.640

first step in assessing the magnitude of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650
first step in assessing the magnitude of
 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.589
first step in assessing the magnitude of
those rebound effects is to establish a

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599
those rebound effects is to establish a
 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.259
those rebound effects is to establish a
baseline so our first step was to

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269
baseline so our first step was to
 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.050
baseline so our first step was to
compute the household carbon footprints

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
compute the household carbon footprints
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.780
compute the household carbon footprints
for each of the 50 states we found that

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790
for each of the 50 states we found that
 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.420
for each of the 50 states we found that
the carbon footprints for each of the 50

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430
the carbon footprints for each of the 50
 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.390
the carbon footprints for each of the 50
states differs quite substantially the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400
states differs quite substantially the
 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.610
states differs quite substantially the
figure highlights that the carbon

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620
figure highlights that the carbon
 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.530
figure highlights that the carbon

in Grid emissions factors and also on
 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.110
in Grid emissions factors and also on
household patterns of consumption we

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120

then simulated the rebound effects in

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
then simulated the rebound effects in
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.030
then simulated the rebound effects in
the figure you see the magnitude of the

efficiency in electricity the white bars
 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.399
efficiency in electricity the white bars
correspond to the potential savings from

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409
correspond to the potential savings from
 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.469
correspond to the potential savings from
that intervention the color bars

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479
that intervention the color bars
 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.199
that intervention the color bars
correspond to the rebound effects you'll

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209
correspond to the rebound effects you'll
 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.199
correspond to the rebound effects you'll
notice that the color bars are really

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209
notice that the color bars are really
 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.149
notice that the color bars are really
small in comparison to the white bars

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159
small in comparison to the white bars
 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.429
small in comparison to the white bars
overall we find that the rebound effects

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439
overall we find that the rebound effects
 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.460
overall we find that the rebound effects
