00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.620
Now that we understand what an operating system is, we can ask ourselves,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.320
what are some examples of actual operating systems?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.060
The examples of real systems out there differ based on the environment that

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.750
they target.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.470
For instance, certain operating systems target more of

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.200
the desktop environment o.r the server environment.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.480
Others target more of the embedded environment.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.790
Yet another set of operating systems target ultra high end

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.830
machines like mainframes.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.369
But we'll focus on these environments, the desktop and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.960
embedded in our discussions just because they're most common.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.460
And also with these examples we'll really focus on more recent, more

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.300
current really operating systems, as opposed to those that have been around or

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.820
that have evolved over the last 60 plus years of computer science.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.260
For desktop operating systems one of the very popular ones is Microsoft Windows.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.750
It is been a well-known operating system since the early 1980s.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.900
Next there's a family of operating systems that extended from

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.757
the operating system that originated at Bell Labs in the late 1960s, and

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:11.660
these are all referred to as UNIX-based operating systems.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.872
This involves the Mac OS X operating system for

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:21.164
Apple devices, and this extends the UNIX BSD kernel, and

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:26.357
BSD here is really Berkley System Distribution of Unix.

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:30.102
And Linux is another very popular UNIX like system, and

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:35.529
it is open sourced, and it comes bundled with many popular software libraries.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.640
There are in fact many different versions of Linux.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.682
Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:46.889
On the embedded side, we've recently seen bigger proliferation of different

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.706
operating systems, just because of the rising number of smartphones and

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:56.542
user devices, like tablet's, and now even smaller form factor devices.

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:59.310
First you're probably very familiar with Android.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.230
It's an embedded form of Linux that runs on many of these types of devices.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.360
And its versions come with funny names like Ice Cream Sandwich and KitKat.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.900
Next we have iOS and that's the, Apple proprietary operating system for

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.070
devices like iPhones and iPads.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.870
Then there is Symbian, and then there are other less population options.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.590
In each of these operating systems there are a number of unique choices in their

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.490
design and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.020
implementation, and in this class we will particularly focus on Linux.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.920
So the majority of more illustrative,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.220
more in-depth examples will be given based on the Linux operating system.
