00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.785
So let's try another quiz.

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:04.000
This one's going to be quite a bit trickier.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.814
Here the question is, "What does the 'sum' procedure do?"

00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:09.000
And here's the definition of 'sum,'

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so here we're defining the procedure of sum.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It takes two inputs, "a" and "b,"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and its body assigns to "a" the value of "a" plus "b."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So the choices are: Nothing;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that it takes two numbers as its inputs, and outputs the sum of the two numbers;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that it takes two strings as its inputs,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and outputs the concatenation of those two strings.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So the final choice is that it takes two numbers as its inputs,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and changes the value of the first input to be the sum of the two numbers.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.477
This is a quite tricky question.

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:43.000
I would encourage you to try some experiments in the Python interpreter

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to see if you can determine for sure what the sum procedure does.
