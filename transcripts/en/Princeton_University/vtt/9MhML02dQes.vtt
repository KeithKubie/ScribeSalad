Barbara White:
Several years ago, I found myself confronting
a number of health challenges at the same

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.380 position:70%
Barbara White:
time, and one of the results of that was that
I found myself becoming sometimes "allergic"

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.420 position:72%
Barbara White:
to music, which is a very strange experience
because it is my vocation and also my passion.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.240
[gong]

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.240 position:70%
Barbara White:
I ended up writing an article called, "In
Search of Silence," and later started writing

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.230 position:73%
Barbara White:
pieces of music that had quite a lot of silence
in them. Eventually, this led me to think

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.260 position:72%
Barbara White:
about a freshman seminar which would deal with
the elusiveness of quiet and then the things

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.940 position:83%
Barbara White:
that aren't so quiet, such as noise, sound and music.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.670 position:78%
Barbara White:
One of the things that's interesting and appealing
about the freshman seminar experience is that

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.649 position:64%
Barbara White:
it's a shared experience by a small group
who all have something in common. They're

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.610 position:92%
Barbara White:
all relatively new to Princeton. I expected that
the students would be less interested than I am in silence,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.979 position:72%
Barbara White:
but I found that a lot of them are craving it.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.250
[layers of sounds]

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.189 position:67%
Barbara White:
For the first creative project, Katie chose
to make recordings of a number of different

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.799 position:69%
Barbara White:
sounds and layer them on top of one another.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.860 position:75%
Katie Welsh:
I recorded myself walking through autumn leaves;
I recorded myself sneezing; I recorded myself

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.079
Katie Welsh:
talking, humming, playing piano.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.740
[layers of sounds]

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.740 position:70%
Katie Welsh:
So, I was inspired to do this project because
I made this observation during the class that

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.759 position:73%
Katie Welsh:
silence was something we could move towards.
It was something that was buried beneath layers

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.579
Katie Welsh:
and layers and layers of sound.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.719 position:70%
Katie Welsh:
It was meant to imitate the order in which
I kind of strip away sound when I move toward

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:58.619 position:75%
Katie Welsh:
silence in my routine. My first step, typically,
would be to go inside, take away the leaves

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.609 position:58%
Katie Welsh:
outside, take away the cars going by.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:08.030 position:84%
Barbara White:
It ends with sounds that are very quiet and
very compelling. One is sneezing and one is breathing.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.910
[sneeze]

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.030 position:92%
Katie Welsh:
This project conveyed the concept that silence is something
that we can't attain. We are living beings.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.530
Katie Welsh:
We are meant to create sound.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.000 position:67%
Barbara White:
It's exciting to me to see how thoughtful
the students are. It's also exciting to see

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.079 position:64%
Barbara White:
the creative spark emerging in the class.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.810
Joshua Taliaferro:
... and she loved a little boy.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.690 position:63%
Damir Golac:
Light a match and wait for it to go out.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.580 position:78%
Barbara White:
Damir chose to do what we might call a performance
or realization of a score by Yoko Ono in

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.440 position:66%
Barbara White:
which the performer is instructed to light
a match and wait until it goes out.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.580 position:63%
Damir Golac:
Light a match and wait for it to go out.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.299 position:70%
Barbara White:
One thing that's interesting about it is that
there's a lot of repetition that we might

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:55.069 position:80%
Barbara White:
find not to be so artistic, but if we look closely,
we see that there's a lot of variation between

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.890 position:75%
Barbara White:
each instantiation of the lighting of the match.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.379 position:72%
Barbara White:
Since the students aren't necessarily required
to have any artistic background, one of the

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.000 position:81%
Barbara White:
things we are doing is playing a bit with the notion
of what art might be and who might be an artist.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.260
[yelling]

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.250 position:72%
Barbara White:
It's also valuable to look at what's right
in front of us. There's this notion of looking

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.980 position:69%
Barbara White:
at things and making them special through
considering them to be art, but then there's

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.099 position:73%
Barbara White:
also the idea of accepting the grit of everyday
experience and making sure we pay attention

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.300
Barbara White:
as it races by.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:42.000
