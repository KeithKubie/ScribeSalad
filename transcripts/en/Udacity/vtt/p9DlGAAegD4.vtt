00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I studied computer science at Caltech, and then I worked at Microsoft.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Then I went to Google. At Google I worked on Desktop and Gmail.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I started Lively, and then after Google I started Sunfire, which is a coworking space.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Then I can fell in love with Minted. Minted is a startup.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We crowdsource graphic design and art from a community all over the world.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Then other people can customize and purchase that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I actually started programming BASIC when I was five, but I didn't actually know what I was doing

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
My parents bought this Radio Shack gaming device,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because it was cheaper than other devices, and then there was a BASIC emulator.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I would write programs. It came with a book of programs.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We actually did not buy a memory cartridge, so I would retype every program

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
every time I wanted to enter it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Then eventually I would start modifying it a little bit.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Some people start later but are very addicted and spend lots of time thinking about i

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or playing with programs.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then if you start later but spend more time it's the same.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000
As a woman, you understand the psychology of a very powerful consumer in the market,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but who is underrepresented in the people creating products,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which is a very powerful position.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
For example, at Minted our demographic is women,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and that means that we are serving this very under-served market

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that has a lot of spending power.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
More money is spent by female consumers than by male consumers.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We primarily look for people who are strong programmers,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so people who like to build consumer websites and preferably who have done that before

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
whether it's for other companies, for classroom projects, or for open source or personal project,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
people who have worked with object-oriented programming.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We happen to use Python, and then on the front end we use JavaScript and jQuery.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But anybody who has worked with either object-oriented programming

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or who has built consumer websites would be great.
