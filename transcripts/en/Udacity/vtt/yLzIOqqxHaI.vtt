00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.030
Well, we don't have enough information to figure this out. If you drive a lot

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.756
of miles, at some point, it must be better to get the more fuel-efficient car.

00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:13.740
So, let's say we figure we're going to drive 50,000 miles before we sell the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.220
car again or it falls apart. And, of course, it also matters how expensive

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.890
gasoline is. If gasoline costs nothing, then the fuel efficiency doesn't

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.450
matter, but we'll assume that gas costs $4 per gallon. Now, that's actually

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.360
enough information for, to come up with the answer, but how will we decide? I

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.540
will give you an algorithm, that a computer could actually execute, to settle

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.120
this question.
