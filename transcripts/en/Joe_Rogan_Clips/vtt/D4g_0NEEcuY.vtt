1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.620
The Joe Rogan experience,
the lost civilization and pass down.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.780
I deploy a concept in this book that I actually got from Richard Dawkins.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.020
Richard Richard Dawkins is the author of the book called the selfish gene.

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.690
And he's not one of my favorite people because he's a,

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.860
he's a materialist reductionist and he doesn't believe in spirit or,

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.460
or any mystery in life that were just accidents of chemistry and B and biology.

7
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.070
We also has no psychedelic experience.
And he said,
no.

8
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.970
I did challenge him at a public event to go to go have a dozen sessions of

9
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.630
IOWASCA and still gas.
And once,
Oh,
just one would be enough.

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.200
But he has an excellent out because,
uh,
and sandy he's had,
he's had a stroke,

11
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.520
so he has a good excuse for not for not doing that,
but he's a clever man.

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.120
And one of his concepts that he's introduced into human culture is the concept

13
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.450
of the meme,
I think familiar with that word.

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.020
Genes are a physical reproductive mechanisms.

15
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.440
They reproduce themselves down the generations they replicate,

16
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:57.990
they multiply their passed on from one individual to another.

17
00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.610
Memes are cultural objects,

18
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.750
cultural ideas that are passed on and replicate and reproduce themselves.

19
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.990
And what I see right across the Americas and right across the old world as well

20
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.010
is a set of meetings that involve the sky,
that involve the ground,

21
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.380
that involve geometry,
that involve notions of life after death.
Uh,

22
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.070
and I think the only way to explain these is that they have been inherited from

23
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.660
an earlier culture that was in some way connected with the ancestors of all of

24
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.660
these,
all of these cultures.
I think that's what we're looking at in the Amazon.

25
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:35.100
We're looking at a meme which was deliberately created once you mobilize the

26
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:38.760
population to start creating huge geometrical structures,

27
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.500
you are also facilitating many other possibilities that an organized population

28
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.363
allows.

29
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.030
I think that's what happened at got Beckley Tepi I think that's why they created

30
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:52.260
the Megalithic site there to mobilize the local population of hunter gatherers,

31
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.030
to give them a project to do,

32
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.710
to engage them and in the process of engaging them to teach them the skills of

33
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:03.000
agriculture,
which were,
which,
which are fundamental to any concept of,

34
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.380
of civilization.
And it's weird the way agriculture just suddenly appears in,

35
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.580
in Quebec,
the Tepee,

36
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.500
and there's huge agricultural mysteries in the Amazon as well.

37
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.670
Um,
may I share a couple of leaves messages with you before you do that though?

38
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.120
Can you pull up that image?
Uh,

39
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.170
from go Beckley Tepi of pillar was the pillar 43 43 in enclosure d I would like

40
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:29.330
to see that that guy holding that bag.
That is,
it's a,
the,

41
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.760
the bags are in a row along the top of the pillow.
Um,

42
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.580
it's pillar 43 in,
in,
in enclosure,
d at correctly.
Taffy.
Is there a,

43
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:42.630
an image of that?
Online is available.
Okay,
here we go.
Yeah,
there's that,

44
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.460
there's the bags in a row and a row along the top as the same sort of square

45
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:51.210
shape bag with a curved handle that you find on the earliest image of the pillar

46
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.780
of the feathered serpent.
And that you find,
no,
you have to go above that Jamie.

47
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.810
Um,
just a little bit higher up the pillar.
That was bad,
right?
Yeah,
right.

48
00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:03.490
It right at the top there.
Um,
it's odd that the symbol crops up in,

49
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:06.700
in many different cultures and tends to be associated with some kind of

50
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.430
interpretation of those.
There's no mainstream interpretation of those bags.

51
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.070
That's my interpretation of those bags,
which I,
which I freely confess.

52
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.270
That's how,
that's how I read them.

53
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.990
I'm intrigued by the anomaly that the similar bag and turns up in the hands of

54
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:24.730
the quote sell collateral figure and turns up in Mesopotamia repeatedly,
um,

55
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.120
in,
in the hands of the individuals who are called the APP car.
Lou,
the,
the,

56
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.090
the magicians of the gods at the beginning bringers of civilization and the

57
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:35.650
plume Serp and [inaudible] was a,
it's an Aztec card,
right?
And quest,
the quest.

58
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:38.260
So collateral is an Aztec is an Aztec God,
but,

59
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.990
but the Aztecs are him from earlier cultures.

60
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:45.130
The very fact that an image of the plumed serpent is given such priority in all

61
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:49.390
met culture tells us that that system of ideas was present during all Mac Times,

62
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.530
which takes us back at least to 1500 BC,

63
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.660
probably quite a bit earlier than that.
Where's the Aztecs are 1,580.

64
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.080
So there's 3000 years between the Aztecs and the Omex and that same system of

65
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:06.310
ideas is running through all of those cultures and the Mayans had a name for it

66
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:10.360
as well.
Cool.
Cool.
Con and w,
what do you think that plumed serpent was?

67
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.480
I think he's,
it's very clear from,

68
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.900
from the accounts that have survived that what he's associated with a two things

69
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:20.560
in PR in particular.
One of them,
he's had god of peace.

70
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.500
He's not a war God.
Uh,
and the,

71
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:28.480
and the other thing that he's primarily about is giving the gifts of

72
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:30.610
civilization.
This is what you,

73
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.170
human beings need to know in order to move on to the next level.

74
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.370
Uh,
that is,

75
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.720
that is the function and the role of quite sarco Ethel and it's there are very

76
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.703
similar,

77
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.570
we could refer to them as civilizing heroes who are found in other cultures and

78
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:50.350
other locations or Cyrus in Egypt plays that role,
uh,

79
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.210
as a bringer of civilization.

80
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:56.620
There's hardly a culture in the ancient world that doesn't remember a time far

81
00:04:56.621 --> 00:05:01.621
back in remote prehistory when some kind of supernatural or advanced human

82
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:05.080
beings.
And I prefer the latter,

83
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.090
that some kind of advanced human beings were involved in a project to

84
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.980
disseminate a civilization.

85
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:15.370
I mentioned the two no in the Amazon who,

86
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.840
who are big drinkers of,
uh,
of Iowasca,
uh,

87
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.840
the Takano have a fascinating origin myth.
Uh,

88
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.870
they say that they're an origin myth states specifically that their ancestors

89
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.710
were brought to the Amazon.

90
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.780
They were brought to the Amazon by a group of super naturals who included the

91
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:39.520
daughter of the sun and an individual called the helmsmen who steered the

92
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:43.990
serpent canoe in which this settlement mission in the Amazon was,
was performed.

93
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:47.860
And what these so called supernaturals did was they brought the ancestors of

94
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:51.820
Tucano to the Amazon and they showed them the best places to settle the best

95
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.750
places where they,

96
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.690
where they might find hunting the best places where they might create a village,

97
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.700
the best places for agriculture.
And then they left,

98
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.130
but they left them behind one gift and that gift was Iowasca.
Wow.

99
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.440
That's the story of the origin myth of the Chicano.

100
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.620
And it sounds to me rather like the other side of the story of that DNA signal

101
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.280
in the Amazon,
that a group of people were deliberately settled,
uh,

102
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.370
in the Amazon by human beings who they chose to regard as a,

103
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.440
as a supernatural best.
That's what makes sense of it to me.
