00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.920
Based on the book by Chuck Pala--

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:10.349
Palani--

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:10.769
Pala--

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.889
I'm not gonna pronounce that.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.429
Comes the film that inspired an entire generation

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.060
... Of college dorm room posters.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.410
Fight Club.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.970
We're totally about to break the first rule,
aren't we?

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.869
Meet Tyler Durden --

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.689
I mean "Jack," or whatever.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.630
He's a normal guy with a steady job, nice
condo, and plenty of free time...

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.219
Which in the late 90's, meant something was
horribly wrong with your life.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.489
Everything will change when Jack creates the
impossibly cool alter ego of Tyler Durden,

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.100
a porn splicing, soup pissing, soap making
badass

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.359
who's basically the Che Guevara of imaginary
friends.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.379
Follow Jack/Tyler on their quest to save us
from all of our first world problems.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.589
"Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes,
working jobs we hate so we can buy sh*t we

00:00:58.589 --> 00:00:58.829
don't need."

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.230
As they tear down our society of mindless
consumer slaves

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.700
By building a society of mindless actual slaves.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.160
"Like a monkey ready to be shot into space."

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.300
But since he's so hot, barely anyone will
realize he's a total hypocrite.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.200
Aaaaaaaabs.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.610
Enter their secret underground world of fight
clubs,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.890
The only place for modern men to release their
violent urges

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.710
Except for boxing,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.200
wrestling,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.860
football,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.770
mixed martial arts,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.320
gun ranges,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.650
action movies,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.380
video games,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.750
hunting,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.220
mosh pits,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.830
hardcore hip-hop,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.250
and war.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.430
Strip down and join in their out of control
punch fests

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.560
And their anarchy obsessed terrorist group

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.740
Where the only thing they love more than violence
and chaos

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.090
is following the rules.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.830
"The first rule of Fight Club is you do not
talk about Fight Club."

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.030
"Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is
you do not ask questions, sir."

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.420
"The second rule of Fight Club"

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.910
"The third rule of Fight Club"

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.670
"Fourth rule"

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.430
"Fifth rule"

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.190
"Sixth rule"

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.950
"Seventh rule"

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.750
"The first rule of Project Mayhem"

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.740
"Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem"

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.620
"The first rule of Project Mayhem"

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.740
"SHUT UP!"

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.530
Take a break from all the sweaty guy-on-guy
action to experience some of your OTHER repressed

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.200
fantasies, like...

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.670
threatening your boss,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.230
blowing up buildings,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.119
sticking your d*ck in crazy,

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.170
punching Jared Leto in the face,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.370
and littering...

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.820
Lots and lots of littering.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.720
Take THAT, society!

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.310
Then, prepare yourself for a twist ending
we all should have seen coming...

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.590
"We're the same person?"

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.230
"That's right."

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.980
where the movie does everything it can to
show you that Tyler isn't real.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.220
"We have the exact same briefcase."

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.640
"Sometimes Tyler spoke for me."

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.290
"For some reason, I thought of my first fight
with Tyler."

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.960
"Who are you talking to?"

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.620
"Shut up."

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.610
"This conversation --"

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.560
"Is over."

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.110
"-- is over."

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.500
But nothing to explain why shooting yourself
in the face gets rid of him.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.860
"Are you alright, sir?"

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.280
"Oh, yeah, I'm ok."

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.690
Are you, though?

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.870
So revisit this high-budget Hollywood movie
with an anti-capitalist message, yet features

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.210
tons of product placement,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.540
a spin-off PlayStation game,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.130
a graphic novel sequel,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.140
two collector's editions.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.100
and, of course, officially licensed soap.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.459
I am Jack's missing sense of irony.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.810
Starring...

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.910
Brad's Pit ts

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.040
Stop Hitting Yourself, Stop Hitting Yourself

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.100
The Corpse Bride

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.760
Dallas Fighters Club

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.520
Mewwwwwbs

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.680
and Happy Feet.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.400
Fight Club

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.100
"With your feet in the air and your head on
the ground"

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.100
