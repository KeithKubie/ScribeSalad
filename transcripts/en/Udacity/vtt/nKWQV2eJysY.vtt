00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.740
Your idea may be original but
it's more likely that your idea

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.980
is similar to ones that
have come before it.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.070
To further validate your idea and
to determine if your product is

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.340
differentiated, you should
look at competitors.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.215
First, you you'll need to know
who your competitors are.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.650
You can quickly find
the competition by searching for

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.275
keywords related to your product idea.

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:24.615
You want to make sure you use words that
customers would use to describe your

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:25.885
product or something similar.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:30.705
Seems like we have a couple competitors
in the news already, at least for

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:31.945
the grocery shopping app idea.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.460
Once you've done that, you can collect
some basic info on the companies

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.820
using WHOis.net, Facebook, and Twitter.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.403
Creation dates for
companies are listed on all three sites.

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:45.989
But do keep in mind that businesses
could have started even sooner.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.770
On the WHOis.net,
the information is just below the fold.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.180
Here's the information for Instacart.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.560
You can find more information on your
competitors by going to websites

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.420
such as SimilarWeb and SEMrush.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.780
You can either search for
websites or mobile apps.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.910
On the results page, you can get
a sense for how the app is doing,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.430
the traffic sources, and keywords that
people use to search for the app.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.291
Now if we switch
the server to the website,

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.903
it will look a little bit different.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:21.156
Here you can get a sense
of the traffic overview,

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:25.925
the geography of the traffic,
referring websites, search keywords,

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:31.110
including organic and paid, and social
referrals from different websites.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.330
Other items you may be
considering looking into,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.520
include the competitors'
social media interactions.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.240
What are they writing about, and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.150
how are customers talking about
the brand or the product?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.810
If you're iterating on your product, or

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.500
trying to understand other companies'
value propositions, then I encourage you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.190
to look at their own homepages and
landing pages for specific products.
