ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Hi everyone.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.295
We're here at Devoxx 2014 in
beautiful Antwerp, Belgium.

00:00:06.295 --> 00:00:09.630
It's kind of cold
today, actually.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.580
And I'm here with my guest
to talk about Chrome Apps

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.180
everywhere.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.157
And maybe you can
introduce yourself.

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:16.990
ANDREW GRIEVE: Sure.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.110
So my name's Andrew Grieve,
and I work on the Chrome Apps

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.948
for Mobile project.

00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:26.510
Yeah, I've been doing web
development for the past six

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.594
years at Google, and it's
always an exciting time.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:29.926
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Yeah.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.440
The web is an exciting place.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.080
And it's always a good time
to be developing for the web.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.130
So Chrome apps and mobile,
so these are probably

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.650
the two things we'll talk about.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.010
The first one, Chrome apps.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.720
Can you maybe redefine this for
those that haven't heard of it

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.710
or need a refresh.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.097
How do they differ from web
pages or web extensions?

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:50.930
ANDREW GRIEVE: Sure.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.430
Sure.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.780
So Chrome apps have
had-- it's actually

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.960
a fairly short history.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.490
As we know them
today for desktop,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.880
they were only made
available late 2012,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.850
so only a couple years old.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.459
And the big difference
from web pages

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.020
is really that they don't
run within a browser tab.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.460
So they have to run
in their own window,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.230
and this distinguishes
them from regular web apps.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.540
So you get them through
the Chrome Web Store.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.740
They are downloaded
and installed.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.420
And the main reason why you'd
want them over a regular web

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.880
app is that they have permission
to use more powerful APIs,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.820
so things like the user's
identity, raw sockets,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.180
or synced storage, some really
more powerful and compelling

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.100
APIs.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.460
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So there

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.668
are two things you mentioned.

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:48.060
The first is the
actual-- its own window.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.610
It probably means it
can be totally immersive

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.800
and you don't really
know it is powered

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.000
by a web engine or
a rendering engine?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.875
ANDREW GRIEVE: Right.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:56.417
That's right.

00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:59.083
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Maybe
you want to comment about that.

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:01.210
And second question is
about the security aspect.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.340
It is very secure, though.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.420
Although it has those
additional powers and APIs

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.079
to access the
hardware and all that,

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.549
it is very secure
at the same time.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.590
So maybe you want to
comment on those two things.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.350
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yeah.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.450
So as you were saying, not only
do they run outside of a tab,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.270
but they run as their own window
and separate from the browser.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.720
So that means they have
their own desktop icon,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.780
they have their
own Alt tab entry.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.257
And to most users, they'd
be really hard pressed

00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:31.465
to figure out that they were
built on web technology.

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:31.870
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Yeah.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.850
They're very-- there's
native integration

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.000
with the OS,
whichever OS that is.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.610
ANDREW GRIEVE: Exactly.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.010
And as far security goes,
you also are right on point

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.540
there as well, that
in general, they

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.930
are more secure than typical
desktop applications.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.480
I mean, a large part of
that is just because it's

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.610
built by the Chrome team,
and I've really never

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.320
been on a team more
paranoid, I guess,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.300
about security than
the Chrome team.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.770
So all the apps
run in sandboxes.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.130
And there's really
locked-down capabilities

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.964
of what they can do.

00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:08.296
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So there's a content security

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:10.380
policy that's-- you
need to have one.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.890
You can't run without one.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.225
A regular website could,
but a Chrome app cannot.

00:03:15.225 --> 00:03:16.100
ANDREW GRIEVE: Right.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.030
So content security policy is
a fairly new HTML5 kind of API

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.150
that's come out in it.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.690
And it is available for
use on the open web.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.440
But it's an opt-in thing.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.740
So for Chrome Apps, the
difference is it's not opt-in.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.690
You must use it.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.650
And it really just helps prevent
mostly against XSS attacks.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.420
And the rationale
there is really

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.970
just because we're giving you
these more capable and powerful

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.804
APIs, so the risk is kind
of even greater to attacks.

00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:47.970
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And part of these things,

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.260
Chrome apps have been out
for a little while already.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.550
We have good examples of popular
apps that have been built

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.720
and that people are using.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.740
But what is new, I would
think, is the ability

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.950
to build mobile apps nowadays
with the same technology.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.570
Oh, and by the way,
Chrome apps are

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.400
being built with
web technologies,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.860
as I think people have
understood by now.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.810
It's all about
JavaScript, HTML5, CSS.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.170
So take those skills
that you have,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.660
those tools that
you have to build

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.700
desktop-like apps, but
also mobile apps nowadays.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.735
So how does that work?

00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:22.610
ANDREW GRIEVE: Right.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.157
So that is what I'm more
intimately familiar with.

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:28.490
That's what I've been working
on for the past two years.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.530
So Chrome Apps for
Mobile is actually

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.430
just still in a
developer preview phase.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.030
So there are some, I think,
pretty compelling apps being

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.470
built with it currently, but
it's still hot off the press.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.197
And you can mostly think of
that as a Cordova application.

00:04:43.197 --> 00:04:45.280
There's not a huge difference
between a Chrome App

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.280
for Mobile application and
a regular Apache Cordova

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.560
application.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.980
So Apache Cordova is a
fairly long-lived project,

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.610
which makes it easy to
create HTML and JavaScript

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.560
applications and deploy
them to mobile platforms,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.365
as true native apps but
built with web technology.

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:04.740
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: So how

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.560
would that differ from me
building, say, an Android

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.670
native app using a WebView?

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.350
ANDREW GRIEVE: So actually it
wouldn't differ all that much.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.230
So Cordova applications,
in general,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.810
are a WebView taking
up the entire page

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.476
and rendering your UI that way.

00:05:22.476 --> 00:05:24.100
So the biggest
difference, I would say,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.620
is it provides an
abstraction that

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.590
lets you target
multiple platforms.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.410
So iOS, Android
is what we support

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.974
on Chrome Apps for Mobile, and
then Cordova itself supports

00:05:35.974 --> 00:05:37.390
pretty much every
mobile operating

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.340
system that you can think of.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.881
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
But do you

00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:42.900
need to develop to
some very lowest

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.130
common denominator in terms
of what a WebView can support?

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.450
I know one of the nice,
very new features,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.450
I believe, in Android is the
fact that the Chrome WebView is

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.010
now something that
is being updated

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.330
on a very regular basis.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.850
It's been externalized.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.740
ANDREW GRIEVE: Right.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.156
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
You get

00:05:58.156 --> 00:06:02.490
take benefits of having WebGL in
the Chrome WebView on Android.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.900
You may not be able to do
this on all the platforms.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.850
So how does a developer
deal with that?

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.090
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yes so
this was historically

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.780
a really kind of growing
problem for the project

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.650
for a long time.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.180
And it's only
recently kind of been

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.489
addressed in a meaningful way.

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:21.030
So I'm really happy
to say that there

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.010
is a meaningful answer here.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.630
So like you said,
as with Android L

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.180
this system WebView
is based on Chromium,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.200
I believe M37 at launch,
and it is updatable outside

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.230
of Android updates.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.220
That's awesome.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.076
The iOS WebView,
as of iOS 8, they

00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:41.450
came up with a
brand new WebView.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.300
Now it has accelerated
JavaScript and WebGL as well.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.320
So very capable there.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.000
And iOS system updates
are quite well adopted.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.670
Of course the question
still is, what

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.830
about people that aren't
running Android L, which

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.640
has been out for
approximately one day now.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.350
So our answer, at least,
there is the Intel Crosswalk

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.240
open source project, which
is a bundling of the Chromium

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.850
WebView inside your application.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.580
So there's a couple trade-offs,
mainly the size of it.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.650
It adds about 17 megabytes
to your APK size.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.130
But for most, we haven't
heard that this is actually

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.810
a big problem.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.110
And it lets you use the
latest and greatest WebView

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.237
on all Android targets.

00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:33.570
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So walk us maybe a little bit

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.325
through the workflow,
the tooling, the APIs.

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:39.290
I want to start
my "Hello, World,"

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.820
and probably move a
little bit beyond that

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.331
and build my first Chrome
App-based mobile app.

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:47.080
What does it take?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.410
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yeah.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.951
So there's a couple
of options there.

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.560
I'd say the easiest just for
building a "Hello, World,"

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.100
and toying around
a little bit is

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.160
to use the Chrome Dev Editor.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.850
So this is, again,
a project that

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.900
was announced at the last
Google I/O this summer.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.220
And it's an ID which is actually
built as a Chrome app itself.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.760
So that's kind of cool as
a technology demonstration.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.962
But it's ID just for
building from Chrome Apps.

00:08:11.962 --> 00:08:13.374
So there's templates in there.

00:08:13.374 --> 00:08:14.290
There's a Play button.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.770
If you click Play, it'll
open your application

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.540
as a desktop Chrome App.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.610
And then if you use the
drop-down menu in our companion

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.910
tool for the Chrome App
Developer tool for mobile,

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.460
then there's a Deploy
to Mobile Device button.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.410
So you could easily,
without installing any SDKs,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.690
play around with what
your app would look like

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.460
both on mobile and on desktop.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.793
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Yeah.

00:08:35.793 --> 00:08:37.770
So the time to
"Hello, World" is very

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.775
short in this-- I mean, no SDKs.

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:41.400
ANDREW GRIEVE: That's
the quickest path

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.027
to a "Hello, World," for sure.

00:08:43.027 --> 00:08:44.860
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And eventually, I

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.920
do build this awesome app.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.700
And I just package this
and distribute this

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.830
through traditional Play
stores or Apple stores.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.330
Right?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:53.895
That's how it works.

00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:54.230
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yeah.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.729
Yeah.

00:08:54.729 --> 00:08:55.660
For mobile, exactly.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.970
So the App Store and iOS or
the Play store on Android.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.580
Once you get past your
typical "Hello, World,"

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.290
you want to install
our command line tools.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.500
So we have-- Cordova's
tools are based on Node.js,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.470
as are ours, for
Chrome Apps for Mobile.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.675
And we give you kind of
a Ruby on Rails style--

00:09:14.675 --> 00:09:16.300
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: Scaffolding.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.320
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.160
You can do-- CCA is
the name of the tool.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.354
So cca Create Project,
cca Build Android.

00:09:24.354 --> 00:09:25.770
And that's about
the extent of it,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.320
so you need to install your SDKs
at this point for this tool.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.510
But then we give you a
nice wrapper around them

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.180
to just say cca build
Android, cca build iOS.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.180
And then that's what you
upload to the stores.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:37.470
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: And I'm

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.320
pretty sure having
command line also

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.090
helps with continuous
integration

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.880
and integrating this in
any build environment

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.112
and development environment
that developers have.

00:09:47.112 --> 00:09:47.945
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yeah.

00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:49.910
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So web developers

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.444
love using frameworks
or libraries, whatever

00:09:53.444 --> 00:09:54.360
you want to call them.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.840
Does Chrome Apps
recommend against

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.620
or to use some
libraries, if any,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.847
especially in the mobile case?

00:10:02.847 --> 00:10:03.680
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yeah.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.860
I mean, that's
mostly a question we

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.640
try to stay out of a little bit.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.815
There's new frameworks
popping up all the time.

00:10:12.815 --> 00:10:14.440
I'd say our project
goal is to give you

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.390
the awesomest, most
powerful blank canvas

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.910
to work with as possible.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.285
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: Right.

00:10:21.285 --> 00:10:22.742
So you're not
mandating anything.

00:10:22.742 --> 00:10:23.700
ANDREW GRIEVE: Exactly.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.730
So Polymer, I think,
is a promising project.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.840
Angular, I've had
good times with.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.780
Ionic is a really popular
Angular-based framework

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.380
for Cordova-based
applications, which

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.970
works just fine for
Chrome Apps for Mobile.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.239
I mean, my personal advice
is to spend the time

00:10:42.239 --> 00:10:44.530
to at least understand what
these frameworks are doing.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.300
But I wouldn't say I have
a strong preference for any

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.800
of them.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.020
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: Choice is good.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.120
I like choice.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.080
So maybe to close off, you're
here presenting at Devoxx.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.910
And I think you also have some
tips or information about what

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.830
kind of paradigm
works for developers.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.580
Maybe mobile apps.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.288
I mean, the things
that really work well,

00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:04.810
things that don't work all
that well that people shouldn't

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.310
maybe use yet or at
all, because it's just

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.950
not the way they should build
things in this environment.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.757
Do you want to tell
us more about this?

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:14.590
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yeah.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:21.070
So I do have kind of developer
guidance, I would say,

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.460
tips and tricks in my talk.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.160
Mostly I'd say what
works well is just--

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.720
the main thing I
find is just make

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.370
sure you have that fast feedback
loop when you're developing.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.150
And that's kind of one of the
best things about developing

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.390
for the web platform
wherever you are.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.300
So for Cordova applications,
the main trick there

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.390
is to remember that
you're building using web,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:51.550
so it doesn't take much to
make your mobile application

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.490
run on a desktop browser.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.790
And Chrome Dev
Tools emulation mode

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.404
gives you a really
easy way to make

00:11:59.404 --> 00:12:01.070
Chrome pretend like
it's a mobile device

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.410
and shrink your view
port and whatnot.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.840
It's really fast and convenient.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.600
So it's no replacement
for testing on device,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.605
but it certainly makes
for a compelling workflow.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:11.980
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: Great.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.420
So what is the status of
this project altogether?

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.010
I mean, can people use it today?

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.250
And would you recommend
people shipping

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.527
apps built on top of that today?

00:12:22.527 --> 00:12:23.360
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yeah.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.010
So I'd say every application
has different requirements.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.850
Certainly for some, this would
be a perfectly reasonable

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.120
platform to use today.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.640
There are some rough edges
around us finishing up

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.990
the Crosswalk
integration, for example.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.260
For example, we
haven't yet updated cca

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.400
to support the iPhone
6 Plus icon sizes.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.550
So we'll have that done probably
next week, some rough edges.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.890
But I'd say for the
most part, we're ready.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.212
We've responded quickly to
our bug tracker on GitHub.

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:00.670
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And this

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.240
is a good time to mention that
this is a fully open source

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.810
project.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.050
ANDREW GRIEVE: Yes.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:04.330
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So if people

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.890
want to support, help, or at
least know what's going on,

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.007
it's done in the open.

00:13:09.007 --> 00:13:09.965
ANDREW GRIEVE: Exactly.

00:13:09.965 --> 00:13:10.580
Yeah.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.830
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.788
Well thank you, Andrew.

00:13:12.788 --> 00:13:14.950
That's, I guess, all
the time we have for it.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.140
So thank you for
answering my questions.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.070
And we'll be seeing you soon.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.890
Online probably.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:20.931
ANDREW GRIEVE: All right.

00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:21.670
Thanks.
