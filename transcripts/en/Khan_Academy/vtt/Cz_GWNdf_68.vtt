00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.730
Let's say that I have
some function, s of t,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.185
which is positioned
as a function of time.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.460
And let me graph a potential
s of t right over here.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.720
We have a horizontal
axis as the time axis.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.140
Let me just graph something.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.020
I'll draw it kind
of parabola-looking.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.603
Although I could
have done it general,

00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:26.350
but just to make things a
little bit simpler for me.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.890
So I'll draw it kind
of parabola-looking.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.110
We call this the y-axis.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.350
We could even call this y equals
s of t as a reasonable way

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.020
to graph our position as a
function of time function.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.420
And now let's think
about what happens

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.840
if we want to think about the
change in position between two

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.160
times, let's say between time
a-- let's say that's time

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.360
a right over there-- and then
this right over here is time b.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.180
So time b is right over here.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.540
So what would be the change
in position between time a

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.800
and between time b?

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.290
Well, at time b, we
are at s of b position.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.380
And at time a we were
at s of a position.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.570
So the change in
position between time

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:31.500
a and time b-- let me write this
down-- the change in position

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.400
between-- and this
might be obvious to you,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.790
but I'll write it
down-- between times a

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.440
and b is going to be equal
to s of b, this position,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.890
minus this position,
minus s of a.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.757
So nothing
earth-shattering so far.

00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:54.340
But now let's think
about what happens

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.470
if we take the derivative of
this function right over here.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.320
So what happens when
we take the derivative

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.351
of a position as a
function of time?

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.850
So remember, the
derivative gives us

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.500
the slope of the tangent
line at any point.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.430
So let's say we're looking
at a point right over there,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.960
the slope of the tangent line.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.830
It tells us for a very
small change in t--

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.330
I'm exaggerating it visually--
for a very, very small change

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.520
in t, how much are we
changing in position?

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.860
So we write that as ds dt is
the derivative of our position

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.480
function at any given time.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.210
So when we're talking about the
rate at which position changes

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.850
with respect to
time, what is that?

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.380
Well, that is equal to velocity.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.130
So this is equal to velocity.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.270
But let me write this
in different notations.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.450
So this itself is going
to be a function of time.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.160
So we could write this
is equal to s prime of t.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.540
These are just
two different ways

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.740
of writing the derivative
of s with respect to t.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.220
This makes it a
little bit clearer

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.020
that this itself is
a function of time.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.550
And we know that this is the
exact same thing as velocity

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:16.030
as function of time, which
we will write as v of t.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.160
So let's graph what v of t
might look like down here.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.270
Let's graph it.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.140
So let me put another
axis down here that

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.170
looks pretty close
to the original.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.230
I'll give myself
some real estate,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.110
so that looks pretty good.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.090
And then let me try
to graph v of t.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.770
So once again, if this is my
y-axis, this is my t-axis,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.640
and I'm going to graph
y is equal to v of t.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.660
And if this really
is a parabola,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.502
then the slope over here is
0, the rate of change is 0,

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:52.710
and then it keeps increasing.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.940
The slope gets steeper
and steeper and steeper.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.380
And so v of t might look
something like this.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.260
So this is the graph of
y is equal to v of t.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.600
Now, using this
graph, let's think

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.900
if we can conceptualize
the distance, or the change

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.990
in position, between time
a and between time b.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.340
Well, let's go back
to our Riemann sums.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.040
Let's think about what an
area of a very small rectangle

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.020
would represent.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.570
So let's divide this into
a bunch of rectangles.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.790
So I'll do it fairly
large rectangles

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.730
just so we have some
space to work with.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.830
You can imagine
much smaller ones.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.837
And I'm going to do a
left Riemann sum here,

00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:44.420
just because we've
done those a bunch.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.710
But we could do it
right Riemann sum.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.020
We could do a trapezoidal sum.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.030
We could do anything we want.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.440
And then we could keep going
all the way-- actually,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.560
let me just do three right now.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.535
Let me just do three
right over here.

00:04:59.535 --> 00:05:01.660
And so this is actually a
very rough approximation,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.650
but you can imagine
it might get closer.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.000
But what is the area of
each of these rectangles

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.110
trying-- what is it
an approximation for?

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.120
Well, this one right over
here, you have f of a,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.240
or actually I should say v of a.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.777
So your velocity at time a is
the height right over here.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.360
And then this distance
right over here

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.250
is a change in
time, times delta t.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.590
So the area for that
rectangle is your velocity

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.532
at that moment times
your change in time.

00:05:30.532 --> 00:05:31.990
What is the velocity
at that moment

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.250
times your change in time?

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.650
Well, that's going to be
your change in position.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.130
So this will tell you--
this is an approximation

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.650
of your change in
position over this time.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.200
Then the area of this rectangle
is another approximation

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.660
for your change in position
over the next delta t.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.760
And then, you can imagine,
this right over here

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.660
is an approximation
for your change

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.669
in position for
the next delta t.

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.710
So if you really wanted
to figure out your change

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.370
in position between
a and b, you might

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.030
want to just do a Riemann sum
if you wanted to approximate it.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.480
You would want to take
the sum from i equals 1

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.114
to i equals n of v of-- and
I'll do a left Riemann sum,

00:06:12.114 --> 00:06:13.780
but once again, we
could use a midpoint.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.790
We could do trapezoids.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.850
We could do the
right Riemann sum.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.641
But I'll just do a left
one, because that's

00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:24.620
what I depicted right
here-- v of t of i minus 1.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.920
So this would be t0, would be a.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.710
So this is the first rectangle.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.956
So the first rectangle, you use
the function evaluated at t0.

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:35.330
For the second
rectangle, you use

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.180
the function evaluated at t1.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.420
We've done this in
multiple videos already.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.900
And then we multiply it times
each of the changes in time.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.170
This will be an
approximation for our total--

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.900
and let me make it
clear-- where delta t is

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.536
equal to b minus a over the
number of intervals we have.

00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:02.160
We already know, from
many, many videos

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.868
when we looked at
Riemann sums, that this

00:07:03.868 --> 00:07:07.099
will be an approximation
for two things.

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.640
We just talked about it'll be
an approximation for our change

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.090
in position, but it's also an
approximation for our area.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.270
So this right over here.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:22.060
So we're trying to approximate
change in position.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.820
And this is also approximate
of the area under the curve.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.297
So hopefully this
satisfies you that if you

00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:35.880
are able to calculate the area
under the curve-- and actually,

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.250
this one's pretty easy,
because it's a trapezoid.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.039
But even if this was a function,
if it was a wacky function,

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:42.580
it would still apply
that when you're

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.630
calculating the area under the
curve of the velocity function,

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.400
you are actually figuring
out the change in position.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.381
These are the two things.

00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:52.880
Well, we already
know, what could we

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.600
do to get the exact
area under the curve,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.930
or to get the exact
change in position?

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.720
Well, we just have
a ton of rectangles.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.990
We take the limit as
the number of rectangles

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.940
we have approaches infinity.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.900
We take the limit as
n approaches infinity.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.960
And as n approaches
infinity, because delta t is

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.450
b minus a divided
by n, delta t is

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.100
going to become
infinitely small.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.050
It's going to turn into dt,
is one way to think about it.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.090
And we already have
notation for this.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.760
This is one way to think
about a Riemann integral.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.200
We just use the
left Riemann sum.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.340
Once again, we could use the
right Riemann sum, et cetera,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:28.840
et cetera.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.756
We could have used a
more general Riemann sum,

00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:31.810
but this one will work.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.210
So this will be equal
to the definite integral

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:41.620
from a to b of v of t dt.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.590
So this right over here is
one way of saying, look,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.060
if we want the exact area under
the curve, of the velocity

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.800
curve, which is going to be
the exact change in position

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.120
between a and b, we
can denote it this way.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.940
It's the limit of this Riemann
sum as n approaches infinity,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.217
or the definite integral
from a to b of v of t dt.

00:08:58.217 --> 00:08:59.550
But what did we just figure out?

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.200
So remember, this is
the-- we could call this

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:18.650
the exact change in position
between times a and b.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.650
But we already figured
out what the exact change

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.750
in position between
times a and b are.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.110
It's this thing right over here.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.500
And so this gets interesting.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.732
We now have a way of evaluating
this definite integral.

00:09:31.732 --> 00:09:33.190
Conceptually, we
knew that this was

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.274
the exact change in
position between a and b.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.190
But we already figured
out a way to figure out

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.064
the exact change of
position between a and b.

00:09:39.064 --> 00:09:40.690
So let me write all this down.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.860
We have that the definite
integral between a and b

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:55.500
of v of t dt is equal
to s of b minus s of a

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:03.150
where-- let me write this in
a new color-- where s of t

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.310
is the-- we know v of t is
the derivative of s of t,

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:17.147
so we can say where s of t is
the antiderivative of v of t.

00:10:17.147 --> 00:10:18.855
And this notion,
although I've written it

00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:21.950
in a very nontraditional--
I've used position velocity--

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.245
this is the second fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:10:26.984 --> 00:10:28.900
And you're probably
wondering about the first.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.810
We'll talk about that
in another video.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.460
But this is a super
useful way of evaluating

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.620
definite integrals
and finding the area

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.780
under a curve, second
fundamental theorem

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.660
of calculus, very closely
tied to the first fundamental

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.530
theorem, which we
won't talk about now.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.600
So why is this such a big deal?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.970
Well, let me write it in
the more general notation,

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.761
the way that you might
be used to seeing it

00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:51.960
in your calculus book.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.780
It's telling us that
if we want the area

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.260
under the curve between
two x points a and b

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.710
of f of x-- and so this
is how we would denote

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.550
the area under the curve
between those two intervals.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.540
So let me draw that
just to make it clear

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.270
what I'm talking about
in general terms.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.050
So this right over
here could be f of x.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.710
And we care about the area
under the curve between a and b.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.570
If we want to find the
exact area under the curve,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.690
we can figure it out by taking
the antiderivative of f.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:32.780
And let's just say that capital
F of x is the antiderivative--

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.095
or is an antiderivative, because
you can have multiple that

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:43.916
are shifted by constants--
is an antiderivative of f.

00:11:43.916 --> 00:11:47.330
Then you just have to take--
evaluate-- the antiderivative

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.440
at the endpoints and
take the difference.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.080
So you take the endpoint first.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.230
I guess you subtract the
antiderivative evaluated

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.200
at the starting point from
the antiderivative evaluated

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.090
at the end point.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:07.871
So you get capital F of
b minus capital F of a.

00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:10.370
So if you want to figure out
the exact area under the curve,

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.030
you take the
antiderivative of it

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.050
and evaluate that
at the endpoint,

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.840
and from that, you subtract
the starting point.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.340
So hopefully, that makes sense.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.530
In the next few videos,
we'll actually apply it.
