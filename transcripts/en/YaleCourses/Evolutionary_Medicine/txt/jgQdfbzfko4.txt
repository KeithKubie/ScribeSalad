Speaker 1:          00:01          Most of us grow up thinking that the bond between infant and mother is a very tight sharing of interests. However, in fact if we look at it from the point of view of the genes that are in the mother and in the offspring, we see that there is a strong potential for evolutionary conflict that has medical consequences and so I would like to start this by talking about the evolutionary theory behind parent offspring conflict. We owe that to bill Hamilton who came up with the idea of cancellation to Bob Trevor's who saw that that had implications for parent offspring conflict and to David Haig who saw that parent offspring and mother father conflict both will have influence on the course of pregnancy. So the basic idea of kin selection comes from Bill Hamilton here photographed on the Amazon River, a British evolutionary geneticist. Bill saw that what matters in evolution is not individual survival, but the increase in frequency of the genes that are carried by an individual. That's an insight he got from Fisher and Haldane and others therefore pays an individual to sacrifice itself. If more copies of that individual's genes get into the next generation, then if that individual did not sacrifice itself. So there can be a conflict between genetic interest in individual survival. The costs and benefits of acts are weighed against each other in genetic currency.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:35          And genes exist not only in the individual but also in its relatives. Therefore, if an individual can help its relatives to survive and reproduce and if the increase in the number of its genes in the next generation through offspring of relatives is greater than the decrease through its own offspring, is a consequence of that act than helping behavior will be selected. Now, how do we calculate genetic costs and benefits? Well, if we let be equal benefit, that would be the increase in the recipient's fitness is as the result of an act. See, the cost would be the decrease in the donor's fitness is the result of an act are, is the coefficient of relationship, which is the probability that a gene in the donor and a gene and the recipient are identical by descent from a common ancestor.

Speaker 2:          02:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Given that the condition for helping is that B divided by c is greater than one divided by r or there'd be times R is greater than c times one or to put it into English. The increase in the relatives fitness as a result of the act times the relationship to the relative. So that's B Times r is greater than the decrease in the donor's is a result of the act times its relationship to itself. It's relationship to itself is one.

Speaker 2:          03:07          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:08          so some of the kinds of traits that are proposed as instances of Ken selected quote, all through wisdom of acting to save others that are costing yourself include alarm calls in birds, ground squirrels and primates guarding behavior and vigilance, helping at the nest in birds, suppressed reproduction which we see and bees and wasps and ants in social carnivores like mere cats. Wild dogs dwarf mongooses and hyenas and they could mole rats. Here we see some mere cats confronting a cobra. They have both suppressed reproduction with one female reproducing and the rest helping and they have guarding behavior and vigilance. Now there are alternative explanations for some of these behaviors, but these are the kinds of things that behavioral ecologist explain his kin selected. Now the next idea is that of parent offspring conflict, which we get from Bob. Trevor's apparent in a diploid sexually reproducing species is 50% related to each of its offspring, and that means it would like to invest equally in each of its offspring. However, the offspring is 100% related to itself. It's 50% related to its full sibs and it's 25% related to half sibs. Therefore, an offspring should, should try to get more investment from its parents than its parents had been selected to give. That's that difference between a hundred percent and 50%

Speaker 2:          04:47          okay.

Speaker 1:          04:48          The offspring should seek to force the parental investment upwards until it's inclusive fitness. It's own fitness plus what it would get from current or potential siblings is maximized. It doesn't try to take everything, but it tries to take more than the parent wants to give.

Speaker 2:          05:11          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:11          so parent and offspring are expected to disagree over how long the period of parental investment should be over the amount of parental investments should be given and over the altruistic or selfish behavior of offspring towards relatives.

Speaker 2:          05:27          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:27          parent offspring conflict is expected increase during the period of parental care and offspring are expected to employee both biological and psychological weapons in conflict with their parents. The next step in this train of reasoning came from David Haig who thought about parent offspring conflict in pregnancy. As with any, oh, an offspring that's the fetus is selected to extract more from the mother than the mother is selected to give and we've seen from our study of invasiveness that fetal tissue in the placenta is put into itself, into a position to manipulate maternal physiology and it can do that by hormone production. That kind of manipulation is easier when the fetal tissue has invaded the maternal tissue in the placenta and there are two with two main ways of doing that. One is to increase maternal blood pressure that continues the risk for Preeclampsia and the other is to increase the sugar concentration of maternal blood that leads to pregnancy related diabetes.

Speaker 2:          06:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:41          This kind of control is related to genetic imprinting. Genes are imprinted or turned off by methylating the DNA, we're changing the acetylation pattern in histones. Some genes are imprinted differently in the germ line of fathers and mothers. This is called parent of origin or genomic imprinting. Genes imprinted in the germ line are not expressed early in fetal development and they are then reprogrammed in the germ line of the adult to be appropriate for being either a mother or father. Okay. Either a male or a female. There is a connection between kin selection and genomic imprinting. The mother is 50% related to each year for her offspring as we have emphasized, but if she has future offspring with other males, then only this offspring is 50% related to the father. The others will not be related to him at all.

Speaker 2:          07:41          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:42          Thus to the degree that meeting is polygamous. Paternal genes are going to be selected to extract more from the mother than the mother is selected to give and the mother or the maternal genes will be selected to resist. So to develop that idea in a bit more detail. What's going on is that the father is turning off genes that downregulate growth, so paternally expressed transcripts, enhanced growth. There's an interesting double negative here. Let me run through it again. The father is turning off genes that downregulate growth paternally expressed transcripts, enhance growth. The mother is turning off genes that upregulate growth, so maternally express transcripts inhibit growth. The normal state of the embryo is that there is an equilibrium in which both mother and offspring are in reasonably good condition.

Speaker 2:          08:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:40          However, the conflict is revealed when the action taken by one parent is canceled by disrupting the imprinting in mice. This can be done with extended with a genetic manipulation and that produces an increase or decrease of about 10% in birth weight. In humans, we rely on mutations that produced rare diseases. We'll talk more about that later.

Speaker 2:          09:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:08          The idea is well supported for the jeans, Igf two and Igf two r this is insulin like growth factor and its receptor CDK nic and GRB 10 but there's not yet. We'll support it for others genes that are known to be imprinted by sex of origin. So to summarize, natural selection acts to increase the frequency of genes, not the survival of individuals. Genes can influence their fate by influencing actions that affect the reproductive success of relatives.

Speaker 2:          09:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Parent and offspring are in conflict over reproductive investment. The offspring is selected to demand more than the period of selected to give.

Speaker 2:          09:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:54          Maternally and fraternity derived genes are in similar conflict within the, within the offspring. And this seems to explain genomic imprinting that is parent of origin in pretty, in both cases, the normal condition is an equilibrium established by an evolutionary tug of war. Disrupting that equilibrium can manifest in unselected pathology.
