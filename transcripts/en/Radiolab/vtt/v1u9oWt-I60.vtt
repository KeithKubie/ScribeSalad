00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.690
You are listening to radio lab radio

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.530
from W. N y.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.330
S. C. E. N. N. P. R. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab, the podcast.

4
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.520
And today we are going to talk about global warfare

5
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.120
<v 1>[inaudible] the hast back</v>

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.130
<v 0>across the planet on a scale that it's really hard to believe involving</v>

7
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:31.330
trillions of deaths.

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.873
<v 1>And yet</v>

9
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.550
<v 0>we really need this war because without it I wouldn't be here.</v>

10
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.250
You wouldn't be here. Jad wouldn't be here.

11
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:42.250
And you may have noticed he isn't here and it's not because of awards cause he

12
00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:46.210
had a baby. But before jab went on paternity leave, we sat down with Ari.

13
00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:50.050
Daniel Shapiro. Okay. And he told us this story here at candles, right? Yes.

14
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:53.830
So he ran it, the center for the culture of Milian Phytoplankton.

15
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.750
And I always say Lee Wilson. Willie Wilson is his name. Yeah, that's tough.

16
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.310
Just like his grandfather actually.

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.960
<v 2>Yeah. My Dad's William Wilson that are from a long line of William Wilson's.</v>

18
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.430
Your son. I saw this Angus, but he's Angus. William Wilson.

19
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:10.530
So I that Guy Willie

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.670
<v 3>works at the big laboratory for ocean sciences in Maine. Okay.</v>

21
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.810
Any studies for these?

22
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.250
Tiny plant like creatures that live in the sea called phytoplankton.

23
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.100
He keeps them in a fridge in these little test tubes,

24
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.380
half full of kind of the greenish water, but then we'll look at that.

25
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.170
He pulled one out and showed it to me and it doesn't really look like there's

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.400
that much going on in there,

27
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.040
<v 2>but actually right at the bottom you can see what looks like a,</v>

28
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.310
like a white a,

29
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.710
<v 3>what is it? It's the carnage of war in that test too,</v>

30
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:51.711
that willys holding are millions of tiny single celled plants called Kaka Litho

31
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:56.700
fours Kako Kaka Litho fours. Yeah,

32
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.860
and there are lots of them in the sea.

33
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.610
<v 2>There's probably about a hundred thousand of these coklat the force in a</v>

34
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:05.880
teaspoon of sea water. Tell me about the Kochler, like what do they look like?

35
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Basically like a like tiny little translucent balls with know a slight tinge of

36
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:18.050
green. But the key thing is that the outside of that bile is it has these white

37
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.083
<v 3>plates,</v>

38
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.540
tiny circular shields of chalk because the Kaka Litho fours are fighting for

39
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:26.194
their lives.

40
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.470
<v 1>Yes, fighting with each other viruses.</v>

41
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.690
These viruses that are shaped like diamonds.

42
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.960
<v 3>So here's what happens. Imagine your Akaka Litho for, okay.</v>

43
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.230
Floating in the ocean and along comes this diamond shaped virus and it jams it's

44
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:51.430
diamond tip into you

45
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.500
<v 2>between these plates and actually get inside the cell, the chinks in the armor.</v>

46
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.120
That's right. It's like the chinks in the armor

47
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.340
<v 3>and the coccoliths Litho for</v>

48
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.360
<v 2>just Goldson and the virus things. Yes, I'm in here.</v>

49
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.080
And then it sort of mix straight to the nucleus

50
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.510
<v 3>and it's at that moment that the viral takeover begins.</v>

51
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.800
The virus kind of hijacks the cellular machinery.

52
00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:20.510
That's usually used by the [inaudible]

53
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.740
<v 1>let the four to make more coccoliths for stuff and it starts making more</v>

54
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:26.604
viruses.

55
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.500
So inside the cochlear for now there are these little diamonds multiplying.

56
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.250
Yeah.

57
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.250
They're filling up that space and eventually all these viruses head out of the

58
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.580
cockle at the floor in big belches or like a steady stream of viruses.

59
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.120
Wow.

60
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.240
<v 2>And each one of these bonuses has the ability to,</v>

61
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.750
to go on and then fact another coccoliths are for sale.

62
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.360
<v 3>In fact, those coccoliths fours in that test too, that willy showed me my shake.</v>

63
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.980
This just stuck to the of them a little bit. Yeah.

64
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.870
Those were in the process of dying.

65
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.900
<v 2>Smell that. Yeah. So that what you're smelling now that's, that's the infection.</v>

66
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:05.420
That's dimethyl sulfide as well.

67
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.010
So then faction is already occurring in this culture

68
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.340
<v 3>and when the coccoliths Litho Ford dies,</v>

69
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.750
those white shields kind of fall off.

70
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.850
<v 2>They sort of gradually sort of reign off over the course of the infection.</v>

71
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.800
<v 3>So as it's dying, after it's spewed out, these viruses,</v>

72
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:27.330
it just sheds its plate and it kind of, and then it dies.

73
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.440
Yeah. And that creates this white chalkiness. Yeah. Well,

74
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.290
so this means like the Coco Litho boys are not doing very well. Oh, well.

75
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.190
They've got a couple of tricks up their little calcified sleeves.

76
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.730
<v 1>Sometimes when a virus enters the cockle, let the four,</v>

77
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.980
we'll send out a chemical signal. There's saw shouting, hey,

78
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.070
it's too late for me, but save yourselves.

79
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.240
And initially this signal's pretty weak in the water,

80
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.660
but as more and more coccoliths fours are infected,

81
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.610
the chorus of this chemical beacon grows louder and louder.

82
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.070
And so the other cells that hear these messages

83
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.840
<v 3>and they change by messing with their DNA a bit,</v>

84
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.060
and they go from having those white shields on the outside to having these

85
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.440
jaggedy scales,

86
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.940
which we think might be in pen of stubble scales instead of these plates, right?

87
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.000
Yep. Yeah. The site. Why aren't they just scaly all the time?

88
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.800
Because when they're scaly,

89
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.530
they can't be the best cockle with the fours they can be,

90
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.910
they just don't grow as well. So scaly is an adaptation against the viruses.

91
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.270
Exactly. And then finally, if all else fails,

92
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.090
program cell death,

93
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.420
the Kaka Litho fours just commit suicide just shuts down and kills itself to

94
00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:47.030
prevent propagation of viruses. But over time,

95
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.060
the viruses have figured out how to prevent the sale from killing themselves.

96
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.330
So it delays the death of the coccoliths [inaudible] for long as possible

97
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 1>to maximize the number of viruses that can get out. Wow.</v>

98
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:07.460
This is serious. Yeah, it's like an arms race. There's a constant battle

99
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.540
<v 2>too, to be fitter than you were several generations ago. And with those,</v>

100
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.730
<v 3>here's the crazy thing,</v>

101
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.880
this battle is happening all through the surface. Yeah.

102
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.840
<v 1>The ocean, there are legions of coccoliths,</v>

103
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.990
Litho forest dying all the time and the Kaka Litho forests are shedding their

104
00:06:27.271 --> 00:06:28.320
white shields,

105
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.100
like taken millions of tiny little midos and putting them in the surface of the

106
00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:32.934
ocean.

107
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.800
So many that you can actually see this carnage from space.

108
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.470
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

109
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.680
<v 2>you can see this from space. Yeah. You get, um,</v>

110
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.840
massive blooms that cover almost the whole of the North Atlantic.

111
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.220
I mean you get this sort of milky bloom that covers anything from,

112
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.971
you know,

113
00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:58.740
off the west coast of Scotland and their southern Iceland almost all the way to

114
00:06:58.741 --> 00:07:01.950
Newfoundland. I'm in the southern hemisphere.

115
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.390
You get this sort of massive milkiness that circumnavigates the globe,

116
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.140
<v 3>these vast swirls of milky water curling around islands and continents and</v>

117
00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:16.020
that's all carnage from this battle.

118
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.460
Billions and billions of soldiers that have fallen in the field. Wow.

119
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.380
That we can view from space.

120
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.140
It probably is trillions if you're talking on that scale. Yeah.

121
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.450
I think that the trillions quadrillion.

122
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.070
Do you think and you think it's wearing the quadrillions, just say it.

123
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:33.570
See how it feels. There are quadrillions of soldiers dying.

124
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.780
How did that feel? It felt good.

125
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.920
If I were to be an astronaut,

126
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.630
how often would I see these sorts of blooms all the time.

127
00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.510
Somewhere on the planet. Every day, every hour,

128
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.720
<v 2>the every hour. Those there's going to be a bloom going on somewhere. You know,</v>

129
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.750
a good example is off the Norwegian fjords.

130
00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.780
They stopped in the fjords and late April into may time and then they sort of

131
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.980
creep to the fjords like this huge living a Amoeba.

132
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.920
Fishermen hate it because the fish can't see the, the lure,

133
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:13.630
so they can't catch the fish anymore

134
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.830
<v 3>and as the shields rain off and fall down to the ocean floor,</v>

135
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.660
they build up and build up over time.

136
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.290
<v 2>Millions of years of sedimentation of these sort of chalk particles.</v>

137
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.630
<v 3>That's actually what led to the creation of the cliffs of Dover.</v>

138
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.260
The white cliffs of Dover in England shut up. Really? Yes.

139
00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:38.860
This is geology and action. And not just that, when the coccoliths,

140
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.490
the fours get decimated by the virus,

141
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.930
it kind of clears out the ocean for other phytoplankton to bloom.

142
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.230
And then they get mowed down by their viruses.

143
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.610
And then the Kaka Litho fores might bloom again and then they get wiped out.

144
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:59.390
And this cycle with all these bottles that mean that it's all responsible for

145
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:02.610
about half the, the oxygen that we breathe.

146
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.770
Really half the oxygen,

147
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:09.690
we breathe half the oxygen because when the phytoplankton bloom,

148
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.020
they take in carbon dioxide and they release a puff of oxygen

149
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:18.670
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

150
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.070
<v 3>and then they're cut down by these viruses,</v>

151
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.160
but they grow back up again.

152
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:26.160
<v 4>Wow.</v>

153
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.930
<v 3>And another breath is released.</v>

154
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.210
So the whole system is, is just kind of breathing

155
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.290
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

156
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.260
<v 2>people think of the, the lungs of the planet, uh, are the,</v>

157
00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:44.040
the rainforests. And that's, that's kind of half the picture.

158
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.960
But every other breath we take comes from the, the phytoplankton.

159
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.430
The notion that had gone through these battles on a, you know, on a daily basis.

160
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.470
<v 3>So this is a battle that rages every single day somewhere in our oceans.</v>

161
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.260
Yeah. We need the battle to live.

162
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:22.930
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

163
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.370
<v 3>Ari, thank you. Sure.</v>
