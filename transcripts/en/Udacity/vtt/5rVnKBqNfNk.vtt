00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.770
So what was your answer, David?

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.320
&gt;&gt; So comparing the X coordinate of
the various cases I found that there's

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.460
two cases that match the X coordinate
of the new problem, A and C.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.930
Comparing the Y coordinates,
though, A is all the way up here,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.090
so I would choose C which matches
the X and the Y coordinate exactly.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.660
&gt;&gt; That's right, David.
