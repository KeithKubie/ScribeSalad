00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.040
Let me tell you about Oliver Sacks, the famous
physician, professor and author of unusual

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.600
neurological case studies.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
We’ll be looking at some of his fascinating
research in future lessons, but for now, I

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.129
just want to talk about Sacks himself.

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.040
Although he possesses a brilliant and inquisitive
mind, Dr. Sacks cannot do a simple thing that

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.780
your average toddler can.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.940
He can’t recognize his own face in the mirror.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.960
Sacks has a form of prosopagnosia, a neurological
disorder that impairs a person’s ability

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.590
to perceive or recognize faces, also known
as face blindness.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.350
Last week we talked about how brain function
is localized, and this is another peculiarly

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.960
excellent example of that.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.559
Sacks can recognize his coffee cup on the
shelf, but he can’t pick out his oldest

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.649
friend from a crowd, because the specific
sliver of his brain responsible for facial

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:46.909
recognition is malfunctioning.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.750
There’s nothing wrong with his vision.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.949
The sense is intact.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.139
The problem is with his perception, at least
when it comes to recognizing faces.

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:59.370
Prosopagnosia is a good example of how sensing
and perceiving are connected, but different.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.649
Sensation is the bottom-up process by which
our senses, like vision, hearing and smell,

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.000
receive and relay outside stimuli.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.720
Perception, on the other hand, is the top-down
way our brains organize and interpret that

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.610
information and put it into context.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.550
So right now at this very moment, you’re
probably receiving light from your screen

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.870
through your eyes, which will send the data
of that sensation to your brain.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.980
Perception meanwhile is your brain telling
you that what you’re seeing is a diagram

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.980
explaining the difference between sensation
and perception, which is pretty meta.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.200
Now your brain is interpreting that light
as a talking person, whom your brain might

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.060
additionally recognize as Hank.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.060
[Intro]

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.990
We are constantly bombarded by stimuli even
though we’re only aware of what our own

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.270
senses can pick up.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.090
Like I can see and hear and feel and even
smell this Corgi, but I can’t hunt using

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.200
sonar like a bat or hear a mole tunneling
underground like an owl or see ultraviolet

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.660
and infrared light like a mantis shrimp.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.960
I probably can’t even smell half of what
you can smell.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.960
No!

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960
No!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960
We have different senses.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.190
Mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.190
Yeah.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.340
There’s a lot to sense in the world, and
not everybody needs to sense all the same

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.340
stuff.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.840
So every animal has its limitations which
we can talk about more precisely if we define

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.370
the Absolute Threshold of Sensation, the minimum
stimulation needed to register a particular

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.640
stimulus, 50% of the time.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.140
So if I play a tiny little beep in your ear
and you tell me that you hear it fifty percent

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.030
of the times that I play it, that’s your
absolute threshold of sensation.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.790
We have to use a percentage because sometimes
I'll play the beep and you’ll hear it and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.490
sometimes you won’t even though it’s the
exact same volume.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.490
Why?

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.080
Because brains are complicated.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.440
Detecting a weak sensory signal like that
beep in daily life isn’t only about the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.820
strength of the stimulus.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.130
It’s also about your psychological state;
your alertness and expectations in the moment.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.330
This has to do with Signal Detection Theory,
a model for predicting how and when a person

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.400
will detect a weak stimuli, partly based on
context.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.819
Exhausted new parents might hear their baby’s
tiniest whimper, but not even register the

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.630
bellow of a passing train.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.970
Their paranoid parent brains are so trained
on their baby, it gives their senses a sort

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.620
of boosted ability, but only in relation to
the subject of their attention.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.130
Conversely, if you’re experiencing constant
stimulation, your senses will adjust in a

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.780
process called sensory adaptation.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.569
It is the reason that I have to check and
see if my wallet is there if it’s in my

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.110
right pocket, but if I move it to my left
pocket, it feels like a big uncomfortable

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.110
lump.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.209
It’s also useful to be able to talk about
our ability to detect the difference between

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.209
two stimuli.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.240
I might go out at night and look up at the
sky and, well, I know with my objective science

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.310
brain that no two stars have the exact same
brightness, and yeah, I can tell with my eyeballs

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.640
that some stars are brighter than others,
but other stars just look exactly the same

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.640
to me.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.690
I can’t tell the difference in their brightness.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.690
Are you done?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.900
Is it time for your to go?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.879
Gimme, gimme a kiiiissss.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.280
Yes, yes.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.280
Okay.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.390
Good girl.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.069
The point at which one can tell the difference
is the difference threshold, but it’s not

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.069
linear.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.910
Like. if a tiny star is just a tiny bit brighter
than another tiny star, I can tell.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.750
But if a big star is that same tiny amount
brighter than another big star, I won’t

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.750
be able to tell the difference.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.270
This is important enough that we gave the
guy who discovered it a law.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.870
Weber’s Law says that we perceive differences
on a logarithmic, not a linear scale.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.600
It’s not the amount of change.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.680
It’s the percentage change that matters.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680
Alright.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.620
How about now we take a more in depth look
at how one of our most powerful senses works?

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.620
Vision.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.070
Your ability to see your face in the mirror
is the result of a long but lightning quick

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.660
sequence of events.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.810
Light bounces off your face and then off the
mirror and then into your eyes, which take

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.030
in all that varied energy and transforms it
into neural messages that your brain processes

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.850
and organizes into what you actually see,
which is your face.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.350
Or if you’re looking elsewhere, you could
see a coffee cup or a Corgi or a scary clown

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.550
holding a tiny cream pie.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.260
So how do we transform light waves into meaningful
information?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.130
Well, let’s start with the light itself.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.690
What we humans see as light is only a small
fraction of the full spectrum of electromagnetic

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.970
radiation that ranges from gamma to radio
waves.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.380
Now light has all kinds of fascinating characteristics
that determine how we sense it, but for the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.460
purposes of this topic, we’ll understand
light as traveling in waves.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.930
The wave’s wavelength and frequency determines
their hue, and their amplitude determines

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.180
their intensity or brightness.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.190
For instance a short wave has a high frequency.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.580
Our eyes register short wavelengths with high
frequencies as blueish colors while we see

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.420
long, low frequency wavelengths as reddish
hues.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.450
The way we register the brightness of a color,
the contrast between the orange of a sherbet

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.820
and the orange of a construction cone has
to do with the intensity or amount of energy

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.100
in a given light wave.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.320
Which as we’ve just said is determined by
its amplitude.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.820
Greater amplitude means higher intensity,
means brighter color.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.390
Someone’s just told me that sherbet doesn’t-
isn’t a word that exists.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.729
His name is Michael Aranda and he’s a dumbhead.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.850
Did you type it into the dictionary?

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.300
Type it into Google.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.020
Ask Google about sherbet.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.370
So sherbet is a thing.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.950
So after taking this light in through the
cornea and the pupil, it hits the transparent

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.580
disc behind the pupil: the lens, which focuses
the light rays into specific images, and just

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.610
as you’d expect the lens to do, it projects
these images onto the retina, the inner surface

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.150
of the eyeball that contains all the receptor
cells that begin sensing that visual information.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.259
Now your retinas don’t receive a full image
like a movie being projected onto a screen.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.930
It’s more like a bunch of pixel points of
light energy that millions of receptors translate

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.009
into neural impulses and zip back into the
brain.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.630
These retinal receptors are called rods and
cones.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.930
Our rods detect gray scale and are used in
our peripheral vision as well as to avoid

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.479
stubbing our toes in twilight conditions when
we can’t really see in color.

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.080
Our cones detect fine detail and color.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.410
Concentrated near the retina’s central focal
point called the fovea, cones function only

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.169
in well lit conditions, allowing you to appreciate
the intricacies of your grandma’s china

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.380
pattern or your uncle’s sleeve tattoo.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.530
And the human eye is terrific at seeing color.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.210
Our difference threshold for colors is so
exceptional that the average person can distinguish

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.740
a million different hues.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.919
There’s a good deal of ongoing research
around exactly how our color vision works.

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.180
But two theories help us explain some of what
we know.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.789
One model, called the Young-Helmholtz trichromatic
theory suggests that the retina houses three

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:21.710
specific color receptor cones that register
red, green and blue, and when stimulated together,

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.570
their combined power allows the eye to register
any color.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.580
Unless, of course you’re colorblind.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.570
About one in fifty people have some level
of color vision deficiency.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.610
They’re mostly dudes because the genetic
defect is sex linked.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.840
If you can’t see the Crash Course logo pop
out at you in this figure, it’s likely that

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.990
your red or green cones are missing or malfunctioning
which means you have dichromatic instead of

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.030
trichromatic vision and can’t distinguish
between shades of red and green.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.620
The other model for color vision, known as
the opponent-process theory, suggests that

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.410
we see color through processes that actually
work against each other.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.240
So some receptor cells might be stimulated
by red but inhibited by green, while others

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.700
do the opposite, and those combinations allow
us to register colors.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.759
But back to your eyeballs.

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:06.069
When stimulated, the rods and cones trigger
chemical changes that spark neural signals

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:11.259
which in turn activate the cells behind them
called bipolar cells, whose job it is to turn

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:13.520
on the neighboring ganglion cells.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.569
The long axon tails of these ganglions braid
together to form the ropy optic nerve, which

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:21.850
is what carries the neural impulses from the
eyeball to the brain.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.020
That visual information then slips through
a chain of progressively complex levels as

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.410
it travels from optic nerve, to the thalamus,
and on to the brain’s visual cortex.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.930
The visual cortex sits at the back of the
brain in the occipital lobe, where the right

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.640
cortex processes input from the left eye and
vice versa.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.669
This cortex has specialized nerve cells, called
feature detectors that respond to specific

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.480
features like shapes, angles and movements.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.700
In other words different parts of your visual
cortex are responsible for identifying different

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.810
aspects of things.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.540
A person who can’t recognize human faces
may have no trouble picking out their set

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.210
of keys from a pile on the counter.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.060
That’s because the brains object perception
occurs in a different place from its face

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.060
perception.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.959
In the case of Dr. Sacks, his condition affects
the region of the brain called the fusiform

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:07.040
gyrus, which activates in response to seeing
faces.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.220
Sacks’s face blindness is congenital, but
it may also be acquired through disease or

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.100
injury to that same region of the brain.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.990
And some cells in a region may respond to
just one type of stimulus, like posture or

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.470
movement or facial expression, while other
clusters of cells weave all that separate

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.430
information together in an instant analysis
of a situation.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.720
That clown is frowning and running at me with
a tiny cream pie.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.589
I’m putting these factors together.

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:30.930
Maybe I should get out of here.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.040
This ability to process and analyze many separate
aspects of the situation at once is called

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.279
parallel processing.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:40.250
In the case of visual processing, this means
that the brain simultaneously works on making

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:45.490
sense of form, depth, motion and color and
this is where we enter the whole world of

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.959
perception which gets complicated quickly,
and can even get downright philosophical.

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:54.540
So we’ll be exploring that in depth next
time but for now, if you were paying attention,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.060
you learned the difference between sensation
and perception, the different thresholds that

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.870
limit our senses, and some of the neurology
and biology and psychology of human vision.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.850
