00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.710
Okay, let's walk through this concept map. And this

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.380
lesson was all about complex traits, and most traits

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.650
are complex, and we learned about traits really for

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.980
the first time in lesson one. And there are

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.730
two main types of complex traits. We have polygenic,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.000
and multifactorial. Both are controlled by multiple genes, but

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
only polygenic traits don't really have an influence from

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.910
the environment, whereas multifactorial traits do. Now, among multifactorial

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.670
traits that have a genetic and environmental component,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.950
the variabilities seen among that trait can be explained

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.360
using something called heritability. Heritability is on a scale

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.240
from zero to one. And if there's a low

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.430
heritability, under 0.5, then it means that variability is

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.210
more influenced by the environment, whereas the higher heritability

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.780
means that the variation in the trait can be

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.000
explained by more of a genetic component, or by

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.040
certain alleles. Now, one way to estimate heritability is to use studies of

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.860
twins, both monozygotic and dizygotic. Now we

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.380
can use correlation in these studies. To

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.100
measure quantitative traits which vary continuously over

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.290
a range. Whereas, we would use concordance

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.950
to measure qualitative traits which vary discontinuously.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.270
Which means, unlike height, which can vary

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.150
over a range of numbers from five feet,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.290
to six feet, to seven feet. There are only

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.830
certain options, like blue eye color or brown

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.600
eye color or green eye color. So, in general,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.900
these multifactorial traits that show a range of variability, like our risk

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.270
for breast cancer, can be measured on a spectrum. And overall this is due

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.560
to incomplete penetrance of particular alleles. So this

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.800
throws a monkey wrench into the. Simple

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.210
dominant and recessive traits we learned about in

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.580
lesson eight. And then in our search for

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.240
understanding the variability among multifactorial traits we can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.030
use GWAS studies or Genome Wide Association

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.820
Studies. To help discover correlative alleles that might

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.230
influence these multifactorial traits. And we learned all

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.845
about alleles in lessons three, four and six.

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:09.830
Hopefully you enjoyed piecing all this information together if

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.540
you had some trouble why don't you go check

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.190
out the forums and see if you had any

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.270
of the same questions as some of your classmates do.
