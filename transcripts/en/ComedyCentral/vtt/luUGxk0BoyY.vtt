00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.335
- Okay Jessica, here we go.

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.638 align:start size:97% position:3%
You are a Latina woman who's
in support of the wall.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.073
How do you exist?

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.541
- My story is like this:

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.943
My dad is a coyotaje.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.879
So what a coyotaje is in
Spanish is a smuggler,

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.347
a human trafficker.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.017
I'd wake up sometimes
and there'd be a room

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.718 align:start size:84% position:16%
packed full of people
I've never met.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:19.986
- Whoa.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.521
- And we lived in
a small apartment,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.556
so it was like I had to share
space with complete strangers.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.557
- How many people?

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:25.492
- Let's say 12?

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.027
It was kind of awkward but--

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.262
- That's the word I would
use to describe waking up

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:32.766 align:start size:97% position:3%
to a room full of 12 illegal
immigrants, is awkward.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.600
- A little awkward.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.868
- Yeah.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.835
What do you think
of those people?

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.103
- I don't know these people,

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.173
I don't know who they
are, what they've done.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.609 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now that I think
about it as an adult,

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.045
I'm like, "How the hell
did my parents do that?"

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.646
- Right, that directly seems

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.515
super unsafe and
weird and creepy.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.482
- Yeah.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.950
- And maybe even a little--

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.485 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I don't like to
extreme language, awkward.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.654 align:start size:94% position:6%
But I'm sure those people,
from their perspective,

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.923
were sitting there going,
"I feel terrible for this

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.325 align:start size:84% position:16%
"little girl, I'm just
like so desperate,

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.227 align:start size:84% position:16%
"what else am I
supposed to do here?"

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.962 align:start size:88% position:13%
Do you see it like that,
or do you just say,

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.864
"It doesn't matter how
desperate you were."

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.667
- It doesn't really matter how
desperate you are, you know?

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
Because here's my
perspective on the wall.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:13.039
The difference between
my father back in the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.643
80s-90s to today is that
you have people like my dad

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.279
pushed out, and now it's
run by the cartels which

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.614
obviously is like a
whole other world.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.651 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So is that your main problem
with illegal immigration

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.885
at this point, is that it's

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.787
become co-opted by
criminal enterprise?

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.255
- That's one of the reasons.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.625 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What do you think
that Donald Trump's wall

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.329
will accomplish to
stop the cartels,

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.931
and to stop illegal immigration?

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.499 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It would actually
do a couple of things.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.367
So, what it would do is one:

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.736
we got the problem
of human trafficking.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:47.474 align:start size:97% position:3%
So we're not only getting
human trafficking from people

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.542 align:start size:97% position:3%
that just want to come here
and make a better life,

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:53.113 align:start size:94% position:6%
we're getting sex slavery,
child trafficking,

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.048 align:start size:97% position:3%
we're getting so many
different types of trafficking

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.883
that are not by their own will.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.384
- So you're saying
that the cartels

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.853 align:start size:84% position:16%
that are worth
billions of dollars,

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.554 align:start size:94% position:6%
some of the most powerful
criminal enterprises

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.022
in the world,
- In the world.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.692
- you don't think that
they can afford a ladder?

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:06.793
I mean just--

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.663
- I mean, depends
what kind of wall

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.531
we're gonna have right?

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:13.032
- I mean you can't--

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.200
- It's not just gonna be
a physical concrete wall,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.869 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm sure there's
gonna be some kind of

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.504 align:start size:97% position:3%
new technology like sensors,
- Oh some spells

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:18.938
like Jon Snow style.
- and lasers, which

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:20.406 align:start size:75% position:25%
you never know.
- Right.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.476 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I mean we're gonna need
that 'cause the Mexican people

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.678
and the people from the
South are very resilient

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:29.182
and were very, ingenious,
"we'll figure it out."

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.450
- Yeah.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.384
- So it can't be just
made out of concrete,

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:33.052
'cause we'll bust through it.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.354
- Would you prefer if
we went back to small

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.723
mom and pop coyote operations?

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.193 align:start position:0%
- No, I'd prefer that we didn't
do any coyote operations.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.027
- Let's say we have to.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:41.961
- If we have to?

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:42.896
- Yeah.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.364
Put your dad back in business?

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.798 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, I feel like I'd
trust my dad more than the--

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.433
- I trust your dad implicitly.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.935
- Aw, you're so sweet.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:51.704 align:start size:81% position:19%
- How does he feel
about the wall?

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.207 align:start position:0%
- Well he's out of that business
now, he's been out so long.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.475
- What's he do?

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.243
- He does construction
over there and mechanic.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.411
- What kind of construction?

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.245
- Probably like build house.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.079
- House?

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.014
- Houses.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:01.814
- What's a house made of?

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:02.949
- Different wood?

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.585 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The roof, and then the
- Wood.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.087 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But then the roof, and then
- Wood, wood homes.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:10.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Right, but as a
construction worker--

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.357
- Oh, you're tryna get
me there huh? (laughs)

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.559
- I'm not trying to
get you anywhere,

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:13.526 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm just-- tell me what
a house is made of.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.028
- Wood.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.930
- And, what are the flat
parts on the side called?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.764
- Wood.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:18.731
- Wood...

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.266
- A wood house.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.268
- Yeah but what's inside of a
house, what's a house made of?

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.102
- Wood floors.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:23.970
- Wood floors and...

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.804
- Wood.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:25.738
- What's on the side?

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:26.606
- I don't know, you tell me.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.440
- What's that?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.374
What's that?

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.108
Say the word wall motherfucker.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:29.943
- Cement?

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:30.877
- Wall!

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.345
Your father builds the wall.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:33.580
Well anyway, thank you
very much for being here.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.248 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Thank you, thank you.
- I appreciate you.
