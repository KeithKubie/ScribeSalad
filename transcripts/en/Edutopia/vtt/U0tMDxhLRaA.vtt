00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:13.266
&gt;&gt;There's distribution and--

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.306
&gt;&gt;Do you wanna start
on that one first?

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.076
&gt;&gt;Yeah, we'll start on distribution.

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:19.016
There's a water cycle website.

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:22.746
Check out what the
interactive water cycle is.

00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:25.426
&gt;&gt;Computer: Water on the earth
is constantly on the move.

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:27.166
It recycles over and--

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:27.796
&gt;&gt;This is good.

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:31.346
&gt;&gt;That's nice, we could do that to
introduce it, right, don't you think?

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:36.736
&gt;&gt;Katie: Teachers had created this
wealth of resources, of lesson plans,

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.696
of ideas, of different ways
to teach different concepts.

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:44.646
And we wanted to find a way where we
could share those ideas with teachers

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.966
from across our district,
and even teachers

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.136
from across the state,
and hopefully beyond.

00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:51.876
&gt;&gt;All: -- is the most
important thing--

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:53.406
&gt;&gt;Katie: So the first thing

00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:56.536
that we did is we calendared our
objectives, our state standards.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.996
The second thing that we did was,
we gave teachers a common plan time.

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:03.466
&gt;&gt;Kevin: So we said, 'How can we
take our process that's proven

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.266
and make it kinda digitized
to make it more efficient?'

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:10.596
We took this free open source
product called MindTouch

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:16.976
and we created a collaborative Wiki.

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.046
&gt;&gt;Katie: We created what
we call Beyond Textbooks,

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.896
and it's an internet application

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:27.086
where teachers can take those
wonderful ideas and they can post it

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:32.176
on a Wiki page that is dedicated to
that concept and that content area.

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:34.216
&gt;&gt;Beyond Textbooks
really helps for prep.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.946
During the week, it's
my first go to thing.

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:40.346
I know that there's always gonna be
something I can depend on on there.

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:42.336
&gt;&gt;We could probably--
maybe we could white out.

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:43.316
&gt;&gt;Yeah, perfect.

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:44.746
&gt;&gt;And have them fill it
in as they're watching.

00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:46.396
&gt;&gt;And define it too, I'm thinking.

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.616
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Not only are we able
to use that for our own teachers

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:51.976
in our districts, so that they have
a central repository they can go

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:55.706
to to find all these teacher
resources, but now we've been able

00:01:55.706 --> 00:01:58.156
to allow other school
districts to tap into it.

00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:00.256
&gt;&gt;Sarah: A lot of the kids will say,
'Miss Bates, did you create that?

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:01.266
That's so cool.'

00:02:01.636 --> 00:02:03.776
And, you know, I'll have
to say, 'Another teacher

00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:04.636
at another school made this.

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:05.416
Isn't this so neat?

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.306
You know, there's other kids who
are able to look at this too.

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:08.986
Other kids are learning the
same thing that you are.'

00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:10.856
And then they feel a
sense of connectedness

00:02:10.856 --> 00:02:11.976
to other students at
our school district.

00:02:12.686 --> 00:02:18.496
&gt;&gt;Crystal: Oh my goodness,
boys and girls.

00:02:18.496 --> 00:02:19.106
[ rhythmic clapping ]

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:19.796
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: Now they have more posts

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:21.196
than they ever dreamed
they would have.

00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:24.486
And now with all these schools
joining, we're getting lots

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:26.846
of new information from
outside of the district

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.146
that we've never had before.

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:29.796
&gt;&gt;Teaching is such
an isolated endeavor.

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:32.056
We want-- we don't want
you alone on an island.

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:33.676
We wanna let you know
there's other folks out there

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:36.906
that you can collaborate
with and discuss things with

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:41.976
and help each other, so that you
can help each others' students.
