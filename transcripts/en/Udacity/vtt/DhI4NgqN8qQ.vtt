00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.710
Professional developers,
more often than not,

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.438
will find themselves working on
pre-existing code with other developers.

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:09.420
They use Git to track changes,
compare versions, and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.540
view the commit history for complex
projects, just like you've been doing.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.840
There's one difference, though.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.120
All your repositories and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.130
changes had been made locally, which
means they only exist on your computer.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.900
And you are the only
one who can see them.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.700
Unless, if all those developers want
to take turns working on your computer,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.030
there needs to be another way for

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.010
developers to work on
repositories remotely.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.420
And there is.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.690
In this lesson, you'll learn how
to use Git and GitHub, to view and

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.480
update shared repositories.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080
You'll also practice with
a demo repository and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.640
be able to apply your skills
to your future projects.
