00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.460
BRADY HARAN: Some of you may
have seen an earlier video on

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.260
Numberphile, where I asked a
bunch of YouTubers to tell me

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.180
their favorite number.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.770
It was people like Vsource,
Veritasium, Vihart, both the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.880
Vlog Brothers, and a few people
who didn't start with a

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.190
V.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.500
CGPGREY: I'm CGPGrey.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.070
HENRY REICH: My name's Henry.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.200
I make MinutePhysics videos.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.970
DESTIN: I'm Destin.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.410
My number is 21.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.130
STEVE SPANGLER: And to a
magician, the number 13 is the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.230
best number in the
whole world.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.490
BRADY HARAN: But then I asked
all of you guys to tell me

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.790
your favorite numbers and put
them in the comments section

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.670
under the video.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.460
And loads of you did.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.030
So now what we've done is gone
through loads of those

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.680
comments and found out a few
things about YouTube's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.700
favorite number.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.740
I know it's not actually
YouTube's favorite number.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.860
But you know what I mean.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.470
First of all, I've got to say,
all the hard work's been done

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.210
by a guy from Colorado
called Dave Wiley.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.880
So huge thanks to him.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.440
And all the data and graphs and
things I'm about to show

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.130
you can be found on my blog.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.760
And I'll have a link
under the video.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.700
Now, Dave spent many long hours
using a combination of

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.640
clever programming and hard
work to harvest 6,041

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.170
comments, and extract
5,286 numbers.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.140
So what was your favorite
number?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.330
Well, you're not going to be
surprised to hear what the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.820
most commonly chosen
number was.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.050
Are you ready?

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.680
It was 7.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850
Not far behind was 3.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.900
Then we had 42, courtesy
of Douglas Adams.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.420
8.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.920
And then 13.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.080
Here's a bigger list,
with the top 25.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.850
There are those ones
I just mentioned.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.010
And as I said before, you
can see more detail

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.490
about this on the blog.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
Now, it would only take one
person choosing Graham's

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.960
number to really wreak havoc
with some forms of averages.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530
And, well, 31 of you chose
Graham's number.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.750
But the median value was 16,
meaning an equal number of

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.550
people chose numbers
below and above 16.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.710
Odd numbers proved slightly more
popular than even ones.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.470
And I find this one
interesting.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.600
4,617 of you chose integers, and
266 chose transcendental

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.840
numbers, like pi and e.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.920
And speaking of pi, it was the
most popular choice among the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.330
constants and named numbers.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.680
152 votes for pi.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.300
Next was the golden ratio;
e; pi's nemesis, tau; and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.670
Graham's number.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.000
You can also see imaginary
numbers.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.240
And infinity, if you
want to call that a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.840
number, also on the list.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.600
But I think j's punching
slightly above its weight,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.470
because of the advocacy of
Henry from MinutePhysics.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.030
If you watch the original
video, you'll know

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.040
what that's all about.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.150
HENRY REICH: Who wants to pick
the team that's going to win

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.390
all the time?

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.110
Who wants to pick the
New York Yankees?

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.415
You want to pick the underdog.

00:02:57.415 --> 00:02:58.750
You don't want to pick what
everyone else has

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.760
already gone for.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.490
BRADY HARAN: A lot of you chose

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.030
numbers relating to birthdays.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.700
Popular culture played a big
role, perhaps unsurprisingly.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.320
Now, if you want to look at
those graphs, see more stats,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.620
get more into all of this, go
and have a look at my blog.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.070
The link is underneath.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.630
And a special thanks to Dave,
who did all the hard work in

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.420
getting all that information
from the comments.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.570
And as I said, we didn't
use all the comments.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.050
We had to draw a cutoff line at
some point, so Dave could

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.030
start working.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.890
People are still adding comments
and favorite numbers

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.420
to the list now.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.640
So there are plenty
more Numberphiles

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.350
to have a look at.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.480
I think this is our 112th.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.850
And if you've watched all of
them, why not check out some

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.710
of my other channels,
about chemistry, and

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.360
physics, and astronomy?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.910
Information in the video
description.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.160
Cheers.
