00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.274
So this example that we, you know, created just

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:07.218
at random actually is it computes an interesting function. So

00:00:07.218 --> 00:00:10.830
let's, let's focus on just the case where our X1

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.266
is in the set zero, one and X2 is in

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.181
the set zero, one. So those are the only inputs

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:19.106
that we care about, combinations of those. What is Y

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:22.580
computing here? What is the name of that relationship that

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.520
function that's being computed? And so, just as a hint,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.910
there's a, there's a, there's a nice short one-word answer to this if

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.250
you can kind of plug it through and see what it is that it's computing.
