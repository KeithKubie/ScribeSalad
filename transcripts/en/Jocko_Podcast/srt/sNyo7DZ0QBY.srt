00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,950
This is Jocko podcast number
one 80 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,680
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,780
It was May, 1968

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,110
we were triple volunteers.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,910
We'd volunteered and graduated from the
army's parachute jump school at Fort

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,743
Benning, Georgia.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,320
Made it through the qualification course
at the Special Forces Training Group in

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:26,790
Fort Bragg, North Carolina,

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,320
and after attending the Fifth Special
Forces Group airborne in country training

10
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,154
program,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,410
we had volunteered to serve in
Mac v sogs command and control

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,230
during special forces
training at Fort Bragg.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Several of the Green Berets teaching
various courses told us to avoid C and c

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,080
because the duty was rough and the
special forces casualties were high in the

15
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:57,060
top secret unit. Despite
all those warnings,

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,620
Rick Howard, John McEntire, Rick Estas,

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,410
Tony Horrell, Mark Gentry,
Bob Garcia, Bobby d leathers,

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,700
myself and a few others
volunteered to serve in CNC.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,090
I had been in training or in between
training cycles since entering the army on

20
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:21,530
one December, 1966 in May,

21
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,670
1968 we were finally shifting gears
from being in a training mode to an

22
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:30,260
operational mode. None of the rumors
prepared us for what followed.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,930
You won't need those. The sergeant
major said, put away all pens,

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,200
pencils and notebooks. This
is a top secret briefing.

25
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,520
All of you have either obtained a top
secret clearance or will do so in the near

26
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,590
future or you wouldn't be here.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,850
Welcome to the command and
control detachment of the
Fifth Special Forces Group,

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,950
Airborne First Special Forces,

29
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,630
United States Army Special Operations
Augmentation study and observations group

30
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,850
or simply c and C

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,640
[inaudible].

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,910
Gentlemen before you is a
confidentiality agreement.

33
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,260
You can't tell your
girlfriend, your mother no one.

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,000
We were prohibited from writing
anything about the operation,

35
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,610
forbidden from keeping
diaries, taking photos,

36
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:18,970
making drawings or tape
recordings, notes of any sort.

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,200
The sergeant major advised us that anyone
who didn't want to sign that agreement

38
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,950
could leave. Gentlemen,

39
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,550
the sergeant major turned toward
a generic map on the wall.

40
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,590
The North Vietnamese army controls
these neutral countries and pointed to

41
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:38,760
Cambodia and Laos located to
the west of the Republican's,

42
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:43,270
south Vietnam and of course
north Vietnam. For several years.

43
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,660
The North Vietnamese army had
moved soldiers, supplies, rockets,

44
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:51,661
guns and propagandists south into the
eastern provinces of neutral Laos and

45
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:56,791
Cambodia through an ever increasing
network of trails and roads called the Ho

46
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,320
Chi Minh trail complex.

47
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,450
Now listen up real close.
The sergeant major said,

48
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,580
when you go across the fence, you will
carry no identification of any manner,

49
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,690
shape, or form. That meant
no identification papers,

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,410
no dog tags, no diaries,
no photos, no love letters,

51
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,300
and certainly no green berets.

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,300
Everyone would wear sterile fatigues
with no company in Signia, no name tags,

53
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,530
no unit designators,

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,580
no jump wings or combat
infantry men badges.

55
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,990
Why without giving anyone
a chance to respond.

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,230
He said that because Laos
and Cambodia were neutral,

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,400
the United States government could
publicly proclaim that the u s reppers

58
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:45,790
respected that neutrality. Thus,

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,760
if we were killed in Laos or
Cambodia or North Vietnam,

60
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,270
the u s government would deny
having anything to do with us.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,940
United States government would explain
that no Americans were stationed in Laos

62
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:00,490
or Cambodia, which was
technically accurate.

63
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,750
U S government had a plausible deniability
if we were killed or captured and if

64
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,050
captured, we were to
speak a foreign language.

65
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,950
Don't tell them who you are. He ordered,

66
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,270
remember technically under the terms
and conditions of the Geneva Accords,

67
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,260
your status is different than air force
and Navy pilots shot down over north

68
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:27,610
Vietnam. They're in uniform, they're
identifiable as a u s servicemen.

69
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,440
CNC Men don't fall into the
category of prisoners of war.

70
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,130
We were in effect spies,

71
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,490
although the sergeant
major never used that word.

72
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,310
He also didn't tell us that spies had no
protection under the Geneva Convention

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,050
and that we could, some are
laterally be executed if captured

74
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,960
and that right there,

75
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,530
that's some excerpts from the beginning
of a book called across the fence,

76
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,620
which is written by a special
forces soldier in Vietnam named

77
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,653
John Stryker Meyer

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,680
and in this particular case it is an
absolute honor for me to say that we have

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,460
him here with us tonight to teach us
about his experiences as a member of Mac

80
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,550
resource studies and ops re observations,

81
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,420
command group command and control teams.

82
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,543
Sir,

83
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,330
welcome, welcome to the
show. Glad to be here.

84
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,680
That's quite a welcome. You got there
Vietnam, Huh? Yes. It was quite something.

85
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,040
Absolutely. Then at the time, we
just watched the John Wayne movie,

86
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:51,000
the Green Berets on top of it
all. So, uh, we were all psyched.

87
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,620
We've seen the movie. We're ready. That's
all it takes. And had been four worn.

88
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,380
You know when you go there,
this is going to happen.

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,810
The little guy's going to come out
and ask for people to volunteer.

90
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
So we said yeah, right
now when we were done,

91
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:05,060
it happened before he shipped
us out. A little guy calls out.

92
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:09,200
We're looking for volunteers and
then a Johnny Mack goes for what?

93
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,410
Sarge can't tell you either
you're in or you're not.

94
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,800
So we raised her hands the next day we
were up in Denang for that briefing.

95
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,620
You covered.

96
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,020
Dang. How well before we get
jumped into that. Yeah. How'd you,

97
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,680
how'd you end up in the military? Where
did you grow up? You grew up in Jersey?

98
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah. Grew up in Trenton, New
Jersey. Uh, dad was a Milkman.

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,450
We opened the milk truck and the mom
was the a piano teacher. Choir organist

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,520
and, um, um,

101
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,610
after high school took me two years to
flunk out of college upon flunking out in

102
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,110
1966 I was working up at
Yosemite National Park. Yeah.

103
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:47,740
It was a garbage man farm man
up there. And, um, the book,

104
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,370
the Green Brace came out and my dad had
sent me a letter saying, hey, that's it.

105
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:54,130
You finally flunked out.
You're going to get drafted.

106
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,200
We got the notification
here from the draft board.

107
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,170
So I read the book and I said,
you know what, if I'm going to go,

108
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:02,380
if I can get in with these guys,
that'd be a great challenge.

109
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,050
And then if I can do that,
that's the way I want to go.

110
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:09,430
Because at that time with the army,
uh, eight weeks of basic training,

111
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,580
eight weeks of advanced infantry,
a month leaving, you're in Vietnam,

112
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:15,100
you can be with any
regular conventional unit.

113
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,540
And by that time there had been
enough stories about some issues, um,

114
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,740
particularly when the,

115
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:24,970
you were engaged in a regular north
Vietnamese army that Deere have some major

116
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:28,720
issues and surprises of how
strong the enemy was. So, um,

117
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,940
give me some more training. I needed it.

118
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,930
And W when you were a kid were you, did
you play sports or anything like that?

119
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,590
Yeah, um, I was never that good at it,

120
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,250
but I love baseball was
the head game and football.

121
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,660
And my dad wouldn't let me play a
football to my senior year of high school,

122
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,980
so I had one year of football.

123
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:51,910
But everything else was just like JV
little league, just loved baseball.

124
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,100
Where did he want you to play football
doing once you get hit in the head too

125
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:58,030
much? That could be, they
didn't care back then. Did they?

126
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,130
Well, you know what, I
think it was more, well,

127
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,290
in eighth grade I hurt
my knee playing soccer.

128
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,160
I said they were worried about followup
injuries here and still have your body

129
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,190
and Pete one piece when you go to
college or wherever you're going to go,

130
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,840
you know, so, um, they're very
conservative mean. No, my mom,

131
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,730
uh, she's a little farm girl from
Central Jersey and she wouldn't,

132
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,880
she was really unhappy with my
granddad gave me a cap pistol.

133
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,840
So that's the household we
grew up in. But uh, you know,

134
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:31,190
eventually we went out, learned about
weapons a little bit along the way.

135
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,860
And then of course when this came
along and we got the real deal

136
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,270
and the, the F was so 1966.

137
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:42,070
So public opinion wasn't completely
against the war yet. Wasn't in 66.

138
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,030
No, but it was beginning. You're
starting, it was starting you,

139
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:48,400
you had people doing the protest
and letters to the editor

140
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,870
and uh, some of the fringe elms
of society, like we see today.

141
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,610
There's some of those parallels,

142
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,710
but [inaudible] you going
down, how did your parents,

143
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,010
your dad was onboard obviously
cause he sent you the letter saying,

144
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,700
all right buddy, you failed. What
school did you flunk out of? Yeah,

145
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,940
try and stay college. Yeah.
And then, yeah, you just said,

146
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,490
I'm going to go to Yosemite
to be a firefighter. Well,

147
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:14,490
we had a couple of buddies of mine
that I'd been in college with,

148
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,290
helped me flunk out and we did
much, much serious drinking.

149
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,240
Just the, you know, just stupid young,

150
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:24,340
young and dumb and no idea what
you're talking about. Yeah.

151
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,310
And uh, so, uh,

152
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,680
they had a crop congressmen that got us
jobs and know [inaudible] it's a good

153
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:37,230
old Frank Thompson came
through for us. He drove across

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,860
and uh, in fact, uh, in Manhattan, Kansas,

155
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:44,430
we got hit with tornado June 12th
going across the rocky mountains.

156
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:48,300
We had snow with the back window blown
out a car. So it was just fun. Yeah.

157
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,570
In a nice experience. Again, be
drank a little bit too much there,

158
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,410
but first time, real job,
real money. And then the,

159
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,640
the reality check is just like,
these guys are amazing. If, I mean,

160
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,320
if I can get even close to this,
get the jump school, at least get a,

161
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,410
tasted this. So that was the plan.

162
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,980
How was the, uh, how was the culture
shock when you rolled into two, uh,

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,833
army bootcamp?

164
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,421
Well,

165
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:14,130
by that time I seen a couple dozen of the
movies over time from the World War II

166
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,150
movies. He kind of knew
what was coming. So, um,

167
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,240
early on I had a, uh,
a friend of mine, uh,

168
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,830
whose dad had been in the army.
He goes, look, you'd go in,

169
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,350
just remember this is like a game.

170
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,470
They want to see if they can break you
or not and you just gotta have the right

171
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:35,790
mindset. And that stuck with me. So
through basic particularly jump school,

172
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,060
they come in and shake out of bed
two o'clock in the morning for bogus

173
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:43,170
inspections just to see if they could
mess you up or brachy a little bit.

174
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,120
It's kind of like, okay,
we all noticed as a game,

175
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,350
we're all know we're training here. And
uh, so that was the way we move forward.

176
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,530
And you guys could go
right into the, you got,

177
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,490
you could go right into the Q course.
Like you could just do that pipeline.

178
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,810
It was open for you. Well,

179
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,460
because we lost so many people,

180
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,700
they came out with what at that
time we called the baby SF course.

181
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,690
So yes. And even to this day,

182
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,050
some of the guards that went to training
group with are still down at Brag now

183
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:12,250
training SF guys. And
I mean, we're biased,

184
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,670
but we feel that if you come through
basic advanced jump school and go right

185
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:21,660
into the Q course and qualify go,
now I have a prequalification,

186
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,810
then your qualification and
then you get to Bray, um,

187
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,390
that there's no bad habits.

188
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,920
Like a lot of the sergeants from the
old days when he came in and you,

189
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:36,400
you had to be an [inaudible] above
more, more timing grade, et Cetera,

190
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:40,900
et cetera. And before they be
even consider you. But, um,

191
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,250
they need a bodies. Well, the
guys, again, we're biased.

192
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:49,600
So then we get the bias out front as the
green kids that came in that went off

193
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:53,980
and did the job and
eventually it saga, um,

194
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,960
by 68, 69, the majority of the ones,
euros team leaders were young guys.

195
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,920
And there's a lot of us that
either got bored, like in my case,

196
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,920
flunked out for, just
wanted some different,

197
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:09,160
something different and
said, this is special forces.

198
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,790
And then you get the rumors and then you
finally get to that briefing where you

199
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,320
say, Hey, has a chance to volunteer.

200
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,490
They'll do you realize there's the
highest casualty operation, entire war,

201
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,110
but they forgot to tell you. They
didn't tell you that part. So did you,

202
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:26,380
did you volunteer for CNC while you were
still stateside or was that once you

203
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,300
got overseas? No, at that time,

204
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,630
the only way you get into special
forces of that program was to enlist for

205
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:34,810
airborne on assigned.

206
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,970
And then when you went through basic
Dennett advanced infantry, you, uh,

207
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,420
you would be, uh, offered
the opportunity to volunteer.

208
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,440
So during one of the classes
they would have, you know,

209
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,780
like in my case, it was a rainy day.

210
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:54,580
We're in a gym just like 607 and people
sitting on the floor and it had stage up

211
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:59,170
front with sidesteps and a cook would
come up to say, hey, the coolest mos,

212
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:02,230
you'll never go hungry with us. And
they're all fat and slop, you know,

213
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,750
just will cooks. And then other
guys couldn't for Camo, Intel, mps,

214
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:10,210
that kind of stuff. At the very end,

215
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,790
this little banty rooster
comes in and it was raining.

216
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:17,080
So every bottles had arraign jackets and
stuff on as banty rooster comes in with

217
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:20,020
a Bray, his and his fatigues are wet.

218
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,520
He came up and did a straight jump
onstage, turned around and said,

219
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,590
um, we're looking for recruits for special
forces, if you, if you're interested,

220
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:33,040
see me outside fact, anybody
interested? Well Hell, I read the book.

221
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,960
I jumped up off the floor,

222
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,760
me about three other guys and the other
700 just sat down going like, WTF,

223
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,670
you guys had gone to
nom to a couple weeks.

224
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm going to give just a little bit
more training here. It was just amazing.

225
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,030
So he jumped off the stage and that's it.

226
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:52,030
So he ran us through the psychological
tests, had to show we could swim,

227
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,900
run all that stuff. And were
you a calm guy initially?

228
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,890
Did you get trained as
a calm guy? Yes he is.

229
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,340
Do they still call 18
echo back then or knows?

230
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,210
This is pre historic gunfire
forest. The forest is the,

231
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:08,800
a SF designator. Got It. And
Oh five B is Comma Morris Code.

232
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,530
And then after training group we sent,

233
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:16,531
they sent us down for 12 weeks to Fort
Gordon for RTT cause they need a lot of

234
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:21,190
AA camps and core c and c needed
some RTT operators, radio teletype.

235
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,660
And so that was the extra training
and that's where I got busted.

236
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,500
Me and Johnny McIntyre got
busted down to private e Dukes.

237
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,740
So we landed a non words you
what'd you do to earn that?

238
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,510
Oh well we're just assholes really. I
mean these are, these are butter bars too.

239
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,510
Young, new tennis. They get this company
and here come these green berets.

240
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:44,120
We just got done all our training.
We're official green barrettes right.

241
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,090
You're the baddest man on the planet
here. I still read your buddy.

242
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,100
So what? I have my
article 15 with the CEO.

243
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:55,490
I go in and there's eight article
fifteens on the tail. He says, pick one.

244
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,970
I've picked one, scratched it up and
threw it out because you got nine. Now

245
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,180
I've got me and Maca target busted. So
as he deuce landed the knobs and he dues.

246
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,520
Yeah. So he gets it. So,

247
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,730
so it wasn't till you got to Vietnam,
correct? That you heard about CNC or, no,

248
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:17,840
you said some training instructors
do Combo, well you know here,

249
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,560
one of these little sidebars
and we go through Camo, myself,

250
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,210
McIntyre and a few of us got recycled
because you had to get up to a,

251
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,060
I forget 12 or 15 groups
[inaudible] or something. Yeah. WPS.

252
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,110
I had to with the seal team,

253
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,620
I went to a course like when the last
guys that were learning Morse code and we

254
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:40,100
had to get whatever it was, I think we
had a lower standard than that cause we,

255
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,770
cause it wouldn't just, no
one would if you want to,

256
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,350
even my officer then couldn't
give you the officer out.

257
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,980
So no, but we,

258
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,460
one of our guys who took us under
his wing was a guy named Paul Villa.

259
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,830
Rosa SFC been a non three times,

260
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,050
had a little tattoo around his neck
cut here. And uh, but he, he helped us,

261
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:04,490
he got us gone. So in our mind,
he, and we had a Weidner and Russo,

262
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,320
two other instructors for two oh five B
and so one day got to know us near the

263
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:13,310
end. It's like, hey, you guys go,
don't do it as foul to your stuff.

264
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,280
Get an AA camp, learn about the
people, Blah Blah, blah. Okay.

265
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,870
That's what it came down to.

266
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,660
So when we get that briefing
and the top secret briefing,

267
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:24,710
and one of the first things we hear about
from Scuttlebutt Paul Villa Rosa was

268
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:29,540
Kia the first Kia out of
a fob four at the time,

269
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,110
which was in January of 68 so here's one
of our living legends who got us in the

270
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,120
SF, trained us up is Kia.

271
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,320
And that had us talk
about psyops. It hit hard,

272
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,850
but you, but so that was in Vietnam
when Nate for when they now said to you,

273
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:49,610
okay, do you want to be a
part of this other program?

274
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,080
Do you want to go one more volunteer
route? And ended up here? Yes sir.

275
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,150
Of course you're like, yeah,
let's bring it, let's go

276
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,390
young and dumb. And then, so then,

277
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,920
so then you immediately got assigned,

278
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,950
they said right away to test to screen
you or anything. Any, anything else?

279
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,160
They just said, oh cool. Or you're,
you're smart enough to volunteer. Yeah,

280
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,420
I've got a vet. He had been done and uh,

281
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,230
all of us either had the top secret
or it was in process. And so,

282
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,620
uh,

283
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,620
from near literally the next day of
plaintiff Denang up north and then we had

284
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:27,440
the briefing and uh, and of course,
you know, we had a safe house.

285
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,360
The denying where does there's house 22,

286
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:33,170
that's our safe house and welcome
to special forces, you know.

287
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,300
And that was a safe house.

288
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,230
It was run by either
us or s agency or both.

289
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,660
And um, you know, you'd go
in and here's old SF guys.

290
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,530
In fact it was one of the teams just got
back from trying to rescue one of our

291
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:50,400
hatchet forces

292
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,030
and they're just sitting there to talk
about the combat and Maca and [inaudible]

293
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,580
oh shit, we're going to really die.

294
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,040
It's a good thing we
spent our money cause we,

295
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,190
cause when we were going through the a
r t t training, we had a weekend pass.

296
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:06,630
We'd go up and we were in Washington.

297
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,140
When we see the Tet offensive and
the tanks are running over Lang VA,

298
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:13,680
the AA camp at Line Bay
one oh one and we go,

299
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,210
we know we're going to die with high
degree of certainty. So we went home,

300
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,510
took our money out of bank,

301
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,010
all of our principal earns with $1,000
we ate steak dinners until he went to

302
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:23,844
Vietnam.

303
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,470
So there'll be worth this house 22 and
we're thinking about the same thing as

304
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:31,890
guy. Oh Shit. We're really into
it now. And so we'd go upstairs,

305
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,320
take showers in the showers.

306
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,720
A couple of these hookers that are
in there do Chanel would with coke,

307
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,860
Coca Cola and they're cleaning
up. Just like welcoming you here.

308
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:44,220
A couple of guys getting a load in the
back there and they're all pumping away.

309
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:48,510
It's like, oh this is really cool.
It tells but this side of Vietnam,

310
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,750
here we go. Yeah. So bring
it on. We're ready. And then,

311
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,080
and then you talked about that flight up
to the first place you got assigned to

312
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:03,660
us. It was fob one
[inaudible] we was called fob.

313
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,550
Where you guys call it a [inaudible]
generation. I guess we're,

314
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,180
I guess we're cutting
corners over here. Okay,

315
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:12,440
so you're going to fob one caught
anything to like still get your leaf to

316
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:14,720
supper? Well, there's a
whole, there's a whole lot,

317
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:18,910
there's a whole offshoot of the
word fob, which we turned into fob.

318
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,220
Have you ever heard the term
fob it before? Yes. Yes.

319
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:26,960
So someone that stays on the
fob and never goes out. Yeah.

320
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,470
So notice if rents, yeah,
well, yes, the ramps is,

321
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,250
is is what you guys called them.

322
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:36,770
And I don't know if the name
of my consulting company
is echelon front and the

323
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:40,490
reason we called the company echelon
front is because we wanted people to know

324
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:44,360
that we were the guys that were like
in the front, not the, not the ramps,

325
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,570
which is specifically taken from
David Hackworth book. Indeed.

326
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,700
Read a ton of times up. Me
Too. How was it? Yeah. Awesome.

327
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,490
And flying up into fob one. Right.
With the King B. Yeah. How was that?

328
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,500
It's just another day in
the secret war, you know,

329
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,570
because they had the old eight-thirty 30
fours and so the pilots set up high and

330
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,140
then you had the, the, the uh,

331
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,020
apartment in the back for the
passengers and there's a door gunner.

332
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,500
So when Mack attire, me and John, uh,

333
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,970
Hutchens get on the eight 34 is
the door is only on the right side.

334
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,270
So we all get in and I see
the helicopter polygon.

335
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,560
I mean the gunner gone was
the gunner Vietnamese. Yeah.

336
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,670
This is all Vietnamese [inaudible]

337
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,640
were you, were you ready
for that? Mentally? Not at
all. Okay. Cause like, yeah,

338
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,300
cause I guess one more important
note to make to everyone so that the,

339
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,830
the aircraft is being flown
by a Vietnamese pilot with
a Vietnamese copilot and

340
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:43,664
a Vietnamese gunner.

341
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,570
Yeah. It was the two 19th,

342
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,410
a special operations squadron for the
South Vietnamese Air Force and uh,

343
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,160
all pilots. And so, you know,

344
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:58,000
our training was, we are going
to work with the people there,

345
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,080
the indigenous people.

346
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,000
But when you literally climb it to
their helicopter and your life is now in

347
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:08,280
their hands, that's like, you know,
we did upgrade, you messed the code,

348
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:09,310
didn't really think about it much,

349
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,520
but it was taken us a couple
steps jumping in and going like,

350
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,960
now WTF to what's going on here now. I
thought we have, you know later he you,

351
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,870
he like we've seen in the
movie with John Wayne,

352
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:23,900
they all had you is not this old age 30
force of course keep thing, you know,

353
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,210
and that has it in the engine and
that was a be 17 a rotary engine.

354
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,990
Yeah.

355
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,120
And then we're going to get into the
factor of how those guys prove themselves

356
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:36,220
over and over and over and over again
to be just incredibly brave and not,

357
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:40,880
not just incredibly good pilots,
but just brave beyond comprehension.

358
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,970
When you were fine up there, was it,

359
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,040
was it a mellow flight
up there or was it cool?

360
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, it was a beautiful day. You
know, it's warm, like it's always hot,

361
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,500
but once you get air you get to flow.

362
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,000
You know how it is when
you were flying through.

363
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,110
And we go on over to cemeteries
and everything and we're
going down highway one,

364
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:59,380
which is heading north
from Denang up to food buy.

365
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,560
And we went past the food by airport.

366
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,360
And so we're flying north when the west
side of the highway one and you see the

367
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:10,690
airport and then there's this big
compound, which was the second, uh,

368
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:12,910
Arbonne division training cramp company.

369
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,860
And then all of a sudden it's like you're
flying north and then you're on your

370
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:20,090
side looking straight down at the rail.

371
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:22,750
You did a 90 degree flip
as it begins to turn.

372
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,810
So I seen the guy talking the door
gunner, like doing this crunchy thing,

373
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:29,200
you know,

374
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,200
could we all had our new fatigues and
you could just tell where newbies,

375
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,230
disgusting newbies. Green
asked me grays, man,

376
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,550
this guy's going to have his kick.

377
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,540
So I was kinda thinking something's
going to happen. What is it? Well,

378
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,710
Maca targets gs and
Hutchins goes the same way.

379
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,810
And I watched the guy,
so we did the, you know,

380
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,070
you look down, there's the road.

381
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,780
And the first time we'd had a helicopter
with that kind of a radical ride.

382
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,990
And so he did a one 80 then came
back and did a three 60 and landed.

383
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,040
We get off while we get off and
then a recon team gets on disappears

384
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,820
was that, was that spike team
Idaho that got on right. Okay. So,

385
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,320
so that happens the ones year as the
bracelet right there and that does,

386
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,120
you got off that bird that
brought you into fob one and,

387
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,340
and it was despite team
Idaho that got on board.

388
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,740
Yup.

389
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,740
Cleanline was the one zero and Robert
own was the one one with four indigenous

390
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,610
troops were five indigenous troops

391
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,110
and and so you start your checking
and whatever and then whatever,

392
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,400
however many hours goes by and all of a
sudden what's happening on camp when you

393
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,110
start to realize that
something's gone sideways.

394
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,750
Well, you know, I was very fortunate
and went with B training group.

395
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,880
I was a catcher and play center field,

396
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,860
a company softball team and we
went on to feed at that summer.

397
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,180
And the reason why spider parks,
Robert J spider parks was our pitcher.

398
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,450
And that little skinny
ass Texan could bring it.

399
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,210
And we still played fast pitch
none of this wimpy slow-pitch shit.

400
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,210
And so we won our games. And
uh, so I come in, we land Mack,

401
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,340
Tara and I are in Hutchinson and we're
like literally walking in front of the

402
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,211
[inaudible] office.

403
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:13,211
Just had a long road that went from
highway one east into the compound.

404
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:17,090
The training centers on the right saw new,

405
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:20,930
we hear to Vietnamese and we
hear a Cambodians on the left.

406
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,570
If you go down and we get
in and take our stuff out,

407
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,920
we're just standing looking stupid.

408
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:30,110
And then here comes spider parks and
it's like, Whoa, am I glad to see you?

409
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:32,180
Could we use it? We were
both in a company together,

410
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,060
spent many months there
training up before we came

411
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,680
and now he, but he wasn't the one
that told you what was going on with

412
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,360
no cause, right at that point it was
like, hey, and I got a spirit bunk.

413
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:45,900
If he goes in and talks to the
sergeant majors as I noticed, asshole,

414
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,820
I'm gonna bring him in with
me for a couple of days.

415
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,650
And we'll see what's going to happen.

416
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,620
Cause at that point a
spider had been on Idaho,

417
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,090
had run four or five missions with the
sergeant lane and then Lane said you're

418
00:24:57,091 --> 00:24:59,790
ready for your own team.
So he promotes them off,

419
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,590
they appoint them as a one zero.

420
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,360
And so he was in that interim time waiting
for the transition to come where he's

421
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:09,030
going to get assigned a team. And uh,

422
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,210
so he's in base team goes out.

423
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,990
So he's got a high degree of
interest in what their statuses.

424
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,940
So the Mr First Kamel check, they
gave a team. Okay. Which in our case,

425
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,020
once you're on the ground,

426
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,520
usually wait about 10 minutes to see
what's going on around you gave a team.

427
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:29,970
Okay. Then the assets leave cause
they can't stay that long anyway.

428
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,340
At least the helicopters
that they had back

429
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,450
which the team. Okay. Was a break
and squelch on the radio. Right.

430
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:37,690
Generally Joanie

431
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,523
speaking. Yeah.

432
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,610
Those either don't know. What
that is is when you break,

433
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,210
we squeeze the handset on the radio.
It made, you can tell on the other end.

434
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:49,860
Okay. They just purposefully
squeezed that microphone three times.

435
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:51,780
We know that that's the
signal for okay. Right.

436
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,240
And sometimes like early on,
the guys may say, um, Timo k.

437
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:01,590
But yeah, later on I saw it was just
Sprake break and then they say, okay,

438
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,700
then Covey will leave.

439
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,440
So they were in and then spider
came back later. He goes, hey,

440
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:11,190
we haven't heard from Idaho.
So by dinnertime, hey,

441
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,740
we haven't heard by head Oho
we haven't heard from them.

442
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:18,210
We're really concerned about what's going
on here. And then by the morning, uh,

443
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,360
they're still at that
point, not, not a word.

444
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,860
And W at what point did you guys get word?

445
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,560
I know I'm hazy on how many, what the
day or timeframe was, but eventually, uh,

446
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,230
another day decided that
had been too long. No Camo.

447
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,730
They put in what they call bright light,

448
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,450
which is a team that's goes
into either find the other team,

449
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,100
if there's casualties or down pilots.
That's what the light mission is. Word

450
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,660
Down Pilots, uh,

451
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:50,220
bring relief or just bring casualties
out or help people get the team out.

452
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:54,720
The wound, the team. So they went in a
team, new went in, everybody was wounded.

453
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:57,480
One guy was killed. This is
from the team that went in,

454
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,970
went in for the bright light. This
is, this is a Oregon, correct? Yeah,

455
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,880
with a Mike Tucker and um, and
George the troll Sternberg.

456
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,810
They went in and at one point
they were thrown a hand.

457
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:14,860
They were in a bomb crater and so the
NVA were hitting them with our weapons

458
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,780
car. 15 fire. They had
our m 26 fragment aides,

459
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,530
one of which blew off
George's jungle boot solid.

460
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:26,580
These guys are really banged up pretty
bad when they came out and when they got

461
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:26,820
out

462
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,790
and they, but they didn't find
anybody from Idaho. Correct.

463
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,780
I'm going to take it back to the
book here. This is sort of the,

464
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,680
this is, this is the
reaction back at fob one.

465
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,600
When Oregon comes back back at base,

466
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:49,140
there was a collective sigh of relief
that s t Oregon had survived the short

467
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:53,680
lived but furious but ferocious bright
light mission. The loss of Estee,

468
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,930
Idaho, however, hung over the
camp like an invisible fog.

469
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,670
Spider was the first person I
spoke to. After that bright light,

470
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,970
he went straight to the bar,
unable to believe that STI,

471
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:10,971
Idaho advantaged the complete lack of
clues added to the mystery where they

472
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,930
killed, where they wounded, captured,

473
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:17,931
and now prisoners of the NBA McEntire
voiced everyone's next thought before he

474
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:24,420
be captured by the NBA. He said he'd
kill himself with around from his car,

475
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:28,800
15 or pretend to be dead and blow up as
many NBA as possible with one final hand

476
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:29,634
grenade.

477
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:35,040
There was no doubt in my mind I'd never
be taken alive from that day forward.

478
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,720
I always carried an m 26 frag grenade
on the upper hook of my web gear.

479
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,920
It was the last one I'd used, I would use

480
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,900
welcome to c and c McIntyre muttered.

481
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,520
We had heard about s t ASP from fob for
vanishing and Laos presumed Kia on 28

482
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:00,420

504
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,533
Yeah,

505
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,010
McEntire and I didn't
personally know any of the Kiis,

506
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,210
but the sheer number in that
short period of time was sobering.

507
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,500
Most of them were veteran special forces,

508
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,560
soldiers being as green as we were,

509
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,800
made us all the more nervous but
not scared enough to quit CNC.

510
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,150
That's uh, that's,

511
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,170
that's quite the, quite
the welcome aboard.

512
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,440
Oh yeah. And then do one little
side note on spider parks. Um,

513
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,590
on that bright light when a team came
out there was so shot up because one of

514
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:22,000
the team members got decently wounded on
the distraction that they never gave a

515
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:25,600
team. Okay. Spider went
down with a King B separate.

516
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:30,601
King B got out looking to make
sure everybody was out and he took,

517
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,250
they took a tense fire that king B got
fired up and on extraction the door

518
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,190
gunner was Kia on that. So spider was um,

519
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,550
quite a mess when he got back.

520
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,103
[inaudible]

521
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,970
yeah, that's, that was such a short period
of time to be losing all those guys.

522
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,050
That's a matter of months.

523
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,380
Oh yeah. And we left several out.

524
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,490
Um, so these, uh,

525
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,940
these spike teams going in explore,

526
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,430
will you explain a little bit about
what the spike teams were like?

527
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,390
What it consisted of?

528
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,390
The spike teams was a code
name for our recon teams.

529
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,450
You had two basic elements
with CNC to hatch, a forest,

530
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,010
which could be a company platoon
or a company size operation.

531
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,160
And then the recon teams,

532
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:26,680
which we had would be two
or three Americans with a,

533
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,360
the corresponding number
of indigenous troops.

534
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,910
So initially we ran three Americans with
three south Vietnamese and the South

535
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,100
Vietnamese on our team were really
good. And then later they're so good.

536
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,460
I just ran myself

537
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,880
one on one, one with four ditch and uh,

538
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,130
we trained up heavily particularly
up to that. And then, uh,

539
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,310
um, learn who the best ones were.

540
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:57,200
And we had a couple of the guys who had
been like Hep or interpreter Soule who

541
00:32:57,201 --> 00:33:01,070
had been near date men running
missions for over two years by 68.

542
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,620
So they were highly respected. In
fact, um, only by the grace of God,

543
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,520
they warn on the team that disappeared
cause we were able to build around them.

544
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,823
Hmm.

545
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,910
You have this other part in the book here.

546
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,050
This is another sort of
welcome to fob one. During the,

547
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,150
during the first few weeks in fob one,

548
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:24,680
I attended at least three memorial
services for fallen SF comrades.

549
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,420
Services were held in the mess hall.

550
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,960
The last one I attended was for
lane and Owen's during the service,

551
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:31,940
the chaplain hesitated on Lane's name.

552
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,680
This was the last official function
honoring spite team, Idaho's members.

553
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,410
And the chaplain couldn't
remember lane's name.

554
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,790
I didn't care if he had attended a dozen
memorial services for other branches of

555
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:46,730
the military that day. I was so angry.

556
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:49,640
I never attended another
memorial service. That fob one.

557
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,190
The services soon stopped anyway
because there were so many casualties,

558
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,240
no official announcement.
They just stopped.

559
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,290
Oh yeah. You and I were
talking a little bit about, uh,

560
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,970
Ramadi when we were in
Ramadi and the, you know,

561
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,160
one thing that we started
doing immediately was going
to the memorial services

562
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:17,470
of the soldiers and marines
that were getting killed.

563
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:22,060
And that was a big wake up call
for everybody. Uh, I can tell you,

564
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,120
I don't think probably anyone in
my task unit had ever been to a,

565
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:29,961
yeah,

566
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:33,050
I had ever been to a memorial service
overseas for guys that have been killed.

567
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,810
I mean, and here we were. There
were, they were happening every day.

568
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,580
You never think about it. No.

569
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,140
Until you're there now and you guys
were having so many casualties that they

570
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:44,210
just said, okay, well we're not
even going to have them anymore.

571
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,113
Ah,

572
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,440
here's talking about some of your first
few operations that you went on and I

573
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:01,840
don't think I've talked about this,
but so these little teams that you had,

574
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,690
yeah. These little teams,

575
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,880
we're getting into helicopters
and flying over the fence,

576
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:14,881
which means over the border into Laos
and Cambodia to do reconnaissance pretty

577
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:22,210
much in the middle of
nowhere by yourselves.

578
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,703
Correct.

579
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:29,230
This type of operation in present
day is not very likely to happen.

580
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,360
The, the amount of risk that
you guys were taking. It's,

581
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,600
it's crazy to read about, like my,

582
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,000
my personal contingency that I'm
running through my head. You know,

583
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:42,660
what if this happened, what if that
happens? Right. I'm looking at these same,

584
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,610
yeah. If I was the commander
in charge, I'd say, well,

585
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:46,020
you need to come up with a better plan.

586
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,960
You need to come up with something
where we have better backup,

587
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,650
especially when the situation is because
you guys can get air support and you

588
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,500
guys used it heavily. But yeah,
as soon as the weather rolled in,

589
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,920
it was like you guys are out
there on your own. And I mean,

590
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:02,730
we'll get into some stories where
you're out on your own for sure.

591
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,400
And you know, and uh, um, is that,

592
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:12,150
that element of it is, uh, an extra
contingency. We had no artillery,

593
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,490
no traditional army or Marine Corps
support and of course no seal teams.

594
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,180
Yeah. They were busy doing this
stuff on the coast. And uh,

595
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,250
so it was quite something to go
across the fence. And in a way,

596
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,550
we're flying into the 18th century
because everything was so old,

597
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,690
the way of working. And they said
do slash and burn agriculture.

598
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,280
So you'd come in with a helicopter,

599
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,990
everybody would hear you comment and the
local people had to cooperate with the

600
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,590
NVA or because their model was work
with us or we're going to kill your dumb

601
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:50,670
ass. So, um, the game was on

602
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,900
and the purpose of most of these was
to figure out where the trails were,

603
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:58,710
what was being transported, where
the location of enemy personnel,

604
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,550
where it was bay. It was your basic
reconnaissance missions, right?

605
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,840
Well, in addition to, yes,
that was the first part.

606
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:08,500
So you always had general missions,
either a point mission a cause.

607
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:13,060
By the end of 68, they were
building fuel lines from the north.

608
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,870
They were coming down near gone
across the DMZ river in Lagos.

609
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,380
And uh, so we heard reports about that.

610
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:24,640
So that could be a point mission or a
general [inaudible] where the movement's

611
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:29,170
gone, what supplies are and
then wiretaps peel w snatch.

612
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,100
And um, those were the
other missions. And so our,

613
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,010
our south Vietnamese are
trained, we trained them up.

614
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:38,710
So back then we had stayed
Yardi cassette player, right.

615
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,450
And South could climb up a telephone pole,

616
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,230
hook it up and it covered a
wire all the way up with mud.

617
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,490
So if anybody walked past,

618
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:52,300
they would never see that
wire and we would record,

619
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,800
cause the CIA told us if you record,
even though you don't hear anything,

620
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,590
keep it on. Cause we get
this taste back to us,

621
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:03,460
we're going to amplify it a hundred times
because the north Vietnamese phones,

622
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,020
even though we're in the
cradle, there is still on and,

623
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,250
and we could record it
date amplifying that.

624
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:11,770
You hear people talking in the
background, get into off of that.

625
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,050
So those are some of the other missions.

626
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,890
So you start going on your
first few operations here. Um,

627
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,680
and by the next morning, back to
the book, by the next morning,

628
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:25,050
the weather had broken and we were
inserted smack dab in the middle of the

629
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:28,920
biggest road running north to
south through the a Shau Valley.

630
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:33,330
Am I saying that right?
Asheville Ashaw valley. Uh,

631
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,160
there was no jungle. There were hundreds

632
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,020
of bomb craters of various sizes.

633
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,130
But what surprised me the most was the
number of Punji pits that we passed.

634
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,031
Some were huge,

635
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:48,031
large enough for animals and you go
through this mission is one of your first

636
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:51,670
missions and there's
like no enemy contact.

637
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:52,930
And one of the guys who
are with walking in,

638
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,910
I looked at each other
in complete disbelief.

639
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,970
We had just walked down into the valley
of the shadow of death without seeing

640
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:02,290
one NVA soldier spider joke with me
saying that I was one of the few people in

641
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,450
the history of CNC to have a run,

642
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:08,080
a practice mission and two missions
and still have not gotten the combat

643
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:09,130
infantry men's batch,

644
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,570
the award given to soldiers who had
seen combat with the enemy or were under

645
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:14,740
direct hostile fire.

646
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,730
I kept telling myself that this was a
fluke and I remembered what the special

647
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,710
forces trainers told us at Fort Bragg,

648
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,930
the NVA and the Vietcong guerrillas will
fight when they want to know sooner.

649
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,030
So your first couple of operations, you
got pretty uh, pretty lucky. Oh yeah,

650
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:35,470
we're a slitter snails not wounded. Could
we put it in those air force sensors?

651
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:39,730
And then we had all this heres tack air
stacked up because we just figured it's

652
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:43,530
going to be a shit show. Nothing
happened. So we left out some poor guy,

653
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,270
supportive VA gunner opens
up with a 50 caliber.

654
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,340
They killed him several times man.

655
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,570
The napalm bombs cause they want to
use something on this big mission.

656
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,180
Where you uh, the other interesting
that you talk about in the book, uh,

657
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,190
I don't think it was one of yours,

658
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:03,100
but even when you guys would do
training missions over there,

659
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,740
there was like a potential for enemy
contact on your training missions.

660
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:10,240
Absolutely. Yeah. Lynne black and
his team, they ran a heavy contact.

661
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,230
In fact it was the navy to save their
dumb ass at one training mission cause

662
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:17,890
they just happen to have the frequency
to kink bees couldn't get in and they

663
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:21,590
called the navy and they came
out of a big boat. Yeah. Yeah.

664
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,390
Some kind of boat that's really long.

665
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,710
But he came in and pulled her ass out
cause they the via Kaya must've a couple

666
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,110
hundred people who were coming after and
they were just out trying to do like a

667
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:35,320
shakeout patrol. Just a little
training operation. Yeah,

668
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:37,690
just a little in country thing.
You know this is just go train,

669
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,580
get a couple of days, get out of camp,
eat some Eastland loops, have some fun.

670
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,600
Okay, well you're a,
your luck didn't hold up.

671
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,740
I guess going back to the book
and is this guys named south?

672
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:54,260
Am I saying that right? Perfect.
Okay. Bye now. So eyes were sow's.

673
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,740
Eyes were bigger than sauces. So
you've been inserted and now you,

674
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,780
you're starting to have a
situation unfold. If you
raised spider walk and said,

675
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,500
tell him I'm declaring
prairie fire emergency.

676
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,830
If he says anything about not hearing
any gunshots, tell him to fuck off.

677
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:13,480
I'll explain later. Sal's never
been wrong. Look at him as we spoke,

678
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,540
sal looked at us. Boku VC Beaucoup,

679
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:20,020
VC call King B's now he whispered.

680
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,600
And then you get on the horn. I have a
prairie fire emergency team in distress.

681
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,660
I have a prairie fire
emergency. Can anyone hear me?

682
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:33,710
I spoke in a hushed tone with my hand
cupped over the mouth. The radio.

683
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,480
I looked at my watch.

684
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:39,620
We still had more than a hundred minutes
before our next scheduled Camo check

685
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:43,580
with spider at 1600 no one responded.

686
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,161
So the,

687
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:51,161
the deal with calm windows are back in
the day when we had batteries that would

688
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,334
run out.

689
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,070
You couldn't just sit there and monitor
the radio all the time on either side.

690
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,400
[inaudible] people that were
waiting for you to call,

691
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,210
they'd be waiting and they didn't want
to, they wouldn't monitor the whole time.

692
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,260
So they would come up at certain
predesignated communication windows.

693
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:07,490
So that's what's going on here.

694
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,940
You have this bad situation
unfolding and you go to call,

695
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,880
but they're not particularly
listening in at that moment,

696
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:16,470
which is why no one's
responding. Right. Yeah.

697
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,730
I'm just explaining that to some
folks that because nowadays we have,

698
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:22,070
well first of all, we have cell
phones. When we call anyone,

699
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,750
whenever we want to make
some nice ring tone.

700
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:27,710
And you've talked to everyone through
and even when I got in we had calm

701
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,160
windows. Yeah, yeah, we, yeah, we set
up call. I was a common guy too. Sure.

702
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,440
Yet we set up calm windows
and we'll call you, you know,

703
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:35,570
whatever it was every
two hours or whatever.

704
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,900
And that's the situation
that's unfolding right here.

705
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,890
You guys still hadn't been
contacted yet. So back to the book,

706
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:47,891
I sat down with my back against the PRC
25 and opened a can of Apricot's I was

707
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:53,390
facing south and just starting
to sip the sweet apricot nectar.

708
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,190
When all hell broke loose,

709
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,030
the green jungle around us are ruptured
with definitely full automatic blasts

710
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:03,830
from NVA, AK 47 and our car fifteens
because my back was to them,

711
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:08,180
I hadn't seen Sal's warning gestures
or watched him get the jump on the

712
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:09,260
approaching NVA.

713
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,490
I remember spilling apricot
nectar on the stock of my car.

714
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:18,260
15 as I turned to my left
where the majority of the
NVA gunfire was coming from

715
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,190
foolishly,

716
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,690
my first thoughts were that I would have
to clean off the nectar off my weapon

717
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,540
and not spill the entire Canada, Africa,

718
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,750
Apricot's because I had waited
so damn long to eat them.

719
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,880
They were always a treat in the jungle.

720
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,470
But the initial seconds of the
firefight, I remember Sao and,

721
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,190
how do I say his name? Fuck
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck. Yelling.

722
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,250
Pro-Family profanities at the NBA
as they fired on full automatic,

723
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:47,060
the crack of AK 47 rounds had
never sounded louder or closer.

724
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:50,840
All I could see from our perimeter was
Gunsmoke the red and orange blasts coming

725
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:51,890
from the darker than ever.

726
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,060
Green jungle and the green AK 47
tracers flying over our heads.

727
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,480
In an odd sort of way, there was
an eerie beauty to the scene.

728
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:04,070
The funder's fury of dozens
of men blasting away at
each other on full automatic

729
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:08,540
within 10 feet of each other, killed all
other sounds. The eardrums were numb.

730
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,500
Adrenaline had slammed into
our bloodstreams and was
now screaming through our

731
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:16,820
systems. It heightened all senses.
It extended time. For example,

732
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,860
a car 15 fires, 20 rounds of five,

733
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,520
five six high velocity ammunition
in less than one and a half seconds.

734
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,530
Yet those first opening moments of combat
with the NVA seemed much longer than a

735
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:32,100
half a second. Then the second and a
half. Ordinarily when firing on full

736
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,551
automatic,

737
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:35,790
the weapon expended rounds quickly and
we trained ourselves to try and gauge

738
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:38,820
when that last round in the magazine
was slamming into the receiver.

739
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,680
Some men placed to trace around
in the magazine as a visual cue.

740
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,800
During that firefight, it seemed
as though I counted the rounds,

741
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:51,240
leaving the car 15 and knew exactly when
the 18th and last round was exiting the

742
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:53,640
weapon. Also, during
that first experience,

743
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,470
exchange fork was slightly behind me to
my right and since I was on the ground

744
00:44:58,471 --> 00:44:59,940
he was firing over my shoulder.

745
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,330
That exposed my right ear to
almost a full blast from his car.

746
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:06,810
15 the explosions were
painful, but fox saved my life.

747
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,960
I had aimed the car 15 down the hill.

748
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:14,250
Toward the largest number of AK 47 muzzle
flashes that I could see to my left.

749
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:19,050
What I hadn't seen were a handful of a
handful of NVA soldiers who broke out of

750
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:21,480
the jungle to the right
and it opened fire on us.

751
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,500
Folk realized I hadn't seen the
NVA troops coming up the hill,

752
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,560
so we got to my right and blasted
them back into the jungle.

753
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:32,760
I was so focused on the first muzzle
flashes that I completely missed the

754
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:36,060
others. If those NVA soldiers
had advanced a few more feet,

755
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,510
we would have been history and the
remainder of the team which was on my left

756
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:40,560
would have been at risk.

757
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,440
That time warp continued when everybody
ran out of bullets simultaneously.

758
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,910
The only audible,

759
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,140
the only sounds audible were the metal
clips of cold magazines being slammed

760
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:55,980
into hot machine guns and bolts
slamming shut to resume the firefight.

761
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:00,270
A key element in any firefight
is the race to reload.

762
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:04,320
After the initial
contact on seven October,

763
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,630
1968 s t Idaho won the race.

764
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,350
No one was faster than Sao heap.

765
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,510
Hip Hip folk at getting
the first magazine out,

766
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:20,100
the second one in and returning full
automatic gunfire on the enemy within

767
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:22,230
seconds. We had gained fire superiority,

768
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,830
the months and months of training on
the range under the tutelage of spider,

769
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,400
spider and Walken, all
of the live fire drills,

770
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:33,300
all the live fire races to see who
finished reloading first paid off.

771
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:39,050
All other games in life were frivolous
and irrelevant in this deadly game.

772
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,990
If you missed hitting
the target, you died.

773
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,920
So that was your first big contact, Huh?

774
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:51,500
That was it. That's a
doozy. It was absolutely.

775
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,420
And uh, it still sticks with us, you
know, you know, never forget it and fuck.

776
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:58,130
I mean later on we're back in base.

777
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,090
I was complaining cause I didn't
realize what had happened.

778
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,620
And so talking through Hap, the
interpreter said, you dumb fucker.

779
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,390
I just saved your ass.

780
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:11,360
These guys would come up the hill and
you're too stupid to realize it. Oh,

781
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,570
so you were mad at him for students who
goes to year, could my ears just fuck,

782
00:47:14,571 --> 00:47:18,380
I couldn't hear for days. It's like,

783
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:23,110
so thanks for saving my life.
I'm complaining, right? Oh,

784
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,170
classic. Oh yeah.

785
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,340
You continue on with this a little
bit as as we gained complete fire

786
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:30,040
superiority. I on the URC

787
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,780
10 beeper and started screaming into
the PRC 25 I have a fucking prairie fire

788
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:39,640
emergency. That bitter fear laced plea
was greeted with complete silence.

789
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,720
Wolken was less than subtle. Keep
yelling until you get someone.

790
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,520
A key factor in STI,

791
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:49,120
Idaho's favor that day was the small
knoll that woken has driven us to.

792
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,990
The jungle is so thick and the knoll was
so small that only a score of NVA could

793
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:57,430
rush at once. They weren't moving,
they weren't fast moving fear,

794
00:47:57,431 --> 00:48:02,350
inspiring charges that the NBA were known
for successfully executing either here

795
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:05,200
or the jungle worked against
them, but the NVA kept coming.

796
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,700
At one point woke and pulled me over,
pointed into the jungle and said, look,

797
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,750
they're stacking up dead bodies
to get to us. Hip showed me,

798
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:19,000
can you believe it? And they keep
coming. Hell, if we kill enough of them,

799
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:24,330
the body stack will be as high as we are
because the jungle area was so dark at

800
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:27,850
first. I couldn't tell exactly what I
was looking at. But woken was right.

801
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,390
The NVA were stacking bodies
and firing at us from behind.

802
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,500
They're dead comrades.

803
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,730
A lot of NVA soldiers died in those
first few minutes of hell on earth.

804
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:43,370
It's a determined enemy. Oh yeah.
And we heard about, you know,

805
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:47,660
it's one thing that do hear
about it basic and, and, uh,

806
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,050
special forces training, how
determined the enemy was.

807
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,280
And uh, to see it
firsthand dying like that,

808
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,570
I mean literally just kept coming
and we had high ground, you know,

809
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:03,140
thank God for high ground, the thick
jungle and the fact that it wasn't a,

810
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,170
a big, big area where he could mass more.

811
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,100
Did you guys didn't bring a, you guys
didn't have an automatic weapon with you.

812
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,070
You guys didn't have an AWS like
I had like a belt fed machine gun.

813
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,150
You guys wouldn't carry those?

814
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,710
No, we had a sit,

815
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,720
well nick k six man team and the teams
on the teens began carrying the a m 60 a

816
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:24,330
little later. And then, uh,

817
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,730
the RPG cause the cut the
barrel off and it had the, um,

818
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:34,230
the magazine of the, uh, circular, um,
magazine, the hills things too hard,

819
00:49:34,231 --> 00:49:38,070
250 rounds. But they were some
that did it. But in our case,

820
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,720
because we cardium 79 also to Sawed-off
m study nine or collect gave you a lot

821
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:43,710
of extra firepower.

822
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,060
Did you use the full shat rounds
with that or just the, just the

823
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,780
brown would be fleshed yet.
So if anything was close,

824
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,400
that would be the first round. And that
we need the hes, we had the rounds,

825
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,900
but no, AWS man, that's it. This I,
when I hear that story right there,

826
00:49:59,901 --> 00:50:04,160
I would do anything to have an m 60
machine gun in the situation. Absolutely.

827
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,840
The weight, the rounds and everything
else. You know, like in my case,

828
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:10,651
I carried the radio,

829
00:50:10,651 --> 00:50:15,651
always cared to radio and so between the
radio to battery and we always had 600

830
00:50:15,871 --> 00:50:16,704
plus rounds.

831
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,050
We were, um, we, I was on
my first deployment to Iraq.

832
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:25,051
I was on like one of my first patrols
in Humvees and we were out and we,

833
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,950
we ended up, we hit

834
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,660
a, uh, a little, I dunno what you
call them, the steel hedgehog.

835
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:34,830
Do you know what that is? It's
like a little obstacle, right?

836
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,570
That Americans had put out American
didn't put it out a steel hedgehog.

837
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:39,020
A little,

838
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,960
it's like a little obstacle for those of
you who don't know it's to prevent cars

839
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:43,770
from going by. Well, we were, we,

840
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,880
we made a wrong turn somewhere and we
went down a road we weren't supposed to go

841
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:50,430
to and we hit a one of those
little steel hedgehogs.

842
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,530
We didn't know what it was.
So we're driving along,
he's actually my Humvee too,

843
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:58,550
and it, it made a loud noise and sparked
and I actually thought in my mind,

844
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:00,800
I thought we just got
hit with a low order IUD,

845
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:03,560
like a low order Boothby booby
trap that didn't fully explode.

846
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,320
So we come to a stop and we all get out
of the vehicles and now we're in the

847
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:13,790
middle of Baghdad. And then
we're just surrounded by threats.

848
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,190
And in our mind we're
about to be attacked.

849
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:19,700
Cause we didn't know that we had
just ran over our old American thing.

850
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,920
But we're two still still. You
don't know. We don't know that.

851
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,340
So everyone's out there and we're
off there with our, with our m fours,

852
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,960
our little basically car fifteens.
Yeah. And you like, I felt,

853
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,020
I felt completely naked. I was
saying to myself, God, we don't like,

854
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:37,220
we need better weapons now. We had 50
cals mounted in the Humvees, but you know,

855
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:40,670
once we were mobile, I'm thinking we do.
Why don't we have, why don't we have,

856
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,300
you know, belt fed machine guns. When
I got, when we got back that night,

857
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:48,140
it wasn't just me that felt like, cause
that because that night all my guys,

858
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:51,710
they went in every Humvee, everyone put
belt fed machine guns, we mounted them,

859
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:54,230
we staged them. So anytime
we got out of those vehicles,

860
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,410
we were ready to go to war. Oh yeah, yeah.

861
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,860
Protecting a situation like that because
you could have on limits that people

862
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,700
come in nuts, but yet
that naked feeling. Yeah,

863
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:08,330
cause an a w in a situation
like this roof. That'd be nice.

864
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,090
Going back to the book
for more than an hour,

865
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:17,030
my cries and screams into the radio
and the URC 10 beeper went unanswered.

866
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:19,070
As the NBA mounted more attacks,

867
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,250
there was no need for
radio secure procedures.

868
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:24,170
Now the hide and seek
portion of the game was over.

869
00:52:24,171 --> 00:52:27,220
Now it was simply a matter of
survival. My respect for the NBA,

870
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,780
his tenacity grew that day, but the hill,

871
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,770
the jungle and our car fifteens worked
against them as they continue to pile up

872
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:38,771
or drag away more bodies with no help
around conserving ammo while keeping the

873
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:40,910
enemy back became a top priority.

874
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,940
There were no more full
automatic blasts from us.

875
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:46,550
Although we had been in
contact less than two hours.

876
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:51,470
It felt like we'd been fighting for
several as the team anxiously awaited for

877
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:55,700
help from above, the few team
members pitted against the enemy.

878
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:58,460
NVA seemed ludicrous in terms of survival.

879
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,520
The enormity of the jungle
hit home. Yes. Are you got,

880
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,880
how many rounds did you say you would
bring? We always carried 600 plus per man.

881
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:09,021
Oh No.

882
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:11,900
The Vietnamese would carry a load a load
cause they could cause they're small

883
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,370
like 98 pounds.

884
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:18,380
So I forget what their load when you guys
had 20 round magazines at this point,

885
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:21,080
right? Correct. 30 we're just a dream.

886
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:25,830
We thought about and a couple of
guys was far enough to to, to colt

887
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,670
order and they had a mail to him
later. We weren't that smart.

888
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,530
So we had the 20 rounds. But because of
the spring you only put 18 then. Yeah.

889
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,260
And so you're taking this
at some point, probably.

890
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,130
How long into this are you starting to
take point shots instead of Oh yeah.

891
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,360
You just wait until things come
out. You see it and then just one to

892
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,240
find the, I heard the Texas
drawl of spider on the radio,

893
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,620
an f four phantom jet returning from a
bombing run in northern Laos had heard

894
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:58,950
the beeper and called him. I told
spider, we had a Perry Fryer,

895
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,960
prairie fire emergency spider,

896
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:05,460
said that he had also called the judge
and the executioner who the judge and the

897
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:10,310
executioner, they were a
pilots for the one 76 days,

898
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,890
American America Division and they
would have muskets. Okay. And uh,

899
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,110
they had been assigned permanently
to CNC earlier in the year.

900
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:22,260
Navy built the camp duck and then, um,

901
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:25,920
they'd been assigned own
camp. Duck was closed down.

902
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,200
They came to food by nasty,

903
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:31,920
built a barracks that the helicopter
positive stay stand Nero wanted to cruise

904
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:32,754
them. And

905
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,770
the Marine Corps as Scarface a were
gunships that regularly hung out with us,

906
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,490
saved our bacon. So, um, the,

907
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:44,580
the judge he had, they
had these old gun shifts,

908
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,980
they could barely get off the ground,
but he had the rocket pods and then, uh,

909
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,980
the executioner was a cook
and he had the, a mini gun,

910
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:59,200
some awesome call science. Oh
yeah. Going back to the book,

911
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:02,500
thankfully we had made mirror contact
with spider earlier and he was able to

912
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:05,680
pinpoint our location in a matter
of minutes. Soon spider was over us.

913
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,000
He told me to pop smoke.

914
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:09,790
Our Sop was not to say what
color smoke grenade we would use,

915
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:14,680
assuming the NVA or monitoring our FM
frequency. I popped a yellow smoke.

916
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,360
He said he saw two yellows,

917
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:20,230
which meant the NVA were monitoring our
frequency and it guessed which color we

918
00:55:20,231 --> 00:55:23,980
would use. We change frequencies
and I popped a violet smoke.

919
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,270
A few minutes later,

920
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:30,390
the first a one e Skyraider arrived on
target and made a gun run on our eastern

921
00:55:31,691 --> 00:55:35,440
perimeter. His wing man made the
first napalm round on the south side.

922
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,480
Put your heads down. I'm
going to make you sweat.

923
00:55:37,481 --> 00:55:41,950
He said he brought it so close we could
feel the heat from the deadly jelly.

924
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:47,080
A few seconds later, we smelled burning
flesh. He dived toward us a third time.

925
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,410
The pilot drawed, it's
crispy critter time.

926
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,500
The napalm run was so close we could
feel the air being sucked away from us by

927
00:55:56,501 --> 00:55:59,050
the exploding material. If the
Jelly had landed on a person's skin,

928
00:55:59,051 --> 00:56:02,440
it would continue to burn either until
it burned itself out or as deprived of

929
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:06,820
air by mud or some other substance.
The spats arrival changed the temple,

930
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:11,080
the firefight. When the NVA heard the old
World War II plane making another run,

931
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:14,770
they charged us in D in a desperate
attempt to get as close as they could in

932
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:18,760
order to avoid the Sky Raiders,
deadly ordinance, the n NVA.

933
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,190
We're getting close to the
belt. That's horrifying.

934
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,400
So for those that don't understand
tactics of that situation,

935
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,710
you've got aircraft overhead.
They're dropping napalm.

936
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,690
So what are the v you think? Oh cool.
That'll make the NVA runaway. No, no.

937
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,930
Actually what they want to do is get
close enough to Americans that they can't

938
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:36,490
get napalm dropped on them.

939
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,080
And by 68 they had the
tacky down really tight.

940
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:43,890
They knew when the air per there
that they were safer to closer to us.

941
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:48,480
And then so they get closer. Hopefully
the wipe us out and saved their own ass.

942
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,010
That's like there's,

943
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,480
I guess there's no higher motivation than
that napalm coming at you if you stay

944
00:56:54,481 --> 00:56:55,920
where you're at. Nasty.

945
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,460
And so therefore, even at
that stage of the game,

946
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:05,120
we had to go back to four matic couple
of times cause they're charging hard.

947
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:09,290
Oh yeah. What numbers are we
talking about? No, never knew.

948
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,880
We just stacked them muscle
high. We'd never had, you know,

949
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:14,120
no time to go do a body count.
You know how that is. Yeah.

950
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,510
You're just busy killing them.

951
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,990
Yeah. I don't want to throw that
out. This all nonchalant like, yeah,

952
00:57:18,991 --> 00:57:20,340
I know how that is. No,

953
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:23,040
actually we never stacked up body
still high that we lost count.

954
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,910
Uh, going back to the book,

955
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,820
then an Air Force pilot and an
air for fandom arrived on station.

956
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,180
Tell your people the ordinance will
arrive on target before you hear me or the

957
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:38,550
rounds. The pilot said, I told
the team to put their heads down.

958
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,690
The phenomenon of having bullets tearing
into a target before anyone could hear

959
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:45,000
the aircraft with delivered
them was unbelievable.

960
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:49,290
The jungle in front of us was shredded
by the air force gun run within a minute

961
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:52,110
or two. His wing man
dropped two 500 pound bombs.

962
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:57,060
The change in aircraft staggered the NVA
for a few moments right then and there.

963
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,300
I thank the Lord for
Uncle Sam's air force.

964
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,130
The judge and the execution are
rolled in right behind the fast mover.

965
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:08,850
The judges mini gun was real close
to our perimeter. Seconds later,

966
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:13,851
the execution followed behind him firing
several 2.75 millimeter rockets while

967
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:17,970
his door gunners blasted away with their
m 60 machine guns because we hadn't

968
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,490
expended any ordinance to our west.

969
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:22,830
We ran the gunships over the
western edge of our perimeter.

970
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,080
They drew no enemy fire either.

971
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,900
About a half an hour before dusk spider
told us the king bees were on their way.

972
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,830
By that time the judge and the
executioner had refueled reloaded and were

973
00:58:34,831 --> 00:58:36,480
returning a few minutes in front of them.

974
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:42,080
Everyone in s t Idaho was dangerously
low on ambient ammo grenades and m 79

975
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:47,820
rounds. So now you've got the the
extract platforms are coming back.

976
00:58:47,821 --> 00:58:49,260
The king bees are coming to get you.

977
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,590
Before the king bees moved
in, an attempt to pick us up.

978
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,130
Spider had the judge and the executioner
make gun runs so close to our perimeter

979
00:58:58,131 --> 00:59:01,790
that we could hear the expended shell
casings from the gun ships and the 60 and

980
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:03,620
mini guns falling to Earth.

981
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,840
Through all of the excitement
I told walking and that
spider had spotted an area

982
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:12,890
west of our perimeter where king B might
be able to settle into some elephant

983
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:17,891
grass for us walking in and
hip pass the word to the team.

984
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:20,420
And we started moving toward
the area from our location.

985
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:25,040
We couldn't the elephant grass and I had
assumed we were locked into double or

986
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,170
triple canopy jungle. Again,

987
00:59:27,171 --> 00:59:31,790
the judge and executioner hammered our
eastern flank as we moved toward the

988
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:32,624
tentative LZ.

989
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:37,790
So I got x or I if you could explain
spider's position a little bit because

990
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:38,624
that's pretty,

991
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:43,810
I think it's pretty unique to Vietnam
of how those guys could be up overhead.

992
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,540
Sort of watching and, and directing.

993
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:52,140
Yeah, there, um, we called and
copied the code name was Covey, Cov,

994
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:55,230
e y [inaudible], but they would
afford air controllers basically.

995
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,830
And in the CNC mission, um,

996
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:03,840
you have an air force pilot at that
time, most of the, uh, cubbies were,

997
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:09,030
oh two says no two dead. It
pushed pool double engine. And um,

998
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,890
but they always would
have, uh, a prior one,

999
01:00:13,891 --> 01:00:18,210
zero somebody with experience who had
been on a ground who'd be with the air

1000
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:22,530
force pilot. So the pilot would fly,
then he would turn the radios over.

1001
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:26,860
So to spider or whoever the
copywriter was. So that was a,

1002
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,560
a slot. So sometimes the guys would be
wounded, they couldn't go to the field,

1003
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,590
but they could fly Covey. Got It.
So that when we're on the ground,

1004
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:37,140
we have a situation
that we're dealing with,

1005
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:41,940
then he's able to understand it as
opposed to talking to an air force pilot.

1006
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:42,860
Right.

1007
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,860
Who's just used to getting a bomb and
drop it somewhere and talk about a

1008
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:51,090
contingent liabilities that
spin off of a firefight.

1009
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,310
And so that was a spider's job.

1010
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,170
He was the cubby rider and he and pat
walkers that day were the two cubby riders

1011
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:01,140
that came in and they covers
until they got us out.

1012
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,453
Okay,

1013
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,520
man. Uh, going back to the
book, sound hip were covered.

1014
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,250
Our frantic desperate
drive to the chopper.

1015
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,460
After taking 10 minutes to
cover those last 10 yards,

1016
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:19,210
we reached the hovering King Bee, which
is about eight feet above the ground.

1017
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:24,190
Fox set up an impromptu security watch
on the western side of the road, or wash.

1018
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:27,910
A quick check of my ammunition revealed.
I was down to one frag grenade,

1019
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:32,410
one white phosphorous grade, and
two magazines of car, 15 rounds.

1020
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,700
If I didn't get extracted that
last frag grenade would be mine.

1021
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:39,190
There was no way in hell
I was going to be a pow,

1022
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:42,820
especially after all the NVA s t,

1023
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:45,970
Idaho and TAC air had
killed. If I had to use it,

1024
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,150
I take as many NVA with me as I could.

1025
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,133
Okay.

1026
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,780
That's a bold statement.

1027
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:00,520
Oh yeah. But that, I just, uh,

1028
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,820
by that time we knew about [inaudible]
is what they go on through.

1029
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:09,750
And we had lost a couple of guys and
one of them had escaped and they were,

1030
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,450
you know, we're by now we're
hearing the POW stories, right.

1031
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:17,860
So it's bad enough in country,
but for our mission, no,

1032
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:19,590
wasn't going to happen.

1033
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,350
I figured it's just to sit and just
try and take as many as we can.

1034
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:27,600
Make it a funnel contact check.

1035
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:33,750
Now you guys eventually get to where
you're loading the, the king bees,

1036
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:37,410
which again, these are Vietnamese pilots.

1037
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,530
They're old aircraft, right?

1038
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,260
Probably look like they were
held together with duct tape.

1039
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:49,190
Well, they always had oil
and fluids inside. And so
Tom, if you sat in too deep,

1040
01:02:49,191 --> 01:02:53,250
you get the fluid on your head. But, uh,

1041
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:56,330
we liked them better than the
UAE because they could take,

1042
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:00,770
they could take more hits and they
had those old B 17 engines up front,

1043
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,510
the nine rotary heads and uh, they could
take more hits us while we liked him.

1044
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:10,580
And this a cabin thin, is
that how you say captain 10 10

1045
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,550
at some point during the craziness,

1046
01:03:12,551 --> 01:03:15,220
I looked up at the pilot of
the King Bee Captain Tin.

1047
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:18,190
He was above all the
madness on the ground,

1048
01:03:18,191 --> 01:03:22,450
completely calm and collected while his
aircraft took numerous hits from enemy

1049
01:03:22,451 --> 01:03:23,170
rounds.

1050
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:27,310
What made his demeanor all
the more extraordinary was
how it contrasted with our

1051
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:31,480
adrenaline hype, frantic behavior on the
ground. We had been fighting for hours,

1052
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:33,580
we were dirty, we were sweaty,

1053
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,990
and we were exhausted and
there sat captain tin,

1054
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,620
cool as a rocky mountain breeze,

1055
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:41,020
giving the impression that
it was just another milk run.

1056
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:46,120
It was as though he said, no sweat boys.
I got all day. You just take your time,

1057
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:50,170
the stewardesses, we'll break out the
beverages after you've secured your seats.

1058
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,750
Looking at captain tin for a brief moment,

1059
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:55,780
generated a mental image I'd
carried with me forever. Frankly,

1060
01:03:55,781 --> 01:04:00,280
I never understood how one man could be
so steady under so much enemy fire and

1061
01:04:00,281 --> 01:04:01,270
keep the chopper

1062
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,303
hovering.

1063
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,220
Can you imagine does day I can't.

1064
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,200
Yeah. Yeah, and you go into
a little bit further here.

1065
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:13,760
A day or two after the extraction,

1066
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,480
Captain Tin and his crew came in
to fob one's green baret lounge.

1067
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:21,560
I went in and thanked him again in ordered
a couple of rounds of drink for all

1068
01:04:21,561 --> 01:04:24,920
the king bee pilots and crew members
speaking through an interpreter.

1069
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:29,340
Capitan said that King Bee, he
flew to extract us from echo four,

1070
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:34,260
had 48 holes in it from an enemy
ordinance sitting at the bar.

1071
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:38,010
Captain Tin appeared to be just as cool
and above the fray of daily life as he

1072
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:43,011
had on seven October 10 said that an
enemy round had torn a baseball sized hole

1073
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:47,040
through one of the rotor blades. I
asked him how he could hover so long.

1074
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:51,420
He told me that when he piloted a
helicopter, he thought only about flying.

1075
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,830
Nothing else. No enemy bullets,
weather or anything. Only flying.

1076
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:00,550
If it's my turn to die, I die.
That day wasn't my turn to die.

1077
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,190
Amazing man. He's uh, he lives in Arizona
today. Really? He's still alive. Yeah.

1078
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:13,390
Oh, we'll be having him on the podcast.
Hopefully he wants to come on here.

1079
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,130
That's awesome. Uh,

1080
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,330
and then you had one of
your guys, and this is, uh,

1081
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,590
this is like the other end of spectrum.

1082
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:28,180
Like it's hard to maintain when your
guys' Davidson had to talk to you when he

1083
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:29,320
came up and he said, Tilton,

1084
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,420
I haven't mentioned that
your nickname was tilt yet.

1085
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,530
Where'd you get that nickname?

1086
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,280
Pinballs C or you play a pinball machine,
you lose and walk away. Pissed off.

1087
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:43,030
When I lose, I shake the shit out
of, get to see my nickname and neon.

1088
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,050
Then I leave. How did the
SF guys know about that?

1089
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:47,993
How'd they learn about it from,

1090
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:52,040
oh, this goes way back. Yeah. As a kid
we used to play pinballs all the time.

1091
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,030
Little anger management
issues. Oh indeed. Yeah. Yeah.

1092
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:02,260
Uh, so Davidson, he comes up tilt. I
have to tell you something, brother.

1093
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:08,140
I don't think I can do this.
I survived Dak two brother,

1094
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:12,070
but I ain't seen, I never seen
shit like that before in my life.

1095
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:16,570
We were really lucky to survive that
mission. I don't think I can go on.

1096
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,140
I hate to desert you brother,
but I think I want off the team.

1097
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:21,390
Okay.

1098
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:25,410
Now I understood that look on
his face from the previous day.

1099
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:30,300
I told Davidson that I respected his
decision and I appreciate his frankness.

1100
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:34,980
I thought it took more
courage to be honest in camp
than to not say anything and

1101
01:06:34,981 --> 01:06:35,814
go in the field.

1102
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:40,080
A man unsure in the field could
get other team members hurt.

1103
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:45,560
He re I reiterated that he'd performed
well under fire in echo four he hadn't

1104
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:46,530
run,

1105
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:51,060
he hadn't quit and he had demonstrated
exemplary courage during the entire

1106
01:06:51,061 --> 01:06:51,894
mission.

1107
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:52,830
Okay.

1108
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:56,310
As we walked and talked, I put
my hand on the shoulder, James,

1109
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,700
you and I had walked in, did something
few men in America will ever do.

1110
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:04,020
We Survived Echo for and all
the NVA could throw at us.

1111
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:08,400
There were six of us against
hundreds of north Vietnamese finest.

1112
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,850
We will have, we will
always have a special bond,

1113
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:16,170
something no one can ever take away
from us. Thanks again for your honesty.

1114
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,550
I asked him if he wanted me to talk to
the sergeant major or did he want to do

1115
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:24,780
it because he'd only been in campus short
while he asked me if I wouldn't mind

1116
01:07:24,781 --> 01:07:29,520
speaking to the sergeant major first
I agreed and asked him what sort of

1117
01:07:29,521 --> 01:07:32,400
assignment he preferred.
I don't know brother.

1118
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:36,780
I'll need some time to get my head
straight. Did you have a note in here?

1119
01:07:36,781 --> 01:07:37,614
32 years.

1120
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:42,090
32 years later I talked to James
Davidson in New Orleans on the telephone.

1121
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,690
One of the things he said was, brother,

1122
01:07:44,691 --> 01:07:47,210
I've never been the same
since those two days in Laos.

1123
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:54,990
Oh yeah. And Guinea back to
captain tin for a moment. The uh,

1124
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,920
d pulled us out and we land at
Fubu by, I'd climb up the thank,

1125
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,640
we say, come on in, I'll get
you a drink. He goes, no,

1126
01:08:02,641 --> 01:08:05,900
my family is waiting for
me. Do Holden dinner.

1127
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,600
No one even on that extraction that
night, cause it was right at sunset.

1128
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:16,040
And so when we pulled out, it's
one of those beautiful scenes

1129
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,350
where it's dark green,

1130
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:23,030
evergreen of the jungle and all these
little sparkling lights that are red with

1131
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:26,010
the green trace was coming
up. If it hadn't been trace,

1132
01:08:26,011 --> 01:08:28,310
it was just a beautiful scene.
But then you realize, hey,

1133
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,810
that's the NVA still trying to
shoot our dumb ass down. And it was,

1134
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:36,440
but then we flew, he had itself
directly for a few minutes.

1135
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:39,350
We had the sunset because
that sweet sunset,

1136
01:08:39,351 --> 01:08:43,460
and it was at that point that sal
looked at me and gave me that look,

1137
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:48,830
this all it was. So we, we cut
the mustard. So he, you know,

1138
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:53,180
cause when I first got into camp, he
looked at me, my came into big spider,

1139
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:57,500
introduce me, and he goes, he's too tall,

1140
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,330
his feet are too big and he looks stupid.

1141
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,930
It took me five months to get,
he'd get on his good side,

1142
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:04,920
but we finally got there.

1143
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:10,010
An Echo for all you had to do was just
fend off a few hundred NVA together.

1144
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,280
Yeah. That's all it took.
And, and so Davidson,

1145
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,470
so this was a volunteer to get into the
program and you could add any points.

1146
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,120
Say, Hey,

1147
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,290
you can quit. Oh yeah, absolutely.
And no dishonor to it. Yeah.

1148
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:26,430
We always preferred because like
with Lynn black in a and chapter six,

1149
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,530
when they came up against 10,000,

1150
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:32,190
one of his Americans who was a son of a
general who's just dare to try and get

1151
01:09:32,191 --> 01:09:34,260
some metals for himself, um,

1152
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:38,340
never fired one round and anger
and prayed during the entire day,

1153
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:41,850
would his face in the ground, the
Vietnamese were ready to kill him.

1154
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,390
So that's kind of thing
that you don't want.

1155
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,050
No, no, that's, that's horrible.

1156
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:53,290
Yeah. These, these contacts
that you're getting in, I just,

1157
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,190
it's hard for me to get
my head around, you know,

1158
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,870
to be out there like alone like that with,

1159
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,780
with just really limited
support, you know?

1160
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:03,440
Oh yeah, there are days,

1161
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:08,450
but we had Uncle Sam's air force
and those door gunners are great.

1162
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,030
Yeah, absolutely. And we
had Scarface, you know,

1163
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:14,450
from marine corps and we had different
units who are attached to us and we're

1164
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:19,451
just really lucky whenever we call
dailies came and the effect of one a

1165
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:23,470
Scarface, who was Lieutenant
Colonel Robertson,

1166
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:26,420
he pulled us out several
times. He pulls out.

1167
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:29,960
The one time he got his plexiglass
shot out, the bird shot up.

1168
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:34,220
We get us back to Fubu, chewed my
s's. Every time we come to get you.

1169
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:37,880
And he chewed my ass out. We go into
the club. He still chewed my ass out.

1170
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:41,870
I bought him drinks, gone so drunk
he couldn't walk. He had to fly.

1171
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,410
He's still two of my SSA kernel.

1172
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:47,810
But you saying you're not
going to come to next ties.

1173
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:52,670
I didn't say that every time you rang
the bell they came, but oh my God,

1174
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,640
they could barely don't
ever try to the door guns.

1175
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:56,720
We get down to the helicopter.

1176
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,690
They're like the B or d
models as really early you.

1177
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,180
He saw this is true at to muskets.

1178
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,690
The door goes out to get out and kind
of lift the helicopter as they tried to

1179
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:09,200
get enough power to get off the ground
because they're just so loaded with

1180
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:13,800
ordinance. Then they jump in once
he got moving. Quite a sight.

1181
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:19,410
But they always came and the other thing
is that's weird is they didn't really

1182
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:22,620
have nighttime capability.
None of it like anyone.

1183
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:24,750
So well,

1184
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,850
it seems like nowadays night is
no factor for America. Oh, I know.

1185
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:33,060
We would have run over our mother for
one of those dogs. Oh yeah, absolutely.

1186
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:37,650
Yeah. But for you guys,
once the sun went down,

1187
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,390
it was hard to get picked up.
It was hard to call for fire.

1188
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,600
It seems that way. Oh yeah, no doubt.

1189
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,950
And so you were racing the s you were
racing the sun, you were resonate.

1190
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:49,930
You always, yeah, she's a,

1191
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:53,780
she's a key player between the
weather and the sunset. Yeah.

1192
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,190
That's the other scary
thing is, I mean, you know,

1193
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,860
this is something I usually say
early on, but I haven't said yet.

1194
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:04,260
I'm reading tiny excerpts of this book.
So if you're listening to the podcast,

1195
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:09,930
these are tiny excerpts. This is less
than five, less than 3% of this book.

1196
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,410
This book is filled with
this kind of mayhem.

1197
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,170
So you have to get the
book to appreciate it all.

1198
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:19,710
I'm just kind of hitting some
of the highlights. But yeah,

1199
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:23,880
the fact that you guys were racing against
the sun going down and how l the sun

1200
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:27,900
goes down. Okay, cool. Where do we go?
Does that mean in modern day seal teams?

1201
01:12:27,901 --> 01:12:30,420
For me that means we use a night strobe,

1202
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,710
a an an infrared strobe that the enemy
can't see instead of a marking panel.

1203
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,570
What does it mean for
you? It means another,

1204
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,840
another 12 hours out in the bush cause
you're not getting vict up and just hope

1205
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:45,540
that the uh, the lions that leave you
alone, you know, I mean to tigers,

1206
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:53,580
um, you had this one idea
or you know, your, your,

1207
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,120
the group had an idea of dropping
like a big giant daisy cutter,

1208
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,340
but a bit bombed like a
2000 pound bomb, right.

1209
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,480
In order in areas that
were so packed with,

1210
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:07,650
with vegetation that you couldn't get
in a helicopter in there and say, oh,

1211
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,420
we got an idea, we'll
just drop a big bomb.

1212
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,070
And those go land in there can get
dropped off in there. And, um, so this,

1213
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:17,070
this one operation where
you're doing that, you're,

1214
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,290
you're heading into the jungle,

1215
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:22,260
you're going to one of these things where
you dropped a 2000 pound daisy cutter

1216
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:27,540
bomb, you're repelling, you're the number
one man heading down, right? And you,

1217
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,690
you decide that like, hey,
this is an abort situation.

1218
01:13:30,691 --> 01:13:33,540
I think you saw some enemy. Oh
yeah. And so you decide, okay,

1219
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:36,150
let's abort this thing and here we're
going to the book. As I looked up,

1220
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,570
I was glad to see king who's one of
your team members climbing back into the

1221
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:40,380
king bee.

1222
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:44,610
I got on the radio and told Covey
to abort the mission as we had been

1223
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:46,800
compromised again for
a few fleeting moments.

1224
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,650
I'd considered trying to get
the team on the ground. Frankly,

1225
01:13:49,651 --> 01:13:52,680
I was sick and tired of getting shot
out of LZs and I wanted to run a mission

1226
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:57,120
instead of going through the gut wrenching
firefight, um, on the lts, which is,

1227
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,860
you know, again, I'm
skipping around in this book,

1228
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:02,100
but you would do mission after mission
where you guys would try and land and

1229
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:06,840
you'd get shot off the LZ. Oh yeah. Um,

1230
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,770
that'd be the primary, secondary,
and then the, uh, alternative.

1231
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:14,850
You try three insertions, you know,
I'm just gonna I'm just going to,

1232
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,760
for the record, if I go one insertion
and I get shout off, I'm coming home.

1233
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:25,330
I'm coming home. [inaudible]
going to go to the secondary Ed.

1234
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:26,830
If I get shot off the secondary,

1235
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,860
I'm damn sure not going to the tertiary
and think I'm getting away with it.

1236
01:14:29,861 --> 01:14:32,420
I'm going to go back and come
up with a new plan. Well,

1237
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,210
but then the king BW run out
of gas. He had to go back. Uh,

1238
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:37,773
so you're there.

1239
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:41,440
Then I saw the helmet of an NVA
soldier heading toward the bombed area.

1240
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:45,760
He was approaching from the area where
I heard the first voice from the jungle

1241
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:46,900
area in front of the helicopter,

1242
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:48,760
which was up the hill from
where I was on the ground.

1243
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,340
As soon as I saw my open
fire with my car, 15,

1244
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:54,820
suddenly the king be swerved
away, leaving me on the ground.

1245
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:57,610
Suddenly it was eerily
quiet. Then it hit me.

1246
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:01,690
I was standing in the middle of a smoking
LZ in the middle of Laos and I was

1247
01:15:01,691 --> 01:15:04,780
alone. All of a sudden I
felt small, very small.

1248
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,390
The trees that had survived
the bomb blast were tall.

1249
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,310
The jungle surrounding the LZ was
both impressive and formidable and not

1250
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:16,210
somewhere I wanted to travel by myself.
I tried to raise Covey on the radio.

1251
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,770
There was no answer from Watkins,

1252
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:21,880
even though I was the American
team leader on s t Idaho.

1253
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:24,800
I insist on carrying the radio because
I wanted to be the person calling air

1254
01:15:24,801 --> 01:15:25,930
strikes around my team.

1255
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:29,380
The Vietnamese kept us alive in the
field and I felt my end of surviving the

1256
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:33,370
jungle warfare was to direct tactically
or strikes and helicopter gunships to

1257
01:15:33,371 --> 01:15:37,990
the enemy. So the king B comes back.

1258
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:42,100
So you're there, the king B comes
back, captain two ong drafts a row,

1259
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:47,130
drops a rope down to you for you to clip
into cause it's I guess too tight for

1260
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:50,080
it to land or it doesn't wanna land
cause it's gonna take a bunch of time and

1261
01:15:50,081 --> 01:15:52,510
energy. So they just throw you
a rope yet they can't land.

1262
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:56,380
Cause there are too many tree stumps.
They didn't cut everything down.

1263
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,960
And then at that time we were just uh,

1264
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:03,490
refining the tactic of
using rope extractions.

1265
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,280
So for anyone that's listening right now,

1266
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,610
when you're refining tactics, try
and do it on training operations.

1267
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,200
Well we did, we trained with this.
We knew we had dug to 50 foot rope,

1268
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,760
a sandbag to it,

1269
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:23,020
and then it had a d ring on
the end and be 150 foot rope.

1270
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:26,230
And so they had to have a sandbag.
So we'd get through the jungle,

1271
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:30,370
get to the ground to you. And
we had developed other tactics,

1272
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:33,010
but you had a d ring on your chest.
Well, you're going to get to that. Yeah.

1273
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,070
Yeah. So here we go. I saw no NVA,

1274
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:39,760
but the weapon that was being fired
had the unmistakable bark. Renee 47.

1275
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,130
I fired another m 79
round in that direction.

1276
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:47,470
That rounds explosion must've startled
capping Tuong because he jerked the king

1277
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:51,130
be upward yanking me off the ground
before I could slip the d ring on my left

1278
01:16:51,131 --> 01:16:52,360
shoulder around the rope.

1279
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,420
That shoulder d-ring was critical
for staying in the Swiss seat.

1280
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:00,780
We had heard horror stories about the
body desecration and the NVA had performed

1281
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:03,940
on SOG, men, and I didn't
want that happening to me.

1282
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:07,690
As Toowong lifted me into the
air, I opened fire with my car,

1283
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:11,360
15 on what appeared to be a flash
coming from the hilltop area.

1284
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:16,880
So you're getting hoisted up by the
helicopter while you're returning fire and

1285
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:20,640
slipping out of your deep ring. It
didn't quite get hooked in that.

1286
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:24,110
As we got a little higher up, I was
ricocheting off the trees. I was,

1287
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,860
I was a human pinball for a few
minutes there. Tilt. There we go.

1288
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,790
Uh, then I became scared. So then
you decided to become scared. Okay,

1289
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,170
that's fine. I still
hadn't hooked my shoulder.

1290
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:41,840
D-Ring and someone fired
a few green tracers out.

1291
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:43,910
As captain Toowong started to
pull out of the target area.

1292
01:17:43,911 --> 01:17:45,020
As he started gaining speed,

1293
01:17:45,021 --> 01:17:47,420
I ricocheted off a few trees
before I cleared the jungle.

1294
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,460
Having sat in the king bees copilot seat,

1295
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:52,430
I understood why he pulled away from
the LZ before I had cleared the trees.

1296
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,020
If the chopper gets shot down,

1297
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:57,890
the mission turns into an operational
nightmare while potentially injuring or

1298
01:17:57,891 --> 01:18:00,980
killing the crew and the [inaudible]
team members aboard the ship.

1299
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:03,530
I wasn't angry with him
how he came back from me.

1300
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:07,280
I would have been stranded down here
for at least two more hours before other

1301
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:10,460
choppers with ropes could have been
able to extract me if he hadn't,

1302
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:13,280
but being dragged through the trees hurt.

1303
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,450
I was angry at myself for not getting the
damn d-ring hooked before I lifted off

1304
01:18:17,451 --> 01:18:20,900
the ground. My arms were getting
very sore. As I went to switch arms,

1305
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:25,490
I was struck by some sort of air pocket
and suddenly I was upside down at 5,000

1306
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:26,324
feet.

1307
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:33,500
My only physical link to life was the
d ring hooked into my rope seat and the

1308
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,740
hundred and 50 foot piece of
rope hanging from the helicopter.

1309
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:39,020
I twisted my body to
look up at king again.

1310
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,880
Thank God he was still
hanging out the door.

1311
01:18:40,881 --> 01:18:44,300
I signaled to get the chopper to
land. As I was giving king signs,

1312
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:48,770
I felt the rope slipping down my
FYS to my knees. At the same time,

1313
01:18:48,771 --> 01:18:51,200
my web gear was sliding from
my hips over my stomach,

1314
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:54,380
toward my neck and a matter of moments.
The Swiss seat was at my knees.

1315
01:18:54,381 --> 01:18:58,820
The only way I stopped it from moving
further was by spreading my legs.

1316
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:03,110
I felt really stupid
after all the training.

1317
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:07,190
This was going to be a dumb way to
die. As the ropes slid across my feet,

1318
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:10,550
I knew I was moments away from passing
out and there was no way I could keep my

1319
01:19:10,551 --> 01:19:12,680
legs spread. Just before the end,

1320
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:17,000
several brief scenes from my life
flashed through my mind. Dolores,

1321
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,970
my kindergarten sweetheart.
Why did she move to California?

1322
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:25,090
I saw my dad's new 1949 Chevrolet milk
truck with its dark evergreen paint with

1323
01:19:25,611 --> 01:19:28,490
the white side panels and
rich gold leaf letters,

1324
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:31,940
my red wagon from Childhood
High School Football Games,

1325
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:36,420
and to add insult to injury, I saw
the front page article in my hometown,

1326
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:38,360
part paper about my death.

1327
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:43,070
The story was below the fold
because stories about local
boys dying and nom were

1328
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,330
now commonplace.

1329
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,860
That angered me because my family
would never know where I really died.

1330
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,150
On the other hand, I didn't want
them to know how I really died.

1331
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,350
Just as I started to pass out, I
felt the ropes slip off my feet.

1332
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:59,300
My body went limp.

1333
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:04,700
I vaguely remember hitting the elephant
grass before landing hard on my back on

1334
01:20:04,701 --> 01:20:08,160
the ground. I had fallen only or 20 feet.

1335
01:20:08,161 --> 01:20:10,830
The Ella elephant grass cushion the fall.

1336
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,640
I hadn't realized that Captain Twang
had the aircraft descending during those

1337
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:17,220
last frantic moments.

1338
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,070
Oh yeah. Have those legs spread
like a New York City Hooker.

1339
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:31,140
Yeah, that's a, that's a nightmare.

1340
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:35,570
Yeah. King came and picked me up
and threw me in the, in the chopper,

1341
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,010
left all my gear there, so
my car 15 and my sod knife,

1342
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:45,000
which now would be a highly treasured
item. Still only us [inaudible].

1343
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:49,850
Oh yeah. He just pulled to open a web
gear and had to get the thing off my neck.

1344
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,790
The rucksack, the web gear
though just choked me out.

1345
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:56,600
He pulled it off and just picked me up
and threw me in the helicopter and there

1346
01:20:56,890 --> 01:21:00,440
I was really happy to feel my head
bounce off that metal floor. It hurt,

1347
01:21:00,441 --> 01:21:01,670
but it a happy hurt.

1348
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:08,220
Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Again,
if you have to get this book,

1349
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:11,100
cause that's, I'm, I'm trying
to pick like some good stories,

1350
01:21:11,101 --> 01:21:14,380
but these are just the
kind of ridiculous, uh,

1351
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:19,380
things that are going on just another
day and a saw just another day in SOG

1352
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:24,240
getting hung upside down. 5,000 feet
above enemy territory by a d ring.

1353
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:29,820
Um, another one here,

1354
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:34,290
you guys got some bad weather,
you're got no support overhead.

1355
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,290
That's another thing people
need to understand is when you,

1356
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:42,390
because of where you guys were located
at a pretty good distance away from the

1357
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,960
bases, if there was no aircraft overhead,

1358
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:49,170
then you wouldn't be able to
communicate with anyone because they,

1359
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:51,600
you'd lose line of sight. Did
you guys carry ever Curie,

1360
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,700
HF radios to try and make long distance?

1361
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,660
We had VHS for UHF. He
had to earn 10 was that,

1362
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:01,340
and but um, at nights
during the day to Rizza,

1363
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,770
there was always an airborne
command aircraft up.

1364
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,670
So at the daytime was Hillsboro code.

1365
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:12,740
At night it was moonbeam. So they would
check in with us on our frequency.

1366
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:16,670
So you would, no matter what, you'd have
some level of comps. Okay, that's good.

1367
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:17,820
So because of the,

1368
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:22,770
uh, we knew the NVA, a RDF radio
direction finder was really good.

1369
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:27,110
There were, there were sharp on that. So
when they would check in with us again,

1370
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,700
if we just

1371
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,510
click, click [inaudible] no discussion.

1372
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,330
And for those of you that don't know that,

1373
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:34,070
that's direct radio direction finding.

1374
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,860
So if you sit there and talk on the
radio for a long period of time,

1375
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,030
the enemy can actually capture
those, those transmissions.

1376
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,120
They try and get when they use multiple
stations and they can tell what

1377
01:22:44,121 --> 01:22:46,370
direction they're coming from and they
can triangulate where you're at and they

1378
01:22:46,371 --> 01:22:50,840
can come and get you. So for
this particular one, you guys,

1379
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,940
or the weather's bad,
so you don't have any,

1380
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:56,820
you don't have any actual
direct support overhead. The,

1381
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,240
the NVA had been chasing,
this is the one where you got,

1382
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:02,000
you tried to set up an ambush and
then they told you don't do it.

1383
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,950
I know we had to add was
set up. We had been at,

1384
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:06,110
but then they told you you
don't the ambush, right,

1385
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,000
don't execute it because we were had
visions of we get the Po dubby could the

1386
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:10,691
nut day if you,

1387
01:23:10,691 --> 01:23:15,250
we kept a live p o w five day
rnr anywhere in the world,

1388
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,800
a hundred dollars bonus. I was like, man,

1389
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:22,150
we're talking about where the
and plans, Hawaii or Australia.

1390
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:26,530
We hadn't quite decided and as spider
came back over and I gave them the cobe,

1391
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:27,191
we got appealed.

1392
01:23:27,191 --> 01:23:31,720
W we'll be back at the primary LZ
in one hour and that's what he said.

1393
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,710
Don't move. But you hadn't initiated,
you didn't have the [inaudible] yet.

1394
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:37,840
You were waiting. Oh yeah, they're
walking up and down to chill.

1395
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,140
It was just a matter of time
before you were going to,

1396
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:43,840
well we spring your ambush and this is
one of those deals where we violated all

1397
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:48,730
the rules of recon. Normally we go
10 and 10 walk, 10 minutes, pause,

1398
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:52,810
tend to hear the jungle, let the
jungle see how it's gone. Wellness one,

1399
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,960
because we've had so much
trouble trying to get in.

1400
01:23:56,410 --> 01:24:00,460
They had a slash and burn areas. There
were underneath the jungle canopy.

1401
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:04,660
I divided the team. We had an eight
man team this time before in each side.

1402
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:09,490
And I said, we're going to go up
this hill until we get to an area,

1403
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,200
to a trail or whatever. And we didn't
stop. We went really hard. Maybe 20, 30,

1404
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:17,770
40 minutes. I forget now.
We came up to the big trail,

1405
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:21,280
we crossed it one at a
time, covered our tracks,

1406
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:26,020
got things set up south prep. The wiretap
had a perfect damn voice. You know,

1407
01:24:26,021 --> 01:24:29,920
we had trained, uh, Lynn
Black had developed the, uh,

1408
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:31,503
the, uh,

1409
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:36,880
ambush kill zone so that we'd have
clay Morris that would go across,

1410
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:42,040
but in a center dubious six foot
area that there'd be no shrapnel.

1411
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,390
But we had, he, he practiced
on himself as C four.

1412
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:50,230
So he finally figured out at the certain
length what a stick a c four was.

1413
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:54,550
We in knock yourself out,
but he did literally, I know
this is another, oh yeah.

1414
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:57,640
So anyway, that's our input
book. But we had it all set up.

1415
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:00,670
So we had the c four to
knock out one person,

1416
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:06,130
Morris to kill everybody else with sides
perimeters and one in the rear just in

1417
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:09,430
case he came down to mountain on us
and their diddy bopped in up and down a

1418
01:25:09,431 --> 01:25:13,300
trail. We could, we could have had
officers there walking down to trail.

1419
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:16,900
Nobody's that upset because
we had gone so far, so fast,

1420
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,640
violating all of our rules that the pupil
up to hill didn't know what was going

1421
01:25:21,641 --> 01:25:26,560
on down the hill. And then spider
says don't move. I was like,

1422
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:30,240
that's when things got really
ugly. And, and when he,

1423
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,040
what was the reason why he told you
guys don't do it because the weather was

1424
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:33,874
moving in. Oh yeah.

1425
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:38,590
Because we'd only been in the ground
two or three hours and whether sock did,

1426
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:42,790
he's at 10,000 feet. I can't even
see the mountain, let alone CNL z.

1427
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,240
So he's saying, look, we're not going
to be to get you out of there right now.

1428
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:50,620
Just don't do whatever you're going to
do and, and, and Oh yeah, break contact.

1429
01:25:50,621 --> 01:25:53,770
Get away. Yeah. So you guys
are kind of kind of on the run,

1430
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:57,220
you gotta start moving out of there.
Right. And so about that time up the hill,

1431
01:25:57,221 --> 01:26:01,900
we hear the tanks and other
trucks starting up their
engines and all of a sudden

1432
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:05,690
the activity on the goes
from casual to frantic.

1433
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,420
Now everybody's two or three
guys, they all got their eks.

1434
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:09,880
What do you think clued him in that,

1435
01:26:09,881 --> 01:26:14,270
that you were there while they heard
come in. By then we could hear the dogs.

1436
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:18,500
They have some dogs that were deaf back
on Elz so they had started looking for

1437
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:22,970
us officially. So when you
hear dogs, tanks, trucks,

1438
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:25,010
and a bunch of people with AK 47

1439
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,580
yeah. How do you feel about that?

1440
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:37,280
Um, the pucker factor is minus
zero. It really is. It's like,

1441
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,390
oh my God.

1442
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:43,450
And you know that you've got no form of
extraction. Correct. The weird thing is,

1443
01:26:43,451 --> 01:26:47,100
I guess, and, and having worked in the
jungle a little bit, you know, I've,

1444
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:50,050
I spent some time in the jungle in
South American, that's Southeast Asia.

1445
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:54,550
Like I will say this, the jungle is huge,
right? Yeah. And you could see where,

1446
01:26:54,551 --> 01:26:57,920
okay, I can get, I can make
myself scarce at least. Oh yeah.

1447
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:01,390
Until you remember they got
trackers right. And they got dogs,

1448
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,093
lots of them.

1449
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:09,020
So you're in that situation here.
Yeah, another Thursday night.

1450
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:12,950
But we did get the wiretap though.
Sal HUD, Rhonda Rock once for an hour.

1451
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:15,680
So once you won, you guys had to take
the tape recorder with you though.

1452
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,330
Oh yeah. We carried the
little, um, you know,

1453
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,750
you think about a traditional
early old cassette recorder,

1454
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:28,140
so it had like two or four the chip of
a Ed d batteries in and then we had the

1455
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:31,270
um,

1456
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:36,270
microphone that had a little plugging
in and then sal would run up the tree or

1457
01:27:36,491 --> 01:27:38,950
fly up the telephone pole that his case.

1458
01:27:38,951 --> 01:27:41,980
He had gone up when he came back
down and put mud on the whole thing.

1459
01:27:41,981 --> 01:27:45,840
So anybody going by on a trail looked
at the pole, they wouldn't see it.

1460
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,270
And so we ran it for over an hour.

1461
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:53,260
We had run that wire tap and
it flipped the cassette over,

1462
01:27:53,261 --> 01:27:55,330
cause that was state of the
art at the time. Your sets.

1463
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:01,650
All right. So yes, we want to break
this up down. Now you guys are moving,

1464
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,520
pull back all to clay Morris to see
for which direction did you head,

1465
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:06,850
um,

1466
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:10,360
did you go away from where you inserted
or did you go back to where you were?

1467
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:13,940
Um, we went, no, we went away from it. Um,

1468
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,810
if I'm facing Elz we
went to our left. Got It.

1469
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:20,150
And we went and we had to go
way across that big trail again.

1470
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,410
But this time we had to cross it in
between enemy come up and down the truck.

1471
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:29,240
It went past us and so took us a while
to get back across the big trail.

1472
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:33,180
Cause this trail, again,
this is layoffs by the way.

1473
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,150
This is t Minh trail, the Coachee,

1474
01:28:35,151 --> 01:28:38,180
Montreal spiders that even
when he could see the jungle,

1475
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:41,260
he couldn't see that road.
And the road was big enough.

1476
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:44,450
You could drive tanks down
in side-by-side. It's huge.

1477
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:49,400
It would be the equivalent
of a highway 78. Okay.

1478
01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:53,630
Or 50 to two lanes. So tank side by side,

1479
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,810
but it's conveniently covered by
the covered by the judge vegetation.

1480
01:28:57,230 --> 01:29:00,710
So it took us a while to get across
the road. Then we went to the left,

1481
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:01,980
then we finally came

1482
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,920
to a little stream bed and went up
that stream because now it's dark,

1483
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:09,060
but now we hear more dogs.
The activity on the trail,

1484
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:14,550
another couple of trucks go by and all
this noise we noted looking at eventually

1485
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,920
your hold up in your, your you, you stop.

1486
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,550
Right and an a on a way up
that stream we put out pepper.

1487
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,150
We put out a mace to throw off the dogs,

1488
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:27,120
locked the doors and we had our team
go up and down these little cars.

1489
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:32,040
It was about 10 foot tall bank.
We're in this little creek or stream,

1490
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,580
had water in it and so we
was trying to lose the dogs.

1491
01:29:35,581 --> 01:29:40,050
We knew to come in at night and now it's
dark and we contin up that stream for

1492
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:40,884
awhile. Call.

1493
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:44,940
Wanted to get as far away from them as
we could because salad climbed a tree and

1494
01:29:44,941 --> 01:29:46,950
said their common. He pointed out,

1495
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,890
he said he told Hep there were
hundreds of them coming with lights.

1496
01:29:49,891 --> 01:29:52,980
They all had lanterns and
the dogs were getting closer,

1497
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:56,850
sweet canteen up, death's dream
for another hour or two at night,

1498
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:59,860
doing still going out and
putting down a amazed me finest.

1499
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:04,050
We're not to the bank on the
right, set up our Ron for tonight,

1500
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:09,051
rest overnight and I'm facing the bank
and the other seven guys are around and

1501
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:14,690
so again, we hear the
dogs, the people, so we,

1502
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:16,950
they're in the rof maybe
two or three hours.

1503
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,500
Two guys come up the the up the stream
with a lantern burning brightly.

1504
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:23,230
They pass,

1505
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:28,230
this lantern goes out and they come
back as they come pack hep costs

1506
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:32,460
and then they stopped and I think
that's where you're going next.

1507
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,600
Well yeah, that's here. Here it is.

1508
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:39,080
One of the NVA and the creek started
crawling up the embankment toward me.

1509
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:43,270
I was still facing the creek.
The NVA soldier was good.

1510
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:47,110
He only moved when the wind
stirred the trees for a moment.

1511
01:30:47,111 --> 01:30:51,280
My faults drifted to summer camp in New
Hampshire years earlier when we played

1512
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,800
capture the flag on those
clear summer nights.

1513
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:58,600
My favorite trick was to use the woods
to get as close to the flag as possible.

1514
01:30:58,990 --> 01:30:59,261
Now,

1515
01:30:59,261 --> 01:31:03,610
my mind was racing a hundred miles per
hour and I realized I was the flag and he

1516
01:31:03,611 --> 01:31:04,444
was closing in.

1517
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:10,480
He was too close for me to tell
anyone on my team. The jungle.

1518
01:31:10,481 --> 01:31:11,980
That night seemed deadly quiet,

1519
01:31:11,981 --> 01:31:16,210
except of course when the wind stirred
as the NVA soldier crawled closer,

1520
01:31:16,211 --> 01:31:21,211
I remembered thinking that my heart was
beating so damn loud that hoe men could

1521
01:31:22,181 --> 01:31:23,140
hear it in Hanoi.

1522
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:29,320
I flashed back to my childhood when we
used to play hide and go seek on West

1523
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,430
Paul Avenue in Trenton, New Jersey.

1524
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:34,530
One of my favorite hiding places was
behind the hedges and Mr and Mrs Amigos,

1525
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,373
Front Yard.

1526
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:40,710
I remember worrying that Teddy's a Broski
or John Wayne Austin or worse Barbara

1527
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:44,590
Poynton would find me because they
could hear my heart beating so loud.

1528
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:48,580
I tried to comfort myself by thinking
that because I had not been running in

1529
01:31:48,581 --> 01:31:51,220
recent hours, my heartbeat
shouldn't be too loud. Yet.

1530
01:31:51,221 --> 01:31:56,080
My heart sounded like a kettle drum
during Beethoven's ninth no matter the NVA

1531
01:31:56,170 --> 01:32:00,070
soldier kept moving up the embankment.
I was very impressed with his

1532
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,903
stealth.

1533
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:05,080
I could barely hear him than it
happened during one windy moment.

1534
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:10,330
I heard movement very close to
me. It was only a slight sound,

1535
01:32:10,331 --> 01:32:13,390
but a sound. Nonetheless,
before the wind stopped,

1536
01:32:13,391 --> 01:32:16,420
the NVA soldier touch the soul of my size.

1537
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:19,990
10 of our army issue, jungle boot.

1538
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:24,100
I heard a slight gasp of surprise
from him. At that moment.

1539
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:28,270
I had a death grip on my car. 15
I had it on single shot a car,

1540
01:32:28,271 --> 01:32:32,050
15 on full automatic sound's
much different from the
bark of an AK 47 on full

1541
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:36,430
automatic. If I had to shoot it would
be single shots for a millisecond.

1542
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:40,500
I wondered if my left foot was far enough
to the left so that when I fired it,

1543
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:43,600
I wouldn't shoot myself. Time stood still.

1544
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,880
My pucker factor was minus zero.

1545
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:50,230
After a few of the longest seconds
of my life, the wind stirred,

1546
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:55,240
but there was no movement. He remained
still after what seemed like an eternity.

1547
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:59,500
The wind stirred again and I heard
the NVA moved backwards just slightly.

1548
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,710
He was so cool. I knew he was facing me.

1549
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,780
I wondered why I couldn't hear his heart.

1550
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:08,350
The jungle around us remained pitch black

1551
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:14,590
as my twilight zone moment. Yeah,

1552
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:18,880
yeah, yeah. That's uh, that's,

1553
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:21,580
that's craziness. And
you think he was, um,

1554
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:24,820
you think he just decided like this,

1555
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,700
this guy's probably got the
drop on me and I want to live.

1556
01:33:27,701 --> 01:33:28,840
What do you think he decided?

1557
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,240
I believe so because if there had
been any other movement at all,

1558
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:33,080
okay.

1559
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:36,320
Then he would've been on the receiving
end of the five, five, six [inaudible].

1560
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:41,450
So he did, he did. He made a tactical
decision to live. Yeah. Thank God. Yeah.

1561
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:41,930
Cause they know.

1562
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:45,170
Then obviously once you started shooting
the gay gigs up and you would have

1563
01:33:45,171 --> 01:33:45,920
been,

1564
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,950
people would be on your trail clothes and
had it happen to me I thought was if I

1565
01:33:48,951 --> 01:33:50,270
just did one single shop,

1566
01:33:50,271 --> 01:33:54,220
could the muscle flash would light up
where he was and then I was hoping to,

1567
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:58,640
would take no more than a second shot
to finish him off so that the jungle,

1568
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:02,340
they would hear gunshots but they
weren't, wouldn't be quite sure

1569
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,000
where was this?

1570
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,990
And people that haven't spent time
out in the woods or out in the jungle,

1571
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:13,570
it can get completely pitch black in
the jungle. Is that what this was?

1572
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:14,940
Was this just like complete, like he's,

1573
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:17,620
you could barely even could you
see his face at all? Nothing.

1574
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,220
I mean he probably knew he was there.

1575
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:22,470
You sit there and you could feel your
hand in front of your nose when you shake

1576
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,920
it, move it back and forth. You
can feel the breeze from your hand,

1577
01:34:24,921 --> 01:34:27,950
but you can't see it. Yeah. So for
those of you that haven't been in this,

1578
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:32,900
it's when you get up at nighttime and
then it's a cloudy night and then you're

1579
01:34:32,901 --> 01:34:35,180
in triple canopy jungle.
There is no light,

1580
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:39,350
non can't see anything and
that's what this situation is.

1581
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:41,283
Absolutely.

1582
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:44,200
Well luckily you,

1583
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:48,200
you got out of that and then you guys
continue on going back to the book.

1584
01:34:48,201 --> 01:34:51,290
By nine o'clock we had
located the LZ and secured it.

1585
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:55,790
The clear area had several feet of grass
on it and the ground was at an angle

1586
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:57,980
because it was on the
side of mountain. Again,

1587
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,820
we heard dogs, our
tactical scenario stunk.

1588
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:05,690
We are in a relatively open area on a
hillside with minimal cover and the NBA

1589
01:35:05,691 --> 01:35:09,800
had the high ground times
seem to be our worst enemy.

1590
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:14,750
Although having limited air, air resources
didn't improve our mood. Finally,

1591
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:18,650
the other team was extracted without
taking firs further casualties and spider

1592
01:35:18,651 --> 01:35:22,250
was overhead taking ground
fire from the north of the LZ.

1593
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:27,400
He told the trustee and reliable marine
corps you h one B gunships with the

1594
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:28,670
radio call sign.

1595
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:33,860
Scarface were seconds away as we
heard the chopper's approaching us.

1596
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:37,580
One of the toe poppers that Salud
Sun had planted, exploded, exploded.

1597
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:41,420
So you guys were doing that too. You
guys don't set booby traps on them,

1598
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,450
on the enemy and set
claymores on them, right?

1599
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:50,280
Which would really piss
them off. Oh yeah. Hey,

1600
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:55,260
try to ruin their parade. Yeah, we knew
the NVA were going to be hopping mad.

1601
01:35:55,261 --> 01:35:57,210
Now that's a gentle way of putting it.

1602
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:01,380
Spider was able to vector the Scarface
gun shipped to our location quickly.

1603
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:04,110
There was no time for orientations.
We popped smoke and seconds later,

1604
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:07,410
the first Scarface chopper
roared in the jungle north of us,

1605
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,850
or ruptured with small arms fire.

1606
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:11,450
The second Scarface chopper
roared in so close it.

1607
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,710
I could see the facial
expressions on the door gunners.

1608
01:36:13,711 --> 01:36:18,150
He blasted the area north of our LZ with
his m 60 machine gun. Both Scarface,

1609
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,340
both Scarface aircraft took several hits.

1610
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:22,500
When the sky Raiders made their passes.

1611
01:36:22,501 --> 01:36:26,640
They also took hits from small arms
fire that sounded like AK 47 during the

1612
01:36:26,641 --> 01:36:30,780
second gun run, sal blew a claim
or in the face of an NVA scout.

1613
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:32,800
Sal then flew a second claim. Warn,

1614
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:37,740
returned to the LZ reporting more NVA
troops right behind him. And you guys,

1615
01:36:37,741 --> 01:36:42,300
this is another interesting sop. We
would do this to carry claymores.

1616
01:36:42,301 --> 01:36:45,660
I didn't do that. I, Oh, let me rephrase
that. We got trained to do this,

1617
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,850
you know, you know
jungle situation, right?

1618
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,420
You guys would make claymores with like
five second and ten second fuses on

1619
01:36:51,421 --> 01:36:54,990
them, right? Boom. Put 'em down, pull
the fuse so you run. Yeah, and run.

1620
01:36:59,370 --> 01:37:03,930
I never used one of those and I'm
very thankful that I did not. Yeah.

1621
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:07,440
Uh, yeah.

1622
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:11,730
Apparently the combination of air
assets and our 40 millimeter barrage has

1623
01:37:11,731 --> 01:37:15,570
slowed the NVA troops long enough for
the extraction ships to come to the LZ.

1624
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:18,990
Spider told me that the a hundred first
airborne division was going to extract

1625
01:37:18,991 --> 01:37:19,290
us.

1626
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:23,940
The Marine Corps gunships would make one
more gun run and for the first time s t

1627
01:37:23,941 --> 01:37:27,570
Idaho slicks from the a hundred first
airborne division would follow right

1628
01:37:27,571 --> 01:37:29,790
behind them and get as
close to the LZ as possible.

1629
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,330
We were used to the King B's and knew
most of the pilots on a first name basis.

1630
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,160
The a hundred first pilots were good too.

1631
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:38,250
But because this was our first time
with a a hundred first airborne division

1632
01:37:38,251 --> 01:37:38,910
slicks,

1633
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:42,750
I told Sean King that they had to be the
first people to approach the ship and

1634
01:37:42,751 --> 01:37:47,130
that they had to alert the young door
gunners that fought that five of our men

1635
01:37:47,131 --> 01:37:50,310
were Vietnamese. That's a crazy
thing to think about. Oh, absolutely.

1636
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:52,890
So you got the head. We had
horrible results when they would,

1637
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:56,100
when you weren't careful.
And again, you know, young

1638
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:01,070
door gunners for sure coming to country
and if they're not briefed properly, uh,

1639
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:05,430
cause our guys dressed irregularly, they
had, not that they will look like NVA,

1640
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:06,930
but they're, they weren't Americans.

1641
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,550
We've had team members that lost
Vietnamese anyway. Yeah. Tragically

1642
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:15,360
we, we, uh, when Roger Hayden was on, he
told a story of the same thing he had.

1643
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:16,560
They had, they had, uh,

1644
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:20,940
Vietnamese scouts and they were doing
a hammer and anvil operation with a

1645
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,250
platoon they hadn't worked with
before that was new in country.

1646
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,790
And there was some mix up puts
on the insertion and you know,

1647
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:30,800
just some minor mistakes that
compounded. And anyways, these guys, the,

1648
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:34,920
the Advil portion was waiting and the
first guys that came out of the tree line

1649
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:39,090
were there Vietnamese scouts. Yeah.
And they got, they got lit up.

1650
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:44,970
Um, you know, we were in,
in, when I was in Ramadi,

1651
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,980
we, I, you know,

1652
01:38:46,981 --> 01:38:50,260
you see like pictures of seals with like
beards and all that and look at cool

1653
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:53,160
like w everyone shaved and everyone,

1654
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,700
we weren't regular uniforms with what
the army and what the Marine Corps war.

1655
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:59,940
Why? Because that exact reason, you know,

1656
01:38:59,941 --> 01:39:04,941
you swing around a corner and you've got
a 19 year old on a 50 cal and he sees

1657
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:08,580
some guy with a beard and a gun.
There's a chance you're getting shot.

1658
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:11,940
Whereas an American, you know, cause
cause the jihadists would have beards,

1659
01:39:11,941 --> 01:39:13,890
right. And in Ramadi,

1660
01:39:13,891 --> 01:39:18,000
we just didn't [inaudible] everything we
could do to identify ourselves as good

1661
01:39:18,001 --> 01:39:19,840
guys did. And

1662
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:24,030
do you hottest could have everything
from [inaudible] for spar beans to a case

1663
01:39:24,031 --> 01:39:25,290
you didn't know what they'd be carrying.

1664
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:29,490
And they also want least we knew
our guys had a case or does.

1665
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:31,860
Yeah. Well, the other thing was they were,

1666
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:36,540
they wore paramilitary outfits
because they wore cammies,

1667
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:41,520
they wore body armor sometime. They
wore helmets sometimes. So yeah,

1668
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:44,280
that's amazing that you guys
that and also you had the,

1669
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,460
you had the Cognizant's to
say, Hey, wait a second,

1670
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:49,230
we've never worked with
these helicopters before.

1671
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:52,780
Get out there and tell them we've got
some Vietnamese folks coming their way.

1672
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:52,880
Right.

1673
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,500
With AK 40 sevens. Yeah.

1674
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:57,350
They were pissed because when king
went down for the first chopper,

1675
01:39:57,890 --> 01:40:00,350
nobody else followed and I said,
you make sure you tell them.

1676
01:40:00,351 --> 01:40:03,020
Then you give me the greenlight
devil, a little people.

1677
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:07,370
And then Bubba and I got on the second
extract and there's two of the things on

1678
01:40:07,371 --> 01:40:10,280
that mission. Yeah. King
had experimental pump,

1679
01:40:10,281 --> 01:40:14,360
m 79 which she carried. It
helped five rounds and we,

1680
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:17,830
we thought we'd try it once, but
he carried it for five date. Well,

1681
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:22,790
the whole five days we were on the
ground and so at that LZ it worked and

1682
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:26,270
imagine five m 79 rails
go off the 40 millimeters.

1683
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:30,380
Then also one night was the night
that the Russians flew over us.

1684
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:35,800
And did a resupply and we were begging
for moon beam to show up because somebody

1685
01:40:36,231 --> 01:40:37,190
on a Russian ass,

1686
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,490
but the whole side of mountain ended up
as a weirdest damn thing we ever saw.

1687
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:44,720
So that was like a signaling device for
it. That was signaling devices that the,

1688
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:49,150
that the Vietnamese were using to have
the Russians drop the resupply in there.

1689
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:49,240
They were

1690
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:53,400
doing resupplies to the Vietnamese.
What language did you speak? Uh,

1691
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:55,090
my foreign language is English.

1692
01:40:57,130 --> 01:41:00,750
So they pushed this through and they
weighed the way the language required

1693
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:05,350
because by 68, they knew we had
SF had a strong interpreter corps.

1694
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:08,830
Got It. Like Ma, like Hap,
he spoke four languages.

1695
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:13,480
He had been educated in France and he
cracked up my English and he was a smart

1696
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:16,060
ass on top of it. A little fucker.

1697
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:23,210
But he was already a little guy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Awesome. Uh,

1698
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:26,990
going back to the book, the extraction
was slick and quick win. Um,

1699
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:30,140
as we pulled out of the automatic
l, as we pulled out of the LZ,

1700
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:31,730
the slick took several hits.

1701
01:41:31,731 --> 01:41:34,880
Three of us returned full
automatic fire from our car.

1702
01:41:34,881 --> 01:41:39,410
Fifteens I threw a white phosphorus
grenade as the area north of the LZ,

1703
01:41:39,411 --> 01:41:43,290
lit up with dozens of muzzle
flashes from AK 47 and [inaudible].

1704
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:47,210
The green traces from the
AK 47 is appeared as though
they were coming between

1705
01:41:47,211 --> 01:41:51,380
my legs. I was told later that as
our slick pulled out of the LZ,

1706
01:41:51,381 --> 01:41:56,381
the iscar phase gunships laid
down a full fuselage fuselage of,

1707
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:57,950
of suppressing fire.

1708
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,220
The lead marine aircraft piloted
by Lieutenant Colonel Robinson,

1709
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:05,840
had the plexiglass windshield blown
out of the aircraft. In addition,

1710
01:42:05,841 --> 01:42:09,950
his chopper and the second gunship
had taken more than a dozen hits.

1711
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:15,260
And yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's
the uh, colonel that you were saying,

1712
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:19,670
yes, he was riding you and riding you.
And by the way, you tell it the book,

1713
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:23,170
colonel, does this mean the next time
we're in trouble, we call for Scarface.

1714
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:27,800
You won't respond to the bell. Hell No.
Robinson responded. I never said that.

1715
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:30,440
It just pisses me off when
my aircraft gets shot up.

1716
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:34,400
Parts are hard to come by
and I'd rather be flying

1717
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:39,310
fearless. And

1718
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:43,110
you know you continue on
here. I went back to my room,

1719
01:42:43,111 --> 01:42:44,820
so this is after that crazy operation.

1720
01:42:44,821 --> 01:42:48,150
You barely make it out for the
hundredth time that you've you,

1721
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,160
you dance in death's face.

1722
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,450
I went back to my room and picked up a
news magazine with a picture on the front

1723
01:42:54,451 --> 01:42:59,160
page about the biggest latest anti
war protests, state side, insane.

1724
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:00,600
Who side were they on?

1725
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:05,220
They hadn't seen Charlie like
s t Idaho had they never,

1726
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:10,470
they never asked Sao hip and other
Vietnamese men on my team what they felt

1727
01:43:10,471 --> 01:43:11,304
about the war.

1728
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:15,990
What a day as three refuse to pull us
out when we were ready for extraction.

1729
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,300
Then as three question my integrity,

1730
01:43:18,301 --> 01:43:22,440
despite the fact that we were only
minutes away from fighting NVA in close

1731
01:43:22,441 --> 01:43:24,990
quarters battle had not Scarface.

1732
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:29,850
The [inaudible] and the a hundred first
airborne slicks defended us from the sky

1733
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:34,200
and there are people back in the states
protesting this war. I shook my head,

1734
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,650
dropped my rucksack and web gear,
picked up a small ammo belt,

1735
01:43:37,651 --> 01:43:39,480
holding several magazines of five, five,

1736
01:43:39,481 --> 01:43:42,240
six ammo and went to the
s three to get a jeep.

1737
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:44,700
The dentist was only a
short drive up the road,

1738
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:48,600
but I kept my trusty car 15 nearby.
Anyway, I went to the dentist,

1739
01:43:48,601 --> 01:43:53,240
got my tooth pulled and drew
knew and PRC 25 batteries.

1740
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:54,440
Okay.

1741
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:58,250
And th the reason I read all that is to
read this line right here. The next day,

1742
01:43:58,670 --> 01:44:03,590
the next day s D Idaho
got shot out of five LZs

1743
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:05,770
yeah, once in the morning
and once in the afternoon.

1744
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:12,070
And by that time when we got
inserted on that Missionar uh,

1745
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:16,390
we had gone a couple of days, the same
thing in the morning gets shot out.

1746
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:20,950
And on one of those
missions on the primary L Z,

1747
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:25,330
when a King p was going in south,

1748
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:29,980
saw a wire across the LZ.

1749
01:44:29,981 --> 01:44:34,240
Now how does sal even see a wire in
a helicopter? When we're going in?

1750
01:44:34,990 --> 01:44:37,900
He saw it. He told the
door gunner. Fortunately,

1751
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:42,970
the Vietnamese thing was quick and they
were able to swerve away and a one came

1752
01:44:42,971 --> 01:44:45,670
in and hit that with a 500 pound bomb.

1753
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:49,780
They knew we were coming
and we had been compromised.

1754
01:44:49,781 --> 01:44:53,440
We never realized how seriously we'd
been compromised and that was proof,

1755
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:58,220
hard proof and where our guys are.

1756
01:44:58,221 --> 01:45:01,040
So Tara switched a lot of
Vietnamese around [inaudible]

1757
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,630
you, so your, your guys were, some of
your Vietnamese were getting burned out.

1758
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,290
Oh sure.

1759
01:45:05,290 --> 01:45:08,950
Cause you know you, you do that
long flight, go out through the LG,

1760
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:13,420
then you go in and get shot out, shot
out, shot out, fly back, get lunch,

1761
01:45:13,810 --> 01:45:15,280
get a new target. Sometimes they just say,

1762
01:45:15,281 --> 01:45:17,860
here's your next target cubby
would know where it would be.

1763
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:20,590
We wouldn't even have any kind
of background or anything on it.

1764
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:24,640
Just they wanted to get a team on the
ground, go back and then we did it again.

1765
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:25,600
Bam, Bam, Bam.

1766
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:31,880
And sometimes we u n so you're
Vietnamese sometimes say, all right,

1767
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:34,430
I've had enough of the school. Is your
main, who is your main outlet guy?

1768
01:45:34,431 --> 01:45:37,190
South by counterpart. He was
the assistant team leader.

1769
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:38,690
He is the Vietnamese team leader.

1770
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:41,470
And who was the other American
that would be with you? Uh,

1771
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:43,790
at that point in time
was Bubba John's shore.

1772
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:48,740
He came on the team in a November where
I became to one zero at the end of

1773
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:51,680
October. And these guys were all freaked
out too. Cause you were like young.

1774
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:55,610
Oh yeah. And what were you, uh,
what was your rank at that time?

1775
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:01,730
Well, by then I'd been promoted to e
four cause I remember on that promoted,

1776
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:02,564
yeah,

1777
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:07,190
he deuce in camp with the built for
e eight or a nine on a recon team.

1778
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:10,370
So spider probably got me
promoted back to PFC said,

1779
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:13,740
now roll up your sleeves so people think
you're a sergeant. We don't want the,

1780
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:15,530
no, you're just a dumb ass PFC

1781
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,280
instead of by October

1782
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:24,880
we able to add a Spec for, and then, uh,

1783
01:46:25,210 --> 01:46:27,460
when Jim wanted off the
team, which we respected.

1784
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,500
And to this day I respected it. Never,

1785
01:46:29,501 --> 01:46:33,470
I'll never say a word against them
on that. Um, then Bubba came on.

1786
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:37,690
So in November, that's when
Babou uh, he was the a one one.

1787
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:40,360
And then on that one
mission king came along.

1788
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:44,170
I just felt funny about I want a little
extra firepower and he wanted to try

1789
01:46:44,171 --> 01:46:46,960
that. Uh, that pump and 79 yeah. Yeah.

1790
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:49,520
Why not just going off on a
mission to test that then? Yeah,

1791
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:57,120
we had that a, they sent us some
thermobaric grenades for the m 79.

1792
01:46:57,890 --> 01:47:00,300
Oh really? Yeah. And,

1793
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:05,350
and then they called a week later and
said, hey, did you guys get a Cha?

1794
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:06,181
It was actually leaf,

1795
01:47:06,181 --> 01:47:10,500
I think life dumped it up like an entire
load out of them on one operation.

1796
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:13,410
And anyways, they, they call
back, they say, hey, did you guys,

1797
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:14,970
we're wondering if you
get a chance to use those.

1798
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:19,110
They're motto Thera Boma grenade yet.
Like where we use the mall, send more,

1799
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:22,710
here's the feedback. Do not wait.

1800
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,810
Well, yeah. And also as it, speaking of
that, as, as one of our side missions,

1801
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:32,130
we always carried eldest
son or Italian green,

1802
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:36,450
which would be enemy ordinance.
Dr Took slowed in her face.

1803
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:40,920
So when we would go along a trail like
wood, that pictorial, we crossed it.

1804
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:44,700
We'd go down and dump a little
the Ammo, so if anybody was CDMO,

1805
01:47:44,701 --> 01:47:48,380
they'd pick it up and then
if we ever came across cache,

1806
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:53,040
which only happened a few times, we
would put the bad ammo in their cache,

1807
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:56,490
so they use it for psyops. Then
it would blow up on her face.

1808
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,480
I was a good psyops thing
when they were, there was,

1809
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:04,200
there was another mission where you
talk about where they'd killed the

1810
01:48:04,201 --> 01:48:05,670
Americans, but they let the, Oh,

1811
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:08,640
you have the Vietnamese girl
that was there January 1st 69

1812
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:14,370
all right. Speaking of holiday
season, here's Christmas Day 1968

1813
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:21,270
you're inserted into like some
really tall elephant grass.

1814
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:26,220
There's NVA around you. Going back to
the book due to the elephant grass,

1815
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:28,950
both in terms of the noise we
were making and how muffled,

1816
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:30,180
how it muffled our other sounds,

1817
01:48:30,181 --> 01:48:32,820
we couldn't tell exactly how many
NVA were moving or if they were,

1818
01:48:32,821 --> 01:48:36,990
even NVA black said, I smell smoke.

1819
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:40,500
Either our hand grenades or
the NVA has started fires.

1820
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:41,690
Okay.

1821
01:48:41,690 --> 01:48:46,100
Things are really heating up on the
LZ. Literally, I radioed spider.

1822
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:50,210
I told them we were surrounded and had
fires on two sides of our perimeter.

1823
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:54,170
I told him that if the king
bees didn't get in here asap,

1824
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:58,910
s t Idaho would be engaged in
fighting fires as well as fire fights.

1825
01:49:01,810 --> 01:49:05,350
Were you really making these punny
jokes in the middle of these situations?

1826
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:10,780
Sometimes you have to laugh
to keep from crying. Uh,

1827
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,040
they're starting more fires.

1828
01:49:12,041 --> 01:49:15,070
Bubba said by now the noise from
the fire forces to raise our voices.

1829
01:49:15,071 --> 01:49:17,200
When we were talking to each other,
the smoke was getting thicker.

1830
01:49:17,201 --> 01:49:18,040
I began to sweat.

1831
01:49:18,041 --> 01:49:21,010
We threw a few more hand-grenades down
the hill to force the NVA to keep their

1832
01:49:21,011 --> 01:49:24,760
heads down the southern fire.
So just so everyone understands,

1833
01:49:24,761 --> 01:49:29,410
this is what's actually happening. You're
in elephant grass, dry elephant grass,

1834
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,040
and it's burning on multiple
sides of your position,

1835
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:36,790
which is 12 to 15 feet
tall. The elephant grass.

1836
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:40,960
So your visibility is like five
feet. Three feet. Yeah. Minimal.

1837
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:48,190
And it's filled with smoke. Yeah.
And getting worse. However we wish

1838
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,500
you a merry Christmas. Yeah.

1839
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:54,040
The southern fire's intensity grew by
the second and continued to move up the

1840
01:49:54,041 --> 01:49:56,980
slope towards us and around to the east.

1841
01:49:56,981 --> 01:49:59,860
There was fire or fires to
the north and northeast,

1842
01:49:59,861 --> 01:50:02,370
but they weren't heading toward Estee,

1843
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:07,360
Idaho with the speed of the southern
flames. By now, the smoke was so thick,

1844
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:11,080
I had my green cravat over my
face and pulled up over my nose,

1845
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,760
burning embers from the south,

1846
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:15,730
kicked up and flew over our
small jaggedy perimeter,

1847
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:20,940
dumping ashes sot and small burning sparks
on the elephant grass and on us only

1848
01:50:21,011 --> 01:50:24,340
hip and Twan wore hats.
Several of US soaked our hair.

1849
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:29,470
Black told me that the NVA weren't far
behind the flames to wanted report and

1850
01:50:29,471 --> 01:50:33,310
seeing images of short distance behind
the flames to the south and southeast.

1851
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,370
Captain Twang knew exactly where we were.

1852
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:39,670
As he brought the age 34
down the canyon toward us.

1853
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:41,740
Seconds became ours.

1854
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:45,940
My vision was clearer than ever and
I was a co cutely aware of the smoke,

1855
01:50:45,941 --> 01:50:49,360
fire popping sounds and enemy gunfire.

1856
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:53,840
I stood on the western edge of the
perimeter waving a colored panel skyward,

1857
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:58,570
trying to catch the pilots. I, the age
34 continued its slow motion descent.

1858
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:03,010
All I saw was the bottom of the chopper
with the front of the strut sticking out

1859
01:51:03,011 --> 01:51:07,360
to the right and left coming down like
a giant praying mantis. The rotor wash,

1860
01:51:07,361 --> 01:51:09,040
when the king bee began to hit us.

1861
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:12,700
Finally the chopper's nose turned slightly
to the left and I could see captain

1862
01:51:12,701 --> 01:51:15,910
twang seeing his face,
seeing him sitting in there.

1863
01:51:15,911 --> 01:51:19,390
So commonly in the pilot seat
made my confidence surge.

1864
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:24,620
We would survive. And then
you guys, you guys, you know,

1865
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:27,260
get, get around, get it under control.

1866
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:30,350
Well under control as you can and you
start boarding the tropper chopper as the

1867
01:51:30,351 --> 01:51:33,350
last man board of the chopper, I signal
to the door gunner to exit the area.

1868
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:35,820
As I sat in the door, I sat in the doors,

1869
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,110
Twang lifted the king be straight up
for several feet before heading south.

1870
01:51:39,111 --> 01:51:42,710
As we pulled away from the knoll
fire, swept up the hill and Gulf.

1871
01:51:42,711 --> 01:51:46,070
The area where we had been
standing moments earlier.

1872
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,133
Oh yeah.

1873
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,780
Every Christmas I, Paula's

1874
01:51:56,540 --> 01:52:01,400
Captain Twang roared down the canyon.
We had chugged only a short while ago.

1875
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:05,150
I radioed spider and gave
him a team. Okay. Once again,

1876
01:52:05,151 --> 01:52:08,600
s t Idaho entered that
magical post-mission moment.

1877
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:12,800
The adrenaline was still flowing.
We had survived another target.

1878
01:52:14,210 --> 01:52:16,550
Every breath of air was sweeter.

1879
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:17,760
Yeah.

1880
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,630
There was no thought of Christmas
mom or holiday presence.

1881
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,670
Our gift was to be alive

1882
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:34,240
that Christmas 1968 would haunt me
sporadically for more than 25 years.

1883
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:37,270
After a while, I was able
to stop sitting upright,

1884
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:39,460
sweating with fear when
the nightmares hit.

1885
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:42,700
It's been almost 10 years
since I had that dream.

1886
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:46,100
But every Christmas
nightmares are not. I always

1887
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,920
take a moment to think of
captain twangs courage.

1888
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:54,260
No sweat can bs. Never rest.

1889
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:01,640
Yeah. So that was, uh, this is, that's,

1890
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:07,300
that's just a crazy
situation. Oh yeah. Close.

1891
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:10,850
And then this is like on Thanksgiving
was when we had the mission down south

1892
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:12,980
where our six mayor recon team,

1893
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:18,550
the credal tells us you have to find
three missing NBA divisions to first the

1894
01:53:18,651 --> 01:53:22,890
third and the seventh. We found them.
How'd that work out for you? Uh,

1895
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:24,050
it was pretty intense. We use,

1896
01:53:24,230 --> 01:53:28,150
we use more than one of those five second
fuses as the holding back. Yeah. Yeah.

1897
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,460
Just that again, that's,

1898
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:32,780
that's why you need to buy
this book and read this book.

1899
01:53:32,781 --> 01:53:37,781
If you want to hear about the eight man
spike team versus a division on that day

1900
01:53:38,961 --> 01:53:42,570
was three, three divisions. For
those of you that don't academy this,

1901
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:47,270
that's 30 30,000 men roughly. And yeah,

1902
01:53:47,271 --> 01:53:51,290
that's where those, those um, five
second few of those five second fuses.

1903
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:54,050
Just so everybody
understands what that means.

1904
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:56,500
You're trying to escape the enemy.

1905
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,080
You have a little thing
called the claymore mine.
It's like the size of a book,

1906
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:05,110
maybe a little bit bigger and it's got
a bunch of ball-bearings on one side,

1907
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:10,160
the 500 5,550 ball-bearings
on one side that are,

1908
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:13,490
that spray out when,
when this thing explodes.

1909
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:17,960
And those are so like wound people. How
many of those things did you guys carry?

1910
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:20,720
Um, every,

1911
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:25,870
everybody had one on a team and then
the one one or least carry two or three.

1912
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:30,650
So you guys had lawless C4 yeah, at
least. And so what these guys would do,

1913
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:33,020
so you can use them for a bunch of
different reasons. And one of the,

1914
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:35,450
one of the things that you guys did
a lot with them, and this is again,

1915
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:38,870
these are things that I was trained in
when I was first got the seal teams aid

1916
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:40,130
too. Okay. When you set up a,

1917
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:43,070
when you're going to sleep at night or
you're going to set up a a rest overnight

1918
01:54:43,071 --> 01:54:45,170
position, you're going
to put out claymores.

1919
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,300
And that way if you get attacked
in the middle of the night, boom,

1920
01:54:47,301 --> 01:54:50,930
you can light off the claymores and you
a can get some fire superiority or at

1921
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:52,820
least shocked the enemy
or do some damage to them.

1922
01:54:52,821 --> 01:54:54,380
So you guys did that all the time,

1923
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:59,360
but then you made these little five-second
fuses knowing that if you're running

1924
01:54:59,361 --> 01:55:02,670
away, you can just put
this thing up, you know,

1925
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,170
put it in the ground real quick or
put it up against the tree pull. Yeah.

1926
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:08,630
You always want to have it up against
the tree or something to take the back,

1927
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:09,200
pull it back.

1928
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:13,000
Even when you put it in and you've got
the last four seconds before it explodes,

1929
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:14,840
you're running. You could still,

1930
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:18,650
you want to make sure that you got a
little protected on the black blast.

1931
01:55:18,770 --> 01:55:23,770
We used to detonate those things that are
completely unsafe distance behind him.

1932
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:29,480
I like, I look back now and I'm thinking,
what were we doing? WTF Times two.

1933
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:33,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, it's like
we play the game. Let's find out.

1934
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:39,410
Are you relate the limb blocks.
So now on this thing. Yeah. Yeah.

1935
01:55:39,411 --> 01:55:41,120
So you started to tell
that story a little bit.

1936
01:55:41,121 --> 01:55:44,370
For those of you who didn't catch
the whole story, the story Lynn Black

1937
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:47,910
was trying to figure out what it
would take to knock somebody out with

1938
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:52,020
[inaudible]. So see for as six
feet. Yeah. C Four just explodes.

1939
01:55:52,021 --> 01:55:55,410
There's no shrapnel in it. You can put
shrapnel in it, but you don't have to.

1940
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,390
So it's just, it's just a big concussion.

1941
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:02,190
So Lynn Black was trying to figure out
how much c four it would take so we can

1942
01:56:02,191 --> 01:56:06,000
stun a guy so we can grab
them so we can get a pow.

1943
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:09,240
So that we can get a five day
liberty anywhere in the world,

1944
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:13,800
anywhere and $100 cash. And
so he figured, so the way he,

1945
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:17,690
the way he experimented with this
was by doing it to himself. Yeah.

1946
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:22,140
Just standing around at the range and
blastic himself with heavier and heavier

1947
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:25,560
weight until he got knocked out. And
when he finally succeeded, he, uh,

1948
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:30,450
his hearing was bad for a few days.
Yeah. His hair was all. So, you know,

1949
01:56:30,610 --> 01:56:32,850
I try this with the, I don't
know if this in the seal teams,

1950
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:36,510
that would've been weird to use the new
guy for that we would use the new guy

1951
01:56:36,511 --> 01:56:37,920
like, okay, let's see
if this works. I'll do,

1952
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:42,780
let's when the s when the a stun
guns, the tasers first came in,

1953
01:56:43,410 --> 01:56:46,440
it wasn't fun to be a new guy because
we had to see how those things work.

1954
01:56:46,441 --> 01:56:50,910
Right. So we, uh, we used
to experiment with that.

1955
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:55,650
So, um, yeah, those,
that story is just crazy.

1956
01:56:55,651 --> 01:56:58,470
And you and you looking down
and seeing the firing Gulf,

1957
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:59,850
the place that you just got picked.

1958
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:04,080
Oh yeah. Instantly. Sure.

1959
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:07,570
Is this like one of those moments
in time? It's the same thing.

1960
01:57:07,571 --> 01:57:09,490
Like on Thanksgiving
Day, we got distracted.

1961
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:13,690
Deer were coming out of the jungle
running at port arms and so they would be

1962
01:57:13,691 --> 01:57:15,670
tried to come down. So
me in the door gunner,

1963
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:17,750
which is Lily's stopped
him in to try like one.

1964
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:20,470
Those cartoons you see on the TV you
would have guys running and stops.

1965
01:57:20,471 --> 01:57:21,304
He gets Janke.

1966
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:24,610
They would just push them right back
in the jungle before he even fell down.

1967
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:29,500
And that was just, um, yeah, you
just, you don't forget those things.

1968
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:30,393
They stick with you.

1969
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:36,850
The next chapter is called
a happy new year. Oh hmm.

1970
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,770
Uh, the day after Christmas,

1971
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,570
the s three brass asked s t Idaho
to run another m a target and Laos,

1972
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:49,320
I respectfully declined citing
fatigue and general weariness.

1973
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,050
I didn't tell the brass that I had
a funny feeling about the target.

1974
01:57:52,051 --> 01:57:54,630
I felt apprehensive for some reason.

1975
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:56,270
Okay.

1976
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:58,520
Back at fob one around 1200 hours.

1977
01:57:58,521 --> 01:58:02,900
Someone from the Camo shack came into the
club instead of Vietnamese team member

1978
01:58:02,901 --> 01:58:06,230
from our t ASP was on the
radio talking to spider.

1979
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,540
That was very bad news.

1980
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:13,320
Several of the RECON team members in
fob one headed toward the Camo shack.

1981
01:58:13,321 --> 01:58:15,210
Before we got there, Tony Harrell,

1982
01:58:15,211 --> 01:58:19,230
a veteran recon man came around
the corner with some more bad news.

1983
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:22,440
They were hit by sappers.
It doesn't look good.

1984
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:23,540
[inaudible]

1985
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:26,510
it appeared the American's and bid
slow to react in a matter of seconds.

1986
01:58:26,511 --> 01:58:31,190
The sappers killed the three SF troops
and chose to leave the south Vietnamese

1987
01:58:31,191 --> 01:58:32,210
team members alive.

1988
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:37,600
The news about the sappers
was a triple dose of bad news.

1989
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:40,660
First we had three dead green berets.

1990
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:42,170
Okay.

1991
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:43,760
Second reports.

1992
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:48,620
One Zeros had received from months about
NVA sappers being a leaf lethal force.

1993
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:49,940
We're now confirmed.

1994
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:51,240
Yeah.

1995
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,670
Third, by killing only the Americans.

1996
01:58:53,671 --> 01:58:58,671
The NVA pulled off a major psychological
coup by leaving the envy that by

1997
01:58:58,771 --> 01:59:00,450
leaving the Vietnamese team members alive,

1998
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:05,810
their survival would plant seeds of doubt
and dissension between SF troops and

1999
01:59:07,231 --> 01:59:08,064
our little pieces.

2000
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:09,373
Okay,

2001
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:18,810
and then you guys were heading north
the hundred first airborne division.

2002
01:59:18,811 --> 01:59:23,811
Choppers carried the six men south when
the choppers landed on the helicopter

2003
01:59:23,851 --> 01:59:28,500
pad. Colonel Jack Warren had ordered
every man in fob for out to the site.

2004
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:29,820
Okay.

2005
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:34,530
He was held in high regard by SF troops
because he genuinely cared about his men

2006
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:35,920
[inaudible].

2007
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,120
It had been said that because
of his dedication to the
SF mission and the men of

2008
01:59:40,121 --> 01:59:43,120
SF, he would never advance
beyond the rank of colonel.

2009
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:47,110
He'd remained an SF too
long, a career decision,

2010
01:59:47,111 --> 01:59:50,620
not the traditional army
hierarchy, despised and punished.

2011
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:56,730
ASP was from farb for Fob,
for which Warren commanded.

2012
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:01,340
After the three corpses were
unloaded from the helicopter,

2013
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:05,630
Warren gave a terse teary-eyed
speech to his captive audience.

2014
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:06,820
Okay.

2015
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:10,120
Warren warned everyone that if
they were careless in the field,

2016
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,490
death was the result of that carelessness.

2017
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:13,870
Okay.

2018
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:16,510
Then he bent down, opened the body bag,

2019
02:00:16,690 --> 02:00:20,410
and picked up a portion of a body
of one of the dead Americans.

2020
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:26,510
He was now crying and screaming at his
men to never be careless in the field.

2021
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:31,000
Warren was never the same after that.

2022
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:32,410
Okay?

2023
02:00:32,410 --> 02:00:33,750
Neither was CNC.

2024
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:41,450
What, what was it that
changed from your perspective?

2025
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:46,260
Well, we, um, from our early briefings,

2026
02:00:46,470 --> 02:00:49,800
probably in October, we heard
about the NBA soccer teams.

2027
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:53,550
They were highly trained and, um,

2028
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:58,740
they would just wear a
loin cloth, carry a weapon.

2029
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:00,803
And, uh,

2030
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:05,460
they were really just highly trained and
tracking so that when they came to the

2031
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:06,653
TAC part,

2032
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:11,130
they have minimal clothing and they
knew what they were looking for.

2033
02:01:11,610 --> 02:01:16,110
And the NBA at that point had a metal
kill American metal. So they killed us.

2034
02:01:16,111 --> 02:01:19,590
They got their metal and a bonus and there
would be heroes for the rest of their

2035
02:01:19,591 --> 02:01:22,230
lives within the communist party.

2036
02:01:23,130 --> 02:01:28,130
So we heard about them disconfirmed
it and it just kicked up everybody's

2037
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,300
concerned a notch. And

2038
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:33,900
that being New Year's Eve,

2039
02:01:33,901 --> 02:01:37,680
the team had at the Americas had
taken a bottle of Scotch with them.

2040
02:01:37,681 --> 02:01:40,220
So they had had little hit of the Scotch.

2041
02:01:40,221 --> 02:01:44,450
We don't know how much and that's what
Jack Warren had gone the extra distance

2042
02:01:44,451 --> 02:01:46,610
on saying about being
careless. We don't know.

2043
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:51,050
But the sappers were good
and um, that proved it.

2044
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:55,850
And it just gave us an our case
no on, as you know for you,

2045
02:01:55,851 --> 02:02:00,770
do you Ron at night without the
dogs he would do your perimeter.

2046
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:04,900
And our people always checked me and we
always had rotated whose be sleeping and

2047
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:08,960
who wouldn't. And we never
ever had a problem with that.

2048
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:13,640
No matter how tired you are to be
somebody awake just so something like that

2049
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,550
happened. Somebody be there on
full automatic ready, the respond

2050
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:20,740
new level terror. Yeah.

2051
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:25,720
And those guys were so it's like a just
traveling super light and super select

2052
02:02:25,721 --> 02:02:30,320
the sappers sure. You know, just
could move quickly and yeah.

2053
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:31,270
That's a scary uh,

2054
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:32,530
yeah, because you know, the,

2055
02:02:32,890 --> 02:02:37,120
we knew that the NBA had all our
sources set up meeting besides being

2056
02:02:37,121 --> 02:02:38,650
compromised in headquarters.

2057
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,580
They also had people that alerted
when the choppers left along site.

2058
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:48,210
They have border watchers so that when
we came in they would report where we

2059
02:02:48,281 --> 02:02:52,930
were heading to a higher command and
they would try to rally their troops.

2060
02:02:53,350 --> 02:02:57,430
So we were up against that at all times.
Just a question of who would be there,

2061
02:02:57,431 --> 02:03:02,200
how many, and a lot of times just
getting on the ground was the first part,

2062
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:06,760
but then you hope to get into the mission
and it was just really a challenge.

2063
02:03:10,450 --> 02:03:11,283
Okay.

2064
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:15,100
Speaking of a challenge who
were going back to the book,

2065
02:03:15,101 --> 02:03:18,790
the daily grind of running missions
across the fence was wearing on me

2066
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:22,930
physically and mentally. As 69 dawned,

2067
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:25,960
I began a mental
examination of life in SOG.

2068
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:31,800
Being in an elite unit within America's
finest special operations was where I

2069
02:03:31,901 --> 02:03:32,734
wanted to be.

2070
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:38,400
The adrenaline enhanced high of deadly
fire fights against a relentless m enemy

2071
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:42,580
under extremely lopsided
odds was intoxicating.

2072
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:47,740
I had never experienced such
exhilaration or sheer terror

2073
02:03:49,330 --> 02:03:52,360
if there was a little voice in the back
of my head, which spoke of survival,

2074
02:03:53,290 --> 02:03:57,970
surviving not only a vigorous enemy
campaign directed against a SOG members,

2075
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:01,750
but merely surviving the odds
of going home in one piece.

2076
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:08,710
My mind also began the mental debate
between rising to the new challenges

2077
02:04:09,591 --> 02:04:13,670
inherent in a secret war and
returning to a safer assignment.

2078
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:15,000
Okay.

2079
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,540
My one year tour of duty was
scheduled to end at the end of April.

2080
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:23,670
Under the general rules of SOG after
running targets across the fence for six

2081
02:04:23,671 --> 02:04:26,190
months, I could request
a cushy assignment.

2082
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,550
I had already spent seven
months with the team.

2083
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,730
I was alive. However,

2084
02:04:32,910 --> 02:04:37,910
thanks to hip sow fuck Twan
and the other men STI though.

2085
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:41,850
I couldn't just walk away.

2086
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:50,030
And that's where your, that's
where you wrap up this book.

2087
02:04:50,031 --> 02:04:53,990
Now you go into some cool.
Um, you go into some cool,

2088
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:57,440
one more really interesting story.

2089
02:04:57,530 --> 02:05:01,130
And then you also have a very cool thing
in there about what you guys carried

2090
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:05,600
and what we didn't care and
what you didn't carry. How
much, so how much longer?

2091
02:05:05,601 --> 02:05:09,140
So now it's January of 69. Yeah,
you'd been there for seven months.

2092
02:05:09,170 --> 02:05:12,440
How much longer did you
stay with the CNC teams?

2093
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:15,690
I'll stay right there to the end. Um, we,

2094
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:17,700
we closed fob one in January.

2095
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:22,020
They shipped us down to Denang and that's
where I picked up with a second book.

2096
02:05:22,650 --> 02:05:27,240
And uh, um, they needed help down here.

2097
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:30,840
So we hit the ground, um, continue to run.

2098
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:35,670
Baba asked if tape be taken off the
team. So he left. Lynn black came on.

2099
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:41,150
So with linen on for my last couple of
months and at the very end they had a

2100
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:43,620
mission up at the mew pass,

2101
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:48,180
which was north of the
DMZ river in layoffs,

2102
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:53,460
which was a major channel point.
And the plan was for us to go in,

2103
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:55,310
set up our mountain top,

2104
02:05:56,360 --> 02:06:00,060
taking a lot of claymores mortars and um,

2105
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,070
call an airstrikes for two or three days
on that just to raise hell with the NBA

2106
02:06:05,071 --> 02:06:08,160
there cause they never had a
recon team go that far north.

2107
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:12,450
And we did an inspection,

2108
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:17,400
which is that inspection prior to that
mission, which was about April 20th, 69.

2109
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:19,380
And then, um,

2110
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,420
we finally went up to the
launch site and we were up to,

2111
02:06:24,421 --> 02:06:29,040
I guess maybe about the 24th or 25th.
I just forget the exact date now,

2112
02:06:29,041 --> 02:06:32,000
but we were up to a launch
site, got on the choppers,

2113
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,400
we're getting ready to launch, the
choppers take off. And he turned around,

2114
02:06:35,401 --> 02:06:36,030
went back,

2115
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:41,030
and he hit that target had just had
two aircraft shot down over it and they

2116
02:06:41,521 --> 02:06:46,140
figured they just shot down a phantom
jet and the sky reader choppers are going

2117
02:06:46,141 --> 02:06:49,800
to be easy to knock out this
guy. So to Sidebar to that,

2118
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:51,840
I'm at a reunion two years ago,

2119
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:56,010
one of the guys that ran recon
says, remember those pictures?

2120
02:06:56,011 --> 02:06:59,730
You got an f on your second book on the
Ground Air? I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2121
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:04,220
He says, what was their mission?
Wasn't that something like that?

2122
02:07:04,290 --> 02:07:07,100
A suicide mission, right. And says,
well I don't know about suicide.

2123
02:07:07,101 --> 02:07:08,910
I was going to be high odds. But you know,

2124
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:13,290
we were gone and we had two extra
Americans where we had [inaudible].

2125
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:17,800
We got Buku bullets. Hand-Grenades
we were gonna give it a shot.

2126
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:19,140
This guy goes,

2127
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:24,450
do you realize they asked me to do
that and I told him to fuck off. I go,

2128
02:07:24,451 --> 02:07:27,220
really? [inaudible] you
saw taking pressure.

2129
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:30,750
You didn't tell me that cause I
didn't know what your mission was.

2130
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:35,500
So here's the top secret operation,
the recon guys, another man,

2131
02:07:35,501 --> 02:07:38,080
it'd be given that target said Hell No,

2132
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:41,530
it was too far north and
you've just felt that the, uh,

2133
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:44,230
it would just be a suicide
mission. And once you get in,

2134
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:46,810
you never get out other
than a casket or a body bag.

2135
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:51,100
But there's no talking between teams
much cause everything is like you got a

2136
02:07:51,101 --> 02:07:55,240
mission, you do your
mission, they do theirs. So

2137
02:07:55,340 --> 02:07:56,550
yeah. Well, uh,

2138
02:07:56,720 --> 02:08:01,220
I already gave you a fair warning before
we started this that we're probably

2139
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:05,660
gonna have to have you come back on
here. Cause I mean, I, I got just a,

2140
02:08:06,170 --> 02:08:08,600
I mean this, this, these books
are, they're just awesome.

2141
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:13,760
The detail that you go on to and
just the experience that you've had,

2142
02:08:13,761 --> 02:08:14,594
which are just,

2143
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:19,630
it's a miracle that you're sitting here
talking and able to tell us what you

2144
02:08:19,761 --> 02:08:22,640
went through when, as far as I can tell,

2145
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:26,720
there's no way in hell you should
be sitting here right now. I agree

2146
02:08:27,650 --> 02:08:31,250
times when, uh, in talking to friends
who are people that have read the book,

2147
02:08:31,251 --> 02:08:34,580
you know, particularly on page two oh
two would the guy touches your boots.

2148
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:39,800
I mean, I've talked to people. It's
just like, it feels surreal even today.

2149
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:43,910
It's like, thank God everybody
at home was praying, you know?

2150
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:46,100
And uh, yeah.

2151
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:49,240
The last thing I want to
read from the book is just a,

2152
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:51,760
just this section right here.

2153
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:55,660
The dedication says this book is
dedicated to all SOC reconnaissance team

2154
02:08:55,661 --> 02:08:56,494
members,

2155
02:08:56,860 --> 02:09:01,860
both US special forces and indigenous
troops as well as to every man in every

2156
02:09:02,711 --> 02:09:03,790
air support unit,

2157
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:08,970
especially the king B pilots of the
219 south Vietnamese air forces,

2158
02:09:09,011 --> 02:09:14,011
Special Operations Squadron who worked
daily with SOG teams on the ground across

2159
02:09:14,651 --> 02:09:17,620
the fence in America's secret war.

2160
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:18,820
Okay.

2161
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:23,820
This book is also for every man
in SOG and their support units.

2162
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:28,210
Who made the ultimate sacrifice.

2163
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:32,000
Yeah. Because today as we sit here,

2164
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:37,140
there are still 1,589 Americans missing
in action in Southeast Asia from the

2165
02:09:37,971 --> 02:09:40,370
Vietnam War. That includes CIA,

2166
02:09:40,580 --> 02:09:44,060
s f regular army and lay us alone.

2167
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:49,480
50 Green Berets are amongst
those mias over 140 aviation,

2168
02:09:50,510 --> 02:09:53,180
army, Marine Corps, Air Force,

2169
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:58,010
Mias dies supporting our
missions ear just held deleo was,

2170
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:02,550
you guys had a over 100% casualty rate.

2171
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:05,040
Yeah. Several of our guys
have multiple purple hearts.

2172
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:10,260
Bob Howard received eight. He
had been put in for 11. He, he,

2173
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:14,470
he was a recipient of the medal of honor
in December 68 for a mission out of

2174
02:10:15,030 --> 02:10:17,550
Kontomble. And uh, yeah,

2175
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:20,490
the Cassie rate did a
seat a hundred percent.

2176
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,400
The uh, and I, I didn't,

2177
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:26,480
I couldn't find any numbers on the
numbers that were actually killed,

2178
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:31,640
but that was a massive number
percentage wise of guys in SOG that were

2179
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:36,620
killed. Right. Yeah. The
numbers, um, are hard to track.

2180
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:40,100
Um, I'm working with a
gal now who's a real,

2181
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:44,180
she's a retired master sergeant from the
a hundred first and she's begin to do

2182
02:10:44,181 --> 02:10:48,470
some research to, to try to put that
number together because during a war,

2183
02:10:48,471 --> 02:10:50,960
3.2 million Americans served in Vietnam.

2184
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:56,320
That includes the 500,000 sailors there
off off the coast and your seals that

2185
02:10:56,750 --> 02:11:01,100
were going up north. And
um, out of that 20,000,

2186
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:05,260
approximately 20,000 were
SF out of the SF prostate.

2187
02:11:05,261 --> 02:11:09,560
2000 went to SOG out of that.

2188
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:11,750
Depends on which author you talk to.

2189
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:16,890
There's no hard stats anywhere because
SF was not as good as the seals and keep

2190
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:19,700
our records and uh,

2191
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:22,550
it'd be between 500 to seven,

2192
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:27,440
maybe 800 green berets
actually went across the fence
with recon missions out of

2193
02:11:27,441 --> 02:11:31,370
the 3.2 million. Those are our numbers.

2194
02:11:32,410 --> 02:11:34,720
Yeah. Amazing. Um,

2195
02:11:36,070 --> 02:11:40,770
well I hope you don't mind coming back
here and an honor to come back because

2196
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:45,780
for some of your stories, pal, do believe
me, my stories are on a big joke. I,

2197
02:11:45,860 --> 02:11:49,390
I conversed with, uh, one of our, one
of the guys that was in Ramadi with me,

2198
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:51,520
a guy by the name of Dave Burke. He was,

2199
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:54,670
he was a Marine Corps ANGLICO
guy on the ground with us.

2200
02:11:55,330 --> 02:11:58,870
And you know, we always
joke our about our,

2201
02:11:58,990 --> 02:12:00,760
about what are our experiences, you know,

2202
02:12:00,761 --> 02:12:04,750
he had a friend and we had him on the
podcast who served in World War II,

2203
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:06,520
Korea and Vietnam. Really,

2204
02:12:06,521 --> 02:12:10,910
he was a purple heart recipient in every
war and every one of those wars I had,

2205
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:15,320
you know, uh, that's the way I feel
standing here talking to you. Like I'm,

2206
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:20,260
I'm uh, in a totally different and
much lower category of experience.

2207
02:12:20,290 --> 02:12:22,870
But that's why it's such an honor to
sit here and talk with you about this

2208
02:12:22,871 --> 02:12:25,270
mutual. If you have any
other closing thoughts too.

2209
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:25,651
Well,

2210
02:12:25,651 --> 02:12:29,010
the only thing about this book actually
spot the mentioned that I could've done

2211
02:12:29,011 --> 02:12:33,450
it without my wife. Awesome. My
dear wife Anna at the time, um,

2212
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:39,050
we had four teenagers in one
newborn in the house and said,

2213
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:43,950
you can imagine that turmoil and I'm
working that fish wrapper up in north

2214
02:12:43,951 --> 02:12:48,330
county and so between the fish
wrapper and the kids, she goes,

2215
02:12:48,390 --> 02:12:49,223
go right to book.

2216
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:52,340
Awesome. She supported me all
it. That is one thing real quick.

2217
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:53,660
When you got home from,

2218
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:57,680
so you got out shortly thereafter when
you got done with Vietnam is that that's

2219
02:12:57,681 --> 02:12:59,660
when you were done, right? You got
out of the army shortly thereafter?

2220
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:01,640
Yeah, I went back to, to CNC,

2221
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:06,470
a for second tour and then I got out of
the army in April 20 fives with book to

2222
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:08,210
Isabelle. Going back

2223
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:10,020
one tour wasn't enough at CMC.

2224
02:13:10,470 --> 02:13:14,520
Well you know what, it be all
honest with you. I came back in, uh,

2225
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:17,460
by the time I landed in the states
like may one, May 2nd of 69,

2226
02:13:18,180 --> 02:13:22,230
the antiwar movements going on
strong. Uh, there was Woodstock,

2227
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:25,360
our men walked on the moon, but I hated,

2228
02:13:25,730 --> 02:13:28,080
hated being and we were
and are supposed to go to,

2229
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,240
to Fort Bragg with the regular SF.

2230
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:35,540
But the 10th Special Forces group was
up in Massachusetts and they had five

2231
02:13:36,870 --> 02:13:41,130
companies, a, B, c, d, and
e. He was a signal company,

2232
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,650
which was rinky dink.
They had new lieutenants,

2233
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:47,610
butter bars running this thing and
they treat it like basic camp on us up.

2234
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:49,171
And to top it off,

2235
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:53,600
they had old career sergeants that are
all overweight on embarrassment to the

2236
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:58,350
Bra they wore. And they came in and
put me up batoon sergeant and I'm,

2237
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:03,330
I'm in this environment that
was not a good chemistry. So,

2238
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:07,690
um, I heard that the MPS were
coming basically. And uh,

2239
02:14:07,710 --> 02:14:09,990
I went down to Pentagon. We
had a woman, Billy Alexander,

2240
02:14:09,991 --> 02:14:14,110
who handled our orders as told what
kind of wine and what flower she likes.

2241
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:18,120
So before I went down here,
I had her wine, her flowers,

2242
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:21,870
and a Thursday morning I get to
the Pentagon is seven o'clock,

2243
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:25,530
give her the flowers, no wine, went
back to sleep in a parking lot,

2244
02:14:25,531 --> 02:14:29,190
came back and forth. She gave me two
orders to nom. I cleared on Friday,

2245
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:31,980
the MPS came on Monday
and I was back in my team.

2246
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:37,220
40 MPs covered for what are some
bar fights? Property destruction.

2247
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:39,140
They have reports of a four 42,

2248
02:14:39,141 --> 02:14:42,770
which I had at a time for
four to w 30 which is what?

2249
02:14:43,790 --> 02:14:46,600
Austin Oldsmobile [inaudible]. Oh God,
God. Oh, that for four to go y'all,

2250
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:51,220
sorry. Yeah, it's a 69 which was the
coolest car at the time. You hear me too?

2251
02:14:51,230 --> 02:14:52,063
For sure.

2252
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:56,000
There are reports about that car going
through the entrance gate on the sideways

2253
02:14:56,001 --> 02:14:59,300
drift. I said, I'm sorry.

2254
02:14:59,301 --> 02:15:02,150
When I entered the base on the
exit gate, that's what it was.

2255
02:15:02,151 --> 02:15:05,300
The MP's weren't happy about
that. They couldn't catch me.

2256
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:07,670
I was able to hide
within our conquest mint,

2257
02:15:07,730 --> 02:15:11,150
but they were trying to begin to
figure things out. But anyways,

2258
02:15:11,151 --> 02:15:14,060
they were common. Sounds like, or
it sounds like the next podcast,

2259
02:15:14,090 --> 02:15:16,640
that's the warm up for
the next podcast. We'll,

2260
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:20,180
we'll take it from there next time. Like
a bad dream. I'll be back if you ask.

2261
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:23,990
Thank you. No, that's awesome.
These books across the fence,

2262
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:25,280
which one do you think people should ride?

2263
02:15:25,340 --> 02:15:29,360
Read first across the fence as the
first and ask my book about my getting

2264
02:15:29,361 --> 02:15:29,810
involved,

2265
02:15:29,810 --> 02:15:33,440
the next Cetera and the stories of
uh, other people which bought away.

2266
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:37,880
We have a Greenbrae medic, John
Walton who was the son of Sam Walton.

2267
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:42,170
You heard of a store called Walmart
[inaudible] son. We're on the best medics.

2268
02:15:42,710 --> 02:15:47,330
There was at the time chapter
four where a fellow green break,

2269
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:51,020
his leg blown off and the front
of Vietnamese got shot four times.

2270
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:55,950
John brought them all back and Tom
Cunningham's alive today and uh,

2271
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,890
has two children. Thanks to John.

2272
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:01,450
That's awesome. These books are available
on Amazon, right? Amazon just go damn.

2273
02:16:01,451 --> 02:16:04,420
Zonda bill was ebooks or paperbacks.

2274
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:09,160
You know the one who website is saw
chronicles.com saw chronicles.com.

2275
02:16:09,161 --> 02:16:12,280
That's the name of volume one.
That's another book, right?

2276
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:15,730
And then on the ground, the secret
war in Vietnam as the second book.

2277
02:16:15,790 --> 02:16:19,810
The second book is in here. There's some
stories I missed because of deadlines.

2278
02:16:20,030 --> 02:16:20,540
Right?

2279
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:25,540
And the first story we have the our recon
teams and our worst target Oscar aide

2280
02:16:26,150 --> 02:16:28,760
and the NBA come up and tap
them on the shoulder and say,

2281
02:16:28,761 --> 02:16:30,070
it's your for guard duty.

2282
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:35,110
Oh, that's pretty close
to the enemy. All right.

2283
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:39,190
We will cover these books in the
future. Everyone go buy these books.

2284
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:44,110
Are you ready? And thank you, really a
true honor to have you on. Appreciate it.

2285
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:48,610
Honor to be here. And can we have
you back if you turn outstanding.

2286
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:53,590
Thank you. And with that, Mr

2287
02:16:55,300 --> 02:17:00,160
John Stryker Meyer has left the building
and what an honor it was to talk to him

2288
02:17:00,310 --> 02:17:04,540
and I can absolutely promise
we're having that guy back on.

2289
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:09,850
And thanks to you, John, for your,

2290
02:17:10,810 --> 02:17:13,840
for your service and your sacrifice
and the sacrifices of your teammates.

2291
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:19,140
It is men like you that have allowed us
to live the way that we live in that is

2292
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:23,380
in freedom.

2293
02:17:27,610 --> 02:17:31,480
So he has left the building and echo. Um,

2294
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:36,580
speaking of living, living the way we
should live, what do you got for us?

2295
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:40,570
Well as we have been doing,

2296
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:45,130
talking about Jujitsu first
[inaudible] Jujitsu, martial arts,

2297
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:46,820
uh, know

2298
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,740
capability is what it is.
That's really what it is.

2299
02:17:49,741 --> 02:17:54,000
You want to generalize it like the whole
thing into one big nugget capability.

2300
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:57,580
Just improve the capability. We want to
improve our capabilities. Oh yeah, sure.

2301
02:17:57,780 --> 02:17:57,990
Way Too.

2302
02:17:57,990 --> 02:18:02,860
Do that. Not just in the Marshall
fields but in life. Yeah.

2303
02:18:03,090 --> 02:18:04,230
Is to train some of that Jujitsu.

2304
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:09,360
Yeah, I was talking to, there's a girl
named Kara who trains here, you know,

2305
02:18:09,361 --> 02:18:13,530
I see her every once in a while
I'll see or whatever. And um, she,

2306
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:17,700
she said basically the stuff we were
saying where she was like, I was like,

2307
02:18:17,701 --> 02:18:20,880
I bet I only see her sort of in
the men's class. I said, hey,

2308
02:18:20,881 --> 02:18:25,020
have you tried the women's costs that
are women's class goodness developed?

2309
02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:27,900
And then she was like, not yet. I want
to whatever. And I was like, yeah,

2310
02:18:27,901 --> 02:18:29,600
that's, I think a lot of the times we'll,

2311
02:18:29,601 --> 02:18:32,520
we'll offer more benefits
depending on who you are as a girl,

2312
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:38,420
we'll offer benefits because you can
get like the moves you can kind of do,

2313
02:18:40,530 --> 02:18:43,110
you know on on a body that's
more similar to yours.

2314
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:45,720
So you can go through the moves
a little bit more thoroughly.

2315
02:18:45,721 --> 02:18:48,930
I think in a way for lack of better
way of putting it. She was like, yeah,

2316
02:18:48,931 --> 02:18:51,960
that's good. That's true. She's like,
you know what though, I really like,

2317
02:18:51,990 --> 02:18:54,810
there's a lot of value here in,
in the guys in the men's class.

2318
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:58,650
And she said straight for self defense
for sure. And I was like, yeah.

2319
02:18:58,651 --> 02:18:59,041
She's like,

2320
02:18:59,041 --> 02:19:04,041
yeah because like when you get used to
guys and meanwhile there's like two guys

2321
02:19:04,171 --> 02:19:05,730
scrolling like hard though,

2322
02:19:05,731 --> 02:19:08,370
you know the kind where they're rolling
and they're grunting at right in front

2323
02:19:08,371 --> 02:19:12,150
of us like sweating and split their splits
with flashing on us. And she's like,

2324
02:19:12,270 --> 02:19:15,270
when you get with [inaudible] and we
kind of laugh cause w she like motions to

2325
02:19:15,271 --> 02:19:16,680
them and I'm thinking like, yeah,

2326
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:20,800
any girl to come in and see that or
anyone even anyone even never dissipate in

2327
02:19:20,810 --> 02:19:24,630
that. Yeah. Thinking I got to do that.
No way man. I'm not ready for that.

2328
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:26,400
All girls are not ready for that. Oh yeah.

2329
02:19:26,401 --> 02:19:29,690
And what if you would just all of a
sudden like one day you go to the grocery

2330
02:19:29,691 --> 02:19:33,010
store and now you've got to
deal with that. Man. That's,

2331
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:36,290
that's tough cause it's a big
psychological gap. You need to make up.

2332
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:38,900
Oh you have to train Jujitsu.
The gap is made up. She was like,

2333
02:19:39,070 --> 02:19:40,490
I'm used to and she's
not a big girl either.

2334
02:19:40,491 --> 02:19:44,420
She's just like a pretty small girl.
She's like, yeah and he's real nice,

2335
02:19:44,421 --> 02:19:45,950
you know, nice to go.
She's like, yeah, I'm cool.

2336
02:19:46,390 --> 02:19:50,510
And I'm really used to that and I've
been training for like almost a year now.

2337
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:52,250
I'm like a big difference.

2338
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:57,350
That's good that you can come in here as
often as you do and have that mindset.

2339
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:02,540
That's good. That's going
to get you places 100% so
we're talking about Jujitsu.

2340
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:03,170
Oh yeah.

2341
02:20:03,170 --> 02:20:06,770
And then you need to start talking about
the gear that is needed for Jujitsu.

2342
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:10,160
Some of it, yes. Some of the gear
that you need for to do as a g. Yes.

2343
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:15,200
If you're going to train g Jujitsu,
which we recommend strongly,

2344
02:20:15,201 --> 02:20:18,110
strongly recommend. We also
recommend you train No-gi.

2345
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:22,070
You train all kinds of Jujitsu. Yeah,
that's what you train. If you need a g,

2346
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:26,360
which you do get one from origin,
main origin, so you go to origin,

2347
02:20:26,361 --> 02:20:29,900
maine.com this is where you can
get all these things. Also jeans,

2348
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:34,070
American Denim. Again, we all, we all
know this, but I'm going to say it again.

2349
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:37,760
It's all made in America. All of
it. Yup. Every little piece of it.

2350
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:42,650
The little seeds that they
plant to eventually grow
cotton to eventually go into

2351
02:20:42,651 --> 02:20:46,250
the loon to eventually
formulate. We've yes,

2352
02:20:46,251 --> 02:20:51,251
formulate both the fabric that gets
sewn and stitched into ghees jeans,

2353
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:57,860
rash guards, all this stuff. Shorts,
the shorts in oral tube, by the way,

2354
02:20:58,130 --> 02:21:02,990
factually. Anyway, all of it is in
American done in America. So boom,

2355
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:06,180
there's that huge deal by the way.
So yeah, American Denim hasn't,

2356
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:10,820
we have some new jeans,
good ones, jogger, you know,

2357
02:21:10,821 --> 02:21:15,080
sweat pants, sweat, athletic
gear, boom, origin, Maine,

2358
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:17,990
their supplements, big deal.

2359
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:24,080
Pretty much all the essential supplements
that you're going to need as you go

2360
02:21:24,081 --> 02:21:28,980
through this kind of hectic path at times
about the sector and should be, yeah,

2361
02:21:28,981 --> 02:21:33,410
I kind of cheesy. That's not the path
we want to be on. That path leads down.

2362
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,910
It's going to be easy if it's a downhill
situation cause all you gotta do is sit

2363
02:21:37,911 --> 02:21:41,240
there and slide, don't take the
path down, you know? So yes,

2364
02:21:41,241 --> 02:21:44,330
the supplements are joint
warfare for your joints.

2365
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:48,200
Joint warfare is more for like if
you have get abuse on your joints,

2366
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:49,620
you're running a lot. You,

2367
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:52,880
you're doing jujitsu where you're twisting
a lot and you're going every day or

2368
02:21:52,881 --> 02:21:56,870
something like this or you're just lifting
every day lifting everyday. Oh yeah.

2369
02:21:56,871 --> 02:22:00,500
Basically if you're doing physical
activity. Yeah, that's Kinda like hard.

2370
02:22:00,501 --> 02:22:02,060
I mean, I guess you could
break it down like, Oh,

2371
02:22:02,061 --> 02:22:07,061
if you're doing some weak physical
activity then you might not need it.

2372
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:10,190
But I think not that so much the joint
where for you made a good point though,

2373
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:11,550
the muster number.

2374
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:16,580
Cause your knee is like Kinda on the panel
on the final Steven's healing and you

2375
02:22:16,581 --> 02:22:20,360
were like, I was like, yeah, how's your
knee or whatever and you're like, uh,

2376
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:22,800
would you say, oh it
was good. But like, oh,

2377
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:27,210
since I've been standing up on
it for a long yeah, sure. Yeah.

2378
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:31,200
At the muster, yes. It actually swelled
up again. Yes, surprisingly. So.

2379
02:22:31,201 --> 02:22:33,700
Here's the thing, it made me
think when I was a bouncer,

2380
02:22:33,701 --> 02:22:36,810
I used to stand up all the
time. Like for the whole thing,

2381
02:22:36,811 --> 02:22:40,100
you're standing at the front door
and not the tactics, the path,

2382
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:44,280
the second and the
struggle is real bad. And,

2383
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:48,120
but I have dress shoes on. I don't have
the, the new balance or the, you know,

2384
02:22:48,121 --> 02:22:51,150
the deal, it's like dress shoes.
So it's like it was hurting man.

2385
02:22:51,151 --> 02:22:55,050
Joint warfare have came
in handy. Well, you know,

2386
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:58,290
varying levels of hard to get some
joint warfare for your joints.

2387
02:22:58,291 --> 02:22:59,750
Get some Krill oil for your joints.

2388
02:22:59,970 --> 02:23:04,650
General Maintenance and
general maintenance of life.
Yes. Life support. Yes.

2389
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:08,700
Let me get the, and then discipline and
discipline go, which is sort of like,

2390
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:11,310
um, gives you a little bit of that.

2391
02:23:15,860 --> 02:23:20,280
Yeah. A little edge. Mentally
Shotgun. It is illegal.

2392
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:21,833
Negative.

2393
02:23:22,410 --> 02:23:27,410
If you are going to confront
someone in an intellectual battle,

2394
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:33,780
is it legal for you to take
discipline? Go and they don't,

2395
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:39,270
should not be illegal because it's not
any legal drug shit. It's not even drugs.

2396
02:23:39,271 --> 02:23:41,640
It's actually good advantage
though, right? Yeah. Good.

2397
02:23:41,780 --> 02:23:45,780
We lifting weights is an advantage or
the results from lifting weights is an

2398
02:23:45,781 --> 02:23:50,370
advantage of the results from eating
salads. That's an advantage. So boom,

2399
02:23:50,371 --> 02:23:54,090
same thing. But just the pulling
just tastes really good and uh,

2400
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:57,810
and have that advantage over your
enemy, whoever they may be. Yes.

2401
02:23:58,230 --> 02:23:59,940
Then we got up, we also got milk,

2402
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:05,780
which is milk, delicious,
delicious protein.

2403
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:09,540
And I had a milkshake last
night at meatloaf. No potatoes.

2404
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:15,660
Meatloaf, carrots. Milkshake. That's
a good meal right there. Chocolate,

2405
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:19,440
dark. Know the darkness and I put
peanut butter in it. Boom. There it is.

2406
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:23,790
Literally my late dinner
last night, I was 10. Yeah.

2407
02:24:24,330 --> 02:24:26,520
That's the milk. And you can
give it to your kids too.

2408
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:30,420
You can get the warrior kid milk.
Yeah. For your kids. So your kids,

2409
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:35,810
so your kids instead of turning out to
be like an obese outage shape kid that

2410
02:24:35,911 --> 02:24:38,850
you were like trying to, no,
don't even put them on that path.

2411
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:43,320
Put 'em on the milk tray. Let me ask
you this, when you were young, yes.

2412
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:47,670
And you went to whatever, elementary
school, junior high, whatever.

2413
02:24:47,671 --> 02:24:49,710
Did you bring home lunch?

2414
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:56,400
Sometimes. Yeah. So not very often. Okay.

2415
02:24:56,401 --> 02:24:58,740
So do you [inaudible] as far
as you can remember, did you,

2416
02:24:58,741 --> 02:25:01,710
did you have a healthy home
lunch? Do you, was your, you know,

2417
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:04,570
nothing and we didn't even know
what healthy was. Like it wasn't,

2418
02:25:04,571 --> 02:25:07,170
that wasn't even a thing.
Yeah. They were just like,

2419
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:11,010
oh what do you like to eat peanut and
what do you like to eat and what's cheap?

2420
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:15,840
Yes. Right. Cause we're going to get
you, we're not getting you cold cuts.

2421
02:25:16,130 --> 02:25:18,390
Right. Cause those costs money. Guess
what? Doesn't cost a lot of money.

2422
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:23,400
Bologna jam. PB and jam.

2423
02:25:23,570 --> 02:25:25,710
Yeah. Right. [inaudible]
butter and Jelly. Oh,

2424
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:30,730
two all day long on the on on white
bread. Oh, white bread, white bread.

2425
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:32,580
And then you know what?
You get the little,

2426
02:25:32,860 --> 02:25:37,860
the little party mix of of potato chips.

2427
02:25:39,070 --> 02:25:42,620
Frito lays Doritos, which
I never liked Oreos.

2428
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:44,470
I still don't like to read
those interests. Yeah,

2429
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:47,170
but then you get some of that and
then like some chocolate chips.

2430
02:25:47,171 --> 02:25:51,550
I'm chips Ahoy cookies. You know what
those are? Yes. I do get the sleet,

2431
02:25:51,551 --> 02:25:55,690
little little mini sleeve, a chips Ahoy
and so there's nothing nutritional.

2432
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:59,170
Right. There's the nutritional value of
this launch is zero. You had nothing.

2433
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:00,940
Yeah. If that was best case scenario,

2434
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:06,120
I used to get the chocolate milk from
the cost that it costs 5 cents for a

2435
02:26:07,931 --> 02:26:11,550
chocolate for a white milk, 7
cents for a chocolate milk. Oh,

2436
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:14,200
at my school school lunch.
Yeah. So I used to get that.

2437
02:26:14,201 --> 02:26:16,330
That would probably be when
I actually lived off of,

2438
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:21,150
because everything else was just was just
poisoned in a rapper basically. Yeah.

2439
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:25,300
Does that answer your question? Well, I
mean the reason I was asking is because,

2440
02:26:25,301 --> 02:26:29,230
okay, so my family or my mom more
than my dad I guess. But you know,

2441
02:26:29,231 --> 02:26:32,320
my mom took care of the poem lunches in
the event of us bringing her home lunch.

2442
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:35,800
She, she's health conscious.
She was like a Hippie, you know,

2443
02:26:35,970 --> 02:26:38,760
so we had like the whole
wheat bread. Okay. You know,

2444
02:26:40,090 --> 02:26:44,590
and then Novato, you're, how old
are you? I will be 42 this year.

2445
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:47,500
So you're like five years
younger than me. There's a,

2446
02:26:47,501 --> 02:26:51,470
there's a difference there in terms of
what people were even thinking. Yeah.

2447
02:26:51,471 --> 02:26:55,900
Yeah. We'll keep in mind everyone
wasn't like that. I'm saying my mom was,

2448
02:26:55,901 --> 02:26:59,170
my mom was like a hippie. She was
different than everyone. And here's what,

2449
02:26:59,171 --> 02:27:00,190
here's my point with that.

2450
02:27:00,191 --> 02:27:02,530
Where when we'd come to school
and I'd bring home lunch,

2451
02:27:02,531 --> 02:27:07,330
we'd get sorta teased because it's
like you don't get the cool snacks,

2452
02:27:07,331 --> 02:27:08,740
the cool Frito lay,

2453
02:27:08,741 --> 02:27:12,760
Frito Lay's and chips and cookies
in like the cool fun stuff. Oh No.

2454
02:27:12,761 --> 02:27:15,160
And then open the milk
negative. No, you got,

2455
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:20,170
we got the whole wheat sandwich with
like Turkey from a real Turkey with

2456
02:27:20,230 --> 02:27:24,130
sprouted grains on it or some little
wheat bread hundred. Sorry about that.

2457
02:27:24,131 --> 02:27:28,330
Sprouted grain. That's the
next level right there it is.

2458
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:31,240
It is. Nonetheless. We
got laughed at that end.

2459
02:27:31,940 --> 02:27:35,380
Mama Deco was coming in hard with the
sprouted oil rain bread with a health.

2460
02:27:35,410 --> 02:27:38,170
Yeah and there was making funny
cause it tastes like cardboard.

2461
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:41,440
I don't even know cause they don't
know how it tastes. It's not tight.

2462
02:27:41,441 --> 02:27:42,700
It's more of a social thing. Everyone,

2463
02:27:42,730 --> 02:27:45,010
everyone knows that
cookies or young yummy.

2464
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:48,340
Everyone knows that like chips are
delicious for snack and all this stuff.

2465
02:27:48,460 --> 02:27:49,090
We didn't have that.

2466
02:27:49,090 --> 02:27:53,770
We had like the snacks that they knew
that weren't that good tasting carrots and

2467
02:27:53,771 --> 02:27:56,670
like carrots are pretty tasty
though. I think so now. Yes,

2468
02:27:56,920 --> 02:27:59,860
concerned about cares. If you're not
eating sugar and you eat a carrot,

2469
02:27:59,861 --> 02:28:02,690
taste sweet. Yeah it is. You're like,
oh this is super sweet. Tastes good.

2470
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:06,820
You can eat too many carrots because
your body can't digest them fully if you

2471
02:28:06,821 --> 02:28:10,050
eat too many of them. Just FYI.
I've made that mistake before.

2472
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:13,640
Pounding bags, a carrot. I look
like one of those bags. Guards.

2473
02:28:13,641 --> 02:28:17,560
Your gut is going to tell you
no. Do an issue. Good. Noted Bro.

2474
02:28:17,561 --> 02:28:19,810
Where are you going with all
this? I'm making a good point.

2475
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:23,030
Unless you wanna talking about care. It's
a little bit more, I can't, we can't,

2476
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:24,440
but nonetheless make it a point.

2477
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:28,010
So these kids would make fun of us because
they got the cookies and we had like

2478
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:32,390
tomatoes and sprouts in our sandwiches.

2479
02:28:33,380 --> 02:28:37,970
But growing up when you
come early adulthood,

2480
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:41,930
adulthood, that health
consciousness paid off big time.

2481
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:43,220
Huge time check.

2482
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:47,810
So to make the switch from non-health
consciousness to health consciousness,

2483
02:28:47,811 --> 02:28:52,520
it's like it's, it can be a grind that
can be harder. Yeah. [inaudible] path.

2484
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:55,250
Maintain the path. And it's already
instilled as being a young person.

2485
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:57,500
So there's that. So milk.

2486
02:28:57,530 --> 02:29:00,080
So my daughter comes home from
school literally yesterday.

2487
02:29:00,081 --> 02:29:03,920
Say they were teasing me because
I had carrots and she was,

2488
02:29:03,921 --> 02:29:08,090
she wasn't very happy about it. I was
due to start token fools out. Well,

2489
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:10,050
I started to say that, but you,

2490
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:12,530
it was no time for jokes at this
point cause she had been like,

2491
02:29:12,531 --> 02:29:13,700
are you serious or not? I'm like,

2492
02:29:13,730 --> 02:29:15,590
you don't wanna choke anyone for
teasing you for your carrots,

2493
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:19,580
but this is what I said. One
of the things I said, I said,

2494
02:29:19,730 --> 02:29:21,030
don't worry about them. T there's no,

2495
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:24,980
first of all there's nothing funny
about carrots like there it's not,

2496
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:26,960
I'm not saying it's like or so serious.

2497
02:29:26,961 --> 02:29:29,090
I'm just saying what's funny about
I don't get it kind of thing.

2498
02:29:29,091 --> 02:29:31,670
And she was like, yeah, that's kind of
true. And I was like, and guess what?

2499
02:29:31,671 --> 02:29:32,570
Carrots are good for you.

2500
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:34,880
Just like your lunch is good
for you and as you grew up,

2501
02:29:34,881 --> 02:29:37,880
you're going to see the results of that
and you're going to see the results of

2502
02:29:37,881 --> 02:29:41,620
them not eating, not healthy
food. And you're going to see,

2503
02:29:41,630 --> 02:29:44,180
you need to do better than
that as a father. Why?

2504
02:29:44,330 --> 02:29:48,410
Because you need a better teacher. No,
she needs to be like, they say, oh,

2505
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:51,740
what are you eating? P You eating
some, you eaten some carrots.

2506
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:55,820
And then she says, what do you eat
in there? Some type two diabetes,

2507
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:59,630
you're going to die at age 32
loser. Get out of my face, four,

2508
02:29:59,631 --> 02:30:02,600
I put you to sleep all the implement.

2509
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:05,570
You know that that direction is not
part of the way of the warrior kid code

2510
02:30:05,571 --> 02:30:10,070
right there. Negative. No, that's
are having fun. Fun is part of life.

2511
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:14,330
But I saw her wheels turning when
she was like, like yeah, you know,

2512
02:30:14,331 --> 02:30:17,420
like I will all see the results,
you know, and then you know,

2513
02:30:17,421 --> 02:30:20,540
then my wife's there and she's like, yeah
look, you're dead. How big is muscle?

2514
02:30:20,590 --> 02:30:21,423
All this stuff, right?

2515
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:24,950
So kind of close or your wife was
kind of like just making stuff up

2516
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:31,310
unless it worked, but go back
to [inaudible] or your kid milk.

2517
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:32,840
This is what you achieved with that.

2518
02:30:32,841 --> 02:30:37,841
One of the many things is you actually
made it like kind of cool to have a

2519
02:30:37,911 --> 02:30:39,770
healthy thing. Have a healthy snack.

2520
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:43,520
We're going to sway a lot of
people with these books and this,

2521
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:46,640
this stuff is what's going
to happen. I mean, I seen it.

2522
02:30:46,641 --> 02:30:49,210
It's not even going to happen. It
is happening. It's awesome to see.

2523
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:52,760
All right dude. We got to rock and roll.
Columbia. That was an important story.

2524
02:30:52,870 --> 02:30:56,050
I've got a long weldment anyways,

2525
02:30:56,890 --> 02:31:00,090
so we got Jocko white tea. How
about that? Tell me about it.

2526
02:31:00,140 --> 02:31:04,580
Drink it tastes good. Dead lift a thousand
pounds certified organic by the way.

2527
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:04,790
Yep.

2528
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:08,750
Certified organic and all that good stuff
and it tastes delicious and it looks

2529
02:31:08,751 --> 02:31:12,170
cool. So when you're
good and we have a store,

2530
02:31:13,410 --> 02:31:15,350
it's called chocolate store.

2531
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:18,930
So you're going to Jocko store.com
this is where you can get and,

2532
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:19,880
and get rash cards.

2533
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:22,690
You can get tee shirts, Huh?

2534
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:26,880
You can get truckers hats and if you're,

2535
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:30,780
if you're not into truckers hats
cause whatever, you can get.

2536
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:34,890
Flex fit hats. Yeah, Bruh.

2537
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:38,730
Flicks me down if ads are good
though, you don't get to judge hats.

2538
02:31:38,731 --> 02:31:43,440
You don't wear hats. They looked
stand down, stand down, stand down

2539
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:49,200
anyway. You want to represent
the pat. This is what it's for.

2540
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:53,310
It's quality stuff's not
ballpark. Give away a shirt.

2541
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:56,160
The one you never wear,
you use for like, you know,

2542
02:31:56,161 --> 02:31:57,750
wiping your hands in
the kitchen or whatever.

2543
02:31:58,020 --> 02:32:00,660
It's not that you're not gonna want
bands in the kitchen with these straight

2544
02:32:00,661 --> 02:32:05,610
about quality, quality,
quality and representation. Um,

2545
02:32:05,611 --> 02:32:07,980
so yeah. Listen, women stuff on
there yet. A lot of good stuff.

2546
02:32:07,981 --> 02:32:12,020
I'm going to have two more new
shirts coming out. Nice. New.

2547
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:16,220
I don't want to necessarily say just
shirts, but to more new items, things.

2548
02:32:16,550 --> 02:32:21,110
Sure. Coming up. Let's stand by

02:32:23,890 --> 02:32:26,480
We're not talking about subscribed to
a magazine cause no one gets magazines

2551
02:32:26,481 --> 02:32:31,340
anymore. Magazines are dead. Sure.
Right? By a magazine now. Well,

2552
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:35,060
you gotta have somebody bring them a
random bunch of papers to your house with

2553
02:32:35,061 --> 02:32:37,100
advertisement. You're not going
to do that. No one is that good.

2554
02:32:37,101 --> 02:32:39,380
So you're not gonna we're not talking
about subscribing to a magazine.

guys. I just, I got hit. I got hit today.

2558
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:56,840
Yeah, I got to hit kind
of hard. Somebody said,

2559
02:32:56,870 --> 02:33:01,450
is the warrior kid podcast
dead? I was like, Ooh,

2560
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:05,210
that stinks. That stinks.
Warrior podcast is not dead,

2561
02:33:05,720 --> 02:33:08,300
but the warrior kid podcast,

2562
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:13,460
I need to put more out so I needed a
little bit of time, which I'm making,

2563
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:19,100
but I need to get it done. So yes, while
you're kid podcasts, subscribe to that.

2564
02:33:19,130 --> 02:33:20,720
I'll get some new ones in there. Also,

2565
02:33:20,721 --> 02:33:24,200

so that everyone in the world

2569
02:33:38,980 --> 02:33:43,770

youtube. We have a youtube channel.

2570
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:45,270
Did you know that? Yes sir. I did.

2571
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:50,190
And it's called Jocko
podcast and it's on youtube.

2572
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:55,110
So podcast is not just a podcast where
it's audio only on the video version.

2573
02:33:55,111 --> 02:33:59,820
You can see us if you want to know
what John Stryker Meyer looks like,

2574
02:34:00,210 --> 02:34:03,990
you can watch this on youtube. This is
going to get a lot of views on youtube.

2575
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:09,000
Listen to the John Stryker Meyer
and hearing his stories. Yeah.

2576
02:34:09,030 --> 02:34:10,470
So check that out. Also,

2577
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:15,030
Echo Charles makes what he
calls enhanced videos. Yes.

2578
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:18,070
Some people might call them
distracting from the message,

2579
02:34:19,650 --> 02:34:20,483
sir. They might.

2580
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:25,120
Some people like them [inaudible]
they have millions of views.

2581
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:28,060
Some of your videos that you've
made, you know that Oh yeah,

2582
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:32,770
I did a lot of views. Well like
I said or like you said, yeah,

2583
02:34:32,771 --> 02:34:36,310
you can call them distract
chins on the message,

2584
02:34:36,311 --> 02:34:39,130
which I actually won't even
argue with it. Thank you.

2585
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:44,830
But some people look at
it or see it as enhanced.

2586
02:34:45,180 --> 02:34:48,820
Oh, put some music on there.
You put it enhances the message.

2587
02:34:48,821 --> 02:34:50,320
It's kind of like Kinda like,

2588
02:34:50,350 --> 02:34:52,990
you know when you have a dog and you
gotta feed them the heartworm pills,

2589
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:55,990
you know, where are the
pills? The heartworm pills
is good for them. It's good.

2590
02:34:56,020 --> 02:35:00,400
That message is good, but sometimes
you got to put it in the food,

2591
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:02,290
you know, so like tastes good.

2592
02:35:02,291 --> 02:35:06,130
It's like the message gets to deliver
my messages so hard to swallow that you

2593
02:35:06,131 --> 02:35:09,250
have to put like videos around it is
what I'm hearing music around it. Yes.

2594
02:35:09,251 --> 02:35:12,360
Sometimes break at the cellos
sometimes. Yes, yes. Hey,

2595
02:35:12,470 --> 02:35:14,620
so that's a youtube
channel. Check them out.

2596
02:35:15,010 --> 02:35:19,870
And then we also got psychological
warfare, which is on iTunes, Google play,

2597
02:35:19,871 --> 02:35:22,960
other MP3 platforms. And
if you want an alarm clock,

2598
02:35:24,010 --> 02:35:25,330
that's me talking.

2599
02:35:25,870 --> 02:35:28,500
Then you go to psychological
warfare and that's what you get and,

2600
02:35:28,590 --> 02:35:31,990
and you'll see that you can use it as
an alarm clock or you can use it as an

2601
02:35:31,991 --> 02:35:36,070
emergency, as an emergency air cover. Yes.

2602
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:39,730
Fire support. You're like, I'm not
sure if I should work out right now.

2603
02:35:39,731 --> 02:35:42,190
Press play. Yeah. On the,

2604
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:47,250
on the psychological warfare track that's
about not working out and you will get

2605
02:35:47,621 --> 02:35:51,820
up and you will go to the gym. Yup. If
you're about to eat some donuts. Yes.

2606
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:56,260
Or some chocolate chip cookies,
right? Sure. Chips Ahoy, whatever.

2607
02:35:56,261 --> 02:35:57,094
Chips Ahoy.

2608
02:35:57,750 --> 02:36:02,500
If you find a sleeve of random chips
ahoy hanging around somewhere, you know,

2609
02:36:02,530 --> 02:36:05,710
use that term for the first time
when it was, it was James Nielsen,

2610
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:10,920
what James Nielsen would talk about
eating a sleeve leaf or just get bathroom.

2611
02:36:13,930 --> 02:36:16,690
James Nelson for world's
toughest accountant. Agree? Yes.

2612
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:21,670
Black belt in Jujitsu
for a long time. Oh Gee.

2613
02:36:21,700 --> 02:36:25,710
American Jujitsu practitioners teaches on,

2614
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:29,350
on Saturdays here at
victory, MMA and fitness,

2615
02:36:29,351 --> 02:36:33,070
which by the way is our gym and San
Diego, California. Do you want to train?

2616
02:36:33,071 --> 02:36:35,620
So you know what's funny about that to
where you know how you say, Oh yeah,

2617
02:36:35,621 --> 02:36:38,830
to world's toughest accountant.
Any teaches, do, do two, two.

2618
02:36:38,831 --> 02:36:41,230
So teaching Jujitsu, that's
a job. Like that's a career.

2619
02:36:41,231 --> 02:36:43,630
Like you're a Jujitsu
instructor, but he's like,

2620
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:45,580
he's an accountant but
he just teaches you to,

2621
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:48,800
he's not like an accountant
is like some, you know,

2622
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:53,590
scraping by sort of getting old
and there's a few people like that.

2623
02:36:53,591 --> 02:36:54,130
You know why?

2624
02:36:54,130 --> 02:36:58,450
Because Teaching Jujitsu is fun and
it makes you better at Jujitsu better.

2625
02:36:58,480 --> 02:36:59,740
That's just how it is, man.

2626
02:36:59,741 --> 02:37:03,310
The nature of the game that's
on psychological warfare.

2627
02:37:03,730 --> 02:37:08,020
Also you can get it if you want some
visual representation of the path to keep

2628
02:37:08,021 --> 02:37:12,400
you there. You can go to flipside,
canvas.com run by my brother,

2629
02:37:12,401 --> 02:37:17,360
Dakota Meyer. He makes art with layers,

2630
02:37:17,570 --> 02:37:21,290
with layers. The layers are free.
Take while they, they're not free.

2631
02:37:21,291 --> 02:37:24,830
They come with the cost of the art
layers included, layers included.

2632
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:29,150
There you go. Yes, we've
designed some of the items there.

2633
02:37:29,660 --> 02:37:31,520
Yeah. You know, let them know like, hey,

2634
02:37:31,521 --> 02:37:35,300
this would be kind of cold right here
and if you want something just just

2635
02:37:35,301 --> 02:37:39,020
request to Cota on Twitter I think is
the best place. Yeah, and that's cool.

2636
02:37:39,420 --> 02:37:39,591
Flip side,

2637
02:37:39,591 --> 02:37:42,740
campus.com if you want to get some
cool stuff to hang up at your house,

2638
02:37:42,890 --> 02:37:46,940
back to psychological warfare, to
use that whole thing as a playlist.

2639
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:50,020
Psychological warfare, even
if it doesn't apply to you,

2640
02:37:50,030 --> 02:37:52,520
you know you're not eating donuts
Wa playlists while you work out.

2641
02:37:53,210 --> 02:37:56,150
Even if you're not eating donuts while
you workout, which most of us do not.

2642
02:37:56,750 --> 02:38:00,740
It still like it puts you in
this mindset of like, you know,

2643
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:02,910
working in reaping the
results of work. Yeah.

2644
02:38:03,050 --> 02:38:07,760
It goes back to the podcast and machete
season when they talk about how the

2645
02:38:07,761 --> 02:38:10,760
power of the audio into
your ear. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2646
02:38:10,790 --> 02:38:13,550
That's what's happening with psychological
warfare going right in your ear.

2647
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:15,160
You like you walk, you
get done. Listen to that.

2648
02:38:15,161 --> 02:38:17,780
You're not even thinking about the fact
that you're thinking about the fact

2649
02:38:18,430 --> 02:38:19,263
you're what I just said.

2650
02:38:19,400 --> 02:38:23,270
You're not thinking about the fact that
you are thinking about the fact that you

2651
02:38:23,271 --> 02:38:27,320
don't even want and don't want,
that you want to get in the gym,

2652
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:31,370
that you want to attack your project.
That's what's happening. It's true.

2653
02:38:31,371 --> 02:38:35,600
100% true. Also while you're
live, if you're lifting at home,

2654
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:38,600
if we're doing the lifting at
home, which I do, which you do,

2655
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:43,280
which a lot of us do, actually, people
hit me up, show me their home set up.

2656
02:38:43,460 --> 02:38:46,640
Awesome. You should have
kettlebells. In my opinion,

2657
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:51,880
kettlebells is one of the pretty much
the biggest as far as changes to my

2658
02:38:51,921 --> 02:38:56,900
workout, the most valuable change did
I changed my workout functionality,

2659
02:38:57,050 --> 02:39:01,640
functionality like the Benzos word.
One time I was doing a, you know,

2660
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:03,680
you gotta introduce the
risk control, you know,

2661
02:39:03,710 --> 02:39:06,440
and bearing levels of risk control
depending on the position there.

2662
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:11,480
I was rolling with the guy literally
like he's like trying to release my grip

2663
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:16,550
from his wrist or whatever and like
he's visibly angry because he couldn't.

2664
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:20,270
So I just sort of sat there and
just let them like do it, whatever.

2665
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:23,150
That was his technique cause technically
you should be able to get out of that

2666
02:39:24,320 --> 02:39:25,153
shit.

2667
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:29,360
But I've been doing those kettlebells
so my risk control is a lot.

2668
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:34,190
We'll say the effectiveness is a lot
higher on the less original point

2669
02:39:34,630 --> 02:39:36,500
kettlebells, this is where I
get my kettlebells from on it.

2670
02:39:36,590 --> 02:39:39,950
So you go to [inaudible] dot com slash
Jocko there you can get these kettlebells

2671
02:39:39,951 --> 02:39:44,570
and they're all the cool ones too by
the way. Like always say Darth Vader.

2672
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:49,490
My most recent one, storm Trooper
Kettlebell, my second most recent one,

2673
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:53,630
and not to mention all the other primal
bells and legend bills that I have from

2674
02:39:53,631 --> 02:39:54,110
there.

2675
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:59,090
Also at on it is the
electrolyte mineral mix.

2676
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:03,350
That's part of my daily mega
mix with Jockos discipline.

2677
02:40:04,130 --> 02:40:06,950
Like I said, the mineral electrolyte mix

2678
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:13,830
water, maybe a little Gatorade.
If, if I'm feeling a little feisty

thanks to all the veterans out there,

2740
02:44:04,450 --> 02:44:09,450
who volunteered and volunteered
and volunteered again to
do the hardest missions

2741
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:15,820
in the worst areas for zero
recognition by the way,

2742
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:18,940
not even from your own friends and family.

Those are true heroes and we
are forever indebted to them.

2744

I know that life can be stressful,

2749
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:55,020
but chances are you aren't surrounded by
elephant grass that is 12 feet tall and

2750
02:44:56,951 --> 02:44:58,360
burning and closing in on you.

2751
02:44:58,361 --> 02:45:01,330
Chances are you aren't being
assaulted by NVA soldiers.

2752
02:45:02,530 --> 02:45:05,290
Chances are you aren't facing death,

2753
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:10,360
but at the same time,

2754
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:14,350
actually you are facing death.

2755
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:19,810
We are all facing death. So remember,

2756
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:22,300
like John striker, Myers said,

2757
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:27,010

2758
02:45:27,420 --> 02:45:28,253
Yeah.

2759
02:45:28,930 --> 02:45:32,680

02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:36,250
So go out there.

2761
02:45:37,330 --> 02:45:37,880
Okay.

2762
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:42,450
