00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.920
As the years go by, movie fans learn each
and every thing there is to know about their

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.160
favorite films.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.020
But sometimes, a single detail or two that
could explain plot holes and dangling plot

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.210
threads is missed.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.720
Funny, informative, or downright disturbing,
it's these little known secrets that can forever

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.520
change the way you see your favorite movies.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.390
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Details
That Completely Change Popular Films.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.390
Fight Club

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.520
Most fans of the Ed Norton/Brad Pitt mind
bender will assume that Fight Club follows

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.430
the novel it's based on to the letter.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430
But the endings are actually completely different.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.141
In the movie, Tyler Durden is killed be the
narrator, forced to watch as the bombs he

00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:48.579
planted level skyscrapers, hopefully tearing
down civilization and the economy along with

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.579
it.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.040
In the book, things go differently: Tyler
still disappears, but the bombs never blow.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.310
Instead, the narrator wakes up in a mental
hospital he confuses with heaven, eventually

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.220
visited by his followers, who are still on
a mission to build a new society.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.489
It changes the message of the movie completely,
but even the novel’s author has admitted

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.510
he likes the movie's ending better - so you
shouldn't believe EVERYTHING you read.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.070
The Matrix&nbsp;

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.939
Some leaps in logic or suspension of disbelief
are needed for the basic premise of The Matrix,

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.310
since computers using people for electricity
doesn't work quite as well as the movie suggests.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.670
But the original plan made a lot more sense,
with Machines using human brains as processors.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.229
That's the reason a human born in the system
could use "mind over matter" to gain control

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.229
over The Matrix.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.509
In the end, the idea was a bit too complicated
to explain, so the directors opted for a simpler

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.509
premise.

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.509
E.T.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:35.509
The Extraterrestrial

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.990
Steven Spielberg's alien movie was a monumental
hit, but the story of E.T. started as something

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.399
much, much darker.

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.080
The original idea focused on ten evil alien
visitors capable of killing cows with a single

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.159
outstretched finger.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.049
One of the aliens, named Buddy, wasn't as
evil as his friends, and wound up becoming

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.789
friends with a young boy.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.029
Spielberg eventually realized the story worked
better as a kids' movie, and kept the rest

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:57.060
of E.T.'s race off-screen.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.289
Thankfully, E.T.'s glowing finger didn't instantly
kill the things it touched, either.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.289
Monsters Inc.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.060
The idea for Pixar's monster movie changed
several times over the years, with one version

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.400
of Monsters Inc. following George Sanderson,
a “scarer” who couldn't scare kids - until

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.540
he met a little girl who faced terror daily
from her older brothers.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.690
As the girl told George to be scary, she overcame
fears of her own.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.760
The story was originally changed, but George
appears just as he would have, as the victim

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.790
of constant decontamination.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.909
The Avengers

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.180
The Wasp may finally be coming to Marvel's
movie universe, but the superheroine was originally

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.459
going to make her debut in the first Avengers
team-up.

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.060
Director Joss Whedon eventually decided against
it, and claimed that he loved the heroine

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.189
too much, using her - a completely new character
- to bounce off the other Avengers, eventually

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.560
making her the biggest star.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.360
In the end, she was replaced by Black Widow.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.140
Which helps explain why the un-superpowered,
quick-witted SHIELD agent was given a spot

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.360
on the team without anyone batting an eye.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.849
The LEGO Movie

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.819
No one could have known how successful a movie
made of LEGO could be, but the original script

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.159
had a completely different take on its star
- and the movie cameos that would appear.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.890
It was originally going to be Indiana Jones
who lost the Kragle to the movies’ villain,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.219
who had to recruit the insanely creative builder
Emmet to save the day.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.689
The duo would have used portals to jump from
worlds based on Lord of the Rings and Star

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:08.689
Wars.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.370
The latter still showed up in the finished
movie, but it missed out on the best moment,

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.640
when Emmet and LEGO Indiana Jones came face
to face with LEGO Han Solo - with Harrison

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.390
Ford voicing both of his iconic roles in one
scene.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.379
We're keeping our fingers crossed for the
sequel.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.379
James Bond

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.440
These days, it's a name famous for deadliness,
charm, secret missions to save the world,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.590
and a love of vodka martinis.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.860
But when author Ian Fleming created 007, his
vision for the secret agent was a different

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.930
one: basically, a dull everyman who was always
surrounded by insane villains and dangers.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.469
With that in mind, he searched for the absolute
dullest, most boring name imaginable - and

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.090
he found it in author and ornithologist James
Bond.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.379
Bond's most well known book even makes an
appearance in Die Another Day, in the hands

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.709
of a more exciting agent than ever intended.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.719
Batman Returns

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.329
Tim Burton's Batman sequel may not have been
the universal hit of his original, but the

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.459
director's vision of Catwoman and Penguin
are impossible to forget.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.640
They weren't the only famous Batman characters
originally planned to appear, either.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.879
Tim Burton had officially cast actor Marlon
Wayans to play Robin, recruited by Batman

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.900
to take down these new threats to Gotham City.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.170
When the movie got too crowded, Wayans was
cut, and replaced as Robin in Batman Forever.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.900
They ahd even manfacrued toys for the Wayans
character.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.550
Audiences never got to see that take on the
Boy Wonder, but Wayans made out all right:

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.110
he still got paid for his two-picture deal,
and apparently still earns residuals from

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.740
the movie he never appeared in.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.740
Gremlins

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.910
Most of the marketing for the movie focused
on the innocent little creature that accidentally

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.250
spawns the troublemaking Gremlins, but it's
never explained why something so terrible

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.010
could come from a sweet little pet like Gizmo.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.510
The original plan for the movie gives an answer,
since Gizmo winds up as the Gremlins leader,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.690
and the mastermind behind the whole terrifying
attack that follows.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.590
It seems they changed that for the finished
movie - either that, or Gizmo actually was

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.380
the villain, and just kept it quiet.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.380
Star Wars

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.390
Every fan of the Skywalker Saga has to have
wondered: did Obi-Wan Kenobi really think

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.530
that Luke wouldn't eventually find out that
Darth Vader was his father?

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.230
It seems weird that the Jedi would force Luke
to hear it from the worst possible person,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.280
but a deleted scene recently surfaced that
helps explain it.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:13.150
Apparently, it was Yoda who ordered Obi-Wan
to keep it a secret, with a plan to train

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.240
Luke in the ways of The Force to defeat Vader,
without him ever learning it was his father

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.240
under the mask.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.410
The scene didn't make the cut, but it's a
surprising sinister side of Yoda that shows

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.070
he's not as cute or cuddly as he might seem...

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.131
Those are the game-changing secrets and story
details we found in hit movies, but which

00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:29.500
ones did we miss?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.570
