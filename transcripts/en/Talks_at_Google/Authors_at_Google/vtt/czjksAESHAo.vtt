LAURA: Hi, everyone and welcome.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.330
And thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.280
My name is Laura.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.650
I work on accessibility
here at Google.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.550
It's great to be here today.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.290
And accessibility is something
that's really, really critical

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.961
and core to our
mission here at Google.

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.460
To organize the
world's information,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.650
make it universally
accessible and useful.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.870
And 15% of the global population
has some form of disability.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.420
And we need to be thinking
about how people are actually

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.142
interacting with our interfaces
and with our devices.

00:00:39.142 --> 00:00:41.100
Kind of stripping away
those assumptions of how

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.724
we might think that
they're interacting

00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:46.129
and really building
inclusive products.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.420
When we are thinking about
the principles of accessible

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.900
design, it's often helpful to
kind of break down the groups

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.410
into personas of users and think
about the different interaction

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.430
models that people may be using.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.830
So we can break down into
a few different groups.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.430
For example, maybe thinking
about blind or low vision

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
users, deaf or hard of
hearing users, people

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.310
with motor dexterity
challenges, and people

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.920
who are considered
neurologically diverse,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.070
or who have a range of
intellectual disabilities.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.740
But there's a huge
population of people

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.710
that absolutely needs to be
factored into this discussion.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.020
And that's the aging
population, which

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.810
has been growing and growing
since life expectancies have

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.096
thankfully been
increasing over the years.

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:28.470
And the World
Health Organization

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.430
estimates that by 2050
over 2 billion people

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.970
will be over the age of 60.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.630
It's a huge population.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.290
And as we all age we may
experience disabilities

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.500
in different ways.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.070
We may experience just
slight deterioration

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.180
of certain senses, of vision,
of hearing, of dexterity,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.870
for example.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.640
Many other sorts of things.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.240
So as technologists it's
really, really important

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.570
for us to factor in the needs
of this very important and very

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.872
large population.

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:00.330
So we're super
excited about today.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.980
Tim?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.560
TIM: Jeff Johnson is a
professor of computer science

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530
at the University
of San Francisco.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.000
There he teaches courses
that introduce students

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.120
to computer science
and also special topics

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.400
in human-computer interaction.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.070
Beyond academia, Jeff has
worked as a UI designer

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.360
and implementer, an engineering
manager, a usability tester,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.390
and a researcher at companies
like Cromemco, Xerox,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.770
US West, Hewlett-Packard
Labs, and Sun Microsystems.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.990
Building on a PhD
in psychology, Jeff

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.960
has spent decades contributing
to our understanding

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.240
of human-computer interaction.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.310
He's addressed both
technical and social issues

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.370
including working as chair
of Computer Professionals

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.570
for Social Responsibility in
the late '80s and early '90s.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.720
In 2016, Professor
Johnson was recognized

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.180
with a Lifetime Achievement
in Practice Award

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.630
from SIGCHI, the ACM
special interest group

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.300
on computer-human interaction.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.970
At the award ceremony, Stanford
professor Terry Winograd

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.250
cited the influence of
Professor Johnson's books

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.320
on interface design.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.070
Many of these books
stem from the idea

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.820
that you learn more
from things that don't

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.570
work than from things that do.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.674
Today, Professor Johnson
will be sharing lessons

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:16.590
that he's learned from
things that don't work.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.050
Because our bodies
change with age.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.520
In designing user interfaces
for an aging population,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.860
Jeff and his
collaborator Kate Finn

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.500
have built a
comprehensive resource

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.810
for technology
developers seeking

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.530
to produce products that can
be easily and successfully used

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.480
by older adults.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.994
Please join me now in welcoming
Jeff and Kate to Google Today.

00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:42.898
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.090
JEFF JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.711
Is my microphone loud enough?

00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:50.210
It is?

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.700
OK, good.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.710
I want to thank Tim
and Laura for giving

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.830
the first half of my talk.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.610
So this talk is
going to be based

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.240
on a book that Kate Finn,
who's sitting back there,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.670
and I wrote.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.820
The book is over there.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.690
And apparently Tim is going
to be giving away copies of it

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.796
later.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.170
And then there's
some other books

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.120
I wrote sitting there
for you to look at.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.910
OK, so the population of the
world is aging on the average.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.870
People live longer.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.490
Birth rates are low.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.450
And so humanity on the
average is growing older.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.280
So let's look at some
numbers so that we

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.130
can see how much it's changing.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.690
These are the top 10 countries
in the world that have

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.900
populations of people over 50.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.310
And by the way, in
our book we use 50

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.030
as the line for
indicating older adults.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.920
The reason that we
picked that number

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.550
is that most of the research
that we read in preparation

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.490
of the book uses that number.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.950
So that age is an arbitrary age.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.170
Some researchers talk about 60.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.910
Some use 65.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.710
But the bulk of them use 50.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.660
And so we decided
to use that number.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.290
OK, so if we look at
these top 10 countries,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.450
China has nearly 400 million
people over the age of 50.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.820
India has about 230 million.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.530
The US is third.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.150
Japan is fourth
and coming up fast.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:41.180
It's got the most rapidly
growing percentage

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.460
of people over 50.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.940
We can also look at the
information this way.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.350
If you look at--

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.640
in 2015, basically
almost 20% of people

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.290
in the less developed areas
of the world were over 50.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.690
Now, in the less
developed world, or what

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.020
we call the developing
world, population rates--

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.390
population growth
rates tend to be--

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.190
birthrates tend to be higher.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.030
And therefore, there's a larger
percentage of younger adults.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.230
And so the average
age of the population

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.276
tends to be lower than
in the developed world.

00:06:27.276 --> 00:06:28.650
So in the developed
world, we can

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.280
see that in 2015
there was nearly 40%

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.670
of the population over 50.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.470
And then as you can
see, the numbers

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.235
are expected to grow over
the next several decades.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.610
Yet another way to look
at what's going on is--

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.260
people say, well, old
people don't use technology.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.580
They don't go online.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.000
But that's not really true,
as we can see from this chart.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.380
This is broken
out by age groups.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:12.240
And so as you can see, the
18- to 29-year-olds have

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:19.800
pretty much been online and
are still that way nearly 100%.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.000
The next age group
is slightly less.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.710
And then when we get
to 50-year-olds to 64,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.050
it's slightly less.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.400
But it's still growing.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.630
And then the fastest growing
demographic on online

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.220
is people over 65.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.250
Now, this is a little bit--
this graph is a little bit

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.270
problematic.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.430
Because although
it sort of seems

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:54.300
to show these growth rates,
it's problematic because people

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.400
who are in one age group
age into another age group.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.030
And therefore, of
course, this lower line

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.280
is going to go up as
the people who were

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.310
on this line become over 65.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.970
So this chart has been
shown by Pew Internet

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.930
to show that people are
increasingly going online.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.350
But I have some questions
about this chart.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.810
So I prefer to look at it more
like this, where we take people

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.080
by birth generation,
which you don't move out

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.669
of your birth generation.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.370
You stay in it.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.010
So we have millennials, age--

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:44.310
people who were,
in 2016, 18 to 34.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.120
Then we have Gen-X,
younger boomers, et cetera.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.340
And we can look at the
percentages of them

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.300
that have adopted
technology, what

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.340
we call digital technology.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.540
Now, when we say technology
in this talk or when I say it,

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.910
I essentially mean
digital technology.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.490
Because of course, a horse
and a buggy is technology.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.370
It's just older technology.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:15.030
So the question is
where are people--

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.840
what kind of technology
are people using?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.720
So for the purpose
of the talk, I'm

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.940
referring to digital technology.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.910
We can also break
it up by device.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:30.690
So we can see that
for tablets, there's

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.840
not a lot of
variability in who's

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.110
using tablets by age group.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.110
There's some, but
not a whole lot.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.880
There's not that much with
cell phones of all types.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.660
Nearly 100% of people 18 to 29--

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.460
or actually, it is--

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.240
Pew puts it at 100% are using--

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.940
and again, we're talking
about the developed world--

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.500
are using digital
technology or cell phones.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.940
And it doesn't vary
that much by age.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.890
The oldest age group,
65 and over, is at 80%.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.660
But when we look at
smartphones, there

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.340
is more of an age disparity.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.020
But again, those bars
are all going up.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.000
And especially the
smartphone for a 65-plus.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.160
That's going up.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.410
Two years ago it was at 30%.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.800
Now it's at 42.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.980
OK, so it's going up.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.030
Laptops, and desktops,
and tablets, actually,

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.030
have been seen to slip
in the general population

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.590
over the last couple of years,
according to Pew Research.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.500
They've started to
drop a little bit.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.040
Now, the interesting thing about
the older than 50 population

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.380
is that technology,
digital technology,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.760
can actually help
them quite a bit.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.870
And here are some
quotes that were gleaned

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.670
from online sources of people
writing comments in response

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.460
to articles about
technology and older adults.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.650
And so here's an
example of a quote.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.740
"A Mac laptop opened
the world to me,

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.800
right here from
my kitchen table."

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.810
And it helped me because
of my physical disability.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.550
My mobility is limited.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.530
So this one, for the
benefit of people

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.980
who may not be able to
see this very well says,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.218
"I can keep in touch with
people all over the world."

00:11:48.218 --> 00:11:52.170
This one, "I feel so connected
in so much of the world.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.150
Art, music, nature,
comedy, humanity."

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.070
And this one says, "Technology
has helped me move 19 times

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.100
in the past nine years,
taking everything with me."

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.310
"I can't imagine going back
to life without a computer."

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.460
So these are the kinds
of things that technology

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:14.070
can do for people whose mobility
is a little bit limited,

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.970
or who are socially isolated.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.070
On the other hand, if we don't
design the technology well,

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.330
then we'll also get comments
like these, which are also

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.750
gleaned from online sources.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.100
"How can I make the font bigger?

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.970
I can't see it!"

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.300
I wish they'd stop changing
things for no good reason.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.030
All the technology is
just so confusing to me.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.210
"Who thought thin grey
letters was a good idea?"

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.800
I hear that one a lot.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.750
"So much to remember!"

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.010
"What happened to the menus?"

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.750
"I don't know
where to get help."

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.720
"Is this the
website, or an app?"

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.690
Actually, that's-- I don't
think that's so age dependent.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.120
A lot of my students at USF
don't know the difference

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.530
between a website and an app.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.220
"Where did my cursor go?"

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.100
Those kind of things.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.810
So poorly designed
technology can

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.980
lead to these kinds of problems
especially for older adults.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.830
Now, these problems are not
restricted to older adults.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.280
But they impact older adults.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.950
They tend to impact
older adults more

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.480
than the general population.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.820
So illegible text,
bad passwords,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.240
hard to remember
passwords, CAPTCHAs,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.780
small targets, and the
difficulty of getting

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.350
tech support.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.880
Those are all problems that
lots of people encounter.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.070
But older adults
encounter them more often.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.240
So let me just show you
an example of someone who

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:01.360
is in a usability test
that Kate and I conducted

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.490
a few years ago.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.720
We were looking at older adults
using travel websites that

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.610
were aimed at older adults.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.720
So you may not know, but
there's a whole industry--

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.760
there's a whole segment
of the travel industry

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.540
that's aimed at people who
are essentially retired.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.490
Because they have
money and time.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.320
So there are various companies.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.670
And so we tried a bunch of those
websites with older adults.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.620
Some of whom are
frequent travelers.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:36.350
So these are not people
who are homebound people.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.710
And so you get quotes--
you get situations

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.277
like this in the test.

00:14:40.277 --> 00:14:41.650
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.040
- So at this point,
if you were really

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.320
looking for a trip, what would
you do next if we weren't here.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.290
What do you think?

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.465
- I would screw this.

00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:52.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.110
- I would say, if
I can't get to what

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:01.320
I want in reasonable
tries, then this is not--

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.322
I don't want to go
to this company.

00:15:03.322 --> 00:15:04.549
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:06.340
JEFF JOHNSON: So they
just lost a customer.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:14.310
So there's a
researcher in Britain

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.250
named Alan F. Newell, who is
different from the Alan Newell

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.470
that many of us know
in the United States.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.380
But this is Alan
F. Newell who has

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.040
been researching designing for
older adults for many years.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.010
And his famous-- one
of his famous quotes

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.960
is, "Design for older
adults, and you design

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.960
for almost everyone else."

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.290
There are many populations that
have similar usability issues

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.980
to older adults.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.690
People with low vision, physical
impairments, low literacy,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.600
little or obsolete technical
experience, second language

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.650
learners, and
cognitive impairments.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:56.700
As we get older, people
often get these kind

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.550
of disabilities occurring.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.170
And it varies
tremendously, as you know.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.990
There are some
people who at age 95

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.940
are running marathons
and writing books.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.840
And there are other
people who at age 60

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.310
are not capable of
those kinds of things.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.310
And the other point
you can make is

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:28.620
that everyone is impaired
at least some of the time.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.990
Even young people can have
trouble in some situations.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.100
We often use the word
situationally disabled.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:39.000
So you could have somebody who
was trying to use their cell

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.500
phone on a bus.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.120
And the bus happens
to be driving down--

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.370
I don't know if you've been
to San Francisco recently,

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.160
but many streets
in San Francisco

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.110
are currently being torn
up as PG&amp;E tries to update

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.210
50-year-old gas lines.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.830
And so all these
streets are torn up.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.130
And so the buses, and taxis,
and Uber cars, and everything

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.140
are bouncing along like this.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.600
And people are trying
to use their cell phones

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.480
and having trouble texting.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.420
And then, of course, you
have very common situations

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.839
like this one, like someone
trying to use a cell

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.329
phone while riding a horse.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.490
But the point is that
the world shakes.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.329
And therefore you
suddenly have tremors.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.359
You have hand tremors.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:28.710
So it's not just for old people
that we're designing this,

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.130
that we're trying to make
the technology accessible.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.590
In fact, we can
look at it as trying

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.300
to build the digital
equivalent of curb cuts.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.150
Because if you're
familiar with curb cuts,

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.380
they were mandated by
city ordinances that--

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.750
and maybe state ordinances--
that try to make sure that

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.610
everyone--

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:55.110
that people in wheelchairs
could use sidewalks.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:59.970
But the percentage of people who
use wheelchairs over curb cuts

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.050
is actually very low compared
to people on skateboards, people

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.790
pulling roller bags, people
pushing shopping carts, people

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.960
pushing all sorts
of wheeled devices.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.660
So curb cuts actually
help a large segment

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.400
of the population,
even though they

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.510
were put in place specifically
for people in wheelchairs.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.070
That's what we're looking for.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.540
Another example of
that kind of technology

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.850
is OXO kitchen appliances.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.610
How many of you are familiar
with OXO kitchen appliances?

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.480
Anyone?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:40.200
So the story is that this guy
who was kind of an inventor

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.800
noticed that his wife, who
had arthritis in her hands,

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.920
was having difficulty slicing--

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.150
peeling the potatoes.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:55.080
And rather than helping
her peel the potatoes,

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.900
he invented a special
potato peeler for her.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.150
Which his friends
started saying,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.150
hey, that's really cool.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.040
I want one.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.650
I want one.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.180
I want one.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.230
I want one.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.450
And so he launched this
company and started

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.460
making these things.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.350
And now they're famous for
making ergonomically designed

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.910
kitchen appliances.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.660
So that's what we're looking
for in the digital world.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.020
Things that can help
make digital technology

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.332
more accessible to older
adults and everyone else

00:19:28.332 --> 00:19:29.040
at the same time.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.930
Well, we've been
doing user interface

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.850
design for a long time.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.050
There's a big user interface
design group here at Google.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.940
They went to some of
the same universities

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.540
and took some of the
same courses that I did.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.280
We should all know how
to do this by now, right?

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.580
The problem is that we don't.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:05.190
And some of the reasons are
given here in this list.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.900
We tend to design for
people like ourselves.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.320
Technology producers
tend to be somewhat young

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.568
and have little experience
with older adults.

00:20:17.568 --> 00:20:22.740
And if you just
provide them with data,

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.770
that's not good enough.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:28.200
It doesn't make enough
of an impression.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.060
Older adults are
often not included

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.480
in usability tests
or user research

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.695
for logistical reasons.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.930
And some people just don't
think aging is a sexy topic.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.220
So it often gets ignored.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.980
There's also an
argument out there

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.730
that Kate and I have heard,
and you probably heard, too,

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:59.329
which is that, well, you
know, old people today

00:20:59.329 --> 00:21:00.870
who don't know how
to use technology,

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.520
they're going to die.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.920
And so let's not
worry about that.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.270
Because everyone who's
grown up with technology

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.590
is going to grow up.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.940
And they're going to
know how to use it.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.000
And therefore, we don't
need to design especially

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.910
for those old people.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.140
And so the terminology
that's been used is--

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.110
we refer to digital natives
versus digital immigrants.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.620
So technically, I'm
a digital immigrant.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.290
Because when I was
born, digital technology

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.320
didn't really much exist.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.630
Or at least it wasn't
used by the public.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:44.610
And so I didn't grow up with
it until I was in college.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.310
And especially true
for my parents.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.900
My parents were not--

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.010
did not grow up with it.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.050
So we're digital immigrants.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.290
And then the people who
grew up with the technology

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.560
all their lives, essentially,
are called the digital natives.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.010
And so the idea of
this argument is,

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.080
just wait until the
digital natives take over,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.820
and everything will be fine.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.830
We won't have to
design especially

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.600
for those older adults.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.640
That argument
doesn't hold water.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.890
And I'll show you why.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.440
We're familiar mostly
with these generations.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.920
So there's the GI Generation,
Silent Generation,

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.570
Baby Boomers, et cetera.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:32.330
And the blue bars show the
ages in which they were born.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:38.020
So those generations are
defined by the range of years

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.290
in which they were born.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.950
And so we can see
when the GI Generation

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.700
was born on this chart.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.180
We can see when the
Silent Generation, which

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.910
is my parents, were born.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.970
Baby Boomers, which is
the generation I'm in.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.040
Generation X, Millennials,
and Generation Z, Homeland.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.500
Those are the kids who
are being born now.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.920
And so the Millennials are my
students, my college students

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.510
right now.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:10.810
But what's important is not the
age at which these people were

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.360
born, these
generations were born.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.180
What's important is
the age at which--

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.160
what was going on
in the world when

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.590
they were between 10 and 25.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.620
Because those are known as
the formative years where

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.490
they become used to
whatever technology

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.250
has existed at the time.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.040
So we look at that.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.790
And we can see that these are
the bands of age at which each

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.830
of those generations are--

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.130
sorry, these are
the spans of years

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.100
at which each of
these generations

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.360
is between 10 and 25.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.770
So we look at those.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.790
And then we take
that and project--

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.920
we're going to project
that onto this graph, which

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.320
is a different graph.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.940
This one shows
the range of years

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.600
in which certain kinds of
technology were dominant.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.670
So we call this
technology generations.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:10.160
So we can see that
1900 to the late '30s

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.920
was that the mechanical era.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.050
Equipment was mechanical.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:20.810
And from the late '30s to 1960
was electromechanical era.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.380
I remember as a child, Hoover
vacuum cleaners and things

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.440
like that, things that were
partly electrical and partly

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.580
mechanical.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.720
But I grew up mainly in
the analog electronic age.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.600
And then there was the personal
computer and basic internet

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.510
age, the web search
and e-commerce age,

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.950
which hasn't ended yet.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.090
Digital music,
social, and mobiles,

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.940
which haven't ended yet.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:52.220
So the question is, how
do the human generations'

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.960
formative years compare
to these time bands?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:04.250
And what we see is that each
of the human generations

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.150
kind of span a couple of
different technology eras.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:13.040
So my parents, who were
in the silent generation,

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.070
grew up partly in
electromechanical and partly

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.190
in the analog electronic age.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.090
You know, those stereos
that us old people

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.930
have in our living rooms now.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.240
It's analog electronic.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.680
And then personal
computer, Gen-X started out

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.950
with the personal computer
and basic internet age.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:42.370
But was still in
their formative years

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.040
when the web search
and e-commerce started.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.650
And a little bit when
digital music started.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.760
And then we have the
millennials who grew up mostly

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.780
in the era of these
technologies, social and

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.520
mobile, digital music.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.430
And Gen Z, of course,
who are being born now,

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.810
they're going to grow up
with all of this stuff.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:09.880
OK, so let's look exactly
at what some of that means.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.840
In the analog electronic world
that, let's say, I grew up

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.940
with, there is no notion of
navigating through a user

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.290
interface.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.830
That is to say, a user
interface is all there

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.620
on the control panel.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.330
And so there's the television.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.500
There's the controls.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.874
And maybe there
are some controls

00:26:30.874 --> 00:26:33.190
on the back that
I hardly ever use.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.600
And there's the phone.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.580
And there's all the
controls for it.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.130
There's the Zenith radio
and all the controls for it.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.600
There's my auto dashboard.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.160
And there's all the
controls for it.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.300
I do not have to navigate
through the user interface.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.020
So say you grew up with
that notion of the world.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.780
And then suddenly you're
plopped into a world

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.552
in which there are multiple
applications on a screen.

00:26:59.552 --> 00:27:01.510
And you have to figure
out which one you're in.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:06.580
And go from one page
to the next page.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.330
And then you look at your phone.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.500
And now one moment
it looks like this.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.690
And the next moment
it looks like that.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.470
So you have to actually
get from one place

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.860
to another in the
user interface.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.480
That's a foreign concept.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.670
You did not grow up with that.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.390
You had to learn that
after you were 25.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.730
And that's not necessarily easy.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:41.250
And here's a Tesla
instrument panel one minute.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.230
And that's the same instrument
panel the next minute.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:51.600
So you're having to learn
a whole new paradigm

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.730
for interacting with technology.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.390
So that's why those technology
generations and the position

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.660
of your generation
while you were

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.195
doing your formative
years, why that matters.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.780
OK, so there's all that.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:16.770
That's a whole packet of reasons
why the age-friendly design

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.530
problem will not disappear.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:23.160
But there is yet another
reason, which is that most of us

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.560
experience age-related changes.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.670
And those are not going
to go away, either.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.320
OK, so those
age-related changes are

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.080
going to happen to your
children and their children,

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.310
as well as to us.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.270
And those changes occur
in vision, motor control,

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.420
speech and hearing, cognition,
attention, learning, memory,

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.150
and knowledge, and attitude.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.840
And I would have to say
the bulk of the book talks

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.310
about these changes.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.530
There's a chapter devoted to
each one of those bullets.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.500
What are the changes?

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.940
And then what do you do to
design so that you don't--

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.380
those changes are not a barrier?

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.620
Now, before I go
into those changes--

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.550
because this talk and be
depressing up to this point.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.570
When you look at that,
and you go, oh my gosh.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.240
What do I have to
look forward to?

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.530
Nothing.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.470
OK, so here's a slide
about some good things

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:29.260
about aging, which Kate
prompted me to put into here.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.320
So that we wouldn't
all commit Hari Kari.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.010
Oh, did I just turn
off the microphone?

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.540
Is it still on?

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.150
OK, good.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:43.540
So cognitive psychologists
make a distinction

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.880
between crystallized
versus fluid intelligence.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.150
Fluid intelligence
is-- and both of them

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:53.950
are measured, to a certain
extent, by intelligence tests.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.060
Crystallized intelligence is
what you would call knowledge.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.760
And of course, that
grows with age.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.130
Fluid intelligence
is the ability

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.950
to solve novel
problems on the spot.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.720
And that increases with
age until a certain age.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.170
And then starts to decline.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.074
And again, it's highly variable.

00:30:14.074 --> 00:30:15.490
In some people it
doesn't decline.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.890
And in others, it
declines steeply.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.910
Greater vocabulary with age.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.070
More real-world
experience to draw from.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.320
Less tendency to worry.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.960
Higher rates of
life satisfaction.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.950
Senior discounts.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.250
And as someone said, it's
better than the alternative.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:41.710
OK, so because my
talk is supposedly

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.190
limited to about
40 minutes, I am

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:50.030
going to not cover all of
the age-related changes

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.490
that the book covers.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.550
Not even close.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.910
I'm just going to
sample a couple of them.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.066
And if you're
interested, you can

00:30:57.066 --> 00:30:58.690
read the book, which
apparently they're

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.720
going to be giving
away some copies of.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.530
Or at least giving
them to groups,

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:06.330
I guess, to have as a resource.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.310
So with vision,
for example, these

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.560
are the kinds of
things that can occur.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.420
Don't necessarily occur.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.300
But they can occur.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.660
So decreased ability
to focus close,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.730
or farsightedness is
another way of putting it.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.820
Presbyopia is the
technical term.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.220
Lower sensitivity to light,
heightened sensitivity

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.183
to glare, lens
yellowing, et cetera.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.460
So here are some examples.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.530
So if you're looking at
a screen of a cell phone,

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:45.440
and your vision is normal,
what's depicted on the left

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.650
is supposedly that.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.120
So what that is is just a
standard screen of some app.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.120
And then if you have
presbyopia or farsightedness,

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.930
and you've forgotten
your reading glasses,

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.450
which I apparently
have forgotten.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:04.870
I normally carry them here.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.600
You might not be able to
read what's on the screen

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.580
if the font is too small,
or the text is too light.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.260
Then glare sensitivity is
just what it sounds like.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.170
Because of a
lifetime of exposure

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.470
to scratches and things,
your cornea and your retina

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.150
might be scratched.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.790
Not retina, but your cornea and
your lens might be scratched.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.120
And therefore, you are
going to experience glare.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.080
And that might
inhibit your ability

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.960
to read, or to see detail,
or to work at night.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.360
I have friends who are
my age who will not

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.890
drive at night anymore, because
the lights on oncoming cars

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.080
are too glaring to them.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.750
But consider this.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.150
You're 28 years old.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.310
And you go out to
the swimming pool.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.440
And you pull out your phone.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.740
And the sun's glaring down on
the screen that's not designed

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.440
for sun glaring down on it.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.390
So glare sensitivity is not
restricted to older adults.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:15.100
In some situations, it can be
applied to people of all ages.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.660
Then we have lens
yellowing, which

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:20.980
is when your lens,
exposed ultraviolet light

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.020
over many years, becomes--

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.530
your lens and your
cornea become yellowed.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:31.540
And therefore, any app
that uses blue versus

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.080
green as a information
carrying element

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.050
becomes hard to distinguish.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.660
Or if as I've seen some
apps, some news apps,

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:46.000
put ads or pseudo news
with a yellow background.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.010
Well, everything's
yellow on my screen.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.810
So I can't see those.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.260
And then reduced
light sensitivity.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.620
The average 60-year-old needs
three times as much light

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.790
as a 20-year-old to be able to
perceive the same brightness.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.910
And so things are
going to look darker.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.679
What we often do when
Kate and I actually

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.810
give a workshop on
this topic is we

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.310
bring in a whole
bunch of sunglasses

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.080
and have people in
the room put them on.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.290
And then it makes
the whole room dark.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.889
And that's what some people
experience when they get older.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.469
So some examples.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.920
For example, tiny text.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.469
So tiny text is a
rampant problem.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.440
Everyone complains about it.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.360
Everyone over 50 complains
about it pretty much.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.280
And so the Social
Security Administration,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.110
which you would think would
be aimed at older adults,

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.260
their web site--

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.929
let's just say the
method that they

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:58.237
provide for making the
font larger is not so easy.

00:34:58.237 --> 00:35:00.320
Because what happens is
you go to their home page.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.090
You say, hmm, I can't
read some of this.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.830
Let me make the font bigger.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.160
So you scroll down
to the bottom.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:13.800
You see-- you look carefully,
if you can read any of this.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.080
Eventually you find-- let's see.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.740
Accessibility is
what I'm looking for.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.474
And I'm not even seeing it here.

00:35:24.474 --> 00:35:25.140
Oh, there it is.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.050
Yes, right there.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.960
OK.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:33.060
By the way, visual search
among older adults slows down.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.365
OK, so anyway.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.380
We'll come back to that.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:43.200
So you click on Accessibility,
if you can find it.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.560
And then it takes you to
this accessibility page.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.990
Which you then scroll down.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:54.835
And it says, I
can't see very well.

00:35:54.835 --> 00:35:56.920
As soon as you see that.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.060
You see, I can't see very well.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.870
If you can find it, then you
click on, Increase Text Size.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.410
And you would expect that
to increase the text size.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:08.400
But what does it do?

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.020
It tells you how to increase
the text size in your browser.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.070
Which nobody is going to do.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.202
They're going to hit back,
back, back, close the browser,

00:36:21.202 --> 00:36:22.160
and say, you know what?

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.580
I didn't need to do that anyway.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.580
Whereas at SeniorHealth, we give
it a thumbs up or a green check

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.080
mark.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.160
Because basically they
have a little widget

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.610
on their home page.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.540
Which you just click
the letter there,

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.650
and it makes the font
bigger or smaller.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.400
Whatever you want.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.290
In addition to straight visual
defects or deficits that

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.870
occur in some people
with age, there's

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.340
visual-cognitive deficits.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.440
So as I mentioned,
older adults are

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.540
known to be slower on
visual search tasks.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.830
And there's also difficulty
finding very small, subtle

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.030
screen elements.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:13.260
So one small, subtle screen
element that many of us

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.780
are familiar with
is this little bar

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.750
at the bottom of our
Macintosh screen,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:23.550
which has little black dots that
indicate that an app is running

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.660
or not.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.590
But the people we talked
to in the senior centers

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:34.737
where Kate has done some
work can't see those dots.

00:37:34.737 --> 00:37:36.070
They might as well not be there.

00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:41.350
Now, one could argue
that on Macintosh it's

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.270
not that important to know
whether an application is

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.050
running or not.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.659
But they try to provide
the information.

00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:48.700
They're just not providing
it for a large segment

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.270
of the population.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:55.330
And then we have situations like
this one at Road Scholar, which

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:59.440
is one of these travel agencies
that targets older adults.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.070
So let's say you're
looking at a trip.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.450
And you're thinking about--

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:10.600
it's too bad I didn't
bring my reading glasses.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.570
Suppose you're wanting to--

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:16.060
you're looking down here.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.900
And you're wanting to
travel on this trip.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:26.800
And you say, OK, February 27,
2016, I don't like those dates.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.740
Let me change the
dates of the trip.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.080
So you change the dates.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.970
OK, this is a good date.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.010
I will like this trip.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.040
But you may not notice that
the price, which is over here,

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.250
just went up by $300.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.190
OK, now maybe Road
Scholar wants you to not

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.470
notice that the price
just went up by $300.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:51.010
But anyway, this
is not good design,

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:56.050
because obviously there's sort
of a visual attention change

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.810
blindness problem
designed in here.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.830
I mentioned that visual search
for older adults is slower.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.940
So here's an example.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.350
So if I put you on this
Amazon page, and I say,

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:19.280
tell me how many items are
in your shopping cart, that

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.830
is a visual task that
will-- a visual search

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:25.790
task in which people of all ages
will perform at approximately

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.230
the same speed.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:29.810
Because everyone knows--
or at least people

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.450
who have been
using Amazon at all

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:33.890
know where their
shopping cart is.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.300
Upper right.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.120
So that won't vary by age.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.030
But if I tell people
instead to tell

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.980
me what are some
of the benefits--

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.860
find some of the benefits
of Amazon Prime membership,

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.230
then what we get into
is a search task that

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:55.285
for the older people is slower.

00:39:58.955 --> 00:40:00.830
And there are various
reasons for that, which

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.230
I won't go into right now.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.311
Things are going on cognitively.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.180
Then in terms of motor
control, the kinds

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.720
of things that can
occur as people age--

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.320
and again, don't
necessarily always occur,

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.080
but sometimes do-- are
reduced hand-eye coordination,

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.950
fine-motor control, strength,
reduced strength, slower

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.660
movements, and stiffness.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:30.680
So one of the ways you have of
measuring that as a researcher

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.220
is noticing that a
Fitts' Law curve--

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.960
how many of you have
heard of Fitts' Law?

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.650
So Fitts' Law is the
law that sort of helps

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.500
you predict how long it
will take someone who's

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:48.650
pointer or finger is one place
to move to another target spot.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.920
That curve flattens
out with age.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.060
Meaning that the peak
velocity is lower.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.630
The acceleration rate at the
beginning of the movement

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.820
is lower.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:08.630
And so the overall time to reach
and hit the target is longer.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.290
So what those kinds of
motor control changes cause

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.420
is difficulty grasping
and manipulating

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.900
small objects, difficulty
with continuous movements,

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.700
like click-drag, tap-drag,
tap-hold, pinch-spread,

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.100
double-tap gestures.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.670
One of the things
that I am amused by--

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:38.280
or maybe not amused
is the better term--

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.440
on the Macintosh and
also on many iPhones,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:49.770
the accessibility features are
turned on and off via gestures

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:52.590
that many older adults
cannot execute reliably.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:04.480
So older adults have
difficulty often executing

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.970
coordinated gestures.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:09.430
Also there's a decreased
consistency of movement.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.460
Just because I can
click on that target

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.550
or do a pinch-spread
right now doesn't

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:21.340
mean I'll be able to do it
in a minute the same way.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.890
One thing that's happening to
me with increasing frequency

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:27.490
is I'm trying to grab something
and drag it to a new place,

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.340
and losing it in the meantime.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.400
And I don't know where
it went, if it falls

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.390
into a folder or something.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.910
Greater risk of an
unintentional click or touch.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:44.470
Accidental selection of objects.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:48.790
So here's a video, again,
from the travel study,

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:56.770
of someone trying to book a trip
to Kenya using a website that

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:58.840
has menus that are pull-right.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.280
So you pull them down.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.960
And then you have
to pull to the right

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.850
in order to get the submenu.

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.070
You've all seen those
kind of menus, I'm sure.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:08.012
So let's watch.

00:43:08.012 --> 00:43:09.440
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.190
- So like I went-- when I went
up here to get the country

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.880
first--

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.830
you know, I went up
here to go up here to--

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:21.470
it's bouncing around
the Kenya thing here.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.012
OK, so I went in-- oops.

00:43:23.012 --> 00:43:25.730
Down in Africa.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:31.387
It's taken me like five times
to click on the country.

00:43:31.387 --> 00:43:31.970
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.030
JEFF JOHNSON: So
anyone had any trouble

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.970
with those kind of menus?

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.055
OK, so it's not
just older adults.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.720
Then there are cognitive changes
like attention, learning,

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.280
and memory.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.340
Reduced short-term memory,
less effective long-term memory

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:57.880
storage, less generalization
between situations.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.160
People are more
easily overwhelmed.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.190
So here's an example
of the latter.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.600
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.980
- At this point,
I would call them.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.850
This is so overwhelming.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:11.400
- OK.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.167
- I would call
them and say, help!

00:44:13.167 --> 00:44:13.750
[END PLAYBACK]

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:15.130
JEFF JOHNSON: OK, now, this is--

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.000
I should say this person
travels all over the world,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.770
sets up clinics, and
libraries, and schools,

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:27.430
is very well-educated
and very well-traveled.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:28.930
Not at all senile.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.320
But is totally overwhelmed
by the travel website

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.380
of the company that she almost
always uses to go traveling.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.780
And so what does she do?

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:42.430
She looks at the site to
get out what trips exist.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.215
And then she gets
on the telephone.

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:50.390
Cognitive.

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:53.590
So cognitive guidelines that
come out of this kind of thing

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.110
are to focus attention on
important information and calls

00:44:56.110 --> 00:45:01.480
to action, which is not
what drugstore.com does.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.350
OK, so drugstore.com is
aimed at people over 50.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:08.530
But with all this
stuff changing--

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:17.170
I mean, we found that when
big images change on a page,

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:18.580
people think--

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.860
people who are especially
not in the generation that

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.830
know about navigation
and user interfaces

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:26.219
think that they've gone
to a different page.

00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:27.510
It took me to a different page.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:28.536
Why did it do that?

00:45:28.536 --> 00:45:30.160
It didn't take you
to a different page.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.319
It just changed that picture.

00:45:32.319 --> 00:45:33.985
Oh, I thought I was
on a different page.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:44.830
So the Android voice recorder
is the paradigmatic example

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.860
of simplicity.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.690
Can't get much more
simple than that.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:54.320
So that's one call to action
on the screen at a time.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.660
And that's good.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.100
In our book, that's good.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.600
Literally, in our
book, that's good.

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.820
And then there's knowledge
differences like these.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:07.270
So unfamiliar with digital
tech jargon and icons,

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:09.890
not knowing control gestures.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:13.060
But people have-- older people
have greater domain knowledge.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.630
That is, tests have shown
that older adults are actually

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:20.680
better at doing search
tasks when the search

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.840
tasks are ill-defined.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.900
They're not as good as
younger people at doing

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.240
well-defined search tasks.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:32.440
What is the capital of Brazil?

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.630
OK, that's a
well-defined search task.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:38.500
But an ill-defined search
task is, find a vacation

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.290
that you would like.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:42.750
That's ill-defined.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.540
Older adults actually
have more domain knowledge

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.000
and can solve those
problems usually faster

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.290
than young adults.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:54.470
So here's an example of
unfamiliar vocabulary.

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:55.300
"Check for update.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.400
A new update is available.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.108
In this version, you
will have the option

00:46:58.108 --> 00:47:01.110
to select between Light
and Dark UI themes

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.000
from the Settings menu."

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.130
Well, my aunt would think that
that is unemployment insurance

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:11.140
or something.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:15.500
UI is a technical term
that we use in the field.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:20.620
It should not be in a user
interface of a mobile phone.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:25.560
And one of my pet peeves
is what is the menu--

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.780
what is the symbol for a menu?

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:32.980
Well, over here in this app is--

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.170
and so this is
Android's voicemail app.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.570
The menu is three dots.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:44.310
In Google Translate,
it's the hamburger.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:47.990
In Waze it's a dancing pig.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:55.860
OK, so let's-- can we agree
that it would be a good idea

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.820
to settle on one symbol
for what a menu is?

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.090
Rather than having
ones that not only--

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:05.070
see, what we're
doing is requiring

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.010
people who didn't grow
up with this stuff

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.300
to learn these things.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.280
But to learn them in the context
of having inconsistencies

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.864
in what are the symbols.

00:48:16.864 --> 00:48:17.530
That's not easy.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.250
I use UPS as an example of
a well-designed website that

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:30.070
works for everybody.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.940
So the last thing
I'll mention is

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:39.000
that our book has a chapter
on why and how to include

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.510
older adults in development.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:44.220
And actually, we
also have a chapter

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.700
on case studies of other
organizations and companies

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.430
that have designed
for older adults

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:53.010
successfully by including
older adults in the development

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.160
process.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.140
So there are a variety of
publications and methods

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.140
for making sure
that the people who

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.880
you're doing your
user research with

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:08.310
include some people over 50.

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:12.210
Here's an example of some
students at a college who

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:18.240
are developing lightweight
walkers that are actually

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.730
more portable, and easy to put
in a car, and things like that.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:26.430
And are very
lightweight and stable.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.410
And so they developed
some prototypes out

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:31.860
of tubing and things.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:36.750
And then they tried them out
with actual older adults.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.540
So that's one method, is
really using older adults

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.770
in your research.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:45.250
Another method that
has been used is--

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.010
it's called empathic design.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:51.450
But basically you put
a suit on a 25-year-old

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.010
that restricts their movement.

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.840
And you tell them,
design a car that you

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.750
can get in and out of easily.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.660
Ford actually does this.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.940
And many auto-- some auto
companies actually do that.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:07.980
They put people in suits.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.950
Or they put goggles on them
that restrict their vision.

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:14.070
Or they put things
on their heads

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.630
that restrict their hearing.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:17.730
And they say, design
a system that you

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:19.560
can use with all
of the impairments

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.440
that this stuff we're
putting on you--

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.710
that will work despite that.

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:34.650
So that's another way to
inspire empathic design.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:40.620
So we give this kind of advice.

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.690
Include older adults
in participatory design

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.790
and evaluation.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.130
Be sensitive in communication
when you're doing it.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:51.750
Avoid technical
jargon and ElderSpeak.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:53.170
And optimize the sessions.

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.860
There's a lot you have to do
when you're using people who

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.830
are in their 70s
and 80s when you're

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.260
doing usability testing that's
not the same as you would

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:06.180
do with people who
were in their 20s,

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.167
including allowing extra
time and eating the cookies

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.000
that they offer you.

00:51:14.409 --> 00:51:15.870
AUDIENCE: What's ElderSpeak?

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.000
JEFF JOHNSON: ElderSpeak is--

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.380
it's sort of like--

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.050
you've read about kid speak?

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:25.560
So mothers talk--
motherese is the word

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.520
for when you talk to a
two-year-old like, hello,

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.490
Billy.

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.680
Please come into the room now.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.830
You know, and use this sort
of stressed language, which

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:39.360
actually linguists have said
helps people learn language.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.760
But when you do that with
older adults-- and people

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.190
tend to do this with people
who are in their 80s.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:45.960
Oh, here's grandma.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:49.020
Grandma, how are you?

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.000
Grandma's going, I'm fine.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.700
Why are you yelling at me?

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.910
So when you go to
a senior center,

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:02.550
and you're helping people
learn how to use iPads,

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.450
don't do that.

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:14.990
So the summary is these things.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:16.950
There's a lot of--

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:19.550
a growing number of older
adults in the world.

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:23.150
The percentage of older
adults is increasing.

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:25.580
A person's technology
generation influences

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.010
which technologies they're
going to be comfortable with.

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:29.960
And here's the thing.

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:35.330
I always like to say
people now, who are young,

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.060
think, OK, so I'm always going
to know how to use this stuff.

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:42.650
But 25 years from now, we will
not have digital technology.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:45.050
We'll have quantum technology.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.580
And the paradigms
will be different.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.670
And so people will
be saying, I just

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:51.170
don't get this
quantum technology.

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.180
But my kids-- maybe
they can fix all

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.560
my quantum equipment for me.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.600
So get used to it.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.530
The world changes.

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:03.379
And you're not going to
keep up with everything.

00:53:03.379 --> 00:53:04.920
You will keep up
with certain things,

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.544
especially if it's
related to your job.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:14.330
Usability issues can
exclude older people

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:18.140
from the benefits of today's
digital culture, which

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:22.400
are great for that
population, for older adults.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.150
The benefits-- you know,
I am a firm believer

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:30.120
in the benefits of digital
technology for older adults.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.078
And we just have to make sure
that they can benefit from it.

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:41.882
So with that, I will
say thank you very much.

00:53:41.882 --> 00:53:44.768
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.892
Are there questions?

00:53:52.892 --> 00:53:54.850
LAURA: We can take
questions live in this room.

00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:58.470
We also have a Dory, which,
Tim, I think you have pulled up,

00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.990
right?

00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.980
TIM: That's right.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.780
Are there any questions
in here first?

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.420
If not, I'll just
read from the Dory.

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.660
OK, so I had a question.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.970
JEFF JOHNSON: And maybe
Kate can pitch in on some

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:12.610
of these questions, too.

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:15.880
TIM: So for me, it seems that
a big challenge in this work

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.910
is helping people to accept the
fact that their abilities are

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:20.800
changing.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.100
What have you seen
that's helpful for this,

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:27.754
to help people accept the fact
that maybe things aren't what

00:54:27.754 --> 00:54:28.420
they used to be?

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:33.850
JEFF JOHNSON: Well,
let me first say

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:37.720
one thing that is not helpful.

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:45.790
There have been
attempts to develop

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:49.480
computers for older people.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.150
They don't do well
in the market,

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:56.890
because people look at them
and go, I would never use that.

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:58.480
I'm not old.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.860
You see, the thing
is-- actually the AARP

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:04.660
has done a survey
of their members

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:10.000
and found out that none
of their members are old.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.690
Only the parents of
their members are old.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.160
So you're never old.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.480
Your parents are the
ones who are old.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.470
However old you are.

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:25.300
So any piece of equipment that
marks you as an older adult

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.560
is not going to be popular.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.530
So the question is
how can we do this

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:33.010
in a way that
doesn't sort of say,

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:35.666
this is the technology
for older adults.

00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:37.540
And this is the technology
for everyone else.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.350
So I don't know if I answered
the question, which was,

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:47.160
how do you get people to
recognize that these things are

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.168
happening?

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:53.970
I don't really have a general
answer to that question.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:56.610
I guess what I can say is
that, from my own personal

00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:00.390
experience, it was kind of
forced on me when I suddenly

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.530
realized--

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:03.300
I had cataract
surgery in one eye.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.410
And then they gave me a
fake lens in the other eye.

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:10.140
And first I asked if I could
have one that did telephoto.

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:14.010
But they said they
couldn't do that.

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:19.040
But now I have to wear reading
glasses all the time, unless--

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.460
when I'm reading at distances
closer than a couple of feet.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:29.640
And so I didn't have
any choice but to accept

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.160
the fact that these
changes are occurring.

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.340
When I was in college,
I did gymnastics.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:39.060
If I tried those things
now, I would probably die.

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.440
So I'm not going to do them.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.580
Kate, do you have any--

00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:48.060
KATE FINN: Yeah, I don't think
it's an answered question.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:56.240
I think that in our
culture, especially,

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.010
aging is, like we
said, not sexy.

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:00.370
And people don't embrace it.

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:04.160
And people don't want to
admit to it or own up to it.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.620
And what Jeff said about
stigmatizing people

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:11.480
by giving them dumbed down
interfaces or applications

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.190
is definitely not the answer.

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:15.350
People don't want--
few people-- you know,

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:17.700
have you ever seen
a jitterbug phone?

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:21.050
I mean, it's simple,
but it's pretty

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:24.161
insulting to a lot of people.

00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:24.660
Depending.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.868
I mean, some people, it's OK.

00:57:25.868 --> 00:57:27.930
So I think that trying to--

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:29.780
my answer is we need
a cultural shift.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.365
We need to embrace aging and
not make it so ostracized.

00:57:33.365 --> 00:57:35.240
JEFF JOHNSON: Yeah, I
mean, in some cultures,

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.770
it's actually cool
to be old, right?

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:39.090
In Japan, it is--

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:43.100
the elders are more respected.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.940
And if you happen to be a
Maasai living in Tanzania

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:51.770
in the Serengeti, the elders
are looked greatly up to.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:53.270
But not in our culture.

00:57:56.870 --> 00:58:00.730
AUDIENCE: OK, many older
folks are on a fixed income.

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:03.450
So they can't afford to
replace their phones or laptops

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:04.440
every three years.

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.464
What problems does this pose?

00:58:06.464 --> 00:58:07.380
KATE FINN: Can I talk?

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:11.880
I addressed a conference
on the digital divide

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.350
earlier this year.

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:17.790
And the cost of equipment,
and trying to install it,

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:21.330
and trying to get technology
support were enormous.

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:25.880
And so many people who
fall in the cracks there

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.640
abandon the technology if
it's too challenging for them.

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:33.420
And it's really
irresponsible for those of us

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.870
who are responsible
for such things

00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:39.680
to shut them out like that,
to not make things easier

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.630
for them to use, and
set up, and maintain.

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:46.980
Or for the government to not
make broadband basically free

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.050
and make an economic
divide, too.

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:54.580
So it's a big divider for
older people and people

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.049
on fixed incomes.

00:58:56.049 --> 00:58:58.090
JEFF JOHNSON: Not only
the cost, but also there's

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:04.720
a mindset, which is,
this royal typewriter

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.580
was passed down to
me from my father.

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:09.550
And his father passed it to him.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:13.090
Why shouldn't I be able
to pass on my Macintosh

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:16.630
to my kids or grandkids?

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:19.590
We could design this thing so
that there's a little module

00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:20.440
that I switched out.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.730
And that was the CPU.

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:23.890
And I put in a new
one every three years,

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:27.800
rather than having to spend
$3,000 for a whole new machine.

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.300
Right?

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.642
The display doesn't change.

00:59:29.642 --> 00:59:32.100
KATE FINN: Instead of built-in
obsolescence, have it be a--

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:32.800
JEFF JOHNSON: Right, right.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.565
KATE FINN: We talk
about, especially--

00:59:33.565 --> 00:59:34.320
JEFF JOHNSON: Or the phone.

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.380
KATE FINN: --with
older adults, people

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.740
get hand-me-ups instead
of hand-me-downs now.

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:41.547
They give their parents or their
grandparents their old phones.

00:59:41.547 --> 00:59:42.380
JEFF JOHNSON: Right.

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:49.690
TIM: OK, let me
ask this, which is,

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:51.060
I think, a little bit related.

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:54.430
So Jeff, I was looking back
through some of your earlier

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.930
writings.

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:56.721
And I saw that you were
writing in the '90s

00:59:56.721 --> 00:59:59.640
about the public interest in
having a national information

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.630
infrastructure.

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.930
How does net neutrality
affect our efforts

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:05.730
to build a more
accessible world?

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.940
JEFF JOHNSON: Well
my personal belief

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:16.410
is that net
neutrality would help.

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:23.220
But it's apparently been done
away with as of yesterday.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.310
I grew up with the
notion of the internet

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:30.840
as an example of something that
we formerly in the telephone

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.350
era called common carriage.

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:36.330
So common carriage
was a term that

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:38.790
was actually created
when stagecoaches

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:40.530
were running letters around.

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:46.680
And basically the idea is
that Wells Fargo stagecoaches

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.090
should not put any priority
on Wells Fargo messages

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:53.250
over anybody else's messages.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.734
I should be able to put any
letter on the Pony Express.

01:00:55.734 --> 01:00:57.150
And it should be
able to get there

01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:59.190
in exactly the same
amount of time for exactly

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:00.550
the same amount of money.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.010
So common carriage was born.

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:06.180
And it was applied to railroads,
and to trucking, and then

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:10.620
to the telephone company,
and then to the internet.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:14.010
And the word for common
carriage in the internet age

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:16.050
was net neutrality.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:20.820
And now that is
being gotten rid of.

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:26.010
And so the question is,
how will that impact what?

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:27.210
TIM: Accessibility.

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:32.580
JEFF JOHNSON: Yeah, so companies
that can control everything

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.100
and are not regulated
can always go

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.470
for the low-hanging fruit in
their particular industry,

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:39.996
whatever it may be.

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:42.120
One of the things that's
happening in San Francisco

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.930
is that the cab companies,
which are highly regulated

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:52.890
and must give rides to
people who have disabilities

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:56.520
of various kinds,
feel like they're

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:00.180
being regulated while
Uber and Lyft don't

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.320
have those same restrictions
applied to them.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.650
So the playing
field is not level.

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:10.260
But so what we see is drivers
in Uber, and Lyft, and things

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:16.380
like that who just do not
want to pick up people who are

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.190
mobility-impaired, for example.

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.230
TIM: OK, I think this
is our last question.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:24.690
It's the last one on the
Dory, unless I see a wave.

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:25.890
Oh, yeah, OK.

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:29.440
Let's have this question
before we do that.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.650
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you
for your talk today.

01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:34.560
What are your thoughts on the
potential for voice interfaces

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.540
to serve the needs
of older adults?

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.730
And I will stipulate that
there are real issues

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.220
to solve around comprehension
and comprehensibility.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.610
But let's say we're addressing
those as fast as we can.

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:48.910
More broadly, how might
voice interfaces help?

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:52.330
KATE FINN: I think it
shows a lot of promise

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:54.980
in not having to relearn things.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.040
Especially if we're not
talking about somebody

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.190
having to learn a command
line interface that they just

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:03.550
speak, if it's a natural
language interface and very

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:06.130
generalized, broad topic.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:09.460
I think-- something I
actually talked to Tim

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.140
about the first
time I met him was,

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:14.130
I don't understand why
you can't say to Siri,

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.120
change my contrast settings.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.270
Why can't-- it's kind
of a meta interface.

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:20.880
Because why do I need to know--

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.739
why do I need to know what
password, or what protocol,

01:03:24.739 --> 01:03:25.280
or something?

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.740
You just need to do this for me.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.840
Or I should ask you
to do this for me.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.664
And I think that
if you lay over--

01:03:32.664 --> 01:03:34.330
I don't know if you
want to call it AI--

01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:37.150
on top of voice interface,
or some huge amount

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:41.020
of smarts on top of a spoken
interface, that that--

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.080
even if it doesn't
level the playing field,

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.320
would make things an
awful, awful lot easier.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.970
Having said that, there
is some difficulty

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:51.670
with automatic
speech recognition

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:55.570
for older voices that have
trembles, and inconsistent

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:56.500
volumes, and things.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.600
JEFF JOHNSON: Yeah,
the frequency of speech

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:04.390
tends to go up as we age,
the auditory frequency.

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:06.355
And she was saying they're--

01:04:06.355 --> 01:04:08.980
KATE FINN: If the algorithm-- if
the recognition can handle it,

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:09.535
that's great.

01:04:09.535 --> 01:04:12.160
JEFF JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, the
problem that Kate was referring

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.620
to, for example,
is that it's not

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:19.230
that Siri isn't smart enough, or
Google Now isn't smart enough.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:22.450
It's that they don't have an
API into everything that they

01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:23.920
need to have an API into.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.270
I mean, I'm surprised often
at what these things can do.

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:33.910
For example, they can
actually control the--

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:35.140
they can access the calendar.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.050
And they can set up appointments
and stuff like that.

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:39.500
They can make phone calls.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.210
So they do have APIs into other
parts of the operating system.

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:46.240
But if they can't access
the accessibility controls,

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.410
then there's--

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:48.550
somebody forgot.

01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:50.860
Somebody forgot to provide that.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:54.240
KATE FINN: Can I have one
little remark about this?

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.540
OK, to me, it's a big deal.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:00.520
As people age, they tend to
become more socially isolated.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.430
And we all read about, oh, it's
so important not to be lonely,

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:06.130
because that leads
to depression.

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:11.000
And in some usability studies
where they're like, here,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.310
have this little robot.

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:16.010
Or here, have this device.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:18.130
What has been found
is that, if you

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:21.340
have a reasonably
intelligent-- quote unquote,

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:27.850
"intelligent" spoken interface,
whether it's a robot or not,

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.640
that it alleviates some
degree of loneliness.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.930
And I'm not saying, to heck
with your friends and family.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.820
I'm just going to talk to
the voice menu on the phone.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.020
It's not that at all.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:42.270
But people can be so socially
starved that that does--

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:45.430
it does give them some
emotional benefit.

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.360
And they can feel
like they've got--

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.090
you know, like you hear people
talking to Alexa and Siri.

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:55.210
But it's some semblance
of human contact

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.830
that they might
otherwise be missing.

01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:59.150
And so people who don't--

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:01.600
some people don't want
to do online banking,

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.030
because they're afraid
they're going to get hacked.

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:07.870
But they want to go into a
bank, and see the bank teller,

01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:10.960
and exchange some
words with somebody.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.840
And in elderly people that are
homebound, and they've had--

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.720
there's some robots in--

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.410
social robots, I
would say, in Europe.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:24.070
And people find it's
like a little friend.

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:27.460
So I think there's another
benefit to a spoken interface

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:32.444
that we don't realize for
the general population.

01:06:32.444 --> 01:06:33.360
TIM: It's interesting.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.110
You may have answered our
last question, which someone

01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:38.060
else put on to this Dory.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.860
That was, which
Google product do you

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.690
think has the
biggest opportunity

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:43.447
for serving older adults?

01:06:43.447 --> 01:06:44.780
JEFF JOHNSON: Which Google what?

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.095
KATE FINN: Product.

01:06:45.095 --> 01:06:46.105
TIM: Which Google product.

01:06:46.105 --> 01:06:46.560
JEFF JOHNSON: Product.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.476
TIM: So if you look at
Google's products, what

01:06:48.476 --> 01:06:54.424
has the most opportunity to be
improved to help older adults?

01:06:54.424 --> 01:06:55.730
KATE FINN: I'm a Mac user.

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:57.311
JEFF JOHNSON: Well--

01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:59.120
KATE FINN: The cars.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.040
JEFF JOHNSON: Sorry?

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.420
The cars, right.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:07.310
The cars, the driverless
cars, is a good place.

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:14.480
Because so many people use
the Google search engine,

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.770
that also is a good
place to improve.

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:21.230
It's not that it's bad.

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:23.390
It's just that, the more--

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:30.320
the easier the search results
can be reviewed and dealt with,

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.520
the better it would
be for everyone,

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.792
including older adults.

01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:35.030
KATE FINN: And the speech.

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:37.040
JEFF JOHNSON: Yes, and speech.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.970
So yeah, Google Now, the cars,
and this general search engine.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.630
TIM: OK, great.

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:47.900
Last call for questions.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.530
OK, yes.

01:07:53.059 --> 01:07:54.850
AUDIENCE: One of your
quotes says something

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:57.730
about very thin typefaces.

01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:01.930
And that seems to be kind
of a popular design trend

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:04.720
in some areas, or has been.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.080
And also light contrast.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:08.580
How--

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.704
JEFF JOHNSON: Gray on gray.

01:08:09.704 --> 01:08:11.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I see.

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:13.510
Like medium gray on white.

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:17.109
And it's really hard to
see in a lot of cases.

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:22.359
What can we do about some of
these design trends and try

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:23.590
and--

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:26.920
I don't know-- nip them
at the bud, if you will,

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.560
if their usability
characteristics are that bad?

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.554
KATE FINN: I think you
have to rant and rage.

01:08:33.554 --> 01:08:35.970
We're mad as hell, and we're
not going to take it anymore.

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:36.529
I don't know.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.570
JEFF JOHNSON: What I do--

01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:39.890
KATE FINN: Because I hear--
since iOS 7 came out,

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:41.600
there was this whole
minimalist thing.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.510
And again, I'm mostly
familiar with the Mac stuff.

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:47.930
And I've tutored so many older
adults at different places.

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:49.399
And they just can't see it.

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:51.279
They can't see the
lightweight font.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:54.990
They can't see gray on a white
or another gray background.

01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:58.580
And the other thing
is popular was

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.310
white font on a black
background, especially

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:02.899
if it's small-ish.

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:07.352
And when Jeff was talking
about the Social Security site,

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:08.810
you had to go
through seven screens

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.149
to increase-- because
most of the people

01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:13.979
that we dealt with don't
know, oh, command-plus,

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:17.340
command-minus to increase--
they don't know about that.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:23.554
So the contrast and the size of
things is impenetrable to them.

01:09:23.554 --> 01:09:25.970
I don't know what the best
avenue for complaining about it

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:26.240
is.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.140
But it's an issue.

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:30.261
JEFF JOHNSON: Well, the best--

01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:32.510
I don't think the best avenue
is complaining about it.

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:37.819
The best avenue is
teaching people what--

01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:41.450
teaching future designers
what design really is.

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:45.819
That is, most of the students
who come into my UX design

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:50.000
class at USF believe that the
class is going to be mostly

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.220
about graphic design.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.120
And I quickly disabuse
them of that idea.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.970
I tell them that it's-- no, it--

01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:02.300
first of all, many of
them think that design

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.370
is about personal expression.

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:06.570
And I say, it's not
about you at all.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:08.284
It's about them.

01:10:08.284 --> 01:10:10.700
So we have to figure out who
they are, and what they want,

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.290
and what they need.

01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:15.140
But the other thing is
that it's not even mostly

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.342
about graphic design.

01:10:16.342 --> 01:10:18.800
It's about making sure that
people can complete their tasks

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.970
or achieve their goals.

01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:24.402
And that's mostly not visual.

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:32.530
TIM: OK, thanks everyone for
coming and participating.

01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:33.794
And especially Jeff and Kate.

01:10:33.794 --> 01:10:35.210
Thanks for coming
to Google today.

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:38.260
[APPLAUSE]
