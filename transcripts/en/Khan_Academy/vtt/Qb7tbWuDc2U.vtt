00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.590
In this video I want to
see if we can understand

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.610
the idea of a hedge fund
a little bit better.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.380
And these tend to be
pretty mysterious,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.890
and sometimes get a bad name
because some hedge funds do

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.352
do some fairly strange
things and secretive things

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:16.935
in the market.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:21.610
So people are, rightfully so,
suspicious of many of them.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.310
But the real difference between
a hedge fund and the types

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.690
of mutual funds that
we just talked about

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.510
are that they're not
regulated by the SEC.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.430
And because they
are not regulated

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.550
they can't market themselves.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.110
That's why when you
watch financial shows,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.440
or you get a magazine,
a finance magazine

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.604
you will not see
ads for hedge funds.

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.270
The mutual funds are
all over the place,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.520
marketing them left and right.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.220
Hedge funds the largest
hedge funds in the world

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.200
are definitely not
even household names.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.382
Very few people even know
what those largest hedge

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:01.340
funds in the world are.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.620
And that's because they
can't market themselves.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.480
No matter how good
of a track record,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.170
or really how
reasonable of a fund

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.910
they might be-- some might
not be reasonable, some are--

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.530
they can't market themselves.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.630
And they also can't take
money from the public.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.580
So in general, in order
to invest in a hedge fund,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.413
you have to be an
accredited investor, which

00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:27.112
means you have a
certain net worth,

00:01:27.112 --> 00:01:28.570
or maybe you have
a certain income,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.480
or maybe by virtue
of your education

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.420
you can prove that you have a
certain level of sophistication

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.710
to invest in these things
that aren't regulated.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.510
You, I guess, don't need
the SEC to watch your back.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.320
So the regulation
is a key difference.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.985
Marketing, no money
from the public.

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:45.360
And then the other
key difference

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.130
is how the managers
tend to be incented.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.040
I know incented is not
a word, or motivated.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.670
In the mutual fund
world, managers

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.690
get a percent of assets.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.670
So for mutual fund
manager, larger is better.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.684
The more under
management the more money

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:03.350
the mutual fund
manager's going to make.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.370
So they really just want to
keep marketing it, marketing it,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.010
marketing it.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.560
They don't get a
cut of the profits.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.250
So you really there's not a lot
of incentive to kind of really

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.290
beat the market here.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.170
Because if they kind of don't
be the market one year, then

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.810
all of a sudden, their
fund will shrink.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.560
So they really just get a
fee on the size of the fund.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.530
In a hedge fund, and
usually the implication

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.080
is that a hedge fund will
be more actively managed,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.520
they'll get a larger
management fees.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:40.020
So larger management fee,
instead of the 1%, 1%

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.520
is actually a lot
for mutual fund.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.060
Instead of that, hedge
funds tend to be 1% to 2%.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.000
So 1% to 2% management fee,
and sometimes even larger

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.500
than that.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.540
But the even I guess
bigger difference,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.915
and this is where
hedge funds are

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:54.880
very different from a
traditional mutual fund,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.800
is that the management
company, the general partner,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.890
gets a percentage
of the profits.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.870
So with a hedge fund manager
or the management company,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.150
the going rate tends to be about
20$ of the profits of the fund.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.140
Sometimes it's less,
sometimes it's a lot more.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.240
Some very successful hedge
funds get 25%, 30% or even

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.804
a larger percentage
of the profits.

00:03:20.804 --> 00:03:22.720
So with that out of the
way in the next video,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.010
I'm going to do some different
mechanics of essentially

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.260
the same returns,
but one by hedge fund

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.610
and then one by a
traditional mutual fund.
