00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:02.870
SALMAN KHAN: I'm here with Dr.
Laurence Baker from Stanford

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.495
Medical School, and we're
going to talk about what?

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:07.120
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
How about Medicare?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.448
SALMAN KHAN: Medicare.

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:10.614
I think we knew that was
going to happen, because we

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:11.863
had this picture here already.

00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:13.460
So what is this a picture of?

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.379
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: I think
that's a picture of LBJ

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.660
signing the Medicare
Act in 1965.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.310
This is the time that
we passed Medicare.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.170
SALMAN KHAN: Lyndon
Baines Johnson, LBJ.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.589
This is Truman right over here.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.880
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: I think so.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.505
SALMAN KHAN: Maybe he was there
because I think he was probably

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:32.520
old enough by that
point to be a recipient.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.561
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.291
65 and over.

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:36.790
SALMAN KHAN: So, I
think we all have

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.510
a general idea of what Medicare
is, that it's kind of a health

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.970
care program, or insurance
program for people

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.097
who are retired.

00:00:43.097 --> 00:00:44.930
But then, it starts to
get fuzzy after that.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.372
There are all these details
that confuse most of us.

00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:49.580
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah,
so we talked about Medicare

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.950
in a bunch of different ways.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.160
Medicare is a program.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.000
It's a US government program
run by the federal government.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.230
SALMAN KHAN: So it is run
by the federal government?

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.650
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yep.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.820
SALMAN KHAN: And sometimes,
it's thrown in with Medicaid.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.600
How are they different,
just at a very high level.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.340
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
Oh, so Medicaid

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.610
is another different
insurance program run

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.170
by the federal government
in coordination

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.480
with state governments.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.730
Medicaid is a federal
and state program.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.310
Medicare is a federal program.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.330
Medicare is for folks who
are 65 years old and older

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.640
and people with disabilities.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.850
Principally those two groups.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.540
Medicaid is a program
that's aimed at lower income

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.470
populations, and so--

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.136
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:27.290
So this older people
and disabilities.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.450
This is low income,
kind of a poverty issue.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.450
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.472
Mostly.

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:34.097
SALMAN KHAN: I'm
gonna write that down.

00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:35.560
Low income.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.609
And this is primarily retirees?

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:38.650
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.790
The vast majority
of people in there

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.424
are folks who are there
because they are over 65.

00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:44.090
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.370
And we're just going
to focus on Medicare.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.828
And Medicare is
federal government.

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:48.840
Medicaid is the federal
and the state government

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.930
are on Medicaid, because they
always sound very similar.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.710
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
They sound very similar.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.251
Yeah, I know.

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.587
They're easily confused,
certainly at the name level.

00:01:54.587 --> 00:01:55.670
Really different programs.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.804
They operate
completely separately.

00:01:57.804 --> 00:02:00.470
In a few cases, there are people
who get access to both of them,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.730
but they pay differently.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.945
They run differently.

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:03.445
They're--

00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:04.861
SALMAN KHAN: But
at federal level,

00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:06.820
they are still run by
the same organization,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.160
the Centers for
Medicaid and Medicare.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.169
Or Medicaid--

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.225
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:12.016
The Department of Health
and Human Services

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:15.130
has a subpart called the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.200
Services.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.830
SALMAN KHAN: --executive branch.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.556
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.930
SALMAN KHAN: The
executive branch

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.690
of our government, obviously.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.482
And then you have the
Secretary of Health--

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:26.398
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
Health and Human Services.

00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:28.340
SALMAN KHAN: So, Health
and Human Services.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.825
And then within
that, you have CMS.

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:31.200
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
You have CMS.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.690
SALMAN KHAN: Which
is the Centers for--

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.880
and you were saying earlier,
it should have two M's in it.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.970
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.150
It's the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.510
So I think it's just
shorter to have one M.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.240
But really, there's
two in there.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.406
SALMAN KHAN: [INAUDIBLE]
instead of calling it CMMS.

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:42.870
OK.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.260
They administer at the
federal level, both Medicare

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.320
and Medicaid.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.190
But just to reiterate,
Medicare is really

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.870
mainly a federal thing,
while Medicaid is both.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.400
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
Yeah, Medicare--

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.066
SALMAN KHAN: And
they're run separately,

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:55.710
so you have Medicare here.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.450
Medicare.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.589
And then you Medicaid here.

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:58.630
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.570
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.070
All right.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.569
All right.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.290
So let's dive deep
into Medicare.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.172
So I guess, what is it?

00:03:07.172 --> 00:03:10.040
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: So Medicare
is an insurance program.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.940
It provides insurance
coverage for people

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.940
who are eligible for it.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.070
So if you're age 67
and over, or if you

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.530
have a permanent disability,
a couple other small groups.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.420
If you have Lou Gehrig's
disease, or end stage

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.722
renal disease, kidney
failure, then you

00:03:22.722 --> 00:03:24.430
can get access to
Medicare too, but those

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.530
are small populations.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.340
So if you're in those groups,
you're eligible for Medicare.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.980
Medicare will provide
you with insurance

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.870
that will cover hospital bills,
doctor bills, some prescription

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.370
drugs.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.490
It'll cover lots
of medical care--

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.740
SALMAN KHAN: You know,
I hear these things--

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.380
this is the part that I think
gets confusing for everyone.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.784
Is that you start hearing Part
A, Part B, Part C, Part, D.

00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:47.450
I don't even if those
are all the parts.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.370
What are those referring to?

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.220
And are they exactly
insurance, or are they

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.880
something slightly different?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.680
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: OK, so
Medicare has these four parts.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.040
Part A, Part B,
Part C, and Part D.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.747
And it can get a
little confusing,

00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:01.830
but we can break it up
into some different pieces.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.996
So the biggest one, in terms
of the number of people

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:07.400
who are in it, is what sometimes
we call traditional Medicare.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.300
And that's what historically
is Part A and Part B.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.300
And you kind of want to
take those two together,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.210
because they make a package.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.636
And we call that maybe
traditional Medicare.

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:18.010
Sometimes people
call it original

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.420
Medicare, standard Medicare.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.420
But when they
passed the program,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.155
when they first
did it, Part A was

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:26.070
meant to cover
hospital expenditures,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.690
and Part B was aimed
at doctor costs, costs

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.200
for seeing physicians.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.350
Of course, those things
go so closely together

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.720
that nowadays, Part A and
Part B are kind of a pair.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.744
So you really rarely would find
someone who only wanted Part A,

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:39.660
or only wanted Part B.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.940
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.020
Sometimes, you hear the doctor
processes it as outpatient.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.770
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.311
SALMAN KHAN: Hospitals,
sometimes you

00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:46.460
hear the word inpatient,
means you're living there

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.230
while they're treating you.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.700
Outpatient, you go visit them
for an hour or two and leave.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.920
And that's where you hear those.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.270
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.512
So that's a way of breaking
up the kinds of services

00:04:53.512 --> 00:04:54.470
that medicine provides.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.645
Medicare actually gets a little
bit-- it's mix and match.

00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:01.510
So really, Medicare
Part A expenditures

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.650
when a hospital bills Medicare
for use of the hospital, use

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.680
of a room, use of the
services at the hospital.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.337
Anytime a doctor bills Medicare,
even if they saw the patient

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:12.753
in the hospital, they're going
to be a Part B expenditure.

00:05:12.753 --> 00:05:13.106
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:13.606
I see.

00:05:13.606 --> 00:05:15.880
So it isn't strictly
inpatient, outpatient.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.020
It really is much more along the
lines of hospital and doctor.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.020
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yep.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.686
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:24.005
So I'll maybe put this in
some type of [INAUDIBLE] way

00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:26.340
or something.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.279
It's not necessarily
outpatient, inpatient.

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:29.320
That's maybe one way of--

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.236
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yes,
it is useful to think

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:33.709
about that,
outpatient, inpatient.

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:36.000
SALMAN KHAN: And will it
cover everything that happens?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.912
Including drugs?

00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:37.870
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: OK.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.510
So drugs is one key issue.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.590
To the main question, the
first thing I guess I'd say

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.500
is that traditional Medicare
is pretty comprehensive.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.196
It covers most of the things
that people would normally

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:51.070
encounter in their needs
throughout the year.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.130
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.840
Does it cover everything?

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.750
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Prescription
drugs is one big exception.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.916
SALMAN KHAN: It does not
cover-- so Parts A and Part

00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:57.400
B do not cover
prescription drugs.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.490
So when Lyndon Johnson
was signing this,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.640
if Truman had to get
prescribed some drug,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.140
and if he was a Medicare
recipient, in 1965,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.130
he would have had to
pay that out of pocket.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.171
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.777
So I guess one
caveat I'll note is

00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:13.110
that if you get prescription
drugs that are administered

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.620
to you while you're
in the hospital--

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.090
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.390
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: --you're
staying in the hospital,

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.930
they give you drugs, that's
going to be generally covered

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.750
under Part A. It's
when you're outpatient,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.000
and you're going home, and
somebody sends you to pharmacy

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.583
to pick up a--

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.030
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.180
Medicare in its original
form would not cover that.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.596
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
They would not

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.510
cover the outpatient
prescription drugs.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.920
So that became a
problem for some folks,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.005
and that has generated changes
to the Medicare program.

00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:34.796
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:37.220
Since then, there is a
part now that cover that.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.460
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.857
So that's the Part D program
as a Medicare extension.

00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:41.440
I don't know how far
you want to get--

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.481
SALMAN KHAN: We can-- I'll
write that right here.

00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:44.600
Well just, D for drugs.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.760
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.843
The whole story of
prescription drugs and Medicare

00:06:47.843 --> 00:06:48.930
has a lot to it.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.510
People would buy
additional policies

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.340
if they had A and B.
They'd buy themselves

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.600
a private supplement that
might cover drugs sometimes.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.070
But now, with the
new Part D plan,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.150
maybe people would
buy that instead.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.240
And there's other stuff.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.760
SALMAN KHAN: There's
probably a C right there.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.530
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
There's a C that's coming.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.690
SALMAN KHAN: We can get
to that in a second.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.260
But so, A and B, traditional.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.550
A, hospitals.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.620
B, doctors.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.400
And what percent would--
with my health insurance,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.400
there's a copay every
time I visit the a doctor.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.700
It's $20.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.930
How does it work with
traditional Medicare,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.474
with Parts A and Part B?

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:19.890
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: So if you
just have Part A and Part B,

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.160
then on the Part B
side, doctors are

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.270
covered 80% of the
Medicare allowable charges.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.780
So Medicare has a
fee schedule that

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.750
governs what doctors can
be paid for services.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.500
And Medicare will cover 80% of
that, and the patient pays 20%.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.380
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.796
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
For Part A, it

00:07:34.796 --> 00:07:37.964
gets a little more complicated,
but there's a co-payment

00:07:37.964 --> 00:07:38.880
that you have to make.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.690
If you go to the
hospital, Medicare

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.430
is going to have a
copayment of a fixed

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.814
amount, several hundred
dollars, coming up.

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:45.480
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.230
It's just not as
simple as 80-20.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.710
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: No.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.668
Not as simple as 80-20.

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.550
You're going to pay a
copayment there too.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.420
So they're not bad coverage.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.420
But there's certainly
some costs you can run up.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.211
And if you're pretty
sick, you might really

00:07:57.211 --> 00:07:58.810
have a bill that's
left [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.910
SALMAN KHAN: And there's
extreme flexibility here.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.609
You can see any doctor you want,
go to any hospital you want.

00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:04.650
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.650
Medicare Part A and Part B
is, to one way of thinking,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.190
one of the last bastions of
health care as it exists,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.920
or health insurance as it
existed in America in 1965,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.054
'70, '75, when there were really
minimal restrictions on what

00:08:18.054 --> 00:08:20.220
doctors you could see, what
hospitals you could use.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.541
Doctors get lots of discretion
here about the services

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:26.040
they're going to provide, and
there's not a lot of oversight

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.400
that you might see in today's
HMOs, or other kinds of--

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:28.570
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.180
But there are still--
maybe I'm wrong here--

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.570
there still are doctors that
won't take Medicare patients?

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.028
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
So, doctors can

00:08:34.028 --> 00:08:36.700
elect to be Medicare
doctors or not.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.387
And some doctors,
I think, decide

00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:40.220
they have enough business
or enough patients

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:40.969
from other places.

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:42.915
And Medicare's a plan
that's got its rules,

00:08:42.915 --> 00:08:44.290
and you have to
follow the rules.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.892
And some people
think that Medicare

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:47.850
doesn't pay as well as
other options they have.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.107
So there are a few.

00:08:49.107 --> 00:08:50.690
Most of the doctors,
the vast majority

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.470
of doctors in the country,
will work with Medicare.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.550
SALMAN KHAN: And
you're saying, it

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.060
is kind of the super
flexible thing.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.727
If you do have an illness, you
can go see multiple doctors,

00:08:58.727 --> 00:08:59.560
get second opinions.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.560
You could go to the specialist
on the other side the country.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.420
So it is pretty good that way.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.930
Although you have to pay 20%
of at least the doctor's visit,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:13.110
so it's a pretty-- so what
happens if I'm a retiree?

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.650
I don't have a lot of money.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:15.520
I have a major bill.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.260
Say I have a surgery
that's $50,000.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.120
I know that's more of a
hospital inpatient thing.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.800
Are there other
options so that they

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.719
don't have to pay
that out of pocket?

00:09:26.719 --> 00:09:27.760
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.660
So there's a bunch
of things that

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.076
go into trying to figure out
what the cost to getting this

00:09:31.076 --> 00:09:33.320
are, and how you
might get covered

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.029
for some of these
other services.

00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:37.320
The main thing that would be
the answer to the question

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.900
is, there are
supplemental policies.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.870
So if you're a
retiree, and you've

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.642
gotten Part A, because
you're eligible for that,

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:46.100
and you've Medicare
tax, and you've

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.730
got Part B, for
which you do have

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.842
to pay a little bit of money
every month-- subsidized,

00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:52.550
but still a premium
you have to pay-- you

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.840
might decide in
addition to that to pay

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.210
for a supplemental
insurance policy, which

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.760
you'd buy from a private place.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.959
The AARP is one place
that sells these.

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:03.500
There are other
folks that sell them.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.100
You pay an extra
premium for that.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.820
That's an additional
insurance plan that you have.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.270
And that might agree, or you
might have a method there

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.530
to have them cover
that 20% co-pay,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.760
the additional hospitals.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.370
And those plans, there's
some different varieties

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.610
of those that cover more or
less generously, and of course,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.249
charge a higher or
a lower premium for.

00:10:20.249 --> 00:10:21.040
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.360
That makes complete sense.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.049
And do people have to pay any
premium to be in Medicare?

00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:28.340
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: To get
A and B both, you have to A,

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.880
you generally don't.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.589
If you pay your Medicare tax for
10 years, you work for 10 years

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:36.130
here, and you pay your Medicare
tax, you get Part A for free.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.870
But Part B charges a premium.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.820
So you do have to
pay a small monthly--

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.440
SALMAN KHAN: And it's what?

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.100
It's like on the order
of like, $100 a month?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.830
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
Yeah, generally.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.440
It's gone up a little bit over
time, or something like that.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.856
SALMAN KHAN: So
it's not too much.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:51.020
Maybe $100 or a little bit more
per month, which is nothing.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.482
I mean, if you're
65 or over, and you

00:10:53.482 --> 00:10:54.940
try to get a private
policy, you're

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.610
probably looking at something
like a thousand dollars

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.060
a month.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.300
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.170
So I guess two ways
of thinking about it.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.503
One, this is heavily subsidized.

00:11:00.503 --> 00:11:03.230
Compared to what a
person 75 years old or 80

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.970
would pay for an actual
private insurance

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.127
policy would be much,
much higher than that.

00:11:07.127 --> 00:11:08.710
There are people who
look at that $100

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.950
a month in fixed income and
Social Security and things,

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.116
and you say that's an issue.

00:11:12.116 --> 00:11:14.202
And so one of the things
that's just in the news

00:11:14.202 --> 00:11:16.660
the last few weeks is the fact
that this number, the number

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.824
went up a bit.

00:11:17.824 --> 00:11:19.740
Social Security payments
went up a little bit.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.010
But less, actually,
than the Medicare.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:21.360
So people are saying--

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:21.710
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.490
So there's a net decrease.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.820
I see.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.050
I see.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.883
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
--if you're buying both.

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:26.530
So there's some
people who will still

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.850
be worried about
that, even though it

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.020
is heavily subsidized, and
looks like a great deal.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.811
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:32.712
And then finally,
so we have no A, B.

00:11:32.712 --> 00:11:34.170
And then we have
a little bit of D.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.130
We know it's all
about covering drugs.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.260
What does C do?

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.011
[INAUDIBLE] exist?

00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:39.010
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:39.785
C exists.

00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:42.710
C has been around for
20 or 30 years now.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.470
C is a separate choice.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.120
So when you turn
65, let's say, you

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.620
can make this choice a little
bit differently sometimes too.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.720
But when you turn
65, you might decide

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.270
to take part A and part B, maybe
by a traditional supplement.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.155
Maybe you add the first
Part D drug plan on

00:11:55.155 --> 00:11:56.238
and make yourself package.

00:11:56.238 --> 00:12:00.460
Or you can elect Part C, and
Part C is an alternative.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.220
Under Part C, what happens is
the CMS, federal government,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.250
has contracted with some HMOs.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.394
Kaiser, Blue Cross,
other places.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.310
Sometimes, they've
contracted with a few PPOs.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.000
They've tried other
kinds of plans too.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.580
Mostly it's HMOs.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.170
So you have a choice then.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:21.137
You can join Kaiser, and have
Kaiser be your Medicare plan.

00:12:21.137 --> 00:12:22.470
You can join the Blue Cross one.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.600
Depending on where
you are, you'll

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.641
have different choices of
different private plans

00:12:25.641 --> 00:12:26.760
that have contracted.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.830
And you can do that.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.450
The federal government will
then pay a bunch of your premium

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.290
to them.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:31.650
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.270
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: So you'll
get covered by the private plan

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.269
with the federal government
covering your costs.

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:38.490
They might ask you to pay
some additional premium.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.948
You're going to have to pay
your Part B equivalent already.

00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:42.550
So you've got to
pay that amount.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.710
But then, you might have
to pay a little bit extra.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.156
And then, you'll get access
to what services that has.

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:48.780
And for some people,
that's attractive.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.190
Because though the co-payments
and deductibles will be lower--

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.932
you'll often have more
like the $10 copay--

00:12:54.932 --> 00:12:56.890
you might have access to
some prescription drug

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.920
coverage automatically
built in there.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.237
Sometimes those cover some
vision and other things,

00:13:01.237 --> 00:13:02.070
which might be nice.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.370
SALMAN KHAN: So
this one or plans.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.160
I could get this, while
it's 80% coverage-- well,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
I can't make that rule,
because hospitals, it

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.110
could be different.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.776
But you get this kind
of flexible thing.

00:13:11.776 --> 00:13:13.720
But you have a pretty
significant co-pay,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.790
the 20% patient.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.830
I could get supplemental
insurance for me

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.960
to cover some of that
right over there.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.169
Or I can do Part C. Is
there a name for Part C?

00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:22.710
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
Part C these days

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.170
is called Medicare Advantage.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.890
So the plans in
Part C are called

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.780
Medicare Advantage plans.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.790
SALMAN KHAN: Which is
really just Medicare

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.977
subsidizing me to get
private insurance.

00:13:32.977 --> 00:13:34.060
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Right.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.960
From some plans that have agreed
to work with Medicare patients.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.380
SALMAN KHAN: And there's
various checking up on them.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.270
So they agree to
basically cover everything

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.080
that A and B would
cover, so you're not

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.680
going to get
skimped on too much.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.300
SALMAN KHAN: And what
do most people do?

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.120
Do they go A and B?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.760
The traditional route?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.780
Or do they go the C route?

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.610
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: So
historically, the vast majority

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.250
of people have
gone A and B route.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.760
It changes.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.030
It kind of goes up
and down over time,

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.310
depending on various factors.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.066
But over a historical
average, it

00:13:58.066 --> 00:14:02.740
would be something like 80%,
85%, 90% in A, and maybe 20%,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.470
15%, 10% in B and C,
depending on which year

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.540
you're looking at
over the last 15 year.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:07.710
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.043
And we could probably do a
whole series of videos on it.

00:14:10.043 --> 00:14:11.430
So when did D come about?

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.180
It wasn't part of the original--

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.305
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: D was
not part of the original.

00:14:15.305 --> 00:14:18.560
D comes about in the early
2000s under George Bush.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.982
George W. Bush.

00:14:19.982 --> 00:14:21.690
SALMAN KHAN: This is
what we heard about.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.740
I think it was like, 2003.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.410
I think I it was--

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.743
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: I think
that's probably about right.

00:14:25.743 --> 00:14:27.750
And the issue there was
there's a lot of folks

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.320
who were having trouble getting
their outpatient drugs covered.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.980
So this is a plan, this is
another part of Medicare.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.140
You can elect to buy this.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.030
You normally would think
about this if you got A and B,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.030
and you wanted to get
outpatient drugs covered,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.360
you'd think about a D plan.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.410
Part D is run by the federal
government, kind of the way

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.370
that C is.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.790
They subsidize, and
they pay a premium

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.149
to the private plans
that cover drugs.

00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:54.690
Or at least they
organize the market,

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.980
and the person then pays
also some premium to get--

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.170
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.870
So a private--

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.740
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
So it's private.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.550
SALMAN KHAN: A
private entity will

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.720
handle the actual
reimbursements for the drugs,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.370
but Medicare will pay them.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:03.650
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.270
So the way to think
about it is, just

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.860
a bunch of private
entities with funds

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.500
flows coming in, partly from the
person, partly from Medicare,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.300
to buy these.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.280
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.002
And who do you
pay your money to?

00:15:15.002 --> 00:15:15.960
You pay it to Medicare?

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.834
You pay it to these--

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.480
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Uh.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.630
SALMAN KHAN:
Actually-- it works out

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.570
the same way one
way or the other.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.820
This is optional.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.220
A retiree or someone
over 65 would pay money

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.070
to essentially get a
drug plan subsidized.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.070
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:34.640
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.160
Cool.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.660
Cool.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.720
Well, no, this is super.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.095
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
Well, actually, we're

00:15:37.095 --> 00:15:37.830
trying to think about subsidies.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.380
But there's some interesting--

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.270
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.800
SALMAN KHAN: Oh, I guess to be
able to participate in a drug

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.220
plan.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.120
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: I
mean, they are subsidized.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.460
And the federal is taking
a bunch of money in.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.215
But how exactly the economics
of these plans works out

00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:50.946
has been an interesting
discussion over the last couple

00:15:50.946 --> 00:15:51.020
over year.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.110
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.230
Right.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.890
No, we could make
a ton of videos.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.790
No, this is super helpful.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.248
Because, I think,
frankly, I didn't

00:15:54.248 --> 00:15:57.570
know about the differences right
here before about 15 minutes

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.441
ago.

00:15:58.441 --> 00:15:58.940
All right.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.990
Well, thanks a bunch.
