00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.610
Simplify the following fractions
to their most reduced form.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.960
If the fraction cannot
be reduced any further,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.650
enter the fraction in its original form.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.240
For example, since I can't
reduce one-half any further,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.184
I should just enter one-half.
