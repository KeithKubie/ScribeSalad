apologize for that I had some computer
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.839
apologize for that I had some computer
issues so that's what kind of tied

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
issues so that's what kind of tied
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.730
issues so that's what kind of tied
things up a little bit but this is part

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
things up a little bit but this is part
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.870
things up a little bit but this is part
three of how to build a spaceship

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
three of how to build a spaceship
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.269
three of how to build a spaceship
corridor and we're just going to go

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
corridor and we're just going to go
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.560
corridor and we're just going to go
right into the footage to see what we

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
right into the footage to see what we
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:53.550
right into the footage to see what we
got

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560
 
 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.470
 
all right so here it is there are a few

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480
all right so here it is there are a few
 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.030
all right so here it is there are a few
things I would probably still add it's

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040
things I would probably still add it's
 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.660
things I would probably still add it's
probably about 98% complete is a few

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670
probably about 98% complete is a few
 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.640
probably about 98% complete is a few
things missin here and there that would

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650
things missin here and there that would
 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.700
things missin here and there that would
really kind of touch it up closing this

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710
really kind of touch it up closing this
 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.160
really kind of touch it up closing this
gap up here maybe by adding some piping

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170
gap up here maybe by adding some piping
 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.380
gap up here maybe by adding some piping
or even some more diffusion or something

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390
or even some more diffusion or something
 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.120
or even some more diffusion or something
like that to kind of add some more light

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130
like that to kind of add some more light
 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.980
like that to kind of add some more light
I ordered you guys even go heavy around

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990
I ordered you guys even go heavy around
 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.530
I ordered you guys even go heavy around
the detail there's a lot of elements on

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540
the detail there's a lot of elements on
 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.270
the detail there's a lot of elements on
the styrofoam and stuff like that where

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280
the styrofoam and stuff like that where
 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.670
the styrofoam and stuff like that where
you could add even more details using

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680
you could add even more details using
 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.370
you could add even more details using
little bits of plastic pieces and stuff

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380
little bits of plastic pieces and stuff
 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.810
little bits of plastic pieces and stuff
like that you have lying around and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820
like that you have lying around and
 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.380
like that you have lying around and
little pieces of wire and even adding

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390
little pieces of wire and even adding
 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.330
little pieces of wire and even adding
more lights add you know it some more

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340
more lights add you know it some more
 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.250
more lights add you know it some more
cheap dollar store lights to different

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260
cheap dollar store lights to different
 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.660
cheap dollar store lights to different
elements and stuff like that put some

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670
elements and stuff like that put some
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.550
elements and stuff like that put some
lights behind stuff to kind of

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560
lights behind stuff to kind of
 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.710
lights behind stuff to kind of
illuminate things from behind which kind

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720
illuminate things from behind which kind
 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.740
illuminate things from behind which kind
of gives it a cool look so for various

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750
of gives it a cool look so for various
 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.050
of gives it a cool look so for various
parts like the styrofoam a lot of these

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060
parts like the styrofoam a lot of these
 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.719
parts like the styrofoam a lot of these
were already had openings in them so I

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729
were already had openings in them so I
 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.820
were already had openings in them so I
wanted to put lights behind it to kind

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830
wanted to put lights behind it to kind
 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.230
wanted to put lights behind it to kind
of bring it out a little bit more give

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240
of bring it out a little bit more give
 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.200
of bring it out a little bit more give
the whole thing a little bit more life

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210
the whole thing a little bit more life
 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.720
the whole thing a little bit more life
so just by adding a light actually this

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730
so just by adding a light actually this
 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.190
so just by adding a light actually this
has a magnet already built into it so

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200
has a magnet already built into it so
 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.110
has a magnet already built into it so
that's kind of a nice feature so I could

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120
that's kind of a nice feature so I could
 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.870
that's kind of a nice feature so I could
just snap on there and cover it up now

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880
just snap on there and cover it up now
 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.310
just snap on there and cover it up now
you have a piece that's actually doing

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320
you have a piece that's actually doing
 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.790
you have a piece that's actually doing
something alright now for some of the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800
something alright now for some of the
 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.979
something alright now for some of the
pieces that are just stare film they

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989
pieces that are just stare film they
 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.199
pieces that are just stare film they
have an interesting shape but they're

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209
have an interesting shape but they're
 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.180
have an interesting shape but they're
also usually pretty recognizable as just

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190
also usually pretty recognizable as just
 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.490
also usually pretty recognizable as just
being painted styrofoam unless you add

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
being painted styrofoam unless you add
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.440
being painted styrofoam unless you add
little elements to it and again I would

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450
little elements to it and again I would
 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.630
little elements to it and again I would
go even further than this but just

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640
go even further than this but just
 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.509
go even further than this but just
adding a little piece of cardboard with

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519
adding a little piece of cardboard with
 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.720
adding a little piece of cardboard with
some little interesting shapes and some

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730
some little interesting shapes and some
 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.699
some little interesting shapes and some
different colors added to it it kind of

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709
different colors added to it it kind of
 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.930
different colors added to it it kind of
takes your mind a little bit more away

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940
takes your mind a little bit more away
 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.130
takes your mind a little bit more away
from the fact that it's just a piece of

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
from the fact that it's just a piece of
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.449
from the fact that it's just a piece of
styrofoam and now it looks like

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459
styrofoam and now it looks like
 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.520
styrofoam and now it looks like
something that's doing something and

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
something that's doing something and
 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.960
something that's doing something and
again if you had a cheap dollar store

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970
again if you had a cheap dollar store
 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.090
again if you had a cheap dollar store
light even better so once again all of

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100
light even better so once again all of
 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.979
light even better so once again all of
these things are very modular you can

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989
these things are very modular you can
 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.560
these things are very modular you can
rearrange stuff as you need

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570
rearrange stuff as you need
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.229
rearrange stuff as you need
like I say without the lighter pieces I

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239
like I say without the lighter pieces I
 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.530
like I say without the lighter pieces I
used magnets and with the styrofoam and

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540
used magnets and with the styrofoam and
 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.420
used magnets and with the styrofoam and
for these heavier pieces or it's just

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430
for these heavier pieces or it's just
 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.479
for these heavier pieces or it's just
attached to a piece of MDF board or even

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
attached to a piece of MDF board or even
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.250
attached to a piece of MDF board or even
like a piece of cardboard but it's it's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260
like a piece of cardboard but it's it's
 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.700
like a piece of cardboard but it's it's
heavier because you're adding

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710
heavier because you're adding
 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.440
heavier because you're adding
different plastic elements and stuff I

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450
different plastic elements and stuff I
 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.300
different plastic elements and stuff I
put these picture hanger piece on there

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
put these picture hanger piece on there
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.130
put these picture hanger piece on there
so it's just a bracket they're pretty

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140
so it's just a bracket they're pretty
 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.540
so it's just a bracket they're pretty
cheap I think they're probably about

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550
cheap I think they're probably about
 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.010
cheap I think they're probably about
five or six bucks at a hardware store

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020
five or six bucks at a hardware store
 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.060
five or six bucks at a hardware store
you might even be able to find them

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070
you might even be able to find them
 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.110
you might even be able to find them
cheaper but then you just add the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120
cheaper but then you just add the
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.550
cheaper but then you just add the
bracket to a bunch of different pieces

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560
bracket to a bunch of different pieces
 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.220
bracket to a bunch of different pieces
and then you can rearrange how you want

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
and then you can rearrange how you want
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.720
and then you can rearrange how you want
it to look so you could take this piece

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730
it to look so you could take this piece
 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.180
it to look so you could take this piece
down add another piece so on and so

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
down add another piece so on and so
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.910
down add another piece so on and so
forth and it takes no time to set back

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
forth and it takes no time to set back
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.580
forth and it takes no time to set back
up then as you can see I ran some LEDs

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590
up then as you can see I ran some LEDs
 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.790
up then as you can see I ran some LEDs
for the floor and again you can totally

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800
for the floor and again you can totally
 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.830
for the floor and again you can totally
change things up how much you guys

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840
change things up how much you guys
 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.420
change things up how much you guys
choose to put into it is purely up to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
choose to put into it is purely up to
 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.220
choose to put into it is purely up to
you the more you put into it the better

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230
you the more you put into it the better
 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.140
you the more you put into it the better
it's going to look obviously you don't

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150
it's going to look obviously you don't
 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.460
it's going to look obviously you don't
need a lot of money to build something

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470
need a lot of money to build something
 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.350
need a lot of money to build something
that looks impressive you just need some

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360
that looks impressive you just need some
 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.870
that looks impressive you just need some
time and a little creativity and it can

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880
time and a little creativity and it can
 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.540
time and a little creativity and it can
go a long way because all of this stuff

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550
go a long way because all of this stuff
 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.460
go a long way because all of this stuff
is just junk you know it's a couple of

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470
is just junk you know it's a couple of
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.170
is just junk you know it's a couple of
Gatorade bottles glued together with

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180
Gatorade bottles glued together with
 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.600
Gatorade bottles glued together with
some hose attached to it it's like I

said egg cartons and old broken toys and
discarded yogurt cups but this gives you

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740
discarded yogurt cups but this gives you
 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.500
discarded yogurt cups but this gives you
an idea of how you can build a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510
an idea of how you can build a
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.930
an idea of how you can build a
relatively cheap spaceship corridor so

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940
relatively cheap spaceship corridor so
 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.580
relatively cheap spaceship corridor so
you guys shouldn't feel restricted by

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590
you guys shouldn't feel restricted by
 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.740
you guys shouldn't feel restricted by
what kind of money or what kind of a

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750
what kind of money or what kind of a
 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.090
what kind of money or what kind of a
budget you have or if you don't have any

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100
budget you have or if you don't have any
 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.790

budget in order to build this corridor
it was about a hundred dollars most of

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380
it was about a hundred dollars most of
 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.650
it was about a hundred dollars most of
the money went into building the actual

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660
the money went into building the actual
 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.260
the money went into building the actual
structure and just the lumber and even

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270
structure and just the lumber and even
 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.450

that wasn't very expensive other things

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460
that wasn't very expensive other things
 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.270
that wasn't very expensive other things
that I just had lying around I added

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280
that I just had lying around I added
 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.950
that I just had lying around I added
those elements too and those are things

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960
those elements too and those are things
 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.260
those elements too and those are things
that maybe you won't have I took bits

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270
that maybe you won't have I took bits
 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.480
that maybe you won't have I took bits
and pieces of other projects and added

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490
and pieces of other projects and added
 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.320
and pieces of other projects and added
stuff but for the most part all of the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330
stuff but for the most part all of the
 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.970
stuff but for the most part all of the

elements that I use to dress up the
 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.060
elements that I use to dress up the
interior of it were just pieces of junk

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070
interior of it were just pieces of junk
 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.440
interior of it were just pieces of junk
they were just things that you would

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450
they were just things that you would
 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.280
they were just things that you would
normally throw away the styrofoam all of

are just things that I save for projects

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300
are just things that I save for projects
 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.910
are just things that I save for projects
like this or if you want to build a

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920
like this or if you want to build a
 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.960
like this or if you want to build a
project like this and you don't

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970
project like this and you don't
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.640
project like this and you don't
necessarily have it any time restraint

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650
necessarily have it any time restraint
 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.560
necessarily have it any time restraint
you have plenty of time to gather some

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570
you have plenty of time to gather some
 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.180
you have plenty of time to gather some
of this stuff like I said it was

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190
of this stuff like I said it was
 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.290
of this stuff like I said it was
probably about three or four

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300
probably about three or four
 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.969
probably about three or four
months of me saving up those plastic

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979
months of me saving up those plastic
 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.559
months of me saving up those plastic
containers and stuff like that and I

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569
containers and stuff like that and I
 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.260
containers and stuff like that and I
still have bins full that I can use for

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270
still have bins full that I can use for
 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.510
still have bins full that I can use for
other stuff so this is just a small

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520
other stuff so this is just a small
 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.860
other stuff so this is just a small
fraction of the stuff that I actually

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870
fraction of the stuff that I actually
 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.279
fraction of the stuff that I actually
have that I've been saving up to use

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289
have that I've been saving up to use
 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.110
have that I've been saving up to use
mostly because this is just a small part

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120
mostly because this is just a small part
 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.980
mostly because this is just a small part
of a much larger piece that I'm gonna be

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990
of a much larger piece that I'm gonna be
 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.719
of a much larger piece that I'm gonna be
working on now how you choose to layer

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729
working on now how you choose to layer
 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.249
working on now how you choose to layer
corridor is totally up to you and

corridor is totally up to you and
 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.740

depends on the project if you want it to

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750
depends on the project if you want it to
 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.360
depends on the project if you want it to
look much brighter you absolutely can

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370
look much brighter you absolutely can
 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.070
look much brighter you absolutely can
you can add more lights now as you guys

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080
you can add more lights now as you guys
 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.480
you can add more lights now as you guys
may have noticed I took out my panels

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490
may have noticed I took out my panels
 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.399
may have noticed I took out my panels
that I originally had here and I added

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409
that I originally had here and I added
 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.950
that I originally had here and I added
one long thinner panel so that I could

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960
one long thinner panel so that I could
 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.809
one long thinner panel so that I could
add my windows like these window pieces

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819
add my windows like these window pieces
 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.209
add my windows like these window pieces
are just cardboard with the window cut

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219
are just cardboard with the window cut
 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:57.170
are just cardboard with the window cut
out and some plastic on there to act as

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180
out and some plastic on there to act as
 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.059
out and some plastic on there to act as
a diffuser now you could just as easily

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069
a diffuser now you could just as easily
 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.790
a diffuser now you could just as easily
do that on the bottom instead and have

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800
do that on the bottom instead and have
 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.950
do that on the bottom instead and have
those panel pieces up here and have your

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960
those panel pieces up here and have your
 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.749
those panel pieces up here and have your
lights on the bottom and kind of light

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759
lights on the bottom and kind of light
 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.189
lights on the bottom and kind of light
your subject from underneath which I

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199
your subject from underneath which I
 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.420
your subject from underneath which I
think would actually be pretty cool and

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430
think would actually be pretty cool and
 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.640
think would actually be pretty cool and
probably give a very dramatic look for

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
probably give a very dramatic look for
 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.260
probably give a very dramatic look for
whatever your subject is inside your

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270
whatever your subject is inside your
 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.959
whatever your subject is inside your
corridor you can also just because the

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969
corridor you can also just because the
 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.879
corridor you can also just because the
ceiling is removable you could take the

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889
ceiling is removable you could take the
 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.950
ceiling is removable you could take the
ceiling out or cut panels for the

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960
ceiling out or cut panels for the
 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.260
ceiling out or cut panels for the
ceiling and light it from the ceiling if

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270
ceiling and light it from the ceiling if
 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.999
ceiling and light it from the ceiling if
you wanted to you could even run LEDs

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009
you wanted to you could even run LEDs
 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.339
you wanted to you could even run LEDs
underneath your floor and light some of

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349
underneath your floor and light some of
 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:27.080
underneath your floor and light some of
your elements from underneath which

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090
your elements from underneath which
 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.909
your elements from underneath which
would look really cool and give it sort

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919
would look really cool and give it sort
 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:30.950
would look really cool and give it sort
of a sense that you're maybe just on one

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960
of a sense that you're maybe just on one
 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.540
of a sense that you're maybe just on one
deck and that there's another deck below

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550
deck and that there's another deck below
 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.370
deck and that there's another deck below
you by being able to remove the ceiling

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380
you by being able to remove the ceiling
 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.110
you by being able to remove the ceiling
or remove a wall and gives you the

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120
or remove a wall and gives you the
 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.080
or remove a wall and gives you the
flexibility to use your camera angles a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090
flexibility to use your camera angles a
 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.230
flexibility to use your camera angles a
lot more you can shoot stuff from a

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240
lot more you can shoot stuff from a
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.309
lot more you can shoot stuff from a
little bit further but you can get some

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319
little bit further but you can get some
 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.409
little bit further but you can get some
wider shots from the side if you wanted

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419
wider shots from the side if you wanted
 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.300
wider shots from the side if you wanted
to you can shoot your subject from

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310
to you can shoot your subject from
 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.689
to you can shoot your subject from
overhead you can it would be a lot

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699
overhead you can it would be a lot
 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.070
overhead you can it would be a lot
easier if you're shooting more than one

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080
easier if you're shooting more than one
 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.200
easier if you're shooting more than one
subject in the corridor like two people

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210
subject in the corridor like two people
 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.059
subject in the corridor like two people
having a conversation if you're removing

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.069
having a conversation if you're removing
 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:58.070
having a conversation if you're removing
one wall then you have that opportunity

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080
one wall then you have that opportunity
 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.290
one wall then you have that opportunity
to shoot the two people side-by-side

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300
to shoot the two people side-by-side
 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.089
to shoot the two people side-by-side
rather than having to use like really

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099
rather than having to use like really
 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:03.439
rather than having to use like really
intense close-ups or over the shoulder

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449
intense close-ups or over the shoulder
 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:05.659
intense close-ups or over the shoulder
shots you can go for a little bit wider

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669
shots you can go for a little bit wider
 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.570
shots you can go for a little bit wider
shot and capture them both against one

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580
shot and capture them both against one
 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.129
shot and capture them both against one
wall or as I said you can get some

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139
wall or as I said you can get some
 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.290
wall or as I said you can get some
really cool dramatic overhead shots you

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300
really cool dramatic overhead shots you
 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.730
really cool dramatic overhead shots you
can bring the dolly in and get some

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740
can bring the dolly in and get some
 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.269
can bring the dolly in and get some
really cool fluid smooth shots and stuff

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:17.279
really cool fluid smooth shots and stuff
 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:22.649
really cool fluid smooth shots and stuff
like that yeah
