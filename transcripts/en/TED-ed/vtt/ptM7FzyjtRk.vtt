00:00:07.742 --> 00:00:09.621
Say you're helping plan a friend's party,

00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:11.165
and he sends you a text

00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:14.082
asking you to "bring Bob, a DJ and a clown."

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:15.296
You're pretty impressed.

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:17.750
You had no idea Bob was so multitalented.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.333
But when the day arrives,

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.082
it turns out that he's not,

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:24.805
and you were supposed to bring three different people.

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:27.082
As you and Bob sit at the silent, clownless party,

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:30.000
it occurs to you that the confusion could've been avoided

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.016
simply by using another comma after DJ.

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:35.940
This final comma in a list,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.234
placed directly before the main conjunction,

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:41.167
such as and, or, or nor,

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.989
is called the serial comma,

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.615
or Oxford comma.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.201
And it has long driven grammar nerds crazy

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:49.203
because even major language institutions

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:51.748
can't agree on whether it should be used.

00:00:51.748 --> 00:00:53.207
Ironically, the Oxford comma

00:00:53.207 --> 00:00:54.917
is more common in the United States,

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:56.249
where it's recommended by

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.167
the MLA, the Chicago Style Manual,

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.167
and the US Government Printing Office,

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.833
though not by the AP Style Book.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.250
In the UK and other English-speaking countries,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.499
most style guides do not support the comma's use,

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:09.166
with the exception of its namesake,

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.499
the Oxford University Press.

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.644
Why not use the serial comma?

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:15.022
One of the main arguments

00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:16.918
is that the conjunction is usually enough

00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:18.565
to denote a separate entity.

00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:19.833
And where it's not,

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:21.442
like in your ill-fated invite list,

00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:24.916
changing the order of terms will usually do the job.

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:26.742
Journalists also dislike the comma

00:01:26.742 --> 00:01:28.282
because it takes up precious space

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:30.249
and can make text look cluttered.

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.830
Sometimes, it can even create confusion of its own.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.249
For example,

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:35.874
if your friend had asked for "Bob,

00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:37.417
a DJ and a puppy,"

00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:38.583
you'd probably figure out

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:40.296
that they're three separate beings.

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:41.333
Puppies are cute,

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.882
but they don't make great DJs.

00:01:42.882 --> 00:01:44.168
With the comma,

00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:45.082
you may think

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:46.249
Bob is the DJ,

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:48.387
and all you need is him and the puppy.

00:01:48.387 --> 00:01:50.500
The argument over the Oxford comma

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.999
has raised such strong passions over the years

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.406
that a sort of truce has been reached.

00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:57.810
The common wisdom is that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.982
its use is optional,

00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:00.441
and depends on whether it will help

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:02.000
to avoid confusion.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.612
For one thing,

00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:05.654
you're supposed to keep your use or avoidance

00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:07.031
of the Oxford comma

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:09.284
consistent throughout a whole piece of writing.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:10.951
So, using it only where necessary

00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:12.620
is not an option.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.703
And the very idea

00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:15.702
of a grammatical rule being optional

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.249
is a bit odd.

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.499
Imagine that you hadn't messed up the party planning,

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.915
and read the next day that "everyone had a great time -

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:24.465
ninjas, pirates, vikings, old and young."

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.666
If the Oxford comma were standard,

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.083
you would notice it missing

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:29.667
and conclude that old and young

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:33.167
must describe the awesome guests already listed.

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:34.166
But as things stand,

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.249
you will always wonder

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.333
whether it means

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.539
that a bunch of regular, boring kids and old people

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.064
showed up as well.

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:43.649
Ultimately, the serial comma may be useful or annoying,

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:44.933
but your opinion on it,

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.377
as for many optional things,

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:47.499
probably has something to do

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.683
with whichever style you were raised on.

00:02:50.683 --> 00:02:52.630
Your high school teachers favored it?

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.119
It's likely you're still using it.

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.956
Your first editor hated it?

00:02:55.956 --> 00:02:57.456
You probably do, too.

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:59.208
And maybe so much hairsplitting

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.044
over a tiny squiggle on a page

00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:02.417
is a bit silly.

00:03:02.417 --> 00:03:03.380
After all,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.796
there are so many bigger problems

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:05.748
to worry about.

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:08.133
But sometimes, little things can make a big difference.
