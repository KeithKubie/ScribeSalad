Hello.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.401
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:07.540
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.400
We've partnered with Udacity
to create the VR Developer

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.192
Nanodegree.

00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:13.650
When you take the
course, you learn

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.100
how to create 3D environments,
define behaviors, and make

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.040
VR experiences comfortable,
immersive, and performant.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.626
To get started, follow the link
included in the description

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:24.125
below.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.910
The third developer
preview of Android Wear 2.0

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.700
is now available with
Google Play on Android Wear,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.940
making it easy for users
to find and install apps

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.730
directly on the watch.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.330
For screenshots and details
on the other updates,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.440
take a look at the post.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770
The data from Landsat
and Sentinel-2

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.050
are now available
on Google Cloud.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.570
This puts over a petabyte
of the world's leading

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.180
public, cost-free
satellite imagery data

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.750
available at your fingertips.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.410
The user growth that Google
Cloud customer Niantic

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.240
experienced with the launch of
Pokemon Go was extraordinary.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.390
For some pretty absurd
graphs, and details

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.101
of what happened
behind the scenes,

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:05.142
take a look at this post.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.550
Also in the category
of awesome posts,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.800
here's one about robots learning
from each other's experiences.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.940
And that's not the only
cool machine learning stuff

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.700
to read about.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.690
We're introducing
Open Images, which

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.510
is a dataset consisting
of around 9 million URLs

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.890
to images that have been
annotated with labels spanning

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.310
over 6,000 categories.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.820
We're also releasing a dataset
of 8 million YouTube video

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.030
URLs representing over
500,000 hours of video,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.390
along with video-level
labels from a diverse set

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.920
of 4,800 knowledge
graph entities.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.430
For more info,
and to get started

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.000
with both these datasets,
follow the links to the posts.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.470
Native ads are less jarring
than traditional ads,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.820
and they fit in with
app content more

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.950
naturally, providing a
better user experience.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.610
Check out this
post for four ways

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.163
you can make UX a priority
both within your app and ad

00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:57.662
experience.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.910
And here's a post
and video to help

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.490
you understand how Firebase
and AdMob work together.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.260
Follow the link to learn how to
save time by linking your AdMob

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.220
app and Firebase
project, monetize smarter

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.757
with Firebase Analytics,
and help grow your users

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:13.340
with Firebase.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.640
