CHRIS MANNING: Thanks,
everybody, for coming.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.710
Really excited to
welcome our author Summer

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.530
Brennan to Google.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.580
My name is Chris Manning.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.440
I'm on the legal
team here at Google,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.170
and I'm also a huge
environmental advocate,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.520
which is how I came to
invite Summer to Google.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.870
And I'm really, really excited
to hear her talk about some

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.630
of the history of Drake's
Bay Oyster Farm, and some

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.000
of Point Reyes's history,
and the history of oysters

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.380
in the area.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.637
So I hope it'll be exciting
for you guys as well.

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:32.470
Summer is an author.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.710
This is her first
book, "The Oyster War."

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.211
She's also had a number of
stories and other publications,

00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:43.460
such as "McSweeney's," "the
Rumpus," and "The Believer

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.787
Logger."

00:00:44.787 --> 00:00:46.620
So she's been doing
this for a little while.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.730
She writes professionally for
the United Nations Press Office

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.310
as well.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.040
So again, she's got
some experience,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.902
and I'm really excited to
talk about her first book,

00:00:55.902 --> 00:00:56.610
"The Oyster War."

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.010
So I'm going to go ahead
and welcome you up, Summer.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.040
We're going to do a Q&amp;A
conversation between the two

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.620
of us, back and forth.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.500
And additionally, Summer's
going to read a little bit

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.480
from her book.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.610
SUMMER BRENNAN: A tiny bit.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.150
CHRIS MANNING: What's that?

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.820
SUMMER BRENNAN: I
said, just a tiny bit.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.361
CHRIS MANNING: Yeah,
just a tiny bit,

00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:15.580
just to give you guys the
flavor of her writing style

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.330
and also just what's
going on in the book.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.900
And we'll use that an intro.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.254
So without further ado,
Summer, welcome to Google.

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:22.670
SUMMER BRENNAN:
Thank you so much.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.685
CHRIS MANNING: Thanks.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:25.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:27.220
SUMMER BRENNAN:
Well, I guess this

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.620
is a great way of a
tiny introduction.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.820
I don't know if anyone's heard
of what this book is about.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.290
There was a conflict inside
Point Reyes National Seashore--

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.780
which is just north of here.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.040
Some of you may know it--
about an oyster farm that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.160
had been there for a while,
and whether or not it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.930
would get to stay past 2012.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.740
And so this story seemed like
a little tempest in a teapot,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.800
but it actually ended up
getting all this national press

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.100
and almost went to the Supreme
Court, and it was a big thing.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.760
So I wrote a book about it.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.500
And chronologically, it
stretches rather widely.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.130
I think it goes back to
sometimes BC at some points,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.790
just because I'm trying
to get a little bit

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.389
of the geological history and
the anthropological history

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.330
the area.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.621
So I thought I'd just
read just one paragraph

00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:15.870
at the start of chapter three.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.094
So actually, this goes
back to the 19th century.

00:02:23.094 --> 00:02:24.010
OK, so I'll just read.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.610
So it's the fable of
the California oyster.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.850
The oyster pirates preferred to
ambush the beds by moonlight.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.640
Working mostly in pairs,
with two men per vessel,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.860
they mustered together
in ramshackle armadas

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.370
of 30 or 40 small boats.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.936
They waited until
cloudless nights,

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:46.310
when the full moon
shone brightly

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.610
on the piles of
pale shells onshore,

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.340
before advancing on the oyster
companies' camps en masse,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.300
their pistols at the ready.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.880
They went by nicknames, like
the Porpoise, the Centipede,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.890
the Spider, or the Shark.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.610
One particularly
vicious character,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.920
known for trying to tear off
the faces of his opponents

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.650
in hand-to-hand combat, was
known simply as Scratch.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.380
Their ranks included
petty thieves

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.590
and notorious murderers,
fisherman gone

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.540
crooked and adventuring youths.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.600
And in 18 1897,
among their number

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.490
was a 20-year-old
undercover fish patrol

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.070
agent by the name of
John Griffith Cheney,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.310
better known to you
and me as Jack London.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.060
So just a little taste.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.494
Then it goes on from there.

00:03:24.494 --> 00:03:25.660
CHRIS MANNING: Very awesome.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.010
A good taste of the local
flavor that I think this book

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.910
definitely offers.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.480
And being in the
Bay Area, I think

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.800
it's very, very appropriate.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.486
So you mentioned a
little bit about what

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:38.610
the overall story is about.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.530
Can you tell us why it
was such a big deal?

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.664
What was going on
here that pulled

00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:45.830
on both sides of the community
that really made this

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.180
such a contentious issue?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.055
SUMMER BRENNAN: Sure.

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:50.424
Well, I mean, everybody
got involved with it

00:03:50.424 --> 00:03:51.840
for different,
individual reasons.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.610
You can't speak for
anyone on either side.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.340
But on the one hand, which can
be called the pro-oyster farm

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.620
camp, the argument
was that bad science

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.784
had been used to imply or
prove that this oyster farm was

00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:06.450
environmentally
detrimental, and so they

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.574
were trying to push it out.

00:04:07.574 --> 00:04:11.260
And so they saw this is a bigger
story about an out of control

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.960
government that was acting
capriciously and picking

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.519
on the little guy in some sense.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.300
And so that was on the one hand.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.480
And the other hand,
there was concern

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.440
that because this was inside
a wilderness area, not just

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.900
a national park,
that it would create

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.990
a very dangerous precedent for
future wilderness protection.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.276
And we've never had a wilderness
area taken away or undone,

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:37.650
so this would have been the
first time that that would've

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.858
been compromised in some way.

00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:40.555
And so even if
people liked the farm

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:44.280
or thought it wasn't harmful
to allow it to continue,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.809
that was the fear,
that it could open up.

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.350
As you get into it
in the story, they

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.990
weren't the only people that
thought that might be something

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.777
they could do with it.

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:53.610
CHRIS MANNING: Cool.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.220
Well, since we're at Google
and you mentioned science,

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.090
I borrowed a
question-- I'll call

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.820
it borrowed, really stealing-- a
question from another interview

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.300
that I read about this book,
actually, that I thought

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.350
was really interesting, just
around the question of science.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.024
So what kind of
research, to start off,

00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:12.440
what kind of
research did you have

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.300
to do scientifically to sort
of understand both sides

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.520
what was going on here?

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.061
SUMMER BRENNAN: Well, there was
a lot of science reports done

00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:22.200
around this, and
in my appendices,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.237
I have nine of them
listed, because those

00:05:24.237 --> 00:05:26.070
were the key ones, and
people were confused.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.360
What's going on?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.280
So I didn't do any
scientific research myself,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.960
but I surveyed the reports
that went out about it.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.680
And they were
basically just trying

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.970
to discern what's the impact
to this fragile ecosystem

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.870
from this company?

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.316
But mostly they were
from secondary sources,

00:05:41.316 --> 00:05:43.690
so there was very little
primary research being gathered.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.090
And it was
interesting to see how

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.910
these older studies
or things that

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.030
were done elsewhere and
repurposed for this area

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.290
were rehashed and spun
out in different ways

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.960
that some people
thought were good

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.340
and other people were
very critical of.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.980
CHRIS MANNING: In a topic like
this about the environment

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.790
and more biologically
speaking, do

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.082
you feel that maybe you
came to understand some

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:07.110
of the limitations
of science and how it

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.649
might apply this type of field?

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:10.190
SUMMER BRENNAN:
Well, I guess it just

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.065
depends on what kind of
science you're doing.

00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:16.400
One of the most interesting
things about this conflict,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.590
actually, was how people had
maybe higher expectations

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.860
of certain scientific
processes than were

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.220
realistic for the situation.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.740
So to understand that these
things are an evolving process,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.650
and sometimes scientists
do make mistakes.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.310
So there was a spotlight
on this whole thing.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.130
So if anybody messed
up or interpreted

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.190
a study a different
way, it was seen

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.520
as maybe it was intentional.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.080
And so it drifted away from the
more collaborative and evolving

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.210
process that so much of
the biological sciences

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.320
are, where you work with
what information you can

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.110
and just keep going from there.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.610
CHRIS MANNING: So it spun in
different directions and things

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.220
like that based on the side.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.310
I think it's probably
generally true.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.440
So how did you get of
involved with the story?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.920
What captivated you
about it, or how did you

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.430
get your intro in it?

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.450
SUMMER BRENNAN: So I grew up out
near Point Reyes in West Marin.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.681
And I went east for
college, but before then, I

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:13.430
grew up out there.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.800
And I had never heard
of this conflict before.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.040
I knew of the oyster farm,
and obviously the park.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.490
But I got tired of living in
New York City after a while.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.350
I've been working
there for a long time.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.720
And I decided to move
back home for a while.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.220
So I got a job at a local paper,
and this was the main story

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.040
they were working on.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.550
So I got thrown into the mix
and right away introduced

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.570
to key people and
sent hundreds of pages

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.370
of research and opinion.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.247
So it was a lot.

00:07:39.247 --> 00:07:40.122
CHRIS MANNING: Great.

00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:41.913
Yeah, it definitely
sounds like it probably

00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:44.070
would have been a lot
to take on all at once.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.790
SUMMER BRENNAN: It
was fascinating.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.940
CHRIS MANNING: Cool.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.350
Did you have any
initial feelings

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.960
when you went into it about
maybe how you would have sided

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.430
with one side or the other?

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.100
Or did you just
really try to let

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.366
the facts speak for themselves?

00:07:58.366 --> 00:07:59.990
SUMMER BRENNAN: I
would think of myself

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.660
as being in the latter camp,
but without realizing it,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.750
I was just dropped
right into the middle

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:09.013
of the pro-oyster farm group,
because the paper was working

00:08:09.013 --> 00:08:10.770
as a support
system, and had ties

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.620
to people that were some
of its main advocates.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.490
So yeah.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.980
I started out very
much mostly just

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.060
hearing that one
side of the story

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.074
and reasons in favor
of the oyster farm.

00:08:21.074 --> 00:08:23.240
And not just the farm itself,
but the separate issue

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.380
of why it should
be able to stay.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.655
So my views of it changed
over time with more research.

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:32.287
CHRIS MANNING: OK, Cool.

00:08:32.287 --> 00:08:34.120
You've alluded to this
a little bit I think,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.750
but can you elaborate
a little bit more

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.370
on maybe some of the people
that were involved in the story,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.450
or how you got to know
them during the research

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.260
process and that kind of
thing, and just why they

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.680
felt so vehemently
one side or the other?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.660
SUMMER BRENNAN: Sure.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.785
I guess there's a couple
different questions there.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:09:00.460
In terms of the people that are
involved, for writing the book,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.354
I had to choose people from
different sections of groups

00:09:04.354 --> 00:09:06.020
that were involved
in this to highlight,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.395
because there were
so many people

00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:09.650
involved-- ranching community,
and different people

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.764
in the agricultural
community, environmentalists.

00:09:11.764 --> 00:09:13.930
And so while many of them
are mentioned in the book,

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:18.040
I had to pick out a
story from each faction,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.830
so to speak, to it
to illustrate it.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.390
So there's a rancher
in here who's

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.930
a friend of mine, Joey Mendoza,
and he's a third generation

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.490
cattleman.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.490
He actually just passed
away a couple weeks ago,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.450
unfortunately.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.770
So I tell his family
history in here

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.459
to give the voice of some of
the agricultural community

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:37.375
and their experiences.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.364
I don't know.

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:44.030
And I picked one of
the environmentalist

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.175
to highlight, and et cetera,
and with the oyster family.

00:09:47.175 --> 00:09:50.130
And just in terms of why people
were so enthusiastic about it,

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.990
or passionate
about this, I think

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.370
it varied, but I did
get a sense of a panic

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.480
about the way their
world is changing,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.560
and a sense of
running out of space,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.270
or running out of time to
protect certain things,

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.490
whether that's
small family farming

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.360
or environmental
protection of areas.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.040
And that's one of things
that really drew me to it.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.174
I do think we're at this
juncture where people

00:10:14.174 --> 00:10:16.090
are realizing we really
do have to take action

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.920
on a lot of this, because
they're seeing these things get

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.149
steamroll.

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:21.940
CHRIS MANNING: So
there's some other oyster

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.980
farms in Point Reyes as well.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.660
Folks here may have been to the
them, Tomales Bay, Hog Island.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.360
Those groups, were they a
part of this story at all,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.200
or did they have a stake in
the legal claim or anything?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.450
SUMMER BRENNAN: Well, they
were especially at the end.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.580
Tomales Bay Oyster Company ended
up being part of a lawsuit.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.039
A bundle of companies ended
up launching their own lawsuit

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:43.580
at the end, because
they were arguing

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.880
that the closure to
Drake's Bay Oyster Farm

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.160
would impact their
own businesses.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.690
But that lawsuit was dismissed
as frivolous by the judge.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.020
But it's a community of people,
of neighbors and friends.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.910
And they wanted to support
people that they knew,

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.160
so they definitely had
a lot of local support.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:00.920
CHRIS MANNING: To
that point, I think

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.490
this is a very local story
that you're describing here,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.490
but did you find that there were
also a lot broader implications

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.130
in some ways?

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.064
And what were those?

00:11:08.064 --> 00:11:08.980
SUMMER BRENNAN: I did.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.760
And as I think I was
getting at a little,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.320
we're at a time
where we're trying

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.270
to figure out how we're going
to manage lands that are left.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.630
And I think people are
realizing that our ideas of what

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.940
wilderness means
are fairly outdated.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.490
I mean, the Wilderness
Act is from 1964,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.150
and the way we talk
about wilderness

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.410
is a bit-- not to get
academic on people,

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.520
but it's very much rooted
in the colonial ideas,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.610
and it's very a sense of "we
as Europeans came and found

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.320
this Eden that was untouched by
man," which is completely false

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.505
and a myth.

00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:44.882
There were hundreds of
thousands of people living here.

00:11:44.882 --> 00:11:48.250
And from the first
contact with Europeans,

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.020
the population was much,
much higher, but diseases.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.270
winnowed the population down
so much that by the time

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.269
there was a huge influx
of Europeans, obviously,

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:57.400
especially Gold
Rush Era here, what

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.580
had been a very thriving human
population was diminished.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.160
So there's these false ideas
that we have about wilderness

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.550
being untouched, or
being a place where

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.260
people can't co-exist.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.351
And so I think it's
time to reevaluate

00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:12.350
those kinds of thoughts.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.410
And anyway, I'm
rambling, but I think

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.340
that that was at the
heart of this story,

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.910
of arguing what
belongs in wilderness

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.112
and what is a wilderness.

00:12:21.112 --> 00:12:22.820
SUMMER BRENNAN: Yeah,
I think absolutely.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.960
It may seem silly,
I guess, but just

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.040
from my own background and
studying history and things

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.840
like that, there's a
whole academic distinction

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.542
between the John Muir camp,
and the Gifford Pinchot camp,

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.500
and that kind of thing.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.057
So yeah, it's out there.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:38.890
CHRIS MANNING: Cool.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.991
So what sort of initial response
have you gotten to the book

00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:42.490
so far?

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.830
I imagine there's
obviously heated response

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.969
in some regards in Point Reyes,
but overall, on a larger level,

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:49.260
has it been generally positive?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.520
SUMMER BRENNAN: Yes, I'm
really pleased, actually.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.330
We were wondering when
we were making this book,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.920
is anyone going to care
about this little thing?

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.464
But it's been really great,
and living in New York,

00:12:59.464 --> 00:13:01.880
I've heard from a lot of people
in the publishing industry

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.117
there that have enjoyed it.

00:13:03.117 --> 00:13:04.700
So it's been getting
some great press.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.680
Obviously, locally, it was just
such a contentious, divisive

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.120
issue that people that
were on the losing side

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.910
are not thrilled to have the
story all laid out like this.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.750
CHRIS MANNING: Cool.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.375
That's awesome.

00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.570
I hope the audience
will humor me

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.380
a little bit that I have a few
questions that are specifically

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.174
about writing and your
process with writing.

00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:29.090
Can you share a little
bit about your process.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.920
And since this is
your first book,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.160
as I mentioned a
couple of times,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.060
did you find that any
tactics particularly

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.474
worked for you in the process?

00:13:36.474 --> 00:13:37.390
SUMMER BRENNAN: I did.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.765
I don't know if anyone here
is a writer other than having

00:13:39.765 --> 00:13:42.940
a regular job, but that's what
I was doing for part of this.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.100
And I read somewhere
that nobody wants

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.067
to hear about how hard
it is to write a book,

00:13:48.067 --> 00:13:49.900
because people think
it's a privileged thing

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.250
to be able to do.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.860
But it's all true
how hard it is,

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.210
and I think for a
first book especially.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.659
But actually, last summer, I
was having a lot of difficulty

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:01.700
with the writing process.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.880
And it just seemed
insurmountable.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.254
And there was so
much information

00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:05.750
that I was trying to distill.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.249
I mean, for every
page on this book,

00:14:07.249 --> 00:14:09.420
there's probably 100
pages of research

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.010
that we needlessly did.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.970
But still, just that
process was overwhelming.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:18.600
And I ended up taking an online
course with Susan Orlean, who's

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.100
a writer.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.420
And it was just pre-recorded,
and it seems silly,

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.690
but she had the best advice
for how to work in nonfiction

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.460
and taking this volume of
information from your research

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.030
and distilling it down to
your notes, and typing it up,

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.640
and just very methodical.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.890
And so I adapted and
adopted that approach.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.175
And so it was unrefined
research, and then notes

00:14:40.175 --> 00:14:44.020
and typed notes, and then
cards and moving them around.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.020
And so it was a very
organized process in that way,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.404
but that really helped me
to actually finish the book.

00:14:51.404 --> 00:14:52.820
CHRIS MANNING: No,
that's awesome.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.970
All you budding nonfiction
writers out there,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.299
Susan Orlean online course.

00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:57.090
Is that what it is?

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.920
SUMMER BRENNAN: Yeah, I'm
advertising for Skillshare,

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.210
but it was on Skillshare.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.140
It was really, really
great, and it helped me.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.930
I was about here, and it helped
me get all the way to the end.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:07.763
CHRIS MANNING: Cool.

00:15:07.763 --> 00:15:08.805
Very awesome.

00:15:08.805 --> 00:15:11.610
Well, I think you spoke to how
hard it is to write a book,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.110
but can you also mention some
of the other things that maybe

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.470
aren't a part of the writing,
but still are part of

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.370
getting the book out there?

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.360
I understand you did
an Indiegogo campaign

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.882
to help fund the book as well.

00:15:22.882 --> 00:15:25.090
So there's a whole business
side and things like that

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.416
that you had to take on.

00:15:26.416 --> 00:15:27.290
SUMMER BRENNAN: Yeah.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.770
Well, as people may
be aware, publishing

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.242
is not the richest
industry, or at least as

00:15:34.242 --> 00:15:35.450
compared to what it has been.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.370
So people talk
about book advances

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.070
maybe not being what
they used to be.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:41.214
I don't know.

00:15:41.214 --> 00:15:42.280
This is my first one.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.740
But that's what I've heard.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.880
And it's very hard to
do a book like this that

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.234
requires a lot of research.

00:15:47.234 --> 00:15:48.650
So it's not just
something I could

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.642
do-- I mean, I know novels
also take travel and research,

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:53.350
so I don't mean to
disparage that at all.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.580
But I had to go to
places physically

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.920
and do a lot of
research that could only

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.255
happen at a research library
during particular hours

00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:01.880
during the day.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.760
And so it was hard to fund it.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.602
So I ran out of
money to work on it,

00:16:06.602 --> 00:16:07.810
but I didn't want to give up.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.020
So yeah, I did an
Indiegogo campaign

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.300
and raised a little over $3,000.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.590
To it seems small,
but when you're

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.770
operating on a
shoe-string budget

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.860
and just trying to
get to the next thing,

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.664
it helped a lot, actually.

00:16:21.664 --> 00:16:23.330
CHRIS MANNING: My
role models as authors

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.020
and in the academic
world are female.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.880
And as a follower
of yours on Twitter,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.205
I've liked seeing that
some of your conversations

00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:32.480
are around topics of
being a female author.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.430
SUMMER BRENNAN: I talk
about feminism a lot.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.140
CHRIS MANNING: Can
you share anything

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.400
more about maybe
your perspective

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.566
about being a female author?

00:16:37.566 --> 00:16:39.830
Or maybe if there's any
challenges or unique things

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.940
that you've faced
in that capacity?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.100
SUMMER BRENNAN:
Well, I've only been

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:51.355
a published author for a couple
weeks now, so I'm new at it.

00:16:51.355 --> 00:16:53.642
What can I share?

00:16:53.642 --> 00:16:54.475
What's the question?

00:16:54.475 --> 00:16:55.360
What's it like?

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.770
CHRIS MANNING: Yeah.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.320
What's your perspective like?

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.940
Did you feel like
you encountered

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.910
any different challenges, or was
it a pretty standard process?

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.040
SUMMER BRENNAN: I think so.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.760
I don't know if I
should talk about them.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.680
No, I mean, I don't
know if people

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.980
are familiar with Rebecca
Solnit, the author,

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.010
but she has a great,
famous essay called

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.859
"Men Explain Things to Me."

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.899
And it's interesting.

00:17:16.899 --> 00:17:17.940
It's an interesting read.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:23.900
So I think sometimes there is
a bit of ingrained cultural

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.400
things that people
don't necessarily

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.316
realize they're doing.

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:29.520
And so people will explain
my own subject to me

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.729
and sort of assume ignorance.

00:17:30.729 --> 00:17:32.478
And I'm like, I did
write a book about it,

00:17:32.478 --> 00:17:33.780
but thank you for sharing.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.830
Well, you know, you
don't want to be rude,

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.730
and people mean well.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.250
And so I don't think it's
malicious most of the time.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.650
And I'm not a total
spring chicken,

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.910
but I'm relatively
young for authors,

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.650
and so that might
be part of it too.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.496
But I'm still brand
new, so I'm sure I'll

00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:48.870
have lots of other
horror stories

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.380
to tell as time goes on.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:51.880
Or not.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.463
Hopefully not.

00:17:52.463 --> 00:17:54.010
CHRIS MANNING:
Yeah, hopefully not.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.060
But no, that's cool.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.360
I think particularly
with a topic that

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.030
was so contentious
to begin with,

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.449
where people had such
personal feelings about it,

00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:03.490
I think it's interesting.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:03.680
SUMMER BRENNAN: Absolutely.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.540
Well, there's somebody
that was in the book that's

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.090
been critical of the book, and
doesn't agree with the things

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.050
that I have laid out.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.980
And so I think that
I did my research.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.270
I have a bibliography.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.975
It's all there.

00:18:15.975 --> 00:18:17.350
CHRIS MANNING:
It's professional.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.266
SUMMER BRENNAN: Right.

00:18:18.266 --> 00:18:19.590
But anyway, it's interesting.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.290
CHRIS MANNING:
Yeah, that's great.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.490
One of the quotations
that starts out

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.500
the book is "everything
not saved will be lost."

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.730
And it's a line from Nintendo,
as you put it in there.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.834
How do you understand that quote
in the context of your story?

00:18:32.834 --> 00:18:35.000
SUMMER BRENNAN: So everything
not saved will be lost

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.220
is such a great big
accidentally deep phrase.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.700
And when I came across it,
I'm not the first person

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.790
to repurpose that, but I was
really struck by it, especially

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.950
since what I felt was
at the core of this book

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.680
was a fear of loss
of different kinds,

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.890
whether it was of this
particular farm or a type

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.790
of way of life, small
farming, or the environment,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.960
that it was just this
sense of urgency.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.320
Maybe I'm taking it too
literal, but that's just really

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.600
what I got from it, is just
this wake-up call of everything

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.140
not saved will be lost.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.467
And it's fun that it's Nintendo.

00:19:13.467 --> 00:19:14.550
CHRIS MANNING: Definitely.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.640
Since we're in the
Bay Area, we're

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.220
in a time right now
of expensive housing.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.650
Sometimes, the environment
seems to become an issue

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.142
in that in that
maybe we shouldn't

00:19:25.142 --> 00:19:27.600
protect certain area because
we should build housing there.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.530
We should build something
to help the economy

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.230
and that type of thing.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.680
Do you think that
the conversation

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.100
around what it means to be wild
and where the environment is

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.930
in a time right now, how do
you see that playing out,

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.440
I guess, in the story,
but also, I guess,

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.089
more holistically
on a larger scale?

00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:46.130
SUMMER BRENNAN: Oh, sure.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.370
Well, I mean, it definitely
was a big issue in the story,

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.530
because that was the
question, of course.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.950
Are we going to have this
place for something commercial

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.660
that is going to be an element
in the community in terms

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.350
of creating jobs and
foods and all that stuff?

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.630
Or whether it can be set
aside for the environment?

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.088
And obviously, that
is a big issue.

00:20:04.088 --> 00:20:06.310
And with the economic
problems, it's

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:11.420
easy to argue for supporting
economies over the environment.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.670
But the problem is that once
you destroy an ecosystem,

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.780
it's incredibly difficult if
not impossible to restore it.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.510
But everything is
damaged at this point.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.040
I mean, there isn't really
any intact ecosystem anywhere

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.690
in America as they
would have existed

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.840
300 years ago because
of invasive species

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.570
from big animals to tiny plants.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.169
But it's a question that's
coming up everywhere, I think.

00:20:34.169 --> 00:20:35.710
CHRIS MANNING: So
my final question--

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.085
and then I'm hoping that maybe
some folks in the audience

00:20:38.085 --> 00:20:41.540
have some questions as well--
is hopefully a fun one.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.700
Do you have a
favorite oyster style?

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.900
Do you like oysters?

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.899
SUMMER BRENNAN: Oh gosh.

00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:52.990
So I love oysters, and yes, I
actually like them just raw.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.104
So that's my favorite
way to have them.

00:20:56.104 --> 00:20:57.520
But I like especially
if they have

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.910
a little bit of the liqueur
still left in the shell.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.250
So yeah, I eat oysters a lot.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:02.750
It's great.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:03.820
They're really
having a renaissance,

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.829
especially in New York.

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:07.370
It almost seems like everywhere
has an oyster happy hour now.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.227
So it's a good place to stop in.

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:11.310
CHRIS MANNING: Do you have
a favorite oyster place

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.050
that you used to go for them?

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.508
SUMMER BRENNAN: Well, actually,
I love Grand Central Oyster

00:21:15.508 --> 00:21:17.800
Bar in Midtown.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.380
When I work at the
UN, it's close by.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.000
So it's a nice place
on the way home to--

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.250
CHRIS MANNING:
How about locally?

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.210
SUMMER BRENNAN: Yeah?

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.660
Oh, locally?

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.180
I think my favorite--
well, I don't

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.720
want to-- they're all great.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.320
I like all the oyster farms.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.892
I especially like Hog
Island Oyster's sweetwaters.

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:36.350
Hog Island sweetwaters, I think
that's what they're called.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.100
They're excellent.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.030
If you haven't them,
definitely give it a try.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.122
CHRIS MANNING: Cool.

00:21:42.122 --> 00:21:44.080
Does anybody in the
audience have any questions

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.070
they'd like to ask Summer?

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.569
Great.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:50.765
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:50.765 --> 00:21:51.556
SUMMER BRENNAN: Hi.

00:21:51.556 --> 00:21:53.532
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for being here.

00:21:53.532 --> 00:21:54.532
It was great to see you.

00:21:57.508 --> 00:22:00.484
I lived in [INAUDIBLE]
from 2008 to 2012,

00:22:00.484 --> 00:22:03.956
and I came to a couple of town
halls, and I knew some people.

00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:06.684
And whenever people asked
me about the story, what's

00:22:06.684 --> 00:22:10.440
happening, I would be like, I
don't even know where to start.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.430
It's so complicated.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.730
And I'm curious.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:18.950
Even today, you presented most
of your thoughts as questions.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.918
It's just something that
we're grappling with.

00:22:20.918 --> 00:22:22.394
It's really hard to understand.

00:22:22.394 --> 00:22:24.066
So I'm curious--
I'm looking forward

00:22:24.066 --> 00:22:26.822
to buying your book today--
how you lay the story out

00:22:26.822 --> 00:22:30.810
and how you decided
is it chronological?

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.580
SUMMER BRENNAN: So it jumps
around a little, actually.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.470
And I tried to think of it
in the planning of the story.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.020
Well, first, I actually laid
everything out chronologically

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.670
in my notes.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.390
So I made a massive timeline
that was like 8,000 BC,

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.300
Miwoks settle in Olema.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.520
And then the most
recent was January 1st,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.620
oyster farm is gone.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.280
And then included
within that timeline

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.540
was everybody's birthdays and
death dates and everything.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.890
And then I switched it around.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.460
So your question
was chronological.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.529
It's quite chronological
towards the end,

00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:02.570
because it sort of just
is the momentum of moving

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.504
through this story,
where it's local,

00:23:04.504 --> 00:23:06.920
and suddenly, you've got Koch
brother attorneys coming in,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.355
and the Supreme Court,
and then all these people.

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:12.730
But it does jump around a
bit, and you going along

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.380
chronologically,
and then I step back

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.009
to Sir Francis Drake at the
beginning of the next section.

00:23:18.009 --> 00:23:20.300
AUDIENCE: What would you say
the lasting impact of this

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.200
has been on the
community in Port Reyes?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.500
SUMMER BRENNAN: Oh gosh.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.190
Well, I think that's still
being figured out to a degree.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:32.010
It's still a very hotly
contested, debated issue.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.340
And with the book coming
out, it's flared up,

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.510
and there's been some angry
things in the newspaper

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.550
and people that violently
dislike the book,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.570
and other people that are
absolutely thrilled with it.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:46.640
So locally, I think it has
created some lasting divisions

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.040
between some people in
the agricultural community

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.380
and in the
environmental community.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.780
There's some trust
that's been lost there.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.220
And with the National
Park too, people

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.540
that feel that they
handled this very badly,

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.630
they're nervous about
anything that they do.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.890
So there's other issues popping
up with Tule elk management

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.416
and different things that
require public input that I

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:15.700
think that they're
trying to soothe over,

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:21.154
but those tensions are
still felt, I think.

00:24:21.154 --> 00:24:21.978
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:21.978 --> 00:24:22.390
SUMMER BRENNAN: Hi.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.780
AUDIENCE: So I guess my
question is from maybe a broader

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.380
perspective.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.290
Throughout the course
of your research,

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.820
obviously, one of
the like the core

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.490
tenets that we're grappling
with is the rise of agriculture

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.990
and how that fits in
with our environment.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.422
Were you optimistic
as you learned more

00:24:38.422 --> 00:24:39.755
about modern farming techniques?

00:24:39.755 --> 00:24:41.160
And do you feel
like these two are

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.951
going to be able to
reconcile in the future

00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:47.980
where we can have a successful
and large society that

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.760
reconciles with our environment?

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.530
SUMMER BRENNAN: Yeah, I
mean, I work with this stuff

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.920
a little bit with
the UN as well.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.520
And I think what's encouraging
is that we have the technology

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.980
to do all these
things sustainably,

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.030
even our energy production
and transportation.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.530
It's just a question
of implementing

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.140
the systems is my take on it.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.240
And that's the same with
agriculture as well.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.850
So there's different obstacles
to that, and some of them

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:13.964
are finances.

00:25:13.964 --> 00:25:15.380
And at other times,
there are just

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.199
people that are in
powerful positions,

00:25:17.199 --> 00:25:19.490
or they have industries that
they don't want to see go.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.600
So that's where
you run into-- it's

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.880
hard to make that
transition, I think.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.000
So it's technically possible.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.300
I just hope that we can make it
economically possible as well.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.660
And this was a lot about
fisheries, the agriculture,

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.790
but it's an oyster farm.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.840
So I had to look a lot at that.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.430
And I we do need to
drastically change

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:45.780
how we handle fishing and
seafood, because fish stocks,

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.880
I think, are projected
to collapse in 50 years

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.190
if we don't change.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.134
So I hope we can change that.

00:25:51.134 --> 00:25:53.550
CHRIS MANNING: I'd be interested
in how your for at the UN

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.180
has also influenced
some of the stuff

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.250
that you were able to
write in this story.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.070
Did you find that to
be the case at all?

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.420
Maybe the systems thinking part?

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.253
SUMMER BRENNAN: I think
it helped me to take

00:26:02.253 --> 00:26:03.529
a bit of a step back from it.

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:05.070
Working as a reporter
in Point Reyes,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.790
I started in 2012, so I
guess you were still there.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.645
You know, you can get a little
myopic about the whole thing,

00:26:12.645 --> 00:26:14.520
but when you step back
and look at the bigger

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.740
picture in the context of
climate change, and ocean

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.140
acidification, and even just
in conflicts in general.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.310
In the book, I compare it to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.100
which some people
think is kind of funny.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.090
Leonard Lopate laughed about
that when I was on his show.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.120
But it did remind
me of that in a way.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.070
You can see that any time you're
in conflict about something,

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.440
especially if it's over
land, the same things

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.480
come up again and again.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.882
So yeah, I think it
really helped me,

00:26:38.882 --> 00:26:41.340
especially since it was such
a personal story, to step back

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.270
a little bit and see
it for the themes that

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.620
are recurring issues.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.270
CHRIS MANNING: Any other
questions in the audience?

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.620
AUDIENCE: I guess my perspective
of the Wilderness Act,

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.730
or my understanding
of the intent

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.820
there is that it
protects areas such

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.330
that there's no human activity.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.710
It belongs to nature.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:07.710
And the primary thing
that it prevents against

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:15.110
is any sort of man-made building
or man-made-- and commerce,

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.760
that's definitely very man-made.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.430
And commerce has a huge
impact on the environment.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:26.865
So I was curious, one,
what your perspective was,

00:27:26.865 --> 00:27:28.490
because it sounded
like you had changed

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:33.245
your perspective over time
through working in a newspaper

00:27:33.245 --> 00:27:34.560
and what not.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.480
But also broadly, is my
understanding of the Wilderness

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.625
Act, am I wrong there?

00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:42.000
SUMMER BRENNAN:
No, you're right.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.669
So the Wilderness Act, the
language is a little poetic.

00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:46.710
I'm going to misquote it
here, but it's something

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.650
along the lines
of a wilderness is

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:53.530
an area where the works
of man are not dominant.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:58.160
It's where the community
of nature is untrampled

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.140
and where man is a visitor
but does not remain.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.600
So that's a mangled
version of that line.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.196
But you're absolutely right.

00:28:05.196 --> 00:28:07.239
It's that it's set
aside not for mankind.

00:28:07.239 --> 00:28:07.780
We can visit.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.369
We can go take a hike there,
but we can't ride our mountain

00:28:10.369 --> 00:28:12.160
bikes, and there's not
supposed to be road,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.370
not supposed to be buildings,
definitely not supposed

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.465
to be private businesses.

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:18.670
So I agree with that.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.140
So that is what the
Wilderness Act was saying.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.870
And when wilderness
is designated,

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.200
that is the purpose.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.272
Along with that,
when that happened,

00:28:27.272 --> 00:28:29.105
there were also writings
that spoke about it

00:28:29.105 --> 00:28:34.900
in an idenic, humanless way
that other academics and critics

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.070
have argued erased and dismiss
the indigenous people that

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.090
were living here.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.780
So I agree with what the
Wilderness Act says and sets

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.490
aside.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.540
And I think that it can
be only strengthened

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.320
by acknowledging the
state of this land

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.440
before Europeans came
and colonized it.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.160
Because I think those arguments
have been used to undermine it.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.570
I feel there's been an
incomplete reevaluation

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:02.940
of our older wilderness ideas.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.140
A positive reexamination
of those begins by saying,

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.556
well, just remember,
when you talk

00:29:06.556 --> 00:29:08.860
about it being a landscape
where man isn't dominant,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.730
there were people living here.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.030
And that's true.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:16.550
And part of, not wilderness,
but national parks

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:21.144
do protect cultural, historic
areas and things like that.

00:29:21.144 --> 00:29:22.810
But anyway, I don't
know if that answers

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.940
your question a little bit,
but it's both of those things.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.480
And I think it actually is
set aside not for people.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.024
But we also need to
acknowledge that there

00:29:31.024 --> 00:29:32.940
were people living here,
and you can't pretend

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.180
that that wasn't the case.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.270
But we have to preserve
them, because there's people

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:38.770
everywhere.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.980
And we do need to set aside
some places that are just

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.940
for natural ecosystems
to prepare them or let

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.305
them be intact.

00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:46.680
AUDIENCE: Was
there actually case

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.987
in this story where Native
Americans were farming oysters?

00:29:50.987 --> 00:29:53.570
SUMMER BRENNAN: No, actually,
as I found researching the book,

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.810
there were not
native populations

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.160
of oysters in the Bay Area,
at least as recently as

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.780
like over 1,000 years ago.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.770
And I'd thought that there'd
been all these native oysters

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.750
in San Francisco Bay,
but actually they

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.426
were imported from
Washington, and New York,

00:30:09.426 --> 00:30:10.800
and other parts
of the East Coast

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.670
by oyster businessmen
around the Gold Rush.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.830
So that's in here too.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.610
So there aren't any stories
of Native Americans harvesting

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.020
oysters, per se-- other things.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.690
So I did talk to the chief
of the local tribe that

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.480
once lived in that area, and
it was really interesting.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.180
Because he's a modern person
with modern businesses,

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:37.410
and yet, is tasked with carrying
on this spiritual heritage

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.350
of the place as well.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.266
And so that was a really
interesting dichotomy

00:30:40.266 --> 00:30:41.550
to encounter.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.640
So I tried to incorporate
as many of those voices

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.430
as I could.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.470
AUDIENCE: Are there any
similar cases to this

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.110
anywhere else in North America
or the rest of the world?

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:55.270
SUMMER BRENNAN: Well,
to this particular case,

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.450
not to my knowledge.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.210
But there are
instances everywhere

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.010
where they have tried to
pry open protected areas

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.590
for different reasons.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.440
We have people following the
news with the Arctic right now.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.900
That's just with whether
that'll be wilderness

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.691
or what's going on.

00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:12.440
So I didn't find a case
that was really like this.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.382
There was an issue with
an Indian trader outpost

00:31:15.382 --> 00:31:16.840
that people compared
this to, where

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.084
he was in a national park.

00:31:18.084 --> 00:31:19.750
But it wasn't a
wilderness area, so it's

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.849
a bit of a different story.

00:31:22.849 --> 00:31:24.640
AUDIENCE: It sounded
like this actually did

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.950
go through the court system.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.560
SUMMER BRENNAN: Yes, it did.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.190
AUDIENCE: It seems
conceptually like it

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.430
should be a pretty--
legally, it seems

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.000
like it if it's
in the wilderness,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.510
it shouldn't be allowed.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:38.700
The contract expired, and
so the contract's finished.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.860
Was there any more legal
precedent that was set,

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.272
or was the court
case mostly just?

00:31:44.272 --> 00:31:45.730
SUMMER BRENNAN:
Well, I mean, to be

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.230
spoilers-- I guess you can see
this in the news-- the oyster

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.740
farm was shut down,
and they did not

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.989
compromise the Wilderness Act.

00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:53.249
So it did go through
the courts, and they

00:31:53.249 --> 00:31:55.290
did petition the Supreme
Court, but they said no.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.980
So it almost went is as high
as it could, but it didn't.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.520
Many people agree with you that
it was absolutely clear-cut,

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.090
and it was only a lot
of smoke and mirrors

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.423
that confused it in the process.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.470
Because it was
designated in '76 as

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:10.960
wilderness, and
the '64 Wilderness

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.406
Act dictates what wilderness is.

00:32:13.406 --> 00:32:15.030
But there was confusion
in the process.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.020
Not everybody agreed on
what wilderness means,

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.561
and that's why I
thought that getting

00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:19.962
at the core of
what is wilderness

00:32:19.962 --> 00:32:21.670
was such an important
issue in this book.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.130
Because you had Senator
Dianne Feinstein writing

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.970
in defense of the
oyster farm, saying this

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.200
is not a wilderness area.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.110
Even though it had
been designated as one

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.160
36 years prior, she said this
is not a remote wilderness.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.916
There's cattle ranches and
dairy firms on all sides.

00:32:34.916 --> 00:32:36.665
It's such and such
close to San Francisco.

00:32:36.665 --> 00:32:38.210
It doesn't count.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.260
And so that was what
was interesting to me.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.570
Who decides what's wilderness?

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.069
And why does it
count as wilderness?

00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:47.500
And that's why I think it is
such an important case going

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.475
forward, that you can't
just come and say,

00:32:49.475 --> 00:32:51.350
well, actually this
place is a bit messed up,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.220
so let's just scrap the whole
wilderness thing about it

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.030
and take it away.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.162
So that was the argument.

00:32:57.162 --> 00:32:58.620
OK, well, we said
it is wilderness,

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.260
but maybe we should
take that back,

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.510
because on second thought,
maybe not so much.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.600
But it is wilderness.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.022
They won.

00:33:08.022 --> 00:33:10.480
CHRIS MANNING: So when the
Lunny family took over-- Is that

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:10.790
how you say it?

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:10.860
The Lunny?

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.650
SUMMER BRENNAN: The Lunny, yeah.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.149
CHRIS MANNING: Yeah, the Lunny
family took over in, I think,

00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:15.130
2005, was it?

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.880
SUMMER BRENNAN: Yeah,
sale closed in 2005.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.296
CHRIS MANNING: Was
it their intent

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.130
to fight that concept
of the wilderness, or?

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.629
SUMMER BRENNAN: I
don't know if they

00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:23.660
wanted to fight the
concept of the wilderness.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.560
I know that they grew up-- Kevin
Lunny, who bought the farm,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.830
grew up next door.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:32.817
And his goal seemed to
be that he would really

00:33:32.817 --> 00:33:34.400
work to clean up the
farm, and then it

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.380
would be able to continue.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.820
It was a very
lucrative business.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.100
I mean, recently, they
mentioned that last year, I

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.300
believe, the oyster farm
made about $5 million,

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.184
which isn't huge,
but it's a lot.

00:33:44.184 --> 00:33:45.100
It's more than I make.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.340
So there's a lot of
initiatives, and I

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.340
know that they were really
fond of the business.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.410
And I think it seems
at their motivations,

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.530
they thought if
they could just show

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.000
that they were good
environmental stewards-- which

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.610
is why there were so many
fights about the science.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.790
It's that they were
accused of being

00:33:58.790 --> 00:33:59.910
poor environmental stewards.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:00.940
They were like, how
can you say that?

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.260
We're working so hard
to clean up this area.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.532
Because their predecessors had
a lot of environmental problems,

00:34:06.532 --> 00:34:08.490
which I was really shocked,
the more research I

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:10.215
did, how extensive they were.

00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:11.465
So they had a lot to clean up.

00:34:11.465 --> 00:34:13.862
I think they just got
in over their head.

00:34:13.862 --> 00:34:15.820
CHRIS MANNING: Any thoughts
for your next book?

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.510
Is that even--

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.676
SUMMER BRENNAN: I don't
know if I can talk about it.

00:34:18.676 --> 00:34:20.850
So I do have a couple
things I've been working on.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.420
I joked on Twitter about novel,
but don't hold your breath.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.100
But I have a couple
nonfiction projects

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.826
that have been in the works,
that I pitched to my agent,

00:34:29.826 --> 00:34:30.909
but not to any publishers.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:34.309
So we'll see what
gets picked up next.

00:34:34.309 --> 00:34:35.850
CHRIS MANNING: You
think nonfiction's

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.840
a medium that you're going to
stick with for a little bit?

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.215
SUMMER BRENNAN:
I really love it.

00:34:39.215 --> 00:34:40.449
I love research.

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:42.817
I made a joke that
I could probably

00:34:42.817 --> 00:34:44.400
write about research
libraries the way

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.699
some people write love poems.

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.030
And so that excites me.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.570
And I like historical stuff.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:54.920
So both of my next projects
are very historically based.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.840
One of my favorite
writers is Erik Larson,

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.506
and I think he does
just a wonderful job

00:34:58.506 --> 00:35:01.030
of finding all this great,
rich historical detail,

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.397
and telling it like a novel.

00:35:02.397 --> 00:35:04.230
And so I'd like to get
better at doing that.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.560
That's my plan.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.518
CHRIS MANNING: Awesome.

00:35:05.518 --> 00:35:06.870
Definitely a need for it.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:11.460
AUDIENCE: In an ideal
world, or if you didn't

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.540
have to pay attention
to the legislation

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.170
or what not, what
do you think would

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:19.055
have been-- in your opinion,
what would you have done?

00:35:19.055 --> 00:35:20.930
SUMMER BRENNAN: If I
was the deciding person?

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.346
AUDIENCE: If you
were the decider,

00:35:22.346 --> 00:35:25.170
and there was no law that
you had to pay attention to.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.090
SUMMER BRENNAN: So if there
was no wilderness designation?

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:29.590
See, that's an
interesting question.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.712
Because if there wasn't a
wilderness designation--

00:35:32.712 --> 00:35:34.420
I'm avoiding your
question a little bit--

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.830
I heard other people
argue that there's

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.670
no reason why the farm couldn't
have existed peacefully

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.560
as long as they always
followed the regulations.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.340
My observation is that
they did not always

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.690
follow the regulations, and
that it's very difficult

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.669
to make all of your
employees follow the rules

00:35:48.669 --> 00:35:50.960
and understand why you have
to follow particular rules,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.022
because sometimes they
don't seem logical to you.

00:35:53.022 --> 00:35:54.980
And you can say, look,
I know this environment.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.930
I know what it needs.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:57.840
But you're not always right.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.960
So it's tricky.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.970
So I don't know.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:02.470
It's hard.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:04.650
I mean, being a
local too, it was

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.960
very scary to come up
against information

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.650
that made it suggest maybe
the farm should have gone.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.941
Because you know you're going
to get a lot of pushback.

00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:14.580
But that was the impression
that I got by the end.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.300
So I feel that the farm
itself, the infrastructure,

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.134
just wasn't environmentally
sound enough.

00:36:20.134 --> 00:36:21.800
If they could have
completely restarted,

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.480
had tons of money to just pull
everything out of the estuary

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.200
and start over from scratch with
this totally green operation

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.660
that didn't have the decades
of environmental issues

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.750
and no wilderness
designation, and nobody ever

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.110
goes near the baby seals,
and, all that stuff,

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.200
they maybe could have
worked something out.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.310
But unfortunately, that whole
scenario just wasn't the case.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.560
CHRIS MANNING: Thanks so
much, Summer, for joining us.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.979
And thanks for coming to Google.

00:36:44.979 --> 00:36:46.270
SUMMER BRENNAN: Thanks so much.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.210
CHRIS MANNING: Everybody
go buy the book

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:49.900
if you haven't already,
and support Summer's work.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:50.900
It's great.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.640
Thank you.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.931
SUMMER BRENNAN: Thanks so much.

00:36:52.931 --> 00:36:55.290
[APPLAUSE]
