1
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.491
Okay.

2
00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:06.260
So we're going to finish up on nuclear fillic substitution elimination reactions

3
00:00:06.261 --> 00:00:08.060
today,
uh,
with,

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.120
and have an example of a practical application of them and then go on to the

5
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:19.820
reverse reaction of,
of,
uh,
of elimination,

6
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:22.250
which is addition to alkenes.

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.050
So a new functional group and we'll be talking about the stability of them
today.

8
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.770
The stability alkenes.
Okay.
So,
uh,

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.450
last time we got,
we got started on,
uh,

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.600
the silver assisted a substitution reaction of neopentyl iodide.

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.070
And notice something interesting in this.

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.100
If we look at those red crosses that trace the carbon skeleton of the starting

13
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:55.490
material and the product,
what do you notice about the carbon skeleton?

14
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.980
Does it look like a normal substitution?
Ellen,

15
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.180
what do you say?
No.
Why?

16
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.480
There's not an extra carbon.

17
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:12.750
There are five carbons on the left and there five carpets on the right,

18
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.140
but they're not hooked together the same way.
Right?

19
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:21.310
So there's be it been a rearrangement of the carbon skeleton during this

20
00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:24.160
reaction.
So how did this happen?
Well,

21
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.510
silver comes down and pulls off iodide,
right?

22
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:32.710
Which would then generate this cad.
I am,
but in the cad I,

23
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:37.480
and we have a low Lumo obviously on the,
uh,
on the cat ionic carbon,

24
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.690
but there are homos next door.

25
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.090
They're not very high homos there,
the CEC Sigma bonds.

26
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.190
But you could imagine that since primary cad ions are rather unstable,

27
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:55.930
and we'll give some more evidence on this later on that you could get,

28
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.053
uh,

29
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.390
a rearrangement in which first the homo next door is shared with the,

30
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.890
uh,
with the Lumo of the carbon cat iron.

31
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.120
Did you ever see a structure like that before where the pair of electrons is

32
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.770
shared with an adjacent Adam?
That's the why bond,
right?

33
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:18.520
The three center to electron bond,
right.

34
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.380
And then it could keep going,

35
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.770
which would give the tertiary cad ion a carbon with three other carbon carbon

36
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.690
cad.
I end with three other carbons attached to it,

37
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.040
which is much more stable than the primary,
uh,
uh,

38
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.930
cad ion is in fact,
it's,

39
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.660
it's possible that it doesn't even go that way,
that,

40
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.700
that at the same time the iodide is leaving and beginning to develop this

41
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.980
unstable primary cad ion.

42
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.340
The methyl next door should shift across so that you directly get the cat ionic

43
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.740
rearrangement product.
But at any rate,

44
00:02:56.741 --> 00:03:01.460
once you have the carbons rearranged like that,
a simple matter to have,
uh,

45
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.610
and notice what that means is that the sigma of the carbon carbon sigma bond is

46
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:11.110
actually acting as a nucleophile in a displacement reaction,
right?

47
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.760
The carbon next door,
his backside attack as the iodide is leaving,

48
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.990
but it's within the molecule that the reaction is occurring.
Okay?

49
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.510
But then you can bring water down of course,
and finally lose a proton,

50
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.700
which will give the product that the crucial thing is this rearrangement because

51
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.690
the fact of the rearrangement shows that there must've been a cat eye and

52
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.020
intermediate without that cat die.

53
00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:41.170
And there would've been no means for the rearrangement to take place in the

54
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.500
carbon skeleton.
Carbon skeletons don't normally rearrange,

55
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.900
but when you lose electrons and can get these two center to two electron,

56
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:54.610
three center bonds,
then carbon could move from one place to the adjacent one.

57
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.530
So the fact of the rearrangement shows that this was an sn one reaction,

58
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.260
that there was a cat eye.
And intermediate if to had there been no Canada,

59
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.810
I end intermediate,
there couldn't have been a rearrangement.
Okay,

60
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:12.370
let's think just a second about the rearrangement.
So we have,
uh,
about this,
uh,

61
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.370
uh,
three,
three center to electron bond.

62
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.070
So we could imagine bringing a proton down,

63
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.830
mixing with the Pi electrons to form a three,
uh,

64
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.820
three center to electron bond.

65
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.040
We could also imagine bringing into hydrogen down on one end of an Alkene,
uh,

66
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.080
to form a normal kind of cad ion.
And of course it could go on the other end too.

67
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.820
Now the question is,

68
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.810
you could get from one of these to the next by shifting the hydrogen from left

69
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:45.190
to right.
Okay.
That's the rearrangement.
Okay.

70
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.690
But the question,
is it,
is it a single minimum or is it a double minimum?

71
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.350
Do you have two normal cad ions which have a transition state?

72
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:56.620
They can go across,

73
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.000
back and forth between them that's not too high because it has this,
uh,

74
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.060
three center to electron bond or might it be that that bridged structure is in

75
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:11.020
fact the lowest energy structure and it's a single minimum.
Okay.

76
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.590
So you can do a,
uh,

77
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.240
simple calculations to check this and you may or may not believe them,

78
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:20.074
but these,

79
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.610
these particular ones are well supported by experimental evidence that we don't

80
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:29.430
have time to go into right now.
Uh,
but if you,

81
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.250
if you take the open compound,
that's what it's homo looks like,

82
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.410
and you notice that the homo,

83
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.940
which you would have guessed from the structure on the top is the sigma ch bond,

84
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.350
right?

85
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.350
In fact is mixed with some of the electron density in that homo or homo minus

86
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:51.070
one it is,
is,
is,
is shared over onto the,
uh,

87
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.480
cat ionic carbon,
right?
It's distorted.
You can see that,

88
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.230
that the electrons are shifting that way.

89
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.940
And the Lumo is the other way around that there's some vacancy of the,

90
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.320
of the orbitals that are involved in the ch bond,
right?

91
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.440
So you can imagine that resonance structure,

92
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:13.340
the one that's drawn in color just below to the right,

93
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.920
but you could also have this structure,

94
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.830
which is a proton plus a carbon carbon double bond.

95
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.210
Or You could have a resonance structure that has a long stretched bond.

96
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:28.070
Remember when you draw a resonance structures,
you don't move the nuclei,
right?

97
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:32.300
So it's,
you don't draw that hydrogen over on the right,
right?

98
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:35.750
You draw it with a really long bond cause they have to be in the same position.

99
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.320
And if you take those three simultaneously into the,
into account,

100
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.920
it says you can have positive charge either on the right carbon,

101
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.290
on the hydrogen or on the left carbon.

102
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:53.291
So that's what's denoted by drawing this why that the two electrons are shared

103
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:56.780
among these three centers.
And the positive charge therefore is shared.

104
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.930
And we can see it in the orbitals that that's the way it works.

105
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:02.960
And of course it makes sense that you should have that.
Of course,

106
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.110
the Cah Sigma bond isn't a very high homo,

107
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.030
so it's not drastically shifted,
not 50 50.
However,
if,

108
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.920
uh,

109
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.920
and we call that the stabilization due to that Homo Lumo mixing hyper

110
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:21.710
conjugation,
I think we've talked about that before.
And incidentally,

111
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.540
that's one of the factors that makes highly substituted carbon cat I and stable.

112
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.890
Because if you have a carbon next door,
not a,
if you have a hydrogen next door,

113
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.150
right,
there's no way that the electrons involved in that bond can stay,

114
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.160
can mix with the p orbital,
the vacant p orbital because there are thugs funnel.

115
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.150
But if you have a carbon and then a bond,
the electrons in that bond can overlap.

116
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.200
So the more carbons you have attached to this carbon,

117
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.580
the more bonds there are.

118
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.380
That can be who's electrons can be stabilized by mixing with the vacant orbital.

119
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.650
So that hyper conjugation is one reason that more substituted cat ions are more

120
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.070
stable.
Right now if we go to the bridge structure,

121
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.280
which is actually symmetrically bridged,
although the program drew that,
uh,

122
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.780
for its own reasons,
with a different kind of bond.

123
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.860
And if we look at the Homo,
you can see that it's symmetrical.

124
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:20.570
You can see it's the,
uh,
it's the Pi orbital,
but it's distorted because the,

125
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.990
the hydrogen orbital is mixed with it,
right?

126
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.560
And the Lumo is,
is the,
uh,

127
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.820
is the Po the anti-bonding combination or the Lumo plus one in this case.

128
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.920
So you can see those,
how those orbitals participate.
Okay.
But in fact,

129
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:41.720
in this calculation,
it's a double minimum.
The,
the,
the,

130
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:45.650
uh,
open structure is lower in energy than the bridge structure.

131
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.130
So it's a double minimum,
but it's different if you have,

132
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:50.900
instead of a hydrogen on the top,

133
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.230
you have a methyl group on top because the methyl has a somewhat bigger orbital

134
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:57.720
than hydrogen does.

135
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.900
So it's better at overlapping two neighbors that hydrogen was okay.

136
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.160
So now it turns out to be a single minimum.
That's the lowest energy structure.

137
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.140
And again,
you can see the homo,

138
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.170
which is a p orbital on the carbon overlapping with pie and the Lumo,

139
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:18.960
which I put in only because I've been drawing these things,

140
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.590
but I wouldn't spend a lot of time worrying about that one.

141
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.970
But at any rate,
it's a single minimum.
So that,
so that,

142
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.540
that structure is in fact bridge.
Now here I've added,

143
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.280
I've made the Alkene,

144
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.570
the CC double bond unsymmetrical such that the carbon cad I,

145
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:39.510
and it would be more stable on one side than on the other.

146
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.910
One side is more substituted.
Right?

147
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:47.220
And in this case it distorts so that it's sort of a double minimum,

148
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:51.870
but that one side is very low,
right?
So it's an unsymmetrical,

149
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.490
a cat eye and open,
not,
not strongly bridged.

150
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.480
That's its structure.
And there's the,
the homo,
which again is,

151
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.140
uh,
is,
is somewhat mixed,

152
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.380
but I don't waste time looking at those things.

153
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:10.980
I just put them in because I had him.
Hey.
But anyhow,

154
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.330
it's a sort of double minimum in the sense that it's not a bridge bridge

155
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:19.740
structure,
but it's,
but it's,
but it's a unsymmetrical and open.

156
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.450
Okay.
Now a sn one and he won a,

157
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:29.250
there's an interesting thing about the stereochemistry of sn one reactions.

158
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.330
So you can,

159
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.620
if you substitute the chloride here on this tertiary chloride,

160
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.500
you could imagine,
uh,
uh,
getting either the,
uh,

161
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.260
Ooh group substitute and directly where the chloride was,

162
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.700
or the Oah group on the opposite face from,
of the chlorine.

163
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:50.220
Now what would you expect if it was sn one

164
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.910
what about if the sn one,
so the rate determining step is I and his Asian,

165
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.220
you've got a cat eye in intermediate.

166
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.410
What structure do you expect for a carbon cat?

167
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.440
[inaudible] we talked about this last semester in x h three so it's the same

168
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:11.730
electronic,
same number of electrons is BH three right there?

169
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.990
No electrons in that fourth orbital.
What should that orbital be?

170
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.430
Right?

171
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:23.430
They're there for atomic orbitals on the carbon or bore on and Bh three right?

172
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.960
But you don't,
you only have electrons in three of them,
right?

173
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.080
How should you hybridize it as p two to get the strongest bonds and leave the

174
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:39.270
vacancy in the highest energy?
Orbital,
the p orbital.
So it should be plainer.
Now,

175
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:40.890
if you get a plane or intermediate,

176
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.640
how much attack should be from one side versus how much on the other

177
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.270
should be 50 50 but in fact,
when you do the experiment,
as it says here,

178
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.230
you get 40% and 60% in version,

179
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.390
right?
So 80% of it is Rasul [inaudible].
That's what you expect.

180
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.020
That is 40% of right.
40% of lefthanded,

181
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.220
but the other 20% is excess.
In version,

182
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.990
it should have been 100% if there was a plane or intermediate cad ion.

183
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.840
Can anybody see how you might explain this?

184
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.330
<v 0>How could it be that you indeed for MCAT,</v>

186
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.350
but it's not equally attacked from the two faces?

187
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.880
Mostly it's attacked from the face opposite the chloride ion.

188
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.700
Where does the chloride ion came from?

189
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.990
Why should it be mostly opposite where the chloride came from?

190
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.910
<v 1>Yeah.
Can't hear very well.</v>

191
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:55.460
<v 0>Steric hindrance of what?
What's the electrons on that?
Right?</v>

192
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.560
The chloride,
even though it's broken,

193
00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:02.561
the bond for a certain time is still around blocking access to the side it came

194
00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:05.540
from.
Right.

195
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.990
So the idea to explain that that inversion is that that chloride for a short

196
00:13:11.121 --> 00:13:14.180
time is still there even though it's not bonded.

197
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.400
So it temporary blocks the face that would lead to retention to give the same

198
00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:24.401
stereochemistry coming in where the chloride was and you get more of the water

199
00:13:24.591 --> 00:13:26.390
coming in from the opposite face.

200
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.900
So this shortlived ion pair gives an explanation for the net inversion.

201
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.341
Okay.

202
00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:39.341
So even though people would usually say that sn one gives Rassam Ization in

203
00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:42.380
truth,
that doesn't always do so,

204
00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:45.710
although it depends on the solvent because the more quickly,

205
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.870
the more the solvent can stabilize ions,
the faster it can get the eye.

206
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:54.620
And so apart from one another,
the less of this effect you would have.

207
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.520
So it depends on the polarity of the solvent.
That was acetone and water.

208
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.130
Now when you have,
here's an,

209
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.630
we talked about this elimination reaction that [inaudible] bromide with sodium

210
00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:08.960
hydroxide gives a large amount of the alkene,

211
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.320
but is that process that gives the alkene e one or e two that is,

212
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.470
is the rate determining step formation of the TB cad ion and then the hydroxide

213
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:21.304
attacks tax it,

214
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.680
or is the rate determining step attack of the hydroxide on a hydrogen pulling it

215
00:14:27.441 --> 00:14:31.220
off at the same time that the chloride leaves?
So how could you tell?

216
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.160
How could you tell whether it's e one or e two

217
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.993
<v 1>okay,</v>

218
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.480
<v 0>Luke,
just what about the rate?
That's fine.</v>

219
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.230
See you.
That's what the names mean,
right?
So you could follow the names.

220
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.040
He two means it's by molecular that the rate depends on the concentration of eye

221
00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:58.220
drops side.
If the rate limited step,
we're breaking the bond,

222
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.960
right?
No hydroxide involved there.
So the rate wouldn't depend on that.

223
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.940
So you can look at the overall rate,

224
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.040
not just the percent of alkene because more hydroxide could mean that even

225
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:13.580
though in the rate determining step,
you made the cat eye and the more hydroxide,

226
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:17.750
the more hydrogens you pull off,
right?
Compared to water attacking.

227
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.890
Okay.
So,
uh,
so you see,
if you see the rate,
not just the product to you,

228
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.410
the ratio,
but the rate depends on hydroxide,
then it's easy to,
okay.

229
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:32.210
Another way to see whether the Proton is being pulled away in the rate limiting

230
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:35.410
step is to look for a kinetic isotope effect.

231
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:40.420
Remember that the hydrogen is faster than deuterium by a factor of up to about

232
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:42.710
six or seven.
Usually,
uh,

233
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.620
only when you're breaking the bond and the transition state,

234
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:49.850
if the transition state is forming the ions and later you break the proton away,

235
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.660
then you wouldn't see a hydrogen being faster than deuterium.

236
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.670
Okay.
Now,
this was a question I asked on an exam once,

237
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.200
a given example of the influence of a change in reacted structure on the ratio

238
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:04.080
of sn two,

239
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:09.140
two e two products be a specific and quantitative as you can and uh,

240
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.130
the simplest minded answer to such a thing,
it would be neat to,

241
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.020
to have a more subtle example,
but a really simple one is methyl bromide.

242
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:21.290
How about the amount of sn two and e two in that case?

243
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.300
Anybody venture a guess?

244
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:25.490
<v 1>Okay,</v>

245
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.230
<v 0>this is in fact a trick question,</v>

246
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.190
Kathy.
There can't,
there is no,

247
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.240
they're not two carbons.

248
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:41.480
You can't make an alkene and there's no hydrogen on the adjacent carbon.

249
00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:45.770
So obviously that's going to be all sn two.
That's a,
so that was sort of a trick.

250
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.130
Okay.
But then in this one we see,

251
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.860
we've seen from last time that it's much easier to do it with a high

252
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:56.750
concentration of I dropped side,
it's much easier to do s n two then he too,

253
00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.360
to the extent that our apartments to do e two,
that sn two because the uh,

254
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.580
sn two was so hindered.
If you get substitution,

255
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:09.170
it's sn one and the case,
as we saw last time and looking at the,

256
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.700
at the rates of the various are be ours now.

257
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.100
So these are really drastic ratios.

258
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.450
Now there are two different organic chemical perspectives on situations where

259
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:21.920
you have drastic ratios.

260
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.130
One is the perspective of a synthetic organic chemist who says it's great to

261
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:32.030
have drastic ratios because then you have a reliable way to get a really high

262
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:35.120
yield.
It's not going to be 40,
60,
or something like that.

263
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:37.700
And you'd have to separate it and throw away the stuff you don't want.

264
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.320
You get all the stuff you want.
That's great.
Okay.
But from a physical,

265
00:17:42.321 --> 00:17:45.020
organic cannabis trying to understand mechanism,

266
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.810
if you have a really drastic ratio,

267
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.410
then the at the energy of activation is quite different between the two.

268
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:57.411
And you can get an an often get an unambiguous interpretation of what the cause

269
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:01.950
of the,
of the,
uh,
uh,
what's determining the rate.

270
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.670
If you can get a really big difference,
you have just a small difference.

271
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:06.504
You can't,
uh,

272
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.160
be so confident that it's not just some subtle change in salvation or something.

273
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.670
So for example,
uh,
the uh,

274
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.620
10 to the third stearic retardation of ice,

275
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.770
propyl vice via sn two.

276
00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:23.420
You remember you had substitution that methyl at Ethel and ice appropriately,

277
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.930
they got slower and slower.

278
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.850
Ice Appropriate was a thousand times slower than methyl,
so that you,

279
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.120
that's a pretty big effect,
right?
1,000 times 10 to the third,

280
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.040
that meant it must be a four kilocalories per mole at room temperature

281
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:40.320
difference in those two.
So that's,
that's pretty big.

282
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:42.840
That's not like half a kilo calorie or something like that.

283
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.830
So you get a factor of a thousand or more often you can be confident in

284
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:51.150
interpreting or in the case of,
uh,
of a t butyl,

285
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:53.220
remember it jumped way back up again.

286
00:18:53.221 --> 00:18:57.570
It was accelerated by 10 to the fifth compared to ice of propyl by putting that

287
00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:58.380
next one in,

288
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.350
which showed that there was a new mechanism coming in the formation of the,

289
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.690
of the cat eye and intermediate.
Okay.
Now what if the,

290
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.240
what if the ratio is not drastic?

291
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:14.100
What if the two products that you could get form in about a 50 50 ratio?
Okay.

292
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.030
The synthetic organic chemist says this is deadly,
right?

293
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.230
Because he's doing a lot of reactions in a row to try to get some product.

294
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.390
If each rack reaction has a 50% yield and you do a whole bunch of them in

295
00:19:27.391 --> 00:19:28.950
sequence.
For example,

296
00:19:28.951 --> 00:19:32.910
if you did 12 steps getting a 50% yield at each step,

297
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:38.150
you'd have yield at the end of one half to the 12th power 0.02% right?

298
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.440
So a synthetic chemist once a reaction,
that gives a really,
really high yield.

299
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.780
Okay?
Uh,

300
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.530
although it might be possible to have a reaction that doesn't give such a good

301
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:49.741
yield,

302
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:53.640
but to tinker around with it and get the yield up so that it becomes acceptable

303
00:19:53.641 --> 00:19:56.640
in a sequence like that.
Okay.

304
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.670
But a physical organic chemist finds such find such a situation valuable because

305
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:04.410
it's a borderline.
There's,

306
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.480
there's a delicate balance between going this way and going this way,
right?

307
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.740
And now you can see changing this effect,
changing that,

308
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.140
changing the solvent this way,
making it more polar,
less polar.

309
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.990
Putting a methyl group on,
taking a methyl group off,

310
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.350
you can interpret small,
uh,
effects.

311
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:26.880
So it allows sensitive tests of subtle influences.
For example,

312
00:20:26.881 --> 00:20:30.900
isotope effect.
Remember that the,
that a deuterium isotope effect,

313
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:34.110
we said the maximum is about a factor of seven usually.

314
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.680
So that's not very big in terms of kilocalories per mole,

315
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.700
but if but,
but even though it's not a very big effect,

316
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.560
even though it's a small thing,
you can,

317
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.990
you can interpret it because you know how,
what,

318
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.560
that it must involve breaking hydrogen away in the rate limiting step.

319
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.590
And finally,
in our discussion of a sn two and e two eliminations,

320
00:20:56.591 --> 00:21:00.520
I'm going to give you a valuable lesson that was taught,
was learned.

321
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.030
He taught himself,
uh,
by Joe David Fine,

322
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.060
who is you see here was the class of 1972 in Yale college and was doing a

323
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.410
undergraduate research during the spring of 1971.
So 40 years ago,

324
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:18.070
he began this project and he continued it,
uh,

325
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.070
through the summer when he,
uh,

326
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.190
lived on York street and then it through the fall and the next spring as a,

327
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.450
as a senior.
So this was his research project.
Now,
what was his research project?

328
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.410
There was an interesting question he wanted to ask that required preparing this

329
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:34.930
compound.
And the question was this,

330
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.810
if you have a very viscous solvent,

331
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:43.210
can motion of the pieces be a rate or product determining step?

332
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.260
Usually we think of bond formation or bond breaking being a rate limiting step,

333
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.310
but obviously for two things that to react with one another that they have to

334
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:55.144
get together.

335
00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.600
So that requires motion and if the medium is sufficiently viscous,

336
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.810
it could be that.

337
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.640
And the reaction that follows when they get close together as sufficiently fast.

338
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.350
Then it could be that the rate limiting step would be motion not breaking or

339
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:12.400
making bonds.

340
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.420
So that was the question that Joe David wanted to find the answer to.

341
00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:20.230
It was whether it was possible that motion would be the rate limiting step.

342
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:25.090
Even very shuttle.
Subtle.
Pardon me.
Short range motion.
You can,

343
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.740
it's easy to imagine that long range motion could be rate limiting.
For example,

344
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.090
the in free radical chain reactions,
you have radicals floating around.

345
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.590
Once they find one another,
Bingo,
they're gone.
Right.

346
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:42.880
That's the termination reaction that stops the machines in the free radical

347
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:43.810
chain reactions.

348
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.560
So obviously what's rate limiting is moving them through the solvent,

349
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.040
but that's long range motion.
How about very subtle motion?

350
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.490
Can it also be rate limiting?
Okay,
so he was gonna,

351
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.020
this is what he was going to do.

352
00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.670
He was going to use UV light to knock out a molecule of nitrogen between these

353
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:04.330
two radicals.
So the two radicals are almost next to one another,

354
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.790
but there's a nitrogen molecule in between.

355
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.940
But if those two radicals are going to react with one another,

356
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.700
they have to get the nitrogen out of the way.
Okay.

357
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.170
So how do they get the nitrogen out of way so they could combine?
Well,

358
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.250
in fact these radical studied in solution don't combine.

359
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.150
Why would those radicals not combined easily and even ideas,

360
00:23:25.151 --> 00:23:29.290
radicals usually too.
So most come together form a bond.
Why not?
In this case,

361
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:33.790
Lauren?
Right?

362
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.770
It's a question of steric hindrance.

363
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:39.010
There too many methyl groups to get in the way.
So that's not what happens.

364
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.460
Uh,
so in fact,

365
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:47.461
what happens instead of that is that you rotate that t butyl radical together

366
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:52.280
with the nitrogen,
right?
So it's just a rotation.

367
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.200
You don't have to actually move things by translation.
Just rotate them,
okay.

368
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.660
To get that geometry shown at the right.

369
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.460
And now one radical is close enough to the deuterium on the other that you can

370
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:08.240
get a hydrogen deuterium atom transfer,

371
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.900
which is very exothermic easy and fast,
right?

372
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:17.290
So that would generate then the alkene or the Alkane by deuterium transfer.

373
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.050
Now there's an alternative reaction to these two radicals.

374
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.970
Does anybody see what it is besides doing the Deuterium Adam transfer?

375
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

376
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.420
<v 0>What other action could you imagine,
Debbie?</v>

377
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.950
Okay.
That particular process is called radical pair disproportion nation.

378
00:24:43.951 --> 00:24:48.120
That's another way that radicals could kill one another besides coupling.
Okay?

379
00:24:48.121 --> 00:24:53.040
But the second alternative is to rotate the other group,
right?

380
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:57.510
The one with hydrogens,
which would give the geometry down on the right,

381
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:03.170
and then you would transfer a hydrogen atom and that would be very exothermic,

382
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.620
easy,
fast,
and you would get that now.

383
00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:12.621
So there's a competition then between transferring hydrogen and transferring

384
00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:18.090
deuterium.
But what's the rate?
What's the product determining step?

385
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.710
What determines which one you do?
Well,
if it's the hydrogen transfer,

386
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.550
then we know that there'll be a kinetic isotope effect and you'll transfer

387
00:25:26.551 --> 00:25:29.760
hydrogen more often than deuterium.
Right?

388
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.710
But if it's the motion,

389
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:37.260
then the two rotations should be just about equal.
Okay.

390
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.910
They're not very big effect from deuterium on the rotation.
Okay.

391
00:25:41.911 --> 00:25:46.080
So all you have to do to answer this question of whether this very subtle,

392
00:25:46.081 --> 00:25:50.190
short range motion,
just this rotation is rate limiting,

393
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.750
is to make this compound photo lies it to knock out the nitrogen and see which

394
00:25:54.751 --> 00:25:55.560
products you get,

395
00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.270
whether the deuterium is in the alkane product or the alkene product.

396
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.230
Right?

397
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:05.790
If it's 50 50 that says that there wasn't a kinetic isotope effect,

398
00:26:05.791 --> 00:26:09.270
hydrogen was not being transferred when the product was being determined,

399
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:13.320
the rotation was limiting.
Right?
If there is an isotope effect,

400
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.920
then that means that the,
that the,
that the bond breaking,

401
00:26:16.921 --> 00:26:21.570
not the motion was rate limiting.
Okay,
so that's easy.
That's what it says here.

402
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:28.380
Okay.
So all he had to do then was to prepare this compound.

403
00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.010
Then notice how the compound was pretty carefully devised,

404
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.370
not so you can sell it to your neighbor and make a big profit.

405
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.440
But to answer this particular question,

406
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.910
so this is in the same spirit as the Bartlett and Knox paper where the idea was

407
00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:45.960
to make some molecule that was designed to answer a particular question.

408
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.970
Okay.
Now,
often in when you're planning to make something,

409
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:56.130
you draw a scheme that where the Arrow doesn't show what something goes to

410
00:26:56.131 --> 00:27:00.750
something else.
It shows the backwards.
It's retro synthesis.

411
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:05.130
That is what could you prepare this compound from what we haven't talked about,

412
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:09.120
the reactions that we get from that starting material on the right to this

413
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:13.290
product,
but they,
but by the end of the course,
they'll seem trivial to you.

414
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.470
They're easy reactions that would do that.
Okay?

415
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:20.160
So if you could prepare this compound t butyl hydrazine,

416
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:25.500
then you'd be home free according to to,
uh,
what we apply on.

417
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.040
Okay.
So you need t butyl hydrazine now where are you going to get tea?

418
00:27:29.041 --> 00:27:34.041
Butyl hydrazine so it requires having a tea butyl group connected to nitrogen.

419
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.480
Right.
While you can buy hydrazine that's cheap.
You could buy tea,

420
00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:42.330
beautiful chloride.
That's cheap.
You can buy at that time,

421
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:47.331
40 years ago you could buy a can of it that size for $5 or something like that.

422
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:49.890
Okay,

423
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.390
so all you have to do is do a substitution reaction where the nitrogen displaces

424
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.120
chloride.
Right.
Does that sound like a good synthetic plan?

425
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.120
Kate,
what do you think about doing,
say an sn?

426
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:10.110
Two reaction to have the unshared pair on the nitrogen attack.

427
00:28:10.111 --> 00:28:14.100
The carbon displays chloride seem okay to you or not?
So good.

428
00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.810
<v 1>Pardon me?
Yeah,
you can imagine though,</v>

429
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.970
<v 0>almost lumos any other,
any problems with it?
Hi,
Shar.</v>

430
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.870
Steric hindrance,
right?
What do you have all those methyl groups?

431
00:28:31.871 --> 00:28:34.570
It's hard to get at that carbon and what would happen instead

432
00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.390
if you can't do the substitution elimination.

433
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.850
Okay,
so you're going to have,

434
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.940
he too will be much greater than sn two here and in fact he one is greater than

435
00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:51.610
sn one two.
So you're going to get this,

436
00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.200
not that you're going to have to figure some other way of making tea,

437
00:28:56.201 --> 00:29:00.190
butyl hydrazine.
Well,
fortunately there was in the literature,

438
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:05.430
this paper in the Journal of organic chemistry from 1958 about a preparation of

439
00:29:05.891 --> 00:29:08.710
these hydro that wasn't the title of the paper,

440
00:29:08.711 --> 00:29:13.450
but it to make the stuff in the paper they needed to prepare hydrazine's and

441
00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:16.930
they say in this paper that we explored most of the synthetic methods that have

442
00:29:16.931 --> 00:29:21.931
been used for other Al Keel hydrazine's but most failed altogether or gave only

443
00:29:22.061 --> 00:29:26.860
negligible yields,
right?
When you tried to do it with tea.
Beautiful.
Right?

444
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.630
But there was a seldom used method that had been discovered by Cerner and that

445
00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:34.810
worked well,
edited,
involved,
uh,

446
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.320
hydrolyzing this cc c n double bond.

447
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:43.200
So that reacting with water gave from this half a key tone,

448
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.920
a ketone that I think some of you have seen,
right?
And on the right,

449
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.500
the t butyl hydrazine the compound you want.

450
00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.630
<v 2>Okay,</v>

451
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.090
<v 0>so hydrolysis of the intermediate,
Benzo for known.</v>

452
00:29:55.330 --> 00:30:00.330
So the idea is to break a CND double bond and put water in there to put oxygen

453
00:30:00.521 --> 00:30:05.100
on the carbon,
the h two of water on the nitrogen,
and you have the uh,

454
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.430
amine you want,
it's connected to another nitrogen and then to t butyl,

455
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.250
right?
And it's very common to change.

456
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:16.390
See x double bonds into CEO double bonds and h two ax.

457
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:19.390
And we'll discuss this ad nauseum later on.

458
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.720
Okay.
And notice that this reaction is catalyzed by acid,

459
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.120
right?
The way it happens is you put a proton on this nitrogen,

460
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.430
<v 2>right?
And then,
uh,
that</v>

461
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.910
<v 0>resonance structure has the cat eye and on the carbon and that can add water and</v>

462
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:43.390
get the oxygen on there.
But suppose you protonate the wrong nitrogen.

463
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.880
If you protonate that nitrogen and then shift these electrons in there.

464
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.540
Now you have the t butyl cat ion,
which is going to lose a proton,

465
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.990
give isobutylene and you're lost,
right?

466
00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.490
So it says hot acid caused the elimination of the t butyl group.

467
00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:03.940
So you have to be carried out at room temperature.
You don't want to warm it.

468
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:06.790
Okay?
So fine.
Do it at room temperature.

469
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:09.760
So this is what Joe David set out to do a he,

470
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.840
the synthesis starts with this compound weirdly enough,

471
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.880
and you have to react it with a grin Yar reagent here,
uh,

472
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.530
which puts the butyl group on the nitrogen.

473
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.600
And then you're going to break that bond,

474
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.810
put oxygen on there at age two on there,

475
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:28.930
and you're going to have the product you want.
That's the idea.

476
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.810
That's the synthetic scheme.
So in the first place,

477
00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:35.950
it turns out that t butyl grin ar is not the easiest reagent to make,

478
00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:40.730
especially in the summer when it's humid.
So it was hard,
uh,
for,
for Joe,

479
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.250
David the did that,
but do this.

480
00:31:42.251 --> 00:31:45.940
But finally he got this stuff to add there and got the stuff that needed to be

481
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:47.950
hydrolyzed.
And then he tried to do it.

482
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:53.250
He worked on this from April to October through the whole summer and never got

483
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:58.030
it to work.
Okay.
And finally he got very frustrated.

484
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.540
So he,
he telephoned Peter Asmr Smith,

485
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:05.800
the professor at the University of Michigan who had published that paper in 1958

486
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.390
and asked him what gave,

487
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:12.870
and this is a page from Joe David Finds Notebook from October,

488
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.500
1971 private communication with Dr Pas Smith.
Most importantly,

489
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:21.910
he stressed that is published method will not give the desired product.

490
00:32:21.911 --> 00:32:24.040
Instead the t butyl group is lost.

491
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:29.550
They haven't been able to reproduce lack Chris's results nor to make any more

492
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.223
<v 2>okay.</v>

493
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.400
<v 0>Although he feels that hydrolysis in the desired manner is possible if</v>

494
00:32:37.921 --> 00:32:42.320
hydrolysis is killed very rapidly,
he said to quote,
play around with it,

495
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.650
which of course Joe David had been doing from April to October.
So the,

496
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.660
the next comment is the one I really like in his notebook for the sake of public

497
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:57.560
courtesy and sophistication.
I will reserve my own comments on this subject.

498
00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:02.450
Okay.
Now in preparing for this lecture,
I,

499
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.730
I emailed Joe David Fine,

500
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.510
so there's a happy ending to this rather lack remos story.

501
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.250
He's now a respected professor of dermatology at Vanderbilt and is the world

502
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:18.020
expert on Epidermal Elias Epidermal lysis below asa,

503
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.670
which is a skin disease.

504
00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:24.350
He's a dermatologist after all and his son graduated from Yale in 2000 and here

505
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:24.651
he is,

506
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:29.651
you see wearing his Yale crew tie is very nice guy and he said in a reply email.

507
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.380
He's a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London now as well as a

508
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:38.330
master of public health and an MD.

509
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.030
He said that project and my conversation with that pleasant profit you've

510
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:48.050
Michigan did teach me more about the rigors and foibles of bench research than

511
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:51.890
anything that I subsequently experienced as a postdoc at Nih.

512
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:57.140
It therefore prepared me for many more happily transient foibles during the 19

513
00:33:57.141 --> 00:34:01.760
years that I ran a bench immunology lab at University of Alabama at Birmingham

514
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:03.170
and University of North Carolina.

515
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:07.730
As I found out the hard way trying to predict good behavior with cell lines,

516
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:12.731
antibodies and semi purified proteins was even more subject to random whimsy

517
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.760
than when I was trying to work with relatively straightforward purified

518
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:21.320
chemicals in a far more structured laboratory setting.
As an Undergrad.

519
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.180
So he,
he feels that this was very good training for him.
Uh,

520
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:30.020
but the important lesson was learned by me next,

521
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.280
the next year at a Gordon Conference in the summer up in New Hampshire when I

522
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:36.640
ran my new,
my graduate school friends,

523
00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:39.500
Steven Nelson and professor at the University of Wisconsin,

524
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:44.830
he said that the way to make tea butyl hydrazine is to react this with this.

525
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:54.050
Right now,
it's indeed true that 95% of it is the elimination,

526
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.370
right?
But that product is a gas.

527
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:03.260
So it just goes away.
And the other 5% is the stuff you want.

528
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.810
Furthermore,
it's very easily to easily purified.
You can crystallize it.

529
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.920
So in one day I made 10 grams of it,

530
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.680
right?
This was after Joe David and graduated,
right?

531
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.760
So what's the lesson here?
This,

532
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.310
if you have cheap starting materials,

533
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:31.040
you don't need a high per se,
that the yield you get isn't the big deal.

534
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:35.030
If you've got cheap stuff and you can easily do it and purify the product,

535
00:35:35.031 --> 00:35:39.510
that's the way to make this stuff right.
Okay?

536
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:43.710
So there's a second happy ending that Joe David fine then had a successor the

537
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.830
next year when we actually had the compound,
he was able to make it,

538
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.990
test it and find out that if you have a fluid solvent,
there's an isotope effect.

539
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:56.190
Hydrogen is transferred more than deuterium.
I had him transfer is rate limiting,

540
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.160
but in a very viscous solvent,
at low temperature,

541
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:02.040
the kinetic isotope effect disappeared.
It was 50,

542
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:06.630
50 hydrogen to deuterium transfer because at this demonstrated that motion had

543
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.620
become rate limiting.

544
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:11.520
So it is possible for very subtle motion to be the rate limiting step in a

545
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:14.340
reaction.
So there were two happy endings to this.
Joe.

546
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:19.140
David learned a valuable lesson and uh,
I learned something both from,
uh,

547
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.860
Joe David and from Steve Nelson and from this result.

548
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:29.190
So this is,
this is the stuff that,
that'll be included on Friday on the exam.

549
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:33.410
I'm sorry that it's taken so long to do this and I'm going to give a review of

550
00:36:33.411 --> 00:36:33.991
this evening,

551
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:37.560
but the registrar seems to be having trouble getting into work or something.

552
00:36:37.561 --> 00:36:39.990
I'm not sure.
That's not surprising today.

553
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.760
So we'll have a room in WL h I'm sure,
and I'll email you where it's going to be.

554
00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:47.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

555
00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:52.150
<v 0>Okay.
Now the next,
uh,
topic is going to be backwards.</v>

556
00:36:52.151 --> 00:36:53.110
What we've been doing,

557
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.920
so what we've been doing is ill substitution and elimination.

558
00:36:56.921 --> 00:37:00.510
And the elimination reaction is of course this,
uh,

559
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.220
where the hydrogen and the leaving group go away.

560
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:06.880
Proton and leaving group minus typically,
right?

561
00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.160
So we have a leaving group.

562
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.360
Now what we're going to the next topic because we're going to be electrophilic

563
00:37:13.361 --> 00:37:15.730
cause it's called addition to alkenes.

564
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.240
Now notice that this is the reverse of e one or e two with some of the names

565
00:37:21.461 --> 00:37:24.430
changed.
So where are we have a proton there.

566
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.740
That's a low Lumo of course,

567
00:37:26.741 --> 00:37:30.580
an electro file someplace where electrons could be easily accommodated,

568
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.670
but we can generalize it.
It doesn't have to be a proton,

569
00:37:33.671 --> 00:37:37.870
it can be any electro file.
Just call it e l okay.

570
00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.140
And the thing that was a leaving group,
we're going to change the name of,

571
00:37:41.141 --> 00:37:45.430
it's a high homo,
we're going to call it a nucleophile,
right?

572
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:50.470
And now with those change names,
we're going to reverse the reaction.
All right.

573
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:54.550
And take the AL keen to a substituted alkane.

574
00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.030
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

575
00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:01.610
<v 0>Now there are a number of questions involved with this that both ones involve in</v>

576
00:38:01.611 --> 00:38:05.990
mechanism and one involve ones involved in synthetic practicality.

577
00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.530
One is what can you make that's a,
that's a synthetic question.
What?

578
00:38:11.531 --> 00:38:16.190
What can elect profile a nucleophile B and you'll see that they could be a wide

579
00:38:16.191 --> 00:38:19.730
range of things.
Then there's a mechanistic question,

580
00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:24.731
is this a homo Lumo kind of reaction or does it involve simply occupied or is it

581
00:38:26.331 --> 00:38:30.140
a free radical reaction?
There's the question of timing.

582
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:34.400
Do you make both bonds at once or do you make one bond and then the other and if

583
00:38:34.401 --> 00:38:38.320
so,
which?
There's the question of Stereo Chemistry.

584
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.240
Do the electro file a nucleophile come in on opposite sides of the double bond

585
00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:47.530
or on the same side?
And that's particularly relevant.
Of course,
if they're,

586
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.900
if they happen to be in the same molecule,

587
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.010
then almost certainly they have to come in on the same side.
Right?

588
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.970
But if you,
if you come in stepwise one first,

589
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.940
then the other side can flop around,
right?

590
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:03.100
So you could attack either side of the other one,

591
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.830
even if the two things are coming in from the same side,

592
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.610
you could adapt the opposite face if it was step wise and it rotated.

593
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:11.290
So that's going to be an interesting question.

594
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.440
Whether the product is from sin or Auntie and we all,

595
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.490
we studied that already in elimination,
whether elimination was sent her Auntie,

596
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.540
and then there's the chemistry,
the question of Riggio Chemistry,

597
00:39:22.541 --> 00:39:25.000
or is it sometimes called orientation,

598
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:29.050
whether the reaction follows Markov knockoffs rule.
Now,

599
00:39:29.051 --> 00:39:31.130
more cognitive coughs rule,
uh,

600
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.650
happens when you have an unsymmetrical case,
right?
So,

601
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:38.950
and you're adding Hx,
right?
So,

602
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:44.190
so you can have x go on the carbon that's more substituted and a name that

603
00:39:44.321 --> 00:39:48.820
sometimes has been given to this as the Matthew rule from this,
uh,
uh,

604
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.130
Bible quotation,
Matthew 25,

605
00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:56.131
29 for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance.

606
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.470
So the carbon that already has two methyls gets another x,
right?

607
00:40:02.471 --> 00:40:05.650
And h goes to where the ages were.
Right.

608
00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:10.210
And that that's contemporary economics seems often to work that way that the

609
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:14.050
people that have a lot get a lot.
Right?
So that's one,
that's one role,

610
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:15.640
that's the Markovnikov rule,

611
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
but sometimes it's anti Markovnikov the product puts the hydrogen ware on the

612
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:23.560
carbon that has more things.

613
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:27.190
So all these are questions we're now going to address.

614
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:30.640
Uh,
last year,
uh,

615
00:40:30.641 --> 00:40:35.641
we had a guest lecture from professors equals Siegel from Zurich who talked with

616
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:39.460
a more synthetic perspective to the class.
If you want us read his lecture,

617
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:43.180
you can listen to it and watch the,
see what he wrote on the board,

618
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.440
on the web for last year's website.
But anyhow,
from a synthetic perspective,

619
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:51.220
the idea is you have an alkene and unsymmetrical alkene and you're going to

620
00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:55.810
react it with some ab reagent and put a on one end and be on the other.

621
00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:59.470
And what can a and B B that is,

622
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:01.840
what products can you make from an alkene?

623
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.430
You can imagine putting two H's on an h and an x and h and n,
O,
h,

624
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:11.380
two x's,
x and o,
h,
a,
O,
h,
n,
O,
h.

625
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.070
Or you could imagine,
Oh,
H and h.
Now we already had h and o,

626
00:41:15.071 --> 00:41:19.620
h but this is different.
It's a different orientation like that Markovnikov,

627
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.310
anti Markovnikov and the same here with these.
So in the course of the lecture,

628
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:28.510
he went through and showed a number of reagents and filled in this scheme of

629
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.170
what happens and what kind of stereo chemistry you have and so on.

630
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:37.490
So that's synthetic,
uh,
motivation for studying these things.

631
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:40.730
What compounds can you make from alkenes?
Right?

632
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.670
But we're going to take,
you won't be surprised,

633
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:48.671
a little more physical approach and look first at the thermodynamics stability

634
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.780
of some of the Alkenes,
uh,
uh,
and then,
uh,

635
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.310
at the how they react.

636
00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.740
Now you wonder where you get this information about stability of compounds.

637
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.090
A great place to get it is from this website,
which I have on the,

638
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.630
which I can get on the other computer here.
If you put NIST,

639
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.070
which is the National Institute of Science and technology into Google,

640
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:17.960
you get this.
And the very first thing you see is chemistry web book.

641
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.440
So if you click there,
you get the chemistry web book.

642
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.000
And I think I've got that here too.

643
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:28.450
And then you can search in that web book by different criteria.

644
00:42:28.581 --> 00:42:32.000
And the easy one is formula for our purposes.

645
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.850
And let's suppose we're interested in beauty means.

646
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.460
So we have si pho for h eight,

647
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.500
oops,
not d h eight.
Okay.

648
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.190
And let's,
uh,
let's work in kilocalories,

649
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:51.950
not in the SIU units.
Okay.

650
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:56.660
So let's search and see what we can find.
Okay.

651
00:42:56.661 --> 00:43:01.040
So here's what I just found and it's also on here.
Uh,

652
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:05.150
so I have one beauty to beauty in two flavors,

653
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:10.150
Z and e,
CIS and Trans.
Uh,
then I have,
uh,

654
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.080
uh,
two methyl one propane and I assume are in cycle of butane,

655
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:16.820
also methyl Cyclo,
propane,

656
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.890
and to beauty a generic that is not,

657
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.080
not separated this isomers.

658
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:27.440
So let's just look at one beauty in and see what kind of information is

659
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:32.420
available.
Okay.
So we see there's all kinds of data available here.

660
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.100
Gas Phase,
Thermo Chemistry,
condensed phase,
thermo chemistry phase changes,

661
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.280
uh,
blob reaction,
Thermo Chemistry.

662
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:44.780
That's particularly interesting.
Let's,
but let's first look at a,

663
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:50.060
at a gas phase.
Thermal Chemistry.
Okay,

664
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:55.061
so here we see the heat of formation in the gas phase is almost zero.

665
00:43:55.971 --> 00:44:00.320
It has about the same energy as the elements graphite and hydrogen do,
right?

666
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.930
And if you look at the heat of combustion,
it's this,

667
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.920
and what's particularly valuable is you can see how well it's known,

668
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.790
what the error limits are.
And then it's been,

669
00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.450
these data have been evaluated by here,
als,

670
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.430
which is al Fevi,
uh,
Liebman and Stein.

671
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:24.200
But it also gives where the stuff really came,
where the information came from.

672
00:44:24.201 --> 00:44:29.000
So if you click on that,
you get these,
uh,
the,

673
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.820
that,
that,
that,
those things came from process and Marin and Rossini.

674
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.050
Now this Rossini is not the guy who wrote the barber of Seville.
It's,

675
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:42.100
it's Frederick Rossini who is,
who was a great,
uh,

676
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.680
thermo thermodynamicists who measured lots and lots of these things.

677
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.970
Notice incidentally that also there's a lot of data from the thermodynamic

678
00:44:50.971 --> 00:44:54.990
research center at Texas a and M in Texas.
Now,

679
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:58.160
Rossini started that,
the National Bureau of standards,

680
00:44:58.161 --> 00:45:01.740
which is what's become Nis t when it got renamed,

681
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.160
then he went to Notre Dame and then he went to Rice in Houston.

682
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.990
Now some of you are from Houston.

683
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.710
Why do you think somebody who's particularly interested,

684
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.790
why should somebody who lives in Houston be interested in,

685
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:18.180
in the energies of hydrocarbons?

686
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.170
<v 1>Major bazillion hydrocarbons.
Why</v>

687
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:27.540
Cassie oil,

688
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.340
<v 0>right.
This started in 1942,</v>

689
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:35.110
the American Petroleum Institute started a big project to determine

690
00:45:35.111 --> 00:45:39.340
thermodynamic properties of all the things that could be in,
in petroleum,

691
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.620
right and refined petroleum and so on.

692
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:46.060
So this was done first at the National Bureau of Standards Than,
than to,

693
00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:51.460
than to,
uh,
uh,
Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh as it was then.

694
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.020
And then he went to Rice.

695
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:56.890
So this [inaudible] there's a method in what they're doing here.
Now,

696
00:45:56.891 --> 00:46:01.480
let me back up.
Uh,
okay.
So we've got that.
If we,
uh,

697
00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:07.300
if we go down a little further,
we could look at reaction,

698
00:46:07.301 --> 00:46:11.710
thermo,
chemistry.
Uh,
now,

699
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.660
so this is the heat evolved when you,

700
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.230
uh,
when you,
when you do a reaction.

701
00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:25.231
So notice that here's one beauty in becomes to be routine trans to beauty.

702
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:31.170
And here are different people who measured it either by equilibrium constant or

703
00:46:32.411 --> 00:46:36.160
by a ISO thermal calorimetry.

704
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:39.850
And these are the values that they deserve.
They obtained.

705
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:44.320
And you can see they're pretty similar to one another that the,
that,

706
00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.180
that the tube you teen sis,

707
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:51.940
the Trans to beauty is more stable than one beauty by about three kilocalories

708
00:46:51.941 --> 00:46:56.320
per mole.
Okay.
Uh,
now if we,

709
00:46:56.321 --> 00:46:59.410
if you can go down in this,
let's see if I got it

710
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.690
to other reactions.

711
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

712
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.270
<v 0>Uh,
these are different reactions.
There's adding Hbr to one beauty.</v>

713
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:15.790
Uh,
the one I'm looking for.
Here's,
here's going to,

714
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:20.350
here's go into the,
to the sis to beauty,
right?

715
00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:24.040
Uh,
oh,
that's the first one I had.

716
00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:28.540
So cis and Trans and you see it's a different energy involved in going to CIS

717
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:33.190
and trans.
But the one I really looking for is a little further down

718
00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:39.350
<v 2>here in the middle here is adding hydrogen to get butane.</v>

719
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.253
Right?

720
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:44.890
<v 0>So here are the here are</v>

721
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.660
<v 2>for that.
Uh,
for that reaction.</v>

722
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.970
<v 0>Wait,
I'm,
I'm out of sync with what's over here.
This is,
this is a number of,</v>

723
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.980
this is adding to the,
to give.

724
00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.990
This is changing one beauty to assist to be a teen and here all these uh,

725
00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.700
values for that.

726
00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.980
And the next one over here on the web is the one I've just talking about,

727
00:48:07.981 --> 00:48:09.690
30 kilocalories for that.

728
00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.830
But you can also do it and I'm not going to do it over there for the sake of

729
00:48:13.831 --> 00:48:18.570
time,
you can see how much energy is given off and adding hydrogen to,

730
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.460
to assist,
to beauty and how much to trans to buting.

731
00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.330
Now these differences in energy that you get here,

732
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:32.420
<v 2>uh,
uh,
wait here,
now</v>

733
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:36.610
<v 0>all give the same product.</v>

734
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:42.510
Now there's a big advantage to doing a reaction that's not very endothermic or

735
00:48:42.851 --> 00:48:47.320
exothermic.
It's not like combustion,
which is 600 calories per mole,

736
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:48.663
right?

737
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:53.730
To take one thing to another that involves rather small amount of energy like

738
00:48:54.011 --> 00:48:59.011
this adding hydrogen to the alkene and to take three different isomers and

739
00:48:59.201 --> 00:49:00.850
convert them to the same thing.

740
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:05.020
You see what the advance why that's a nice experiment to do.

741
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.460
<v 2>Yes,
pardon?
Well,
you could make</v>

742
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:15.320
<v 0>more,
but not many people want to make butane,
right?</v>

743
00:49:15.321 --> 00:49:19.160
You get that for free or from the petroleum to begin with.

744
00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:23.630
It's for purposes of measurement that it's important,
right?

745
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:28.700
Because if you're measuring a small amount of energy and make a 2% error,

746
00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:34.250
it's not very much.
If you're measuring 600 calories and make a 2% error,

747
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:38.360
that's 12 kilocalories,
right?
But you can,

748
00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:43.490
but here you see these errors are a part in 200,
right?

749
00:49:43.491 --> 00:49:47.020
Apart in 300 part in 300.
So,

750
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.260
so now you know all these compounds relative to the same compound to very high

751
00:49:54.681 --> 00:49:58.610
precision,
which means you know them relative to one another,

752
00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:04.370
right?
So that's the way to really,
uh,
get the data properly.

753
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:08.360
Uh,
so here's a table from a,
from a textbook,

754
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:11.060
I think it's the Jones textbook which gives these things.

755
00:50:11.061 --> 00:50:14.330
But you've seen now where it really comes from,
from this,
uh,

756
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.660
from this NIST web book.
And what,
uh,

757
00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.330
here are data I collected for the,

758
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:23.150
from the NIST web books for the heck scenes.

759
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.120
And you'll notice that a whole bunch of them were done by professor.

760
00:50:26.121 --> 00:50:28.760
Why Barry in the eighties and nineties,
nineties.

761
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.980
The guy who talked to you last year,

762
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:35.660
and this is a problem to do after the exam.
So it could be due next Wednesday,

763
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:37.430
say something like that a week from today.

764
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.130
But to try to look at these numbers here,

765
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:42.650
the relative stability of the heck scenes

766
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.030
and see whether it's consistent with what you,

767
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.230
what you find for the beauty means in terms of the relative energies that is,

768
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:56.231
are there regularities of the energy between CIS and Trans Double Bond of the

769
00:50:56.721 --> 00:51:00.950
difference between a double bond at the end of the chain and a double bond in

770
00:51:00.951 --> 00:51:03.890
the middle of the chain.
Can we make generality that way?

771
00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:06.290
So that's a fun project to look at.

772
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:10.490
But the first thing to do is to get to the exam on Friday.

773
00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:13.910
So I'll talk to you this evening about that.
That's it.
