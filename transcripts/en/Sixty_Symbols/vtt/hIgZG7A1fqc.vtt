00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
I guess the first thing to say is they're
a consequence of general relativity that

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.920
when you get as far as writing down the
equations of general relativity and start

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.690
trying to solve them you find that some
of the solutions involve these wave solutions.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.369
They're distortions of the spacetime that propagate out.
-I mean they're important

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.780
for lots of reasons they're important
because they are a prediction of general

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.841
relativity so actually if you then
detect them you've found further

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.999
confirmation that general relativity is actually right.
-Whenever matter

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.109
passes by through some region of spacetime it will distort the spacetime just like

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.730
you would distort water when if you
put your fingers through water and waves

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.649
propagate out this is a propagation of the
spacetime itself, so the spacetime is

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.390
is sort of moving in and out,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.720
propagating out at the speed of light.
-But also because in principle at least

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.580
they open up an entire new window on the
universe, everything, almost everything we've done

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.640
in astronomy, barring a few cosmic rays
and neutrinos, has been mediated through

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.890
light - we've used light to figure out
what's going on in the universe. Having

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.489
an entirely new way of detecting what's
going on out there in the universe is a

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.132
very exciting thing for astronomers
because it - it opens up all sorts of new avenues for

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.360
us to pursue on research.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.400
As the Earth goes around the Sun then the spacetime is distorting around the Earth

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.160
and that's propagating out in waves in all directions.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.720
[Brady off Camera] Do those waves have nothing to do with for example why the moon is attracted to the Earth?

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.930
[Prof. Copefield] No - no they're different gravit- that- that's a different aspect, sometimes

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.980
we call them gravitational waves, but
they're different here these are the-

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.560
the tides don't exist because of the
nature of gravitational waves propagating.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.300
You've got the Earth going around the Sun and then you've got the Moon going around the Earth.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.780
These are very massive objects, right, and
so there's a net attraction just due to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.109
the pure mass of these objects and
that's where the tides come from the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.441
large mass of the Moon and the even
larger mass of the Earth and as they go

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.009
around the water that's on the Earth
gets distorted by the changing

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.520
gravitational field due to the huge mass
of the Moon and the Earth.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.560
But on top of that there's like a
secondary effect going as the Moon

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.940
is going around it's causing ripples in
the spacetime and it's those ripples -

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.440
these are minuscule ripples that are
propagating out - and it's those that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.060
recently were detected not from the Moon
but from two massive, supermassive

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.160
- well not supermassive -

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.760
two massive black holes that
were orbiting each other and so they

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.840
distorted the spacetime enough that
these waves that propagated out -

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.620
they could be detected here on Earth.
-I said space is expanding and contracting,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.500
but the amount that space is expanding
and contracting by is absolutely

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.920
minuscule. So this big result that came up
with this thing that they detected - the amount

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.320
by which space was expanding over the
many kilometers of their detector was

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.030
less than the diameter of the nucleus of
an atom. So it's an absolutely tiny - infact

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.250
that's why we don't - sort of notice them going past 'cause if they were big effects, you know you'd see

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.500
kind of space doing all sorts of weird things. But because they're so tiny we just don't see them.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.660
It's just amazing, I mean
the numbers involved, the timing involved -

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:15.360
it's a spectacular event so - a billion light years
away - four hundred and fifty megaparsecs away -

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.260
So a billion years ago, two black holes which
were each of them thirty times the mass

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.820
of the Sun, okay? Which is unusual apparently in its
own right to get this kind of

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.380
combination. They were orbiting, they'd
been orbiting each other

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.260
for probably millions of years anyway.
-They have to be bound together because they

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.620
were in orbit around one another and
it's actually quite complicated because -

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.709
so the way you get massive black holes is
you have some very massive star

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.121
exploding in a supernova, and unless that
supernova is set up very carefully, if

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.259
you imagine you had a pair of binary
stars in orbit around one another -

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.461
one of them goes supernova - if
you're not very careful that's gonna

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.870
unbind the system because you've lost a
whole load of mass, there's all sorts of energy

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.440
being transferred between one and the
other - so somehow the two manage to stay

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.360
bound together, it would seem.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.680
When first one went supernova and then a bit later
the other one went supernova -

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.540
I say a bit later, you know -

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.760
probably tens to hundreds of thousands
of years later the other one went supernova.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.080
Alternatively, possibly, if both of these stars were in a
cluster they might actually have

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.269
individually been separate stars and
at some point in the subsequent

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.420
evolution they might have actually got
sufficiently close together that they'd end up

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.120
capturing each other and end up in a binary
system that way. So it is a little bit of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.750
a mystery how you make these two
massive black holes - fairly massive,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.820
not supermassive black holes - in orbit around
one another in the first place, but there are

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.500
at least kind of plausible mechanisms for doing it.
-So they're doing this for millions

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.990
and millions of years and then in the
final - I think it's .2 of a second -

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.040
first they're coming closer and closer
together. They start going so rapidly

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.190
around one another that it begins to
approach the speed of light in fact

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.290
something like sixty percent of the
speed of light.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.140
These are 30 solar mass black holes. As they're
coming closer and closer, when they're

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.210
about, I think, 350 kilometers apart they basically
start merging together.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.300
Amazingly, from just looking at the kind
of signal they detect they can learn a

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.410
great deal about the kind of black holes
it actually was, how the amplitude

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.270
changes over time, how the frequency of
the signal changes over time. So in

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.300
this case they're fairly confident that
one of them was a 29 solar mass black hole

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.280
and the other one was a 36 solar mass
black hole -

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.280
they got sort of errors of 1 or 2 
solar masses on each one -

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.360
but they were both 30 to 40
solar mass black holes. So those are the

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.710
kind of black holes which are probably
the end states of very massive stars,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.370
although they are actually on the high
side even for very massive stars.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.770
Remember we've talked about this intricate
link between the matter and the

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.960
spacetime. Just imagine - try to imagine - these two huge objects.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.280
What they're doing to the matter, to the spacetime around it, as they- and the

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.040
spacetime must be going 'oh my god
what's happening here' and it's flipping

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.580
up and down, up and down and they're just
generating - these waves are beginning to

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.680
propagate out. 350 kilometers, we should find a distance, what, to London? Then you got two

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.710
30 solar mass black holes sort of orbiting one
another in this region and so they're

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.409
going at close to the speed of light.
So the the spacetime in which it's

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.729
revolving must be going - is having huge distortions
associated with it.

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.069
And so it begins to send out
gravitational waves - they've been happening

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.900
all the time but at a much lower
amplitude because they've not been

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.840
feeling this effect, like this. And then these two black holes keep coming in together and they merge.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.060
And what happens is when you've got two black holes they'll merge into a bigger black hole.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.940
So one of them is 29 solar masses,
the other one is 36 solar masses.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.379
If you add those two together you get 65 solar
masses, so you would think by merging

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.539
these two together you make a 65 solar mass
black hole. Turns out they can also tell

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.999
you what the mass of the black hole ended up
with was. Again, just by looking at the

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.200
kind of signal, and it's not 65 solar masses, it's about 62 solar masses.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.639
And the reason why is because three solar
masses has disappeared, and via Einstein's

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.069
famous formula E=mc^2
those three solar masses of energy

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.509
have all been turned into the energy of
the gravitational waves. So three solar masses

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.770
by E=mc^2 has been turned
into a huge amount of energy liberated

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.129
in this gravitational wave explosion. And in
fact if you work out what the luminosity

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:20.060
of the thing was, how bright it was in
gravitational waves, in that fraction of a

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.129
second as all this happened, it was
brighter, it was liberating more energy,

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:28.769
more power than all the stars in the entire observable
universe -

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:31.769
for that fraction of a second - all in gravitational waves.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.340
But there was no light?
-There may well have been some light as well, but that

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.010
was just what was coming out in
gravitational waves, mostly the energy

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.160
of this merger was coming out in these sudden bursts of gravitational waves.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.610
They're traveling now,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.659
they've got a billion years, they're traveling in all
directions - they propagate, and then it - as it

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:54.129
happens, there's a detector - two detectors
in America, been recently updated, and

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:57.220
they've just been turned on - they were doing
I think they call it the engineering run - they

00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:59.889
haven't even started doing the proper
science run.

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:05.159
They'd been turned on for a few weeks, and a few
billion years later these waves are

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:08.919
coming through - now they've lost a lot of
their energy, right? Just as light loses

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:14.719
its energy and becomes dimmer
and dimmer. The huge amplitude associated

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:18.509
with the waves early on is now dimmed down, down, down, down. They pass through

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:23.979
this detector, and the detector consists
of two arms - four kilometer long arms.

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:27.159
An interferometer, classic interferometer
has two arms to it and you basically

00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:32.250
shine a light down each arm - usually a laser 'cause you want it to be nice coherent light - and

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.630
in essence you shine the light backwards and forwards along each of these arms - by recombining the light you

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.829
can essentially tune the thing so
that the two arms are exactly the same

00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:45.829
length as each other. And if you set up
your interferometer right, then the light

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:49.069
that's gone down this arm, and the light
that goes down this arm exactly cancel

00:08:49.069 --> 00:08:53.310
each other out so you end up with no
signal at all. And so that's a thing called

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.899
a nulling interferometer it's set to - you get zero
signal when the two arms are actually

00:08:56.899 --> 00:09:01.279
tuned in that way. Now, of course, when one
of these waves goes past, in one

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.440
direction it actually causes a contraction and in
the other direction it actually causes an expansion.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.620
"This back and forth stretching
and squeezing happens over and over

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.620
until the wave has passed."

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.520
As the wave
goes past, by this tiny, tiny amount

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:18.029
the arms will no longer be exactly the
same length - and the effect of that is

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:21.779
then that exact cancellation ceases to
work, and suddenly some of the light gets

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.870
through your interferometer. So the way they
actually detect it is that they actually

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.240
start seeing light in the interferometer
because the arms have changed in length by

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.949
that tiny amount.
-This huge amount of energy required

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:40.839
this desperately accurate detector in order
to be able to find the gravitational

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.820
waves. And then you might ask: "How do you
know you've found gravitational waves,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.480
surely everything distorts?"

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.960
[Brady off Camera] Seems like an
instrument that a mosquito sneezing would effect them.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.600
[Proffessor] And they get huge numbers of
false positive detections, so any kind of

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:02.149
earth tremor, a truck driving by, all those kinds
of things produce signals that they end up

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:06.930
detecting in these interferometers. There's
two things that save them: one is that

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.259
actually it has - the things that you're
looking for - so things like these black

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:14.160
hole signatures - have a very
characteristic shape to them that the

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.300
way that the oscillations increase and
decrease in amplitude with time - has this very

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.740
classic signature to it that tells you
the kind of thing you're looking for -

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.240
so they know what sort of thing to look for,
and then the second thing that saved them

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.560
is that there isn't just one
interferometer, there's two working at the

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.280
same time a large distance apart from
one another -

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.980
and so the chances of the same
pathological truck going past both of them

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.340
at the same time producing
something that looks exactly like a

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.720
black hole merger signature is at that point astronomically small -

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.080
so they can,
by doing this kind of coincidence

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:46.170
thing of detecting it in both detectors
almost simultaneously - tells them that

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.540
actually they have detected a real
astrophysical result. One of the upsides

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.200
to actually having two detectors; if the
gravitational wave is coming from over

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.560
here somewhere - it'll hit one detector
first and then a bit later it'll hit the other detector

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.100
So the wave came through, hit
Louisiana first, and then the

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.660
light travel time - because they're going
at the speed of light - it then passed

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.790
through the Washington detector - exactly
the same profile -

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.720
7 milliseconds later which corresponds
to the light travel time - and that

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.480
enabled them to sort of give an estimate of
where in the sky this original thing had started from.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.760
So for example this
thing that they've detected, they know it's

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:26.399
somewhere in the southern hemisphere.
They can't say much more than that,

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:29.660
it's somewhere in the southern sky, is about
as close as they can get - but they do

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.930
at least get some directional information.
When they start getting third and fourth

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.069
detectors up obviously that will give them more
information, so they'll actually be able to

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:39.751
triangulate much more exactly where these sources are.
-Potentially an issue

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.579
for the gravitational wave
community: it could be that we're on the

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.600
verge of being inundated now with

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.300
black hole by neutron star.. black hole binaries..

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.440
So all of a sudden they're everywhere
and we just hadn't had the sensitivity

00:11:58.449 --> 00:12:02.569
to detect them and now *poof*. No one really
knows how many there are out there

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:06.491
because all that we have to
work on are theories where you estimate

00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:08.491
how many you expect there to be -

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.620
so that, I was reading that, you know, they're expecting an order of 40 per year, but

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.639
hey, we may have got that wrong, it may be
four thousand or something, in which case you have a

00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:21.680
bit of a different issue - you have like an LHC issue, where you've got so many

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.149
collisions. How are you gonna extract out
the interesting physics here, you know,

00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:29.839
where's the Higgs coming from - here you
might just have so much radiation coming -

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:34.569
gravitational waves coming in from all of
these binary systems that we think we

00:12:34.569 --> 00:12:37.520
understand the binary systems and we're
now interested in finding the

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.700
the weird and wonderful early universe features.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.699
That might be a - Well that'll be a nice problem to have, I think.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:51.700
You've got two very massive objects and they're in orbit around each other in a binary black hole system

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.960
when something is moving around in a circular orbit it's actually accelerating

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.540
So they weren't looking. They were in their shut down mode when this gravitational wave

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:05.240
when this gravitational wave passed through it. Travels for a billion years, those detectors were up and running

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.520
maybe a few months earlier, but they had just shut down and it passed through.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.120
