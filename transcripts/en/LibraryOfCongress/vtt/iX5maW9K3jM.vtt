Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.680
[ Applause ]

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.980
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Good evening.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.790
It's really an honor to be
here for the closing event

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.780
of the National Book Festival
with Sir Salman Rushdie.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.510
So, can we just give a round of
applause for him before we begin.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.170
[ Applause ]

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.610
Please, you should come up now
and you can take a seat before--

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.910
Feel free to come up
and take a seat.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.740
Do you want to take a seat now?

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.040
OK.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.650
[ Laughter ]

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.410
I'm going to make a
brief introduction

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.600
and then I'll look forward
to speaking with you.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.500
But the [inaudible] against
Salman Rushdie, one's threatened

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.310
to silence, one of our
generations most original,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.770
prolific and essential voices.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.470
Today, almost two decades
after those dark years,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.100
Mr. Rushdie has not
only not been silenced,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.670
he has published six more novels,
a dazzling collection of essays,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.400
literary anthologies,
and a screenplay.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.390 position:56%
His latest novel is "Two Years Eight
Months and Twenty-Eight Nights"

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.480
and it-- which by the way
is a thousand and one nights

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.780
which he'll explain to us.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.300 position:56%
And Salman Rushdie was born in 1947,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.890
weeks before the partition
of India and Pakistan.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.190
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Forty-seven.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Forty-seven, yeah.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.990
In the great cosmopolitan
city of Bombay.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.400
He studied History at
Cambridge University

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.000
and worked in advertising.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.040
He published his first
novel, "Grimus" in 1975

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.530
but it was his second novel,
"Midnight's Children",

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.520
that made him an international
literary sensation.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.570
With the Booker Prize,
he was crowned the voice

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.960
of a new post-colonial generation,
a writer capturing the journey

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.890
of migration, globalization,
and cultural transformation.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.850
I was born in the country where Mr.
Rushdie's novels were explicitly

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.040
forbidden and even mentioning
his name considered an act

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.710
of transgression.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.930
Fortunately, my parents moved.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.750
It was my privilege to be
assigned "Midnight's Children"

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.070
as a college student in
the University of Virginia.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.500
The novel changed my life,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.430
everything about how I understood
South Asia and my place within it.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.740
Most importantly, it introduced
me to Mr. Rushdie as a writer,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.070
not a symbol or political
football but as a creative,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.710
extremely funny, and
brilliant artist.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.270
His latest novel takes his level of
imagination and epic storytelling

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.280
to new heights and
it's really my honor

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.510
to welcome Mr. Salman Rushdie
back to Washington, DC.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:24.570
[ Applause ]

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.370
So, I want to begin by asking you
your last book before this was a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.120
book, many people would ask
you to write for many years,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.900
your memoirs of what
happened in those years,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.450
was it fun to return to fiction?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.040
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah,
it was a great relief.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.060
You know, I never became a
writer to write about myself.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.490
When I started if you would said

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.520
to me would I ever
write an autobiography,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.700
I would have said absolutely not.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.510
And then I acquired
an interesting life.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.240
[ Laughter ]

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.890
You know, most writers' lives
involved sitting in rooms

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.490
for long periods of time.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.550
Anyway, I'd-- so I knew I was at
some point have to tell that story.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.300
But once it was done, I
think two things happen.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.960
One is that I had a real desire
to be as fictionally fictional

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.900
as possible after several
years of trying

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.710
to be completely nonfictional.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.500
And the other is I think
that somehow the consequence

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.490
of writing the memoir was as
if I had put down a button

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.610
and I felt sort of lighter.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.870
And I think this book,
in a way, shows that.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.060
I think it has a kind of lightness
in it which I think has been part

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.990
of the consequence of having got
the autobiography off my chest.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.320
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And so, if
I can say, I mean this is a--

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.310
almost an IMAX 3D spectacle of
a set in New York City of a kind

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.110
of Marvel Comic style
war of the worlds.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.940
It's sort of how it reads
when you first started.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.840
There's a lot of amazing
things happening in this book.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.260
It's ultimate fantasy.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.090
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: I hope movie
studios are listening to you.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.160
[ Laughter ]

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.260
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: But what
can you tell us about the--

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.360
your version of "One
Thousand and One Nights"?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.660
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie:
Well, the "One Thousand

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.120
and One Nights" was just a
way of thinking about it.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.430
So, it doesn't really have any
narrative connection with the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.730
"One Thousand and One Nights".

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.320
It's just that kind of story.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.190
I mean one of the things
I thought about all these

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.980
so called Wonder Tales in the East,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.750
which is not just the
"Arabian Nights".

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.760
In India there're so
many other collections.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.830
There's wonderful collection of
animal fables, the "Panchatantra".

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.200
And actually from Kashmir which is
where my family is originally from,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.690
there's a very large story
compendium originally

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.310
in Sanskrit written by Somadeva
called the "Ocean of the Streams

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.870
of Story", Kathasaritsagara,
which is actually longer

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.390
than the "Arabian Nights".

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.880
So, there are many of these things
around and they were, in many ways,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.380
some of the first stories I
heard and the first things I--

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.430
first literature that I fell in
love with and originally heard them

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.750
as children's bedtime stories.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.200
And when I grew up to
read the actual books,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.080
it immediately struck me that these
books are not written for children,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.760
you know, that the language in
them is very complex and the ideas

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.360
in them are very complex and
they're clearly adult fiction.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.070
And that interested
me in a different way.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.500
And so, after finishing the memoir,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.400
I thought in a way I found
myself circling back to that kind

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.710 position:56%
of origin point of the place where
my interest in literature had began.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.010
And I thought what can I do?

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.440
Is there some way that I can
use that kind of storytelling

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.340
but to tell a contemporary story,
you know, not to do something set

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.040
in the Baghdad, the Harun
al-Rashid or something,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.230
but something set in
New York City now.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.610
And I also wanted to
do another thing,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.870
which is that I'm also
very interested in the kind

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.040
of Western surrealist tradition.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.070
You know, and there
are so many writers

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.950
and so many different
languages who have all written

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.560
in a kind of non-naturalistic way.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.240 position:56%
I mean, you know, you could say that
Kafka is a magic realist, you know?

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.710
And in Russia, Gogol and
Bulgakov and then, of course,

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.750 position:56%
there's French surrealist and so on.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.180
And I've always been
very interested in that.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.250
So I thought what would happen
if I allow this Eastern tradition

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.980
of the fantastic to collide with a
Western tradition of the fantastic?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.930
And, you know, what
would that look like?

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.050 position:56%
And I guess the answer is this book.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.940
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And the results
are genies invading New York City?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.240
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah,
that's the high concept.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.740
You know, in Hollywood-- in
Hollywood you have to be able

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.970
to say it in 10 words or
less, that's high concept.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.270
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: OK.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.570
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: So,
high concept of this is,

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.010
yeah, genies take Manhattan.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.680
[ Laughter ]

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.980
Three words.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.720
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: But, you know,
you said something interesting

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.740
about while it's not obviously
your version of "Arabian nights",

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.040
it does have in common

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.730
that storytellers are often
central characters in your books.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.550
And then this one specially, it's
not just the story of the book

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.330
but there are many, many layers
of stories within that story.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.090
And you said that you feel in
the Western tradition, literature

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.540
and storytelling became
separated at some point.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.030
Can you just talk about that idea?

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.330
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well, there's--

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.630
there was a thing that
happened in the--

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.220
I guess, and this is
very simplifying it.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.520
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.820
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: But there
was a thing that happened

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.080
around 100 years ago in
the Modernist Movement

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.590
where people became so interested
in form and language and, you know,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:51.220
doing new things with those that
the narrative aspect became less

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.520
significant, you know?

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.460
And, I mean, one of
the books I admired

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.600
above almost all other
books is Joyce's "Ulysses".

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.020
And Joyce's "Ulysses"
is crowded with stories.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.110
I mean, there's-- it's
got stories on every page,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.920
but the actual narrative
of the book, I mean,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.280
almost nothing happens, you know?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.170
Jewish advertising salesman
walks around Dublin for that day,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:25.230
getting a little drunk, you know,
lusting after girls on the beach,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.850
ends up in the red light
district where he runs

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:35.930 position:56%
into a young writer who's also drunk
and takes him home for a drink,

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.460
and in the meanwhile his wife
has been unfaithful to him.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.760
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.060
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: The end.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.360
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: The genie is.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.660
[ Laughter ]

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.960
.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.260
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.560
And now, that's what you call a
big narrative engine, you know?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.860
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.160
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie:
And yet, you know,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.340
his way of telling the story is
so extraordinary that it becomes,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.290
you know, one of the
greatest novels I've written.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.170
But I've always thought my
way of thinking about it is

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.480
that if you're going
to build a big car,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.150
you should put a big
engine in it, you know?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.570
And story is the engine.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.750
And I've always thought that
there are a lot of books

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.470
which are underpowered because they
don't have that narrative drive.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.480
But in the-- You know, in the
18th century, the 19th century,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.160 position:56%
in those great moments of the novel,
the great writers never forgot

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.930
to tell stories, you know?

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.680
I mean, Dickens is crowded with
stories and so as Thackeray.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.570
So, you know, all of those writers.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.150
So, I'm very interested in--

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.140
I see there's no reason
at all why storytelling

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.940
and literature should be separated
from each other, and I think one

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.390
of the things I've tried to do is
to, you know, is to use stories

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.550
of various-- as the driving force.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.410
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And beyond the
fantastical component, though,

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.520
in this book, there is a deep
philosophical war also playing

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.780
out among two figures in the book
who kind of actually the characters

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.110 position:56%
that we meet subsequently are almost
"Midnight's Children" like figures

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.440
who descend from these
two original figures,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.540
which are actually historical
figures from the Islamic history.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.630
Two philosophers with
dueling visions

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.190
of how to deal with the world.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.670
Can you talk about
those two figures?

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.970
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.270
I mean, they would--
they were supposed

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:23.480
to be really minor characters and
they've kind of got out of control,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.470
and insisted on being
more important.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.710
And originally, there was--
the book has this prologue

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:38.440
in the 12th century, in
Arab-controlled Spain, Andalucia.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:44.260
And I thought in this prologue,
two things would happen.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.210 position:56%
One is that one of the philosophers,
the philosopher known in the West

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:55.330
as Averroes, his real name was In
Rushd from which my name derives,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:01.190 position:56%
that he would have this fall in love
with this girl who he didn't realize

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.890
but she's actually a supernatural
being, she's a jinn princess.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.190
And they have children.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:15.140 position:56%
A lot of children, sometimes 19 at a
time, and yet he's so self-absorbed

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.370
that he doesn't realize that
she might be something a little

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.120
out of the ordinary.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.680
So, that's one thing and the--
those children and the descendants

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.080
of those children in our century
become the main characters

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.380
of the novel.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.860
And the other thing that
was going to happen is

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.240
that he would have this argument
with this other philosopher.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.070
And Ibn Rushd was very--

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.970
in his time, a very
progressive-minded philosopher

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.640
who was the greatest-- perhaps
the greatest ever commentator

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.340
on the works of Aristotle
and was a great deliverer

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:58.310
in Aristotelian virtues of reason
and logic and scientific method.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.640
And what he wanted to do was

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:05.140
to incorporate those things
into Islamic philosophy.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.160
And against him was the
figure of Al-Ghazali

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.950
who was a much more
conservative thinker, you know?

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.560
And that argument in a
way is still going on.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.570
And I think that's why
they ended up not shutting

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.510
up when they died in my book.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:28.710
Unusual for people to go on
arguing 900 years after they die

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.450
but that's sort of what happened.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.570
Because I began-- Once I had that
argument going on in the book,

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.340
in this prologue, I thought-- A,
I thought they were too much fun

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.600
to dump and I thought I was
kind of enjoying them too much.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.090
And B, I thought in a way, this
argument is still continuing.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.370
And so, I wanted to think-- then
I thought but how do I allow them

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.620
to go on having the
argument when they're dead?

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.540 position:56%
And the answer is, of course,
fiction lets you do a lot of things.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.100
And, you know, ghosts
can have arguments too.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.180
And so, they become this
sort of motif that crops up--

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.830
I mean, they're still
secondary characters

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.660
but they now crop up a few times.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.830
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And the war
of the worlds as described

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.980
in the book is a war
between the age of--

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.250
between reason and unreason
as you described it.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.550
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.910 position:56%
Well, what the book suggests is that
the book begins or the modern part

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:22.500
of the book begins
with a huge storm,

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.650
a kind of super Hurricane Sandy.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:30.250
And this storm, it
suggests it's so powerful

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.210
that it breaks open the seals which
separate our world form the world

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.120
of these supernatural
beings, the jinn.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.450
And the jinn pour through
the cracks.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:46.840
And some of them are really very
bad and wanted to take over.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.140
And they're very powerful.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.520
One of them-- They also
can become very large.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.930
One of them eats the Staten
Island Ferry at one point.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.280
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: I really like,
by the way, you did a TV interview

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.570
where you were riding the Staten
Island Ferry describing what it

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.160
would feel like to be eaten on it.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.460
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.760
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.760
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah, I
mean, actually with Jeff for PBS

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.770
who I saw today, we were
reminiscing about how we failed

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.310
to be eaten off the
Staten Island Ferry.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.720
But anyway, so the dark jinn,
you know, invade the world.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.490 position:56%
And they have enormous power so they
can take over the control of minds

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.520
of many people and so on.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.810 position:56%
And then Dunia who is the good jinn,
the princess with whom Ibn Rushd

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.010
that had all these children, kind
of returns to the world to try

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.080
and save the world, to
try and save her children.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.380
And so there's this war.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.690
And one of the things that
is really quite strange,

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.590
is that when I started writing
this book, which is now--

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.270
I mean, it's close to five years
ago that I'd started writing it

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:52.510
and nobody had ever heard of
ISIS, you know what I mean?

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.220
That time, Isis was the
name of an Egyptian goddess.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.490
And that was all.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:04.940
And so, when I started describing
this war taking place in, you know,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:10.490
in what the novel calls Mesopotamia
but we what we know better as Iraq,

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.910
there was no such war taking place.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.960
And then just as I was getting
to the end of the novel,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.090
you know, it started happening.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.690
And that was alarming.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.360
I would like my books
to stop coming through.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.170
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: I mean, but given
the memoir that you just written

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.780
and the fact that we-- you know,
you've had a history with religion.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:39.500
And have you found that
exploring it in fiction presents--

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.870
or did you mean to explore sort of
a debate internally within religion

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.890
and forces of secularism or--

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.470
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: I mean, yeah,
it's one of the things that happens

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:52.280
in the book, but I think there's
something sort of under that.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.400
And the book has-- there's
a frontispiece to the book,

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:03.680
this famous etching of Goya's
which is known as the sleep

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.380
of reason brings forth monsters.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:12.580
But what is interesting is in
his commentary, on that picture,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.610
he said something more complicated.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.590
When you look at the picture, you
think what you are being told is

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.310
that reason is good and
unreason is bad, you know?

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.580 position:56%
But in his commentary, he said
something more nuanced, if you like.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:31.830
He says that when reason and
fantasy come together, then--

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.610
I mean, to paraphrase, then they
become a great creative force

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.530
and they're the parents
of the arts and so on.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.610
But when they're torn apart from
each other, it's when the kind

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.680
of monstrous aspects
begin to emerge.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:49.580
So, I really took that as my cue to
say I want to write about a world

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.270
which is not just opposing these
two forces but trying to say

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.060
that when they come
together, they are creative

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.770
and when they're taken
apart, they're destructive.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.620
So, you know, the novel begins with
a man of reason falling in love

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.700 position:56%
with a creature of fantasy and their
union produces all these children

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.360
who become the novel, if you like.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.330
So, they're-- that's sort of, in
a way, shows the creative force

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.960
of the union of these things.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.980
And then there's this war
which is an illustration

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.280
of the opposite, you know?

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.190
So, it's trying to
say both those things.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.030
And yes, of course, one of
the ways it says it is to talk

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.140 position:56%
about what we all know to be going
on in the world right now, you know?

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.980
And as I said, I wanted it to
feel like a contemporary novel.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:39.360
I wanted people reading the
novel to be able to hear echoes

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.350
with the modern world, you know?

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:47.240 position:56%
I mean, the period of the novel is--
I mean I thought of it as being set

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.220
in New York like "The Day
After Tomorrow", you know?

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.020
Because I didn't want to worry
about who the mayor was, you know?

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.430
I mean, actually, the mayor of
New York in the novel is a woman

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:04.300
which is not actually the case,
unfortunately, but it's other

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.520
than that kind of detail, it
really is supposed to be the city

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:15.370
as it is now, but in which
very strange things have

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.930
started happening.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.540
And I-- in the novel it's called
"The Time of the Strangenesses".

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.840
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.470
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: And I kind--
And even though the strangenesses

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.980
in the novel, a kind of
surrealist strangenesses, really,

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.600
I think we live in that time.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:36.160
I think we live in a time in
which the rate of transformation

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.210
and the radical nature of
transformation, you know, both--

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:44.820
the world is changing both very
extremely and at very high speed.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.290
And that strangeness, that
alienation that I think many

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.830
of us would consequently
feel is kind of the mood

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.340
in which the book is set.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.630
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And then
you've stopped tweeting recently

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.010
because you were tweeting
quite a bit?

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.660
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie:
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.960
I'm done.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.260
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: OK.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.560
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.860
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And
why are you done?

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.160
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: I don't know.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.720
It's-- You know, sometimes, you
wake up in the morning and you look

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.560
to your right and there's
somebody sleeping there

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.280
and you think I don't
love you anymore.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.550
[ Laughter ]

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.850
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: So
that was Twitter feed.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.150
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.450
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.750
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah,
that little blue bird.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.630
I thought, "I don't
love you anymore."

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.410
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: But it
was you responding to a lot

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.710
of the strangenesses around us.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.700
I mean, you've taken-- I mean, you
have a pretty public view of one

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.230
of our candidates for president and
you were tweeting quite regularly?

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.530
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Which one?

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.830
[ Laughter ]

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.960
I mean, the thing is I just-- I
think it's very well-named Twitter.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.550
It is this kind of
twittering noise in your ear.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.360 position:56%
And there was just a moment of which
I thought I don't want this noise

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.780
in my ear anymore.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.510
And I just stopped.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.210
And I haven't missed it
for a second, let's say.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.570
And I mean I've had to
leave the account alive,

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:59.500
because if I delete the account,
somebody will cybersquat my name

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.380
within five seconds and
will then be tweeting

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.470
as if they're me and
I don't want that.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.180
So, the account is alive
but I'm just stopping.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:14.830
Enough. I'm just going to
do this old fashion thing.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.130
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Write novels?

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.430
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Writing books.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.730
Yeah.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.030
[ Applause ]

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.380
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: You know--

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: You know, I
remember like a couple of years ago,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.520
Jonathan Franzen made
a series of statements

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.510
in which he expressed his
dislike of social media.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.010
And at one point, he even said
I don't know why Salman does it

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.920
because I thought he
was too smart for that.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.710
And then everybody tried to
make a fight between him and me.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.940
But actually, you know,
we get on very well.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.580
And I said-- I said, you know,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.600
I completely understand
what he's saying.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.020
I understand not wanting that noise
in your head when you're working.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.420 position:56%
And I said I'm just trying this out,

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.280
I'm trying it out to see
what it is, you know?

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.760
And I've now more or less come
around to the Franzen position.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.450
I think I just-- I'm just
going to do what I do,

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.730
and I don't need all
these peripheral things.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.680
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: But, I mean,
you have-- But you have always--

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.070
I mean you have this
incredible collection of essays

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.490
that you publish step across this
line which came out of a series

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.100
of things that you were responding

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.120
to from political events
to world events.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.310
There was a really interesting talk
you gave about news and the media,

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.210
and the fact that, you know, we're
all fiction writers now, you say.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.590
You say that we have characters
in the news which are novelistic.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.240
And do you still feel that way?

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.780
Do you see-- Do you look at
sort of as you read the news,

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.700
do you see now an age of
fiction and nonfiction?

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.980
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well, I mean
I think I'm not the first person

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:47.550
to suggest that we live in a
post-factual age, you know?

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:52.340 position:56%
But I think one of the
presidential candidates is an expert

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.660
with that, you know?

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.900
And nobody cares, you know?

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:06.060
I mean, he goes on TV
and lies 25 times a day

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.620
and nobody cares, it
doesn't affect him.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.760
It's as if we've stopped
being interested

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.640
in whether things are
true or not, you know?

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.300 position:56%
And Steven Colbert invented that
wonderful word truthiness, you know?

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.260
And we now live in
the age of truthiness.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.280
You can say anything you wanted
if it sounds kind of truthy.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.960
People will not actually worry

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.250
about whether it's true,
truthy is good enough.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.640
And that's very worrying, very
worrying to live at a time

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.620
when people have become
detached from the idea

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.010
that the truth is important.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.800
You know, speaking is a [inaudible]
fiction, that's very important

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.100
because we need to be able

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.160
to tell the difference
between truth and lies.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.510
That's my job.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:23:00.700
[ Applause ]

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.900
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: You've also,
though, have been quite critical

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.470
of people on the left and
have sort of a kind of culture

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.150
of cultural relativity
and relativism

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.110
and political correctness,
et cetera.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.180
And we're also living on the
flip side, it seems to me,

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.190
in the new of identity politics
as well and of the question

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.780
of representation and who speaks
for whom and who's able to--

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.490
you know, you have this great line
of beware of the new behalfism

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.350
of people who's claimed to speak
on behalf of a certain community,

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.420
and yet it feels like on one side
in the left, we're having a lot

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.080
of debates about representation.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.470 position:56%
And I wonder what you think of that?

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.960
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well, it's
too big a question, really.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.910
I mean I think it is
a very big question.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.210
And--

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.510
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.810
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: And it has
a lot to do with the novel

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.110
that I'm trying to write now.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.410
So--

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.710
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: OK.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.010
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: --
you might have to--

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.310
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: OK.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.610
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: We might have
to come back in a couple of years.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:55.960
But I do think that-- you know,
I'll just say one thing about it,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:03.060
which is that it seems to
me that the thrust of a lot

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.710
of contemporary identity politics
is to ask us to define ourselves

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.450
in increasingly narrow ways.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:18.200
We have to be very
specific things, you know?

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.090
That's true in politics, politics.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.560
It's true in gender politics.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.950
It's true in race politics.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.250
It's true everywhere.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.950
We are being asked to define
ourselves more narrowly.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.570
And the trouble with that is

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.120
that the more narrowly we define
ourselves, the easier it is

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.580
to find ourselves at odds
with other people, you know,

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:43.330
whereas one of the things that the
novel as a form has always known is

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.780
that human beings are
very, very plural people.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.320
We are not singular, we are plural.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.240
And we are contradictory, you know?

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.830
I mean, that's what's
been famously said,

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.320
you know, do I contradict myself?

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.510
Very well, I contradict myself.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.810
And that's what the novel is like.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.360
It shows that a human
character is not homogenous,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.160
it's heterogeneous
and contradictory.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.300
So, you know, anybody in this
room could probably make a couple

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.300
of dozen statements
that would be all

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.570
of them would be equally
a definition of identity.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:23.250
They could define themselves as,
for example, tall or supporters

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:29.360
of a certain baseball team or
as the parents of their children

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.970
or as people who do a certain
kind of job or in terms

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.970
of whatever their religious
orientation or lack of it might be.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.080
I mean there's a whole range of
things you can say about yourself.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.120
And all of them are true.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.470 position:56%
And if you accept that you are all
those things, then it becomes easier

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.480
to find points of overlap
with other people.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.420
You can have strong political
disagreements with somebody

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.870
but support the same football team.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.300
You know, you could--
it's just much easier.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.720
When you see human character as
plural, it becomes much easier

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.490
to see points of contact
with other people.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:09.020
And the more you have to say, you
know, I am Western, I am Muslim,

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.840
et cetera, that's hard to
create conflict, you know?

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.850
And I think that's the
problem with a lot of--

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.060
And it's not even in
the West versus Islam.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.950 position:56%
I mean in India right now, you know,
the desire to push people into kind

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:29.750 position:56%
of narrow community definitions, you
know, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, whatever,

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.740
is also creating conflict there.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.800 position:56%
So, I worry about this whole area of
identity politics because it seems

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.180 position:56%
to me, to not understand something
very profound about human nature was

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.840
that all identities are not
singular, they are plural.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.760 position:56%
And the novel has always known this.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.440
And it's one of the reasons I
think why people should read novels

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.720
because it tells them something
that they're not hearing enough.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.760
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And you've
said it's the age of frontiers

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.590
that we live in that it's the
time to-- that the people--

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:04.070
you know, one of the sort of goals
of your creative project has been

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.700
to explore the idea of
those who step across lines,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.200
those who don't see frontiers.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.500
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.710
And I'm the kind of opposite
of I don't want to build walls.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.510
Let's put it that way.

to pay for them.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:36.560
I would like somebody to
ask him how, just how.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.860
Anyway--

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: But do you think--

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: But I think the--

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.760
I mean, look, I'm a
migrant, you know?

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.060

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.360
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: I mean,

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.910
I have spent my life
bouncing across the world.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.800
And that started off in India--
long time in England, now,

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.680
almost 20 years in America.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.390
And my life is being defined by
that act of movement, you know?

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:03.150
And I'm grateful for it and
I think it's been something

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.160
which has created the kind
of artist that I have become.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:14.390 position:56%
And I think on the hold, it was this
age which is an age of migration,

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:20.330 position:56%
has been very enriching both for the
communities to which migrants come

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.020
and to the migrants who
come to those communities.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.830
All you have to do is walk down
the streets of any great city

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.630
in the world now and you have the
stories of the whole world bumping

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.940
into each other on the streets
and that's seems to me much richer

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:40.300
than some kind of narrow
pure culture.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:45.580
I'm on the hold in not a great fan
of the idea of cultural purity.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.490
I think when people start
talking about cultural purity,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.500
other people start dying, you know?

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.820
I mean, Hitler was somebody who
talked about cultural purity.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:01.600
I'm in favor of dirt, you
know, cultural impurity.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.450
Let's have a lot of just
stuff, dirt mixed in there.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.980
Then people first of all-- first
of all, people tend to stay alive

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.960
and that's probably good.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.870
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: So, the risk

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:18.400
of asking another possibly too big
a question, if novels are meant

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.510
to show us how not to allow
ourselves to be confined

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.750
by that kind of purity, are artists

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.220
in some way not addressing
these questions enough?

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.510
Are they not emphasizing this
kind of multiplicity enough?

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.810
Are there--

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.110
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: No, no, no.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.410
No, I'm not going to say that.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:35.710
I mean, I--

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.010
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.310
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: You know, I
think if we talk about the art

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.610
of the novel, I think it's
a very, very rich time

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.610
in world literature for a start.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.960
I think it's a very rich time in
American literature and precisely

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.330
for this reason, which is

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:51.550
that American literature
has always been inspired by

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.110
and enabled by migration.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:58.170
Eastern European Jewish
migration, Italian migration,

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.570
all of that has fed directly

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.480
into the mainstream of
American literature.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:10.040
Now, in a generation
much younger than mine,

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.870
there are new American writers

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.550
from really almost
everywhere in the world.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.310
You know, there's Junot Diaz
from the Dominican Republic,

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:21.400
there is Jhumpa Lahiri from South
Asia, there's Yiyun Li from China,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.570
there's Nam Le from
Vietnam, there's, you know,

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:27.330
any number of people coming
from all over the world

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.700
that they have their families
coming from all over the world

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.490
with different stories in
their luggage, you know?

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:37.600
And unpacking that luggage and
allowing those stories to escape

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.420
into American literature, you know,

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.490
and become a part of
American literature.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:46.620
And I think it has been incredibly
enriching of this generation

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.840
of American writers have.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.380
And I-- in a way, I was--
this book is in part inspired

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.250
by those young writers because I
thought I can do that, you know?

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.730
I thought I've got stuff
in my luggage, too.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:04.940
Maybe I should unpack that--
those suitcases and get out some

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.240
of that stuff and throw it

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.500
at the Chrysler Building
and see what happens.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.910
And now, I genuinely
think that this generation

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.550
of new migrant stories arriving
in American literature is one

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.200 position:56%
of the best things to happen to
American literature for a long time.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.000
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Well, it's
interesting time for you to say

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.060 position:56%
that too because you've recently
become an American citizen yourself?

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.360
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Oh, yeah.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.660
I get to vote now.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.390
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.810
[ Applause ]

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.910 position:56%
And so you are an American novelist?

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.230
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah, that's me.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.530
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:37.830
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yes.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.130
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.430
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie:
Amongst other things.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.730
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.030
You've often written
about your love of cinema

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.010
and how the movies kind
of made you a writer.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.660
And it was "The Wizard of Oz",
specifically, is that right?

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.310
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well,
I mean yeah, that was one.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.610
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: One.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:51.910
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: But I
mean, no, I just grew up--

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.210
you know, I grew up in Bombay.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:54.650
And Bombay is a city
obsessed with the movies,

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.580
obsessed with the movies.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.820
And so it's impossible to
grow up there without having

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.310
that in your bloodstream.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.840
And, I mean, I had people
in my family who were

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.840
in small ways involved
in the movies.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.070
So, I mean, I have two aunts who
acted in the movies and uncle

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.610
who wrote screenplays,
and so on and so.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.160
And the movies are everywhere.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.130
And yeah, "The Wizard of Oz" just
had to-- I mean, I wrote a story--

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.600 position:56%
I saw "The Wizard of Oz" and I wrote
a story called, "Over the Rainbow",

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.000
about a boy who finds the beginning
of the rainbow and walks over it.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.700
Anyway, I thought it
was pretty good.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.510
My father lost it.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.810
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: No.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.110
Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.360
My father said you won't be able to
look after it, I'll look after it.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.170
And then he lost it.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.230 position:56%
And I thought, you know, "The Wizard
of Oz" actually is to an extent,

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.510
it's a story about the
incompetence of adults.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.480
[ Laughter ]

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.390
You know, Aunt Em and Uncle Henry
can't save Toto from Miss Gulch.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.410
They're useless, you know?

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.700
When Dorothy gets to the
wizard, the wizard is useless.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.660
The wizard is a phony.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.790
Pay no attention to that man
behind the curtain, you know?

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:09.120
So, the grownups in the story
are pathetic, and Dorothy has

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.530
to become the adult in order to--

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.500
because of the incompetence
of adults.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.830
So, the fact that my father lost
my story about "The Wizard of Oz",

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:22.650
it's completely appropriate to
the theme of "The Wizard of Oz".

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:29.200
But no, I mean, I think I was
very lucky that when I was young--

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.290
when I was like in the
years I was in college,

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:35.010
I was in Cambridge from--
in the mid '60s, '65 to '68.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:40.540
I mean, there's a period from
roughly speaking, the late 1950s

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.940
to the early 1970s, which we
now think of as the golden age

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.570
of the sound cinema, you know?

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.000
And it's very difficult to
explain to people what it felt

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.850
like when what we now
think of as masterpieces

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.550
with that week's new
movie, you know?

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:02.120
So, one week, it would be,
you know, "La Dolce Vita",

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.430
and the next week it
would be a new Godard film

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:10.480
and then a new Truffaut film
and then a new Pasolini film

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.870
and then a new Ingmar Bergman film
and then a new Satyajit Ray film

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.130
and then a new Luis Bunuel film.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.850
And week after week
after week, this--

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.400
I mean, it was dazzling
to go to the cinema.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.640
And I think I learnt
at least as much

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.430
in the movie theaters
as I did in the library.

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:37.840
There was this little theater in
Cambridge called The Arts Cinema,

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:43.560 position:56%
which like everything else no longer
exist and now it's a coffee shop.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.840
But I feel I got my education
in that little room, you know,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.800
watching, you know, Godard's
"Alphaville" and Traffaut's "Jules

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.280
and Dim, and Ingmar Bergman's "The
Seventh Seal" and Luis Bunuel's

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.190
"Exterminating Angel",
and so on, you know?

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.520
And I think those-- those
things have a colossal--

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.500
this book is in incredibly
influenced by those films.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.350
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And
there's the golden--

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.080
so-called the golden age
of television [inaudible].

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.700
Well, are you watching
a lot of these series?

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.000
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Oh, this, yeah.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.300
I mean, I'm interested.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.190
I'm interested because
it's clear that this thing,

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:24.990
this new form of the
60-minute drama series,

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:26.940
there is something
novelistic about it.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.210
The length of time you
have available allows you

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.210
to do what is difficult
to do in films.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.510
It allows you to have time
to develop a character,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.850
to have many different story lines.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.960
I mean, you think of something
like "Game of Thrones",

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.200
there's an unbelievable
number of story lines in that.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.120
And I, you know, I wonder
how people keep them all

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.930
in their heads but
it works, you know?

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.430
So, there's something
novelistic about this.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.230
And, yeah, I'm interested.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.530
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: But it
isn't the novel, right?

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.830
I mean you--

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:59.130
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: I mean, no,

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.430
nothing is the novel,
the novel is the novel.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:01.730
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right, right.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:03.030
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: You know?

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.330
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.630
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: And one of
the great things about the novel,

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.930
you know, is that everything.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.480 position:56%
Almost since the birth of the novel,

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.780
people have been predicting the
death of the novel, you know?

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.430
And every single new thing

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.630
that comes along is
supposed to kill the novel.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.990
You know, radio is supposed
to kill the novel, cinema,

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.070
television, you know, the internet.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.520
Everything is supposed to kill
the novel and yet, you know,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.740
the novel obstinately
refuses to die.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.040
And I'll tell you why.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.350
It's because people like it.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.150
Things--

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.670
[ Applause ]

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.920
I mean, very interesting
what-- you know, the eBooks,

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.430
they were supposed
to kill the novel.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.240
So, they arrived, eBooks,
and they went like a rocket,

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.540
"voom", like that, you know?

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.980 position:56%
And everybody-- including everybody
in the publishing industry panicked.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.950
And they got to about
17, 18% of the market

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:01.280
and they completely plateaued.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:07.130
And now, they're actually dropping
whereas the sales of this dinosaur

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:11.830
of an object, the hardcover novel,
sales are going up, you know?

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.730
Our bookstores were
getting out of business,

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:17.220
now there's little indication
that bookstores are beginning

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.830 position:56%
to open rather than close, you know?

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.630
So--

[ Applause ]

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.430
So, you know, here's this--

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:32.630
sometimes I had to go and give
a talk at Google, you know,

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.700
in Mountain View, California.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.460
And I said audience as big as this

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.220
but entirely composed
of 21-year-old techies.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.430
[ Laughter ]

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.290
And, I mean, very smart kids.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:50.830
And I said to them, you know,
this is a very remarkable piece

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:54.850
of sophisticated hardware.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.980
I said, you know, if you--

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:03.420
what happens if you drop
your laptop in the bath?

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.720
It's screwed.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:10.720 position:56%
So, if you drop that in the bath,
it does not lose its data, you know?

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.020
You just have to dry it out.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.320
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.990
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: What happens
if you pour sand on a computer?

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:18.330
Not good for it.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.840
So, you could read this stuff, this
thing, you can read it in the bus,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.330
you can read it at the beach,
you could read it in places

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.630
where people like to read.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.430
Also, if you're in the beach
and it's sunny and you look

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.730
at your Kindle, the screen,

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.810
you can't read the screen
because it's too bright.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.110
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.410
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: This is not--

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:39.930
the text doesn't disappear
in bright sunlight, you know?

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.420
So, this is--

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.610
[ Applause ]

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:47.170
This is actually more
sophisticated, you know?

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:48.500
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Fantastic.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.430
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: And also,
it doesn't become obsolete.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.300
The thing about computers,
which was supposed

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.210
to be this wonderful new
thing, is they become obsolete

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.230
at incredibly high speed.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.450
What's a floppy disk?

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:05.920
You know? If you have-- If 20 years
ago, if you were saving your data

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.200
on a floppy disk, you couldn't
use it anymore, you know?

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.950
This, 20 years ago, you could
have a book that's 20 years old,

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.350
you could still read
it perfectly easily.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:19.130
It doesn't need to be translated
into some other technology

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.210
that will be obsolete in
five year's time, you know?

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.750
So, you see, this is
most sophisticated.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.020
And that's why it survives.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:33.330
You know, you don't need all those
they call them campuses, you know?

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.630
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Google--

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:35.930
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie:
Google, Microsoft,

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.280
all of that, they're
called campuses.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.210
You don't need those
places, you just need this--

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.810
you know, one person
sitting in a room scribbling.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.120
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.130
[ Laughter ]

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.070
Well, I think we-- I'm sure
many of you have many questions.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:53.000
So please, I think we should
open this up to the audience.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.930
There are mic stands
in both of the aisles.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:40:02.790
And yes, preferably questions and
not statements would be great.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.950
OK, yeah.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.250
&gt;&gt; Is that OK?

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.470
OK. So, you said that in drawing
the distinction between the person

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:14.210
who sits down to write a novel and
the person who takes to Twitter

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:17.630
that there sort of
needs to be truths

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.820
so that the novelist
can essentially make

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.250
up a certain form of lies, right?

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.700
So, in a world where truth

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.740
and reality are becoming
increasingly fictionalized,

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.420
what is it that's left
for the novelist to do

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.210
or how are the fabrications of
the novelist suppose to differ

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.830
from the fabrications
of the Twitter user

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.560
or the spectacularized politician?

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.240
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well,
it's a question, you know?

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.540
There's no doubt.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.270
I mean, the answer is you got
to deal with it, you know?

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.610
I think what happens, is the
world changes all the time

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.820 position:56%
and the novel has to change with it.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:58.800
And one of the things that's
happened now, is that reality

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.790
or what we consider to be
reality has become very contested.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:04.300
There's isn't an agreement
about what it is.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.610 position:56%
You know, whereas, if you think
about the great heyday of the novel,

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.900
think about, you know,
the 19th century novel,

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.420
the 19th century realist novel,
that was based essentially

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.830
on the knowledge that the
writer had, that the writer

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:21.180
and the reader would basically
have the same picture of the world.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.250
You know, they would
basically see the world

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.860
in the same way as
being the same thing.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:29.990
And out of that agreement
between the writer and the reader,

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:31.290
came the realist tradition.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.800
You know, it's built
on that agreement.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.260
But if you now live in a time

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.680
in which reality has become
incredibly contested and disputed

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:44.500
and messed around with, it's
very hard to write that kind

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.470
of realist novel, because that
agreement no longer exists,

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.770
you know?

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.070
So, you have to think
of different forms.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:54.470
I mean, that's what I think
many of us are wrestling with.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:57.480
&gt;&gt; Sir, thank you for being here.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.870
Might you be willing
to mentor young people,

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.690
perhaps through the
Rolex Mentorship Program?

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.380
I was wondering-- I know
Anish Kapoor has participated,

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.260
have you participated with that?

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.730

They never asked me.

&gt;&gt; We'll make it happen then, OK.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.430 position:56%

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:18.040
every so often, I've been asked
if I would be willing to be asked.

[ Laughter ]

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.840
It is a kind of meta-question,
you know?

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:28.480
And I have expressed a desire-- I
have said that I would be willing

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.150
to be asked and I would be
willing to considering answering.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.290

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.550
But they actually never
have asked me.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.940
I mean, I do-- You know, I do
my bit of teaching and so on.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.620
I mean, I'm interested
in the company

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.520
of young smart minds, you know?

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.150
And one of the things
that's a great pleasure

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.980
when I teach a little
bit in-- at NYU.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.550
And to sit around with
very smart people talking

00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:00.940
about very good books, feels
like pleasure, you know,

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.510
and then they give
you money for it, so.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.010
[ Laughter ]

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:09.540
&gt;&gt; I'm a smart young person and I
would love to be in your company.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:16.590
You know, my question is a
college student at a time

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:20.620
of political correctness, social
justice warriors, trigger warnings,

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:24.590
professors who ask you to stop
believing in the purest form

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:29.170
of free speech and stop,
you know, raising your voice

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:32.920
and sharing your opinions
because they're controversial.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:38.170
How does a student broaden their
horizons and gain the most they can

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.380
from the money they're
paying to college?

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.680
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.130
Well, you know, I'll
take two things.

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:49.490
One is that I dislike all of
that, the list that you just made.

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:54.180
But secondly, I would say I
don't think it's as big a problem

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.230
as it sometimes made out to be.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:57.530
You know, I've been teaching

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.950
in the American Academy
now for a very long time.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:04.960
I was teaching on and off at Emory
College in Atlanta for 10 years.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.260
I'm now at NYU.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:11.990
And I have literally never,
never had a student come up to me

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:15.330
and expressed a desire
for a trigger warning

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.730
or safe space or any
of these things.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:20.020
It's never happened.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:25.050
And so, I think if
it were to happen,

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.480
I would have a very clear answer,

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:32.800
which is that a university is a
place where exactly is a place

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.850
where you must be exposed to ideas
you have not had before and some

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.410
of which, which you might not like.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.510
That's what you are there for.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:47.050
[ Applause ]

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:50.530
And that the only safe space they
can be in a university is to have--

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:56.210
is a safe space for ideas, not a
safe space from ideas, you know?

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.670
And if you can't stomach that,

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:01.200
then maybe you shouldn't
be at a university.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.090
Maybe you should be working
at KFC or something, you know?

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.760
Because, really, that's why people
go to college, they go to college

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.390
to have-- to learn how to think.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:15.520
And you cannot learn how to think
unless you are exposed to thinking,

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.760
which is not the thinking
you already have.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.100
But as I say, that's-- you know,

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.620
this is the debate that's
happening a lot I know.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:30.000
And I know some instances
which have been very difficult,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.600
but in my personal experience,
I've never come across it.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.520
And certainly at NYU,
I've been talking

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.220 position:56%
to my fellow members of the faculty.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.120
They don't come across
it that much, you know?

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.760
I mean, there are some very
weird things which we all know

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.060
because they've been
in the newspapers.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:51.560
There was this event at Mount
Holyoke College couple of years ago

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.570
when at Mount Holyoke, they
would, every year, do a production

00:45:54.570 --> 00:46:00.580
of stage reading of
[inaudible] vagina monologues.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:03.520
And then couple of years
ago, there was a protest,

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.720
a protest from the left, by
the way, against the play,

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:15.490
this famous feminist text was
criticized because it defined women

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:19.530 position:56%
as people with vaginas and therefore
discriminated against women

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.240
who did not have vaginas.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.420
And because of this, the
production was canceled.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:29.820 position:56%
Now, that's an example of where this
identity politics things can go.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:35.820
But as I say, I don't think this is
as huge an issue in my experience

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.770
as people are making it, and maybe
there's already a student backlash

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:46.950
against it, you know, that students
don't want it either, I hope.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.620
&gt;&gt; For you, what was the hardest
aspect of storytelling to tackle,

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.940
and how did you approach it?

Everything is hard.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.480
I mean, it's not easy, you know?

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.520
If it was easy, everybody
would do it.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.510
And that would be awful
because then--

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.400
[ Laughter ]

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:14.970
Well, look, the hardest thing
is to say something interesting

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:20.960
and the great gamble of
writing is that you don't know

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.100
if what you think is interesting
will be interesting to anyone else.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.910
You know, I mean, I remember
when I finished writing

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:34.170
"Midnight's Children" all those
years ago, I remember thinking

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:36.000
to myself, you know,
I think this is--

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.810
I think this is a good
book, I thought.

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.890
I had absolutely no--
Nobody knew who I was.

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:45.460
I was completely unknown
as a writer.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:50.190
And I was completely uncertain
whether anybody would agree

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:52.870
with my assessment of it, you know?

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.170
I mean, I think it's a good book

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:56.810
but supposing nobody
else does, then what?

00:47:56.810 --> 00:48:03.910 position:56%
And that's really the gamble of art,
you know, is that you do this thing

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.770
which when you're doing it
feels like a very private act.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:10.340
You're sitting by yourself
in a room for five years.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.030
It took me five years
to write that book.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:17.060
And really, it's just you and the
book that's all there is, you know?

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.050
And then at the end of it,
you send it out of the room

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:23.470
and suddenly this private
act becomes a public act,

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:27.110
and you have to hope that
somebody gets it, you know?

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:29.210
And that's the-- I
think that's the gamble

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.220
and you just you never
know if it's going to work.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.240
And when it works,
it's pretty damn good.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.710 position:56%
When it doesn't work, it's horrible.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:41.160
And I can't say more
than that, really.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:46.550
I mean, it's the hardest thing
I've ever tried to do writing

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.070
but it's also the most rewarding.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:54.100
&gt;&gt; Since you brought up "Midnight's
Children", I had a little bit

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.730
of a question about that.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:59.970
You, of course, always talk
about your debt to the authors

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.300 position:56%
that came before you and of course
we see that very much in this novel.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.590
You bring up Gogol's "The
Nose" I think is in there.

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:11.070 position:56%
And you're very comfortable it seems
with referencing other authors.

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:16.200
I was wondering about the end of
"Midnight's Children", I read it

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.320
and thought it sounded
very much like the end

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.370
of "Villette", only in reverse.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.620
And I wondered at all
if that had come

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.720 position:56%
into your mind at all of reading it?

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.020
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie:
"Villette" of Charlotte Bronte?

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.320
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.620
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Oh, no.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:34.510
No, that's actually-- I'm going
to pretend that I knew that.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.390
[ Laughter ]

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:40.040
So that next time anybody ask
me that question, I'll say, oh,

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.050
yeah, sure, Charlotte Bronte--

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:44.360
&gt;&gt; It sounded like the mirror
like the opposite of it.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.660
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: No,
no, I know what you mean.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.960
I know what you mean but no, no.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.260
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.560
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: I mean alas.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.860
I wish I was smart enough
to have thought of that.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.980
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: My favorite
question of all time was

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:58.140
when Midnight sort of first
came out, I was at talking

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:01.680
at a university in [inaudible].

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.650
A young woman stood up and said--
she said, "Your novel, Mr. Rushdie,

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.780
'Midnight's Children',
is a very long novel.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.510
I said, "Never mind,
I'd read it through."

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.110
[ Laughter ]

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.990
I said my question for
you is the following.

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:20.510
She said, "Fundamentally,
what's your point?"

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:26.010
[ Laughter ]

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:27.310
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:34.010
Salman Rushdie: I've been trying
to answer that ever since.

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:37.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes, I have a question not
related so much for being a novelist

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.960
but certainly literature.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:44.400
You recently espouse the
memorization of poetry as a way of,

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.190
you know, as a technique
for teaching and being

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:48.640
that I'm a schoolteacher,
I'm fascinated by that.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.390
You know, we've gotten very far
away from memorization of any kind

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:55.530
and you just-- you basically
refer to it as a lost art.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:58.000
You know, I happen to like
Kipling and other forms

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.340
of poetry but it doesn't matter.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:02.350
I mean, I've always just
enjoyed that for my leisure.

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.930
And when I was a young
man, we did memorize things

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:08.040
like the Gettysburg Address and
whatnot and anything, you know,

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.660
that we thought was about related

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.490
to civics basically
and even some dates.

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:14.920
So, could you explain
how that, you think--

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.500
you know, I know, you basically--

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.810
I think of you as an
educator like I am obviously.

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:24.290
And so I would like to hear your
views on memorization of poetry.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:29.700
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well, I mean
I come from that generation

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.380
where we were all asked to do it.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:38.600
And it's very annoying, you know?

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:44.650
You know, when you're having to sit
by yourself and try and memorize,

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:48.450
you know, especially, when it's
a poem you don't particularly

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:52.680
like which at school
it often is, you know?

00:51:52.680 --> 00:52:00.430
But the fact is that a lot of that
poetry has still stayed with me,

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:05.030
you know, and I still have it
in my head as a way of thinking

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:10.940
about things and I feel it's
a real resource, you know?

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.100
And not all of it is great poetry.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:17.790
I mean, I can still recite
the whole of "The Walrus

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.850
and The Carpenter", for example.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:24.730
Don't ask me, otherwise, I will.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:30.500
I just think it's a way
of training the mind.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:36.740
First of all, it allows you
to understand beauty in a way

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.680
that you don't understand
unless you have it

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.060
at your fingertips, you know?

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:45.530
If you have a poem there in your
head for you to think about,

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.470
you can appreciate it in a way
that you don't on the page.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:52.220
When the page becomes irrelevant
because it's inside you,

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.980
that's a different
sort of experience.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.850
And I just think it's
an enriching experience,

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:00.400
although I admit annoying.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.390 position:56%
And children, young people very
often complain about being asked to,

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.010
you know, rote learning
is something.

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:13.720
And it's also unfashionable, which
is its second great advantage.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.440
So, yeah, I mean, I
think it's a good thing.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.940 position:56%
And, I mean, I know everyone I know
who spent their childhood being made

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.500
to learn things speaks
well of the experience,

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.990
says that they are glad they
did and that they feel happy

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.380
to have those things in their head.

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:34.440 position:56%
And not everything stays in your
head but, you know, some stuff does.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.230
And it's worth it, it's
worth it, you know?

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:41.510
It gives you a frame of
reference which is broader

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:42.960
than you would otherwise have.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.590
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Thank you.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:48.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming
and thank you for asking

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.510
such thoughtful questions.

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.680
I don't have a question
about literature per se

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.700 position:56%
but about the cultural purity thing.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.350
Why-- I'm curious to hear what
you think is going to be the case

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:02.000
for Indian writers in India, like
what that environment will look

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.390
like with the rise of
the BJP, and especially

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:09.850
like what's really been happening
and all of what Modi is saying.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.730
And on top of that, like
do you think we're going

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:15.250
to see more self-censorship
from writers in India or--

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:16.650
I'm just curious what you think.

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.970
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: You
know, I really have to--

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:22.270
my problem is that I
have not been to India

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.780
since the Modi government
took power.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.120
So, I'm looking from
a distance, you know?

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:33.330
And I've always been very
suspicious of people who talk

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.750
about India from a distance.

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:39.070
So, I don't want to be the
person doing it, you know?

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:45.820
I mean, I'm very-- I was always
an opponent of Narendra Modi

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:51.870
from way back, you know, from
when he was just running Gujarat.

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:55.190 position:56%
I think he is a very alarming figure

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:58.480
and I think his government is
a very alarming government.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.990
And I do think it's
frightening for people, you know.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.490
Self-censorship, I can't tell.

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:09.280
I mean, self-censorship seems
to me to be the greatest crime

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.340
that a writer can commit.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:16.300
I mean, if you feel that
scared, then don't write.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.100
Nobody is asking you
to write, you know?

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:22.970 position:56%
And if you-- if by writing, you
could only write by saying something

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:26.160
which is less than the truth,
then, you know, for goodness' sake,

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.830
save the trees, you know?

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:32.060
There are plenty of good
books around for us to read.

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.670
We don't have to read
second-rate books.

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:37.630
I don't know if any writer to--

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:43.610
of my acquaintance who is too
chicken to say what they think.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:46.950
But what I do know is that it is
very frightening in India right now

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:48.910 position:56%
and there are lots of-- there's lots

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:54.520
of bullying going on
and lots of menaces.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.190
And I don't want to say more than
that because I haven't been there,

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.530
so I don't have that kind of
boots on the ground knowledge

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:04.120
of what's going on, but
I'm very worried about it.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:06.130
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Unfortunately,
we probably only have time for one

00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:08.540
or two more questions so--

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.900
&gt;&gt; So, my question is about freedom
of speech, about which you talked.

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.550
So, some of your critics say that
you are selective about talking

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:17.920
about freedom of speech like you--

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.220
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: That I'm what?

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.520
Sorry?

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.230
&gt;&gt; Like you are being selective
about the freedom of speech.

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.530
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Selective.

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:27.990
&gt;&gt; So, what do you say to that?

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:29.890
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: You'll
have to say a bit more.

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:33.160
&gt;&gt; So, I was saying like
in India, you don't talk

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.920
about how the international
[inaudible]

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.520
and they censor the media
and all those things

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.160
so you don't talk about that.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.460
Some of your critics say this.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.980
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well, first
of all, it's not required to talk

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.250
about everything, you
know what I mean?

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:52.630
Freedom of speech is
the right to speak

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:55.500
about what you want
you to talk about.

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:59.020
And I'm not obliged to
talk about anything.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:01.100
You know, I talk about the
things I want to talk about.

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.160
But the point I'm trying
to make is that there is--

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:08.930
the value of this thing
is that it is the freedom

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:11.840
on which all other freedoms depend.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.980
If you don't have free expression,

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:17.310
you don't actually have
a free society, you know?

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:19.660
So, that's why it's valuable.

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:23.870
I mean, you may-- you know, people
are completely free to disapprove

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:25.890
of what I say or to disapprove

00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:30.040
of the things I don't talk
about, fair enough, you know?

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.340
That's not the point I'm making.

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.780
I don't have to make a speech on
every subject in the world in order

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.250
to prove that I believe
in free speech.

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.820
I talk about what I want to talk
about and let other people talk

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.260
about what they want to talk about.

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.610
That's the point.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:45.440
Does that answer your question?

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.040
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: OK.

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.340
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: I think we can
probably take one last question.

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.640
I'm sorry to everybody
else who's in line.

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.940
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.340
A simple question perhaps
provoking a non-simple answer,

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:59.990
from where do you get
your deepest inspiration?

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:02.010
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Oh, yeah.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:03.810
There's a store.

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:08.050
[ Laughter ]

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.010
But you have to know the password.

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:12.310
[ Laughter ]

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:14.050
&gt;&gt; Very good, very good.

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:15.350
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: No.

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:17.000
I mean, if I knew the
answer to that question,

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.830
I would have written a
lot more books, you know?

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.160
It's very difficult to say
where a book comes from.

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.590
And in my experience, it doesn't
come in the same way twice.

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:29.210 position:56%
Every book comes in a different way.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:33.970
Sometimes you have a story line,
sometimes you have a character,

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:37.460
you know, sometimes,
you have fragments

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.380
that you gradually understand
how they fit together.

00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:44.860
The great American novelist
Joseph Heller who wrote

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.040
"Catch-22" amongst his other books,
used to say that what happened

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.130
with him characteristically is
that he would think of a sentence

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:59.020 position:56%
and he would know that that sentence
contained another 200 sentences,

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.320
you know?

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:04.580
So that-- I mean, his second novel,
something happened originally began

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:06.660
with the sentence in the
office in which I work,

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.940
there are five people
of whom I'm afraid.

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:13.620
Then he knew how to
write the book, you know?

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.920
That happened to me once.

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:18.110
That happened when I wrote
"Haroun and the Sea of Stories",

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:23.110
which I was having-- I mean, I was
having some trouble with the tone

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:27.160
of voice of that book, you know,
of how to make it not too grownup

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.910
for children and not too
childish for grownups, you know?

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:34.470
And then there was a day when I sat
there and wrote the first sentence.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:37.670
You know, there was once in the
country of Alif Bay, sad city,

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.790
saddest of cities, a city so sad
that they have forgotten its name.

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:44.740
I thought, OK, now I know
how to write the book.

00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:48.580
Literally, I wrote that sentence
and it was like open sesame.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:49.880
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Wow.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.200
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: I
thought, OK, got it.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:56.150
And so, yeah, it comes
in many different ways.

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:57.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:58.750
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Could we take one

00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.300
or two more questions
or-- Is that OK?

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.600
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Sure.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.900
Yeah.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.500
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Go ahead.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.800
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.100
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Oops.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:13.430
It's not [inaudible] the
person asking the question.

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:14.730
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Oh, yeah.

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.030
No.

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.500
&gt;&gt; OK. Oh, wow.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:24.260
First of all, I'd like
to just say it's an--

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:27.060
such an honor for me to have a
chance to ask you a question.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.030
So, thank you so much
for being here.

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:33.340
Second, since you talked about
movies, I have a two-fold question.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:37.710
First, if you have one, what's
your favorite Bollywood movie,

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:42.670
and second, would you like to
see some of your novels be made

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:45.800
into movies or do you think they'll
lose their essence while being made

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.100
in movies?

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.400
Thank you.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.690
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well, you know,
when I was growing up in Bombay,

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:55.370
it was not called Bollywood.

01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.410
Bollywood is a more
recent invention.

01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:00.390
We used to just call
them Bombay Talkies,

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.670
sometimes they were called movies.

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:08.060
I like-- My favorite films
all come from that old period.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:15.450
I like [inaudible], "Mr. 420"
is one of my favorite films.

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:20.290
And my favorite song,
unsurprisingly,

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:24.140
is the song about Bombay
which is called

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:28.730
"Bombay Meri Jaan",
"Bombay My Darling", so.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.860
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Great good.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.790
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: This will mean
only something to those of you--

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.290
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And
your novels as films?

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:36.590
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.550
And my-- Well, "Midnight's
Children" was made into film

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.580
by the Indian-Canadian
director Deepa Mehta,

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.260
and I wrote the screenplay.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.430
And so I'm bias but I
thought it was quite good.

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:50.100
But one of the things
I was interested in,

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:53.400
in the finished film
was that its tone

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.710
of voice is rather
different than the novel.

01:01:55.710 --> 01:02:01.200
I think the novel is funnier and
sort of wilder than the film,

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.950
but the film is much more
directly emotional than the novel.

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:10.400
And, I mean, I kind of like it
that they have that difference,

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.380
that the film really
is Deepa's work,

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.960
you know, responding to my work.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.840
And, so yeah, I like it.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.630
I mean, I would like
all of them to be filmed

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:23.510
but that doesn't seem
to be a stampede.

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:26.550
[ Laughter ]

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.930
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, I come from
the country of--

01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:33.610
another country [inaudible]
I believe a very--

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:40.110
your work unfortunately was not
allowed to be read to the extent

01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:46.640
that we could go to jail
or-- and/or be killed by mob.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.110
However, you know, my parents made
the fortunate choice of not leaving

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:55.980
that country and going off the
black market and getting your books

01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.500
and going through the process,
so that's just one point.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.800
So--

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.170
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: No,
I very well respect.

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:06.410
&gt;&gt; -- given what's going on in
this country, unfortunately,

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:10.240
because all I think you may want
to renew your roots a little bit.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.670
But my question to Mr.
Rushdie, if I may, is regard--

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:20.870 position:56%
as an international-- as a
non-American, the candidate that you

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:28.030 position:56%
so dislike perhaps, from what he's
saying, it seems, as a non-American,

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:31.500
that he probably would
be a lot more--

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:37.880
or a lot less interventionist
than the usual lot,

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.730
if you know what I'm
trying to say, in terms of--

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:47.340
in holding the leaders
of the area that I come

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:52.420
from more accountable perhaps
than the other candidates.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.020
I'm just curious what's your view

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.710
from international perspective
regarding the US elections?

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:02.600
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well, I
think the only world leaders

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.080
that I've heard Mr. Trump refer

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.030
to with admiration are
all dictators, you know?

01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:13.890
Putin, Assad, these are
the people he likes.

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:18.710
And I worry about that being
a principle of foreign policy.

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:22.760
But, you know, long before
he intervenes in any country,

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.510 position:56%
he's going to intervene in this one.

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:30.500
And I, at frankly, my worries
begin right here at home.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:38.490
I cannot imagine a Trump-appointed
Supreme Court which is, you know,

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.450
which is what would happen.

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:45.790 position:56%
We'd have an extremely authoritarian
Supreme Court for the rest

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:48.820
of my life certainly
for a generation.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:52.980
I'm unable to take Trump seriously

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:56.540
as a candidate except
as a figure of fear.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:03.280
So, it is my hope that he will be
defeated, and so we will not have

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.580
to have this conversation.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.880
[ Applause ]

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.600
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: We have some
younger readers have a question

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.560
for you and I want to give
them the chance to ask you.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.800
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: OK.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.100
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: OK, yes?

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.840
&gt;&gt; Me and my sister were wondering,
where'd you get the inspiration

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.920 position:56%
for "Haroun and the Sea of Stories"?

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Well, part of it,

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:31.640
my oldest son's middle
name is Haroun.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.570
At the time the book
came out, he was annoyed

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:37.500
that I didn't use his first name.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.700
Now, I think he's quite relieved.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:46.880
And the book began because
when he was a little boy,

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.090
I used to tell him
stories in the bath,

01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:54.220
when he was in the bath not bedtime
stories with bath time stories.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:06:00.850
And I would pretend to him that the
bath water contained the stories.

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:05.270 position:56%
So, I would dip a little cup in the
bath water and pretend to take a sip

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:08.280
and then tell him a story.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.200
So, I would-- I said, you
know, I said that, you know,

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.350
the bath is full of stories.

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:19.030 position:56%
And so, from that bath full of
stories, it became a sea of stories.

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:22.320
And that's-- really,
it began with my son

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.400
in the bath, that's how it started.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.070
Some of it comes out of
Kashmir, because, like I said,

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.830
it's where my family is from.

01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:35.140 position:56%
The book is, I think, anyone who
has any knowledge of Kashmir can see

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.250
that the fictional country

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:41.660
in the story is pretty
clearly based on Kashmir.

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.690
So, like that, that's all of it.

01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:46.990
Does that help?

01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:48.290
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: I--

01:06:48.290 --> 01:06:49.590
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Yeah.

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:50.890

can take one last question.

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:53.060
I'm sorry, but we have--

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:59.700
&gt;&gt; Hi. I read your
book, "Joseph Anton",

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.430
and about that very difficult
period of time you went

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:06.290
through when you were in hiding
and your life was being threatened

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.930
and you were actually
separated from your son

01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:12.150
and your family, much of that time.

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:20.410
And I just wondered what
strength you were able to rely

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:24.430
on from yourself to get
through that period of time

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:27.280
which was a long time,
like 10 years.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.250
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: More
than 10 years, yeah.

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:34.470
Well, I mean, I-- First of
all, I was very fortunate

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:43.990 position:56%
and that I was surrounded by
incredibly loyal friends and family.

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:49.810
And had it not been for
their strength, you know,

01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:52.760
I would probably have had
much greater difficulty

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.360
in surviving that experience.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:02.810
But I did fortunately have around
me this circle of very brave

01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:05.070
and very loyal people, you know?

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:08.170
And that was a great help.

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.010
And then there's a
thing, there's a thing

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.820
which relates to this
book, you know?

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.610
And in this book, there are--

01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:18.000
these are characters who are
supposedly the descendants

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.230
of the jinn and have a little
bit of the jinn magic, you know,

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:26.530
inside them, which when the crisis
comes, when the great war comes,

01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:31.780
they discover that power within
themselves that they're able to use

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:34.310
to resist the attack against them.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:39.220
And what I was trying to say
there is something that I learned

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.960
in those years, which is I
think many of us, many of us,

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:50.170
maybe all of us, have within
ourselves unsuspected strength,

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:55.410
unsuspected reserves
of strength that we

01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:58.750
in ordinary life have
no need to call upon

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.270
and we are maybe not even aware of.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:05.070
But in a time of crisis, whatever
that crisis may be, you know,

01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:10.390
many of us face crises in
our family, crises of health,

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:12.470
crises all sort of things.

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:16.910
And I think what very often happens
is that when the crisis comes,

01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:22.440
we discover in ourselves the
strength to face it, you know?

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:26.750
And we surprise ourselves
in our ability

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:32.270
to resist whatever it
is that's coming at us.

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:35.860
And I certainly thought-- I
mean, if you would ask me in--

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:40.020
at the beginning of that period,
if you would say that's going to be

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.480 position:56%
like 11 years of your life and how--

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.760
what sort of shape do you think
you're going to be in at the end,

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.730
I would not have bet on myself
to be in great shape, you know?

01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:51.430
But I, as I say, with
the help of these--

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:54.240
the other people, I also found--

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.920
I think I found that I was more
bloody-minded than I thought I was.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.110
I'd found that I had survival
capacities which were greater

01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:04.060
than I'd believe I did, you know?

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.630
And as I say, I think
that's not just me.

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:11.400
I think that is a characteristic
we have that when the crisis comes,

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.450
we find in ourselves the
resources to deal with it.

01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:17.340
And that's what I did, nothing
else that many people do.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.640
&gt;&gt; Yes, I agree.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.940
Thank you.

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.740
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: Thank you.

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:27.560
[ Applause ]

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.360
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And--

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.640
[ Applause ]

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.440
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And on
that note, thank you so much

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.300
for being here this
evening and for the sea

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:37.600
of stories that you've given us.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.900
I really appreciate it.

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:40.200
Thank you.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.500
&gt;&gt; Salman Rushdie: OK.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.800
