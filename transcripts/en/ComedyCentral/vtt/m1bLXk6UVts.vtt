00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.307
[doorbell rings]

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.745
- [German accent]
<i>HEIL</i> HITLER.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.916
MY NAME IS COLONEL
HANS MULLER OF THE S.S.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.487
AS YOU KNOW, WE WERE
COMBING THE AREA FOR JEWS.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.758
BUT IT HAS COME TO OUR ATTENTION
THAT TWO NEGROES HAVE ESCAPED,

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:28.428
AND ARE HIDING OUT
IN THIS AREA AS WELL.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.397
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.034
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,
NOW, WOULD YOU?

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:38.071
- UH, NO.
NO NEGROES HERE. MM-MM.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:41.875
- UH, NEGROES? EW.
[chuckles]

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:42.976
HELL NO.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.280
- AND, UM,
WHAT ARE YOUR NAMES?

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.215
- LEROY...

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.816
HEIMER.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.952
LEROYHEIMER
IS MY LAST NAME,

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.855
AND MY FIRST NAME
IS VERY GERMAN,

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.957
AND THAT IS BECAUSE
IT IS HEINRICH.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.928
SO, MY NAME
IS HEINRICH LEROYHEIMER.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.966
- AND I AM BARON HELMUT...

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.135
SCHNITZELNAZI.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.071
- WELL.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.940
ARE YOU GOING TO
INVITE ME IN?

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:15.275
- OF COURSE!
- YEAH, COME ON IN!

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.311
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.156
- PLEASE, GENTLEMEN,
SIT DOWN.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.425
NOW...

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:36.330
AS YOU KNOW, THE NEGRO,
NOT UNLIKE THE JEW,

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:40.868
CAN BE A VERY
TRICKY CREATURE.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.004
OH, THAT'S FUN.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.173
WE HAVE DEVELOPED
MANY TESTS TO DETERMINE

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.776
IF AN INDIVIDUAL
IS, IN FACT,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.114
AN ACTUAL NEGRO.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.416
IT'S VERY SCIENTIFIC.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.852
LIKE WHEN WE THROW THE BEANS
UP AGAINST THE HOMOSEXUALS

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:01.054
TO SEE IF
THE BEANS EXPLODE.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.490
- YEAH, UH...

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:05.759
WHAT KIND OF TESTS?

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.562
- IT'S INTERESTING
THAT YOU WOULD ASK ME THAT.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:12.866
WOULD YOU MIND IF I...

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.501
REMOVED YOUR HAT?

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:17.070
SO THAT I CAN
MEASURE YOUR HEAD.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.505
THE NEGRO HEAD,
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.075
ONLY COMES
IN THE HALF SIZES.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:26.246
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY INTERESTING
THINGS ABOUT THE NEGRO HEAD.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.982
HMM.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.851
EVERYTHING
SEEMS IN ORDER.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.152
both: [exhale]

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:34.354
- WELL,
NO NEGRO HEADS HERE.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.889
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
THOUGH.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:37.457
IF A NEGRO HEAD
CAME IN HERE,

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.327
IT WOULD FIND ITSELF
DETACHED FROM ITS NEGRO BODY.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.361
I'LL TELL YOU THAT,
RIGHT HERE.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.096
[chuckles]
AM I RIGHT?

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.865
- THIS IS VERY,
VERY GOOD.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.401
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY
EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE,

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:49.970
WHICH IS WHY
IT'S SO IMPORTANT

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.974
THAT WE HAVE A TEST
WHICH IS FOOL-PROOF.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.210
- UH, M-M-M-MORE TESTS?

00:02:56.243 --> 00:03:00.214
- YOU KNOW,
HUNTING THE NEGROES ALL DAY,

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.116
YOU REALLY BUILD UP AN APPETITE,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.486
CAN I INTEREST YOU TWO

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.090
IN SOME DELICIOUS BEETS?

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.392
INTERESTING.

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.761
THE NEGRO
CANNOT RESIST THE BEET.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:18.065
IT IS DRAWN TO IT
LIKE FLIES TO <i>SCHEISSE.</i>

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:21.468
WELL, GENTLEMEN.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:24.438
IT APPEARS I HAVE
WASTED YOUR TIME.

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:25.806
I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:26.940
- [exhales]

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:28.242
- JUST ONE MORE THING.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:32.646
I'M CURIOUS AS TO
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT...

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.949
THIS CAT TOY!

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:38.352
JIGGLEDY, JIGGLEDY!

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.254
NOTHING?

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:41.488
WELL, THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:45.225
I'M SORRY
FOR BOTHERING YOU.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.294
YOU TWO ARE OBVIOUSLY
NOT NEGROES.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.695
both: [laugh]

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.297
- OF COURSE
WE'RE NOT NEGROES.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.099
- THIS IS A NO-NEGRO ZONE.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.500
- THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:54.902
- AIN'T NO THANG.

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:58.105
- HERR LEROYHEIMER.

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:00.274
OH, THAT'S NEW.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:02.910
BARON SCHNITZELNAZI.

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:04.845
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
OH, <i>HEIL</i> HITLER.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:07.147
- I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE.
THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT.

00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:09.183
BY THE WAY...
[clears throat]

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:10.450
ARE YOU, BY CHANCE,

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:13.353
RELATED TO THE DUSSELDORF
SCHNITZELNAZIS?

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.923
- YES, I AM.

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:17.191
- HOW'S YOUR AUNT FRIDA?

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:19.493
- AUNT FRIDA? SHE...

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:22.229
IS STILL...

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.797
FAT?

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.067
- I DON'T RECALL
HER BEING FAT.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.369
BUT WHO LOOKS LIKE THEY DID
IN COLLEGE ANYWAY, AM I RIGHT?

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.772
- NOT ME. NOT ME. NOT ME.
- NOT THIS ONE, EITHER.

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.074
- 'CAUSE I WAS A--
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:35.876
- WELL, <i>GUTEN TAG.</i>
- [laughs] ALL RIGHT.

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.412
- OH, GUTENBERG!

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:43.383
[engine starts]

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:44.952
[car drives away]

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:48.388
- WHEW.
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE.

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:50.991
WHOO. WE GOTTA
GET OUTTA HERE, MAN.

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:52.759
WE--

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:55.162
- HE LEFT THE CAT TOY, MAN!
- UH-UH.

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.130
- HE LEFT IT!
- UH-UH.

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.199
- [laughs] OH!

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.301
OH! [giggles]
