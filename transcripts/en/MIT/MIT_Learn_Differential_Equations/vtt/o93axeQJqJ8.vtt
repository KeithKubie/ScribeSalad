00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.910
GILBERT STRONG: Well, you
see spring has finally

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.860
come to Boston.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.870
My sweater is gone and it's
April the 16th, I think.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.980
It's getting late spring.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.580
So today, this video is the
nice case, constant coefficient,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.180
linear equations, and the right
hand side is an exponential.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.510
Those are the best.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.590
And we've seen that before.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.240
In fact, let me extend, we saw
it for first order equations,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.700
here it is for second
order equations,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.580
and it could be an
nth order equation.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.840
We could have the nth derivative
and all lower derivatives.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.330
The first derivative,
the function itself,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.780
0-th derivative
with coefficients,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.040
constant coefficients,
equalling e

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.773
to the st. That's
what makes it easy.

00:00:56.773 --> 00:01:00.180
And what do we do when the
right hand side is e to the st?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.490
We look for a
solution, a multiple

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.480
of e to the st.
Capital Y times e

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.440
to the st, that's going to work.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.650
We just plug into the equation
to find that transfer function

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.966
capital Y. Can I just do that?

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.710
I'll do it for the nth degree.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.930
Why not?

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.640
So will I plug this in for y,
every derivative brings an s.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.050
Capital Y is still
there, the exponential

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.890
is going to be still
there, and then

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.620
there are all the s's that
come down from the derivatives,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.810
and s's from the nth derivative.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.595
One s from the first derivative,
no s from the constant term.

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:52.600
Do you see that
equation is exactly

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.220
like what we had before with
as squared plus Bs plus C.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.490
We have quadratic equation,
the most important case.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.419
Now, I'm including that with
any degree equation, nth degree

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.050
equation.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.630
And what's the solution for Y?

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.240
Because e to the st
cancels e to the st.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.440
That whole thing equals 1.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.360
I divide by this
and I get Y equal 1

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.310
over that key polynomial.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.500
It's a nth degree polynomial.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.670
And the 1 over it is called
the transfer function.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.000
And that transfer function
transfers the input--

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.020
e to the st-- to the
output-- Ye to the st.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.620
It gives the
exponential response.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.030
Very nice formula.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.110
Couldn't be better.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.690
And you remember for
second degree equations,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.510
our most important case is
as squared Bs plus C. That's

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.970
the solution almost every time.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.630
But one thing can go wrong.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.570
One thing can go wrong.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.440
Suppose for the particular
s, the particular exponent,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.880
in the forcing function, suppose
that s in the forcing function

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.830
is also one of the s's
in the no solutions.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:37.060
You remember the no solutions,
there are two s's-- s1 and s2--

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.590
that make this 0,
that make that 0.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.990
Those are the s1 and s2 that
go into the no solutions.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.510
Now, if the forcing s is one
of those no solution s's, we

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.380
have a problem.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.520
Because this is 1 over 0 and
we haven't got an answer yet.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.710
1 over 0 has no meaning.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.730
So I have to, this
is called resonance.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.440
Resonance is when
the forcing exponent

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.940
is one of the no exponents
that make this 0.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.390
And there are two of those
for second order equations

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.700
and there will be n different
s's-- s1, s2, up to sn--

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.990
for nth degree equations.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.400
Those special s's, I
could also call them

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.000
poles of the transfer function.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.970
The transfer function has
this in the denominator

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.720
and when this is 0,
that identifies a pole.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.540
So the s1, s2, to
sn are the poles

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.740
and we hope that this s is not
one of those, but it could be.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.740
And if it is, we
need a new formula.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.890
So that's the only
remaining case.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.500
This is a completely
nice picture.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.290
We just need this last
case with some resonance

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.610
when s equals say s1.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.490
I'll just pick s1 and
when A, I know that As 1

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.640
squared plus Bs 1 plus C is 0.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.600
So Y would be 1 over 0.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.830
And we can't live with that.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.300
I've written here for the
second degree equation

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.690
same possibility
for the nth degree,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.130
An s1 to the nth
plus A0 equals 0.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.260
That would be a
problem of resonance.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.560
In the nth degree equation, this
gives us resonance, you see,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.790
because remember, the no
solutions were e to the s1t

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.060
was a no solution.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.950
If I plug-in e to the s1t,
the left side will give 0.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.050
So I can't get for equal to a
forcing term on the right side.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.730
I need a new solution.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:16.805
I need a new y of t.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.130
Can I tell you what it is?

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.660
It's a typical case of
L'Hopital's rule from calculus

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.800
when we approach
this bad situation,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.460
and we are getting a 1 over 0.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.990
Well, you'll see a 0 over 0
and that's L'Hopital's aim for.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.060
So where do we start?

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.060
A Y particular
solution is this e

00:06:52.060 --> 00:07:12.950
to the st over this As
squared plus Bs plus C. Right.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.520
That's our particular solution.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.140
If it works.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.170
Resonance is the case when this
doesn't work because that's 0.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.060
Now, that's a
particular solution.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.950
I'll subtract off a no solution.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.690
I could do that.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.350
I still have a solution.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.860
So I subtract off e to the s1t.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:41.600
So S1 is, e to the
s1t is a no solution.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.490
This is what I would call
a very particular solution.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.160
It's very particular because
a t equals 0, it's 0.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:57.130
Do you see that, you see
what's happening here.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.770
The question, resonance
happens when s approaches s1.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.580
Resonance is s
equal to, resonance

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.290
itself is at the thing.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:14.230
Now, we let s sneak
up on s1 and we ask

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.720
what happens to that formula.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.100
You see, we're sneaking
up on resonance.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.740
At resonance, when s
equals s1, that will be 0

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.220
and that will be 0.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.490
That's our problem.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.980
So approach it and you
end up with the derivative

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.590
of this divided by the
derivative of this.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.750
Do you remember L'Hopital?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.460
It was a crazy rule in calculus,
but here it's actually needed.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:49.610
So as s goes to s1
this goes to 0 over 0,

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.000
so I have to take
derivative over derivative.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.880
So let me write the answer.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.520
Y resonant.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:02.240
Can I call this the resonant
solution when s equals s1.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.330
And what does it equal?

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.940
Well, I take the s
derivative of this

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.170
and divide it by the
s derivative of that.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.830
Derivative over derivative.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:21.490
The s derivative of
that is te to the st.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:29.370
And the s derivative
of this is 2As plus B.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.190
And now, I have derivative
over derivative,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.620
I can let s go to s1.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.710
So s goes to s1, this goes
to s1, and I get an answer.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.870
The right answer.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:47.310
This is the correct
solution and you notice

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.660
everybody spots this t factor.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.560
That t factor is a
signal to everyone

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.580
that we're in a
special case when

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.880
two things happen to be equal.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.760
Here the two things
are the s and the s1.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.770
So that will work.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.870
So do you see the
general picture?

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.070
It's always this te
to the st, t above.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:17.810
And down below we have the
derivative of this polynomial

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.970
at s equal s1.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.150
You know it's theoretically
possible that we

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.100
could have double resonance.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.360
We would have double
resonance if that thing is 0.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.530
If s1 was a double root, if
s1 was a double root, then,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.010
well, that's just absurd,
but it could happen.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.550
Then not only is that
denominator 0, but after one

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.720
use of L'Hopital, so we
have to drag L'Hopital back

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.680
from the hospital
and say do it again.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.350
So we would have a
second derivative.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.390
I won't write down that solution
because it's pretty rare.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.830
So what has this video done?

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:07.270
Simply put on record
the simplest case

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.460
possible with a forcing
function, e to the st.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:17.560
And above all, we've identified
this transfer function.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.810
And let me just anticipate that
if we need another way to solve

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:27.100
these equations, instead
of in the t domain,

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:33.150
we could go to the Laplace
transform in the s domain.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.120
We could solve it
in the s domain.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.470
And this is exactly
what we'll meet when

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.150
we take the Laplace transform.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.660
That will be the
Laplace transform,

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.250
which we have to deal with.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.980
So that transfer function
is a fundamental,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.210
this polynomial tells us, its
roots tell us the frequencies,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.010
s1, s2, and the no solutions.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.810
And then 1 over that tells
us the right multiplier

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.140
in the force solution.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.250
So constant coefficients,
exponential forcing,

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.580
the best case possible.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.370
Thank you.
