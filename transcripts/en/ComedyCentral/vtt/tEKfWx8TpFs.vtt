00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:06.406
IT'S TIME TO PLAY "BAD SANTA."

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.879
"BAD SANTA."

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:13.480
THE REAL SANTA CLAUS IS THE
MAGICAL PATRIARCH OF CHRISTMAS

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.516
WHO LIVES IN THE NORTH POLE AND
MAKES DREAMS COME TRUE.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.384
BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL GO THEIR
WHOLE LIVES WITHOUT EVER SEEING.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.418
HIM.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:21.989
THE SANTAS YOU'RE FAR MORE
LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER ARE

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.323
OVERWEIGHT VAGRANTS WHOSE
PISS-STAINED LAP YOU ONLY LET

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:26.426
YOUR KIDS SIT ON ONE MONTH A
YEAR.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.296
SO COMEDIANS, I'M ABOUT TO SHOW
YOU SOME FOOTAGE WE FOUND OF BAD

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.631
SANTAS, AND FOR 250 POINTS I
WANT YOU GUYS TO ANSWERS SOME

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:35.235
QUESTIONS THAT THESE VIDEOS
RAISE.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.772
VERY IMPORTANT SOCIOLOGICAL
EXPERIENCE.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.944
FIRST UP, THIS CLUMSY CLAUS.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:49.416
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Chris: SO THE QUESTION IS

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.187
WHAT DOES HE WANT FOR CHRISTMAS,
RANDY.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.689
&gt;&gt; RECTAL RECONSTRUCTION
SURGERY.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:01:00.694
&gt;&gt; TO BE FAIR THAT'S WHAT HE
WANTED BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.996
&gt;&gt; Chris: THIS MAKES IT MORE OF
A PRIORITY.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.164
CHRIS.

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:09.169
&gt;&gt; PLACE TO HIDE HIS WHISKEY
THAT ISN'T AN ICY RAIN GUTTER.

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.505
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.107
NEXT UP.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:21.081
THIS SANTA DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO
SHUT HIS [BEEP] MOUTH.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.349
&gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD, IF
YOU'RE THE REAL SANTA WHAT DID I

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.584
ASK FOR?

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:28.789
A BARBIE DOLL AND TIDDLYWINKS
&gt;&gt; I GOT A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:32.259
YOU MYSELF.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:36.196
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Chris: NOT REALLY SURE WHO

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.197
THAT APPEALS TOO.

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:42.870
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: THE REAL SANTA LIVES

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:43.871
IN THE NORTH POLE, WHERE DOES
THIS SANTA LIVE?

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.974
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS,
FLORIDA.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.710
RIGHT.

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:53.447
&gt;&gt; I GUESS --
Chris: RANDY.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.583
&gt;&gt; AT THE RITZ CARLTON IN THE
NUTCRACKER SUITE.

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.285
COME ON.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.052
&gt;&gt; Chris: WELL DONE.

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:01.755
THINK ABOUT IT, RANDY.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:06.460
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.561
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.797
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY DESERVES A LITTLE
EXTRA --

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.067
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE ALLOWED
TO TAKE VICTORY LAPS.

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:14.835
I DID NOT.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.204
&gt;&gt; I WAS TOLD TO STAND HERE.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:21.008
Chris: I MEAN AFTER A COMEDY
TOUCHDOWN LIKE THAT IT'S OKAY.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:22.042
&gt;&gt; FAIR ENOUGH.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.179
&gt;&gt; AFTER THIS I'M GOING TO DO
THE WORM.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:26.380
&gt;&gt; Chris: OH MY GOSH.

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:28.448
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THE WORM?

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:31.485
&gt;&gt; OH, BOTH DIRECTIONS.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:34.621
Chris: CHRIS FAIRBANKS I WILL
GIVE YOU TWO HUNDRED POINTS IF

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.123
DO YOU THE WORM.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.157
&gt;&gt; GET DOWN.

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:38.058
DO IT.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:44.164
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; OH MY GOD.

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:44.865
YES!

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:45.465
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:51.238
YES.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:03:01.215
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; GO, GO, GO.

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:02.416
&gt;&gt; RANDY IF IT'S ANY
CONSOLATION I THINK I BLEW OUT

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.787
BOTH KNEES.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.993
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: NEXT UP, IT'S OL'
SAINT DICK.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:20.334
(YELLING AND LAUGHING)
&gt;&gt; Chris: I REALLY HOPE THAT'S

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.069
NOT THAT GUY'S FAMILY.

00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:27.207
WHAT DID YOU SEE SANTA DO TO
MOMMY UNDER THE MISTLETOE LAST

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:27.908
NIGHT.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.709
RANDY.

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:31.411
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THIS.

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:35.449
SANTA DOESN'T GO DOWN THE
CHIMNEY HE COMES IN THE BACK

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:36.583
DOOR.

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:37.084
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:39.553
&gt;&gt; YEP.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:40.187
Chris: APRIL.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.356
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE SANTA CLAUS TWO.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.562
THAT'S WHEN YOUR MOM GETS DOUBLE
TEAMED BY SANTA AND TIM ALLEN.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.398
&gt;&gt; UUUUGH!

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.168
&gt;&gt; UUUUGH!
