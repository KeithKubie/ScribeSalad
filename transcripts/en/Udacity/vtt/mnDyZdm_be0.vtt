00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is what energy does or I should say doesn't do--it never ever changes.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The total amount of energy in the universe stays the same.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Energy is what we call in physics--a conserved quantity.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I told you before that I don't know what energy is and I don't need to.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I know that there is a certain number that if I calculate it once--let nature do its thing

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then calculate it again, I will have the exact same number.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is an amazing fact and one that gives us incredible predictive power.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If I could calculate the total energy in the universe today--something that I probably couldn't do--

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
how much energy would there be tomorrow--more, less or the same.
