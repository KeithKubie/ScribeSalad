to download the game do it by clicking

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050
to download the game do it by clicking
 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.340
to download the game do it by clicking
on the link so they can be tracked

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350
on the link so they can be tracked
 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.780
on the link so they can be tracked
however we all know that this is not the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790
however we all know that this is not the
 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.390
however we all know that this is not the
case some of the users who watch the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
case some of the users who watch the
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.670
case some of the users who watch the
video and still download the game do it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680
video and still download the game do it
 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.130
video and still download the game do it
without clicking on the link and so it's

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140
without clicking on the link and so it's
 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.620
without clicking on the link and so it's
really hard to understand what is the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630
really hard to understand what is the
 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.720
really hard to understand what is the
value and what is the size of this non

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730
value and what is the size of this non
 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.199
value and what is the size of this non
tract majority and so the classical ways

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209
tract majority and so the classical ways
 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.479
tract majority and so the classical ways
that developers use nowadays to do that

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489
that developers use nowadays to do that
 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.820
that developers use nowadays to do that
is to look at the performance of the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830
is to look at the performance of the
 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.190
is to look at the performance of the
video look at how many people click on

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.680
you would usually look at your install
numbers over time and try to estimate

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690
numbers over time and try to estimate
 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.050
numbers over time and try to estimate
how many of these users that you see in

on the store and hopefully install in
 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.240
on the store and hopefully install in
the game and so with this methodology we

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250
the game and so with this methodology we
 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.550
the game and so with this methodology we
have been able to see out of the cohorts

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560
have been able to see out of the cohorts
 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.470
have been able to see out of the cohorts
of users who have been exposed to

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480

users after viewership went into the

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890
users after viewership went into the
 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.540

then we want to go one step further and

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800
then we want to go one step further and
 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.740
then we want to go one step further and
try to understand what is the value of

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750
try to understand what is the value of
 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.080
try to understand what is the value of
these users so we also checked how many

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090
these users so we also checked how many
 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.330
these users so we also checked how many
of them turned into buyer and if they do

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340
of them turned into buyer and if they do
 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.640
of them turned into buyer and if they do
how much they spend over time after

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650
how much they spend over time after
 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.510
how much they spend over time after
viewing the video and so then we use

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520
viewing the video and so then we use
 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.580
viewing the video and so then we use
this methodology to analyze a pool of

that means that next time that you do an
 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.210

without clicking and by the way 4x is
 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.540
without clicking and by the way 4x is
just an average this multiplier can be

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550
just an average this multiplier can be
 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.210
just an average this multiplier can be
as high as 10x depending on the type of

up question that we had after that after
understanding how big is this non-drug

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.380
understanding how big is this non-drug
 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.430
understanding how big is this non-drug
majority is how does the distribution of

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440
majority is how does the distribution of
 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.980
majority is how does the distribution of
the install look like over time do they

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990
the install look like over time do they
 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.780
the install look like over time do they
come all at the same time do they come

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:48.790
come all at the same time do they come
 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.630
come all at the same time do they come
after a few hours after few days and so

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:51.640
after a few hours after few days and so
 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.260
after a few hours after few days and so
on and so what we saw is that on average

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.270
on and so what we saw is that on average
 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.740
on and so what we saw is that on average

well this is something you can do but we

00:11:37.199 --> 00:11:37.209
well this is something you can do but we
 

00:11:37.209 --> 00:11:39.509
well this is something you can do but we
also saw an effect you might want to be

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519
also saw an effect you might want to be
 

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:41.939
also saw an effect you might want to be
aware of and this is something what we

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:41.949
aware of and this is something what we
 

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:45.089
aware of and this is something what we
call download fatigue because if you

00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:45.099
call download fatigue because if you
 

00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:47.459
call download fatigue because if you
work with the same creator again within

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:47.469
work with the same creator again within
 

00:11:47.469 --> 00:11:50.039
work with the same creator again within
the time period of a year the second

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:50.049
the time period of a year the second
