Let's actually use the framework on a real website.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560
Here's a mock up for a portfolio site that you can use.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.280
There's a link in the instructor notes.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.570
Think about what you learned last lesson about approaching the process of

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.810
going from design to an actual website.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.740
But instead of creating new classes and styles from scratch,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.490
you should use the classes that your new framework supports.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.660
I've gone ahead and drawn some boxes around different elements in the mock up.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.110
These boxes correspond with the rows and columns from the framework.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.540
Which classes correspond with the boxes in the mock up?

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.509
Which class would you use for the red box at the top, the blue box at the top,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.650
the red box at the bottom, and the blue box at the bottom?

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.650
