00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.830
another favorite squared square well is

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
another favorite squared square well is
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.889
another favorite squared square well is
this one I face favorite because this

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899
this one I face favorite because this
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.939
this one I face favorite because this
one was actually found before the

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:10.949
one was actually found before the
 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:12.949
one was actually found before the
Trinity students found theirs they were

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959
Trinity students found theirs they were
 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.340
Trinity students found theirs they were
scooped they was just before them and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
scooped they was just before them and
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.200
scooped they was just before them and
the and this was published first last so

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
the and this was published first last so
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.510
the and this was published first last so
disappointing so if I'm being technical

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
disappointing so if I'm being technical
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.260
disappointing so if I'm being technical
this was the first squared squared found

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270
this was the first squared squared found
 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.950
this was the first squared squared found
but there's no theory behind it this is

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
but there's no theory behind it this is
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200
but there's no theory behind it this is
some point it was some fluke Yahweh's

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
some point it was some fluke Yahweh's
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.020
some point it was some fluke Yahweh's
made it's made out of squared rectangles

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
made it's made out of squared rectangles
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.420
made it's made out of squared rectangles
actually those previous squared

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
actually those previous squared
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.460
actually those previous squared
rectangles that been found there's

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470
rectangles that been found there's
 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.440
rectangles that been found there's
copies of those in there he's put them

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
copies of those in there he's put them
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.760
copies of those in there he's put them
together and scaled them up and scale

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
together and scaled them up and scale
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.300
together and scaled them up and scale
them down

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310
them down
 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.310
them down
there's no Maps in that it didn't help

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
there's no Maps in that it didn't help
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.960
there's no Maps in that it didn't help
you find more telling no theory about it

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970
you find more telling no theory about it
 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.910
you find more telling no theory about it
but it was the first it's that is so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
but it was the first it's that is so
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.590
but it was the first it's that is so
annoying as well here's one more square

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
annoying as well here's one more square
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.049
annoying as well here's one more square
and this this one I like because it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
and this this one I like because it's
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.709
and this this one I like because it's
more aesthetically pleasing notice the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
more aesthetically pleasing notice the
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470
more aesthetically pleasing notice the
squares are more round about the same

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
squares are more round about the same
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.510
squares are more round about the same
size so instead of having a squared

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
size so instead of having a squared
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.340
size so instead of having a squared
square where you have one tiny square

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
square where you have one tiny square
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.039
square where you have one tiny square
one massive square with a lot of them

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
one massive square with a lot of them
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.379
one massive square with a lot of them
seem to look like that this one's more

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:09.389
seem to look like that this one's more
 

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:12.410
seem to look like that this one's more
balanced the squares are round about the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
balanced the squares are round about the
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.449
balanced the squares are round about the
same size if you take the ratio of the

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.459
same size if you take the ratio of the
 

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.660
same size if you take the ratio of the
biggest to the smallest this has the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
biggest to the smallest this has the
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.510
biggest to the smallest this has the
kindest ratio right this is the more

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
kindest ratio right this is the more
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.480
kindest ratio right this is the more
favorable ratio because I don't know sir

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
favorable ratio because I don't know sir
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999
favorable ratio because I don't know sir
maybe it's got a nice square square it's

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
maybe it's got a nice square square it's
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.879
maybe it's got a nice square square it's
the smallest ratio between the biggest -

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:28.889
the smallest ratio between the biggest -
 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.279
the smallest ratio between the biggest -
like James and I squared yeah I like to

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289
like James and I squared yeah I like to
 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.879
like James and I squared yeah I like to
think so

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:31.889
think so
 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:33.739
think so
one thing is tempting to do with these

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749
one thing is tempting to do with these
 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.149
one thing is tempting to do with these
squared squares is turn them into

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
squared squares is turn them into
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830
squared squares is turn them into
puzzles because you can cut them up and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
puzzles because you can cut them up and
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539
puzzles because you can cut them up and
then say can you make them into a square

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
then say can you make them into a square
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.039
then say can you make them into a square
or something like that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
or something like that
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.199
or something like that
this is actually a rectangle it's a

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209
this is actually a rectangle it's a
 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.989
this is actually a rectangle it's a
rectangle that I've made out of the

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999
rectangle that I've made out of the
 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:47.839
rectangle that I've made out of the
smaller squares I must find the complete

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849
smaller squares I must find the complete
 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.230
smaller squares I must find the complete
set I think some of the smaller ones are

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
set I think some of the smaller ones are
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.319
set I think some of the smaller ones are
still in here having this be 100 there

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
still in here having this be 100 there
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.169
still in here having this be 100 there
you go so it's like a jigsaw I can you

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179
you go so it's like a jigsaw I can you
 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.300
you go so it's like a jigsaw I can you
put these together like a jigsaw and so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
put these together like a jigsaw and so
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.519
put these together like a jigsaw and so
that's what one of the Trinity students

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:01.529
that's what one of the Trinity students
 

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:02.870
that's what one of the Trinity students
did he actually this is the one he

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
did he actually this is the one he
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.459
did he actually this is the one he
turned into a puzzle and he gave it to

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469
turned into a puzzle and he gave it to
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.800
turned into a puzzle and he gave it to
his mom and he said well I know what the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
his mom and he said well I know what the
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.200
his mom and he said well I know what the
solution is but can you find it and so

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210
solution is but can you find it and so
 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.240
solution is but can you find it and so
she tried to find a solution and it

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
she tried to find a solution and it
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.030
she tried to find a solution and it
turned out that she found a different

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
turned out that she found a different
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.690
turned out that she found a different
solution

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
solution
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.030
solution
using the same squares no so there are

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
using the same squares no so there are
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.420
using the same squares no so there are
two ways to use the same squares to make

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
two ways to use the same squares to make
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.880
two ways to use the same squares to make
the rectangle of the same dimension as

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
the rectangle of the same dimension as
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.280
the rectangle of the same dimension as
well for the same dimension and a star

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290
well for the same dimension and a star
 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.910
well for the same dimension and a star
nice nice those --sold item s so they

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920
nice nice those --sold item s so they
 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.400
nice nice those --sold item s so they
are two rectangles the same dimension

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
are two rectangles the same dimension
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.900
are two rectangles the same dimension
using the same squares but in a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
using the same squares but in a
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.229
using the same squares but in a
different order okay I'm going to say it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239
different order okay I'm going to say it
 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.370
different order okay I'm going to say it
this was built uh CH training in maps

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380
this was built uh CH training in maps
 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.009
this was built uh CH training in maps
built at was given problems at Bletchley

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019
built at was given problems at Bletchley
 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.780

Park because they knew he liked puzzles

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790
Park because they knew he liked puzzles
 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.809
Park because they knew he liked puzzles
he knew he was a kind of a guy who liked

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819
he knew he was a kind of a guy who liked
 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.420
he knew he was a kind of a guy who liked
to do a problem a puzzle and he gave him

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
to do a problem a puzzle and he gave him
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.059
to do a problem a puzzle and he gave him
problems that they thought can be solved

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069
problems that they thought can be solved
 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.430
problems that they thought can be solved
and I thought we've given up on this so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
and I thought we've given up on this so
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.699
and I thought we've given up on this so
he's oh yeah you go and do it and so he

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
he's oh yeah you go and do it and so he
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.430
he's oh yeah you go and do it and so he
worked away and people were kind of

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
worked away and people were kind of
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.930
worked away and people were kind of
looking over going is he actually doing

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940
looking over going is he actually doing
 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.370
looking over going is he actually doing
anything because he doesn't seem to be

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380
anything because he doesn't seem to be
 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.490
anything because he doesn't seem to be
doing anything but he was and he sold

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
doing anything but he was and he sold
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.070
doing anything but he was and he sold
these massively important problems that

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
these massively important problems that
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.449
these massively important problems that
helped us break codes in World War two

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459
helped us break codes in World War two
 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.430
helped us break codes in World War two
he was doing that yeah and you can

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440
he was doing that yeah and you can
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.170
he was doing that yeah and you can
randomly choose any of these things you

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
randomly choose any of these things you
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.940
randomly choose any of these things you
have to have a quick look at it oh my

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
have to have a quick look at it oh my
 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.710
have to have a quick look at it oh my
goodness this is his original book or

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720
goodness this is his original book or
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.569
goodness this is his original book or

so if you just open that up this is like

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
so if you just open that up this is like
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.340
so if you just open that up this is like
mathematics Christmas morning I think I

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350
mathematics Christmas morning I think I
 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.349
mathematics Christmas morning I think I
think if the Royal Society was on fire

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359
think if the Royal Society was on fire
 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.050
think if the Royal Society was on fire
which I hope never happens this would be

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060
which I hope never happens this would be
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.170
which I hope never happens this would be
one of the things I would grab
