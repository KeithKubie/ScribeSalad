00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.540
So we're multiplying
matrix A here by vector w.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.630
And they ask us
what is A times w?

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.720
So let me get my
scratch pad out.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.620
And let's think about this.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.640
So we have matrix
A times vector w.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.290
So just as a reminder,
Aw-- and I'll

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.313
write it in bold
right over here-- Aw.

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:26.310
And I could write it either
as a vector like that,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.700
or I could bold that as well.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.350
Aw.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.369
It's lowercase for a vector,
uppercase for a matrix.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.610
This is the same thing
as matrix A times vector

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.590
w-- let me do that same color--
which is the same thing.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.760
This is matrix A. So it's,
A is 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2 times

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.555
vector w.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:03.330
W is the vector 3, 4, 3.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.700
So we have a matrix with
two rows and three columns,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.570
so it is a 2 by 3
matrix, times a vector.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.210
And this is a column vector.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240
It is three rows in one column.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.707
So you could view this
as a 3 by 1 matrix.

00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:23.040
And so, deciding whether this
is even a valid operation,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.706
it's just like
multiplying two matrices.

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:28.290
You can view this column vector
is really just a 3 by 1 matrix.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.510
And the only way that matrix
multiplication is defined

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.850
is if the columns
in this matrix is

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.130
equal to the rows
in this matrix.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.580
And we see that is
the case, this vector.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.540
This matrix, matrix A, has
three columns: 1, 2, 3.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.140
And this and vector w
has exactly three rows.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.020
So matrix multiplication,
or matrix times

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.817
vector multiplication,
is defined here.

00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:57.400
And the way that
we're going to do it,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.760
we're going to end
up with a 2 by 1.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.210
You could call it
a 2 by 1 matrix.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.600
It's going to have two
rows in one column.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.955
Or you could view it as
a column vector, when

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:13.561
you have two rows
and one column.

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:15.060
But either way,
let's actually think

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.680
about how we would compute it.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.314
So it's going to have
two rows and one column.

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:20.730
Then I'm going
give a lot of space

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.630
so that we can actually
do the calculation.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.380
So the top entry
right over here,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.930
we're going to get
the row information

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.302
from our first matrix, and
then the column information.

00:02:34.302 --> 00:02:35.510
There's only one column here.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.010
But we're going to get that
from this matrix or this vector,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.580
whatever you want to call it.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:48.190
So we're going to have 0 times
3, plus 3 times 4, plus 5 times

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.880
3.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.940
Now the second entry
right over here

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.330
is going to be the
second row here.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.000
Essentially, the dot product
of that with this vector.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.220
And if you don't know
what the dot product is,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.595
I'm essentially
about to do that.

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:05.240
It's going to be-- you take
each corresponding term,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.800
take their product, and then
add up everything together.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:17.420
So you have 5 times 3, plus
5 times 4, plus 2 times 3.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.050
And this is going to
simplify to-- This top term,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.200
this is a 0.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.080
This is 12 plus 15, which is 27.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.310
And then the second term,
this is 15 plus 20 plus 6.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.260
So this is 35 plus 6 is 41.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.500
So it's a column vector,
two rows, 27 and 41.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.220
Now let's input that, 27 and 41.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.020
So we get 27.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.250
And here we can put 41,
and check our answer,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.220
and we got it right.
