00:00:00.673 --> 00:00:03.924
In the last couple of videos we talked about reflection.

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:08.600
And that's just the idea of the light rays bouncing off of a surface.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:17.067
And if the surface is smooth, the incident angle is going to be the same thing as the reflected angle.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:21.266
We saw that before, and those angles are measured relative to a perpendicular.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.953
So that angle right there is going to be the same as that angle right there.

00:00:24.953 --> 00:00:27.041
That's essentially what we learned the last couple of videos.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.002
What we want to cover in this video is

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.645
when the light actually doesn't just bounce off of a surface

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:34.629
but starts going through a different medium.

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:39.390
So in this situation, we will be dealing with refraction.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:46.321
Refraction. Refraction, you still have the light coming in to the interface between the two surfaces.

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:50.059
So let's say--so that's the perpendicular right there,

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:53.392
actually let me continue the perpendicular all the way down like that.

00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:59.613
And let's say we have the incident light ray coming in at some, at some angle theta 1,

00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:04.182
just like that...what will happen--and so let's say that this up here, this is a vacuum.

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:06.777
Light travels the fastest in a vacuum.

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:12.054
In a vacuum. There's nothing there, no air, no water, no nothing, that's where the light travels the fastest.

00:01:12.054 --> 00:01:17.438
And let's say that this medium down here, I don't know, let's say it's water.

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:19.452
Let's say that this is water.

00:01:19.623 --> 00:01:22.618
All of this. This was all water over here.

00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:25.905
This was all vacuum right up here.

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:30.921
So what will happen, and actually, that's kind of an unrealistic--

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:34.408
well, just for the sake of argument, let's say we have water going right up against a vacuum.

00:01:34.408 --> 00:01:38.725
This isn't something you would normally just see in nature

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.931
but let's just think about it a little bit.

00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:44.515
Normally, the water, since there's no pressure, it would evaporate and all the rest.

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:48.813
But for the sake of argument, let's just say that this is a medium where light will travel slower.

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:51.464
What you're going to have is

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:55.587
is this ray is actually going to switch direction, it's actually going to bend.

00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:59.315
Instead of continuing to go in that same direction, it's going to bend a little bit.

00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:02.875
It's going to go down, in that direction

00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:06.623
just like that. And this angle right here, theta 2,

00:02:06.623 --> 00:02:15.838
is the refraction. That's the refraction angle. Refraction angle.

00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:20.171
Or angle of refraction. This is the incident angle, or angle of incidence,

00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:24.854
and this is the refraction angle. Once again, against that perpendicular.

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:28.100
And before I give you the actual equation of how these two things relate

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.490
and how they're related to the speed of light in these two media--

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.038
and just remember, once again, you're never going to have vacuum against water,

00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:37.546
the water would evaporate because there's no pressure on it and all of that type of thing.

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:41.008
But just to--before I go into the math of actually how to figure out these angles

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.992
relative to the velocities of light in the different media

00:02:44.992 --> 00:02:47.202
I want to give you an intuitive understanding of

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:50.264
not why it bends, 'cause I'm not telling you actually how light works

00:02:50.264 --> 00:02:51.967
this is really more of an observed property

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:54.500
and light, as we'll learn, as we do more and more videos about it,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.723
can get pretty confusing.

00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:59.002
Sometimes you want to treat it as a ray, sometimes you want to treat it as a wave,

00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:01.238
sometimes you want to treat it as a photon.

00:03:01.238 --> 00:03:02.802
But when you think about refraction

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:05.854
I actually like to think of it as kind of a, as a bit of a vehicle,

00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:10.879
and to imagine that, let's imagine that I had a car.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.223
So let me draw a car. So we're looking at the top of a car.

00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:17.864
So this is the passenger compartment, and it has four wheels on the car.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.659
We're looking at it from above.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.171
And let's say it's traveling on a road.

00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.479
It's traveling on a road. On a road, the tires can get good traction.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:30.090
The car can move pretty efficiently, and it's about to reach an interface

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.454
it's about to reach an interface where the road ends and it will have to travel

00:03:35.454 --> 00:03:41.469
on mud. It will have to travel on mud. Now on mud, obviously, the tires' traction

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.171
will not be as good. The car will not be able to travel as fast. So what's going to happen?

00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:49.469
Assuming that the car, the steering wheel isn't telling it to turn or anything,

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.515
the car would just go straight in this direction.

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:56.413
But what happens right when--which wheels are going to reach

00:03:56.413 --> 00:04:01.541
the mud first? Well, this wheel. This wheel is going to reach the mud first.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:04.490
So what's going to happen? There's going to be some point in time

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.664
where the car is right over here. Where it's right over here.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.771
Where these wheels are still on the road, this wheel is in the mud,

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:13.152
and that wheel is about to reach the mud.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:15.767
Now in this situation, what would the car do?

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:20.633
What would the car do? And assuming the engine is revving and the wheels are turning,

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:29.377
at the exact same speed the entire time of the simulation.

00:04:29.377 --> 00:04:34.725
Well all of a sudden, as soon as this wheel hits the medium, it's going to slow down.

00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:37.767
This is going to slow down. But these guys are still on the road.

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:39.952
So they're still going to be faster.

00:04:39.952 --> 00:04:43.782
So the right side of the car is going to move faster than the left side of the car.

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:46.013
So what's going to happen?

00:04:46.013 --> 00:04:49.956
You see this all the time. If the right side of you is moving faster than the left side of you,

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.229
you're going to turn, and that's exactly what's going to happen to the car.

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.787
The car is going to turn. It's going to turn in that direction.

00:04:56.787 --> 00:05:02.433
And so once it gets to the medium, it will now travel, it will now turn--

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:05.362
from the point of the view from the car it's turning to the right.

00:05:05.362 --> 00:05:09.664
But it will now travel in this direction. It will be turned when it gets to that interface.

00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:13.125
Now obviously light doesn't have wheels, and it doesn't deal with mud.

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:17.295
But it's the same general idea. When I'm traveling from a faster medium

00:05:17.295 --> 00:05:21.721
to a slower medium, you can kind of imagine the wheels on that light

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:26.356
on this side of it, closer to the vertical, hit the medium first, slow down,

00:05:26.356 --> 00:05:27.752
so light turns to the right.

00:05:27.752 --> 00:05:35.362
If you were going the other way, if I had light coming out of the slow medium,

00:05:35.362 --> 00:05:39.202
so let's imagine it this way. Let's have light coming out of the slow medium.

00:05:39.202 --> 00:05:47.510
And if we use the car analogy, in this situation, the left side of the car is going to--

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.782
so if the car is right over here, the left side of the car is going to come out first

00:05:51.782 --> 00:05:58.854
so it's going to move faster now. So the car is going to turn to the right, just like that.

00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:04.136
So hopefully, hopefully this gives you a gut sense of just how to figure out which direction

00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:06.762
the light's going to bend if you just wanted an intuitive sense.

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:11.229
And to get to the next level, there's actually something called Snell's Law.

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.454
Snell's Law.

00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:21.423
Snell's Law. And all this is saying is that this angle--

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:26.264
so let me write it down here--so let's say that this velocity right here is velocity 2

00:06:26.264 --> 00:06:29.264
this velocity up here was velocity 1, going back to the original.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:33.162
Actually, let me draw another diagram, just to clean it up.

00:06:33.162 --> 00:06:36.925
And also that vacuum-water interface example, I'm not enjoying it,

00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:40.679
just because it's a very unnatural interface to actually have in nature.

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:44.767
So maybe it's vacuum and glass. That's something that actually would exist.

00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:51.156
So let's say we're doing that. So this isn't water, this is glass. Let me redraw it.

00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:53.364
And I'll draw the angles bigger.

00:06:53.364 --> 00:06:57.125
So let me draw a perpendicular.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:00.377
And so I have our incident ray,

00:07:00.377 --> 00:07:04.531
so in the vacuum

00:07:04.531 --> 00:07:06.869
it's traveling at v1--and in the case of a vacuum,

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:09.854
it's actually going at the speed of light, or the speed of light in a vacuum,

00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:13.757
which is c, or 300,000 kilometers per second,

00:07:13.757 --> 00:07:18.536
or 300 million meters per second--let me write that--

00:07:18.536 --> 00:07:21.725
so c is the speed of light in a vacuum,

00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:24.762
and that is equal to 300--

00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:27.008
it's not exactly 300, I'm not going into significant digits--

00:07:27.008 --> 00:07:31.685
this is true to three significant digits--300 million meters per second.

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:34.731
This is light in a vacuum.

00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:39.500
Light in vacuum. And I don't mean the thing that you use to clean your carpet with,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.464
I mean an area of space that has nothing in it.

00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:45.952
No air, no gas, no molecules, nothing in it. That is a pure vacuum

00:07:45.952 --> 00:07:47.962
and that's how fast light will travel.

00:07:47.962 --> 00:07:52.715
Now it's travelling really fast there, and let's say that--and this applies to any two mediums--

00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:57.577
but let's say it gets to glass here, and in glass it travels slower,

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:00.875
and we know for our example, this side of the car

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:02.300
is going to get to the slower medium first

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.705
so it's going to turn in this direction.

00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:07.177
So it's going to go like this.

00:08:07.177 --> 00:08:09.264
We call this v2.

00:08:09.264 --> 00:08:11.029
Maybe I'll draw it--if you wanted to view these as

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:13.762
vectors, maybe I should draw it as a smaller vector

00:08:13.762 --> 00:08:15.679
v2, just like that.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:19.685
And the angle of incidence is theta 1.

00:08:19.685 --> 00:08:23.952
And the angle of refraction is theta 2.

00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:27.479
And Snell's Law just tells us

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:31.900
the ratio between v2 and the sin--

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.382
remember Soh Cah Toa, basic trig function--

00:08:34.382 --> 00:08:37.859
and the sin of the angle of refraction

00:08:37.859 --> 00:08:45.331
is going to be equal to the ratio of v1 and

00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:49.054
the angle--the sin of the angle of incidence.

00:08:49.054 --> 00:08:50.936
Sin of theta 1.

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:52.377
Now if this looks confusing at all, we're going to

00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:54.971
apply it a bunch in the next couple of videos.

00:08:54.971 --> 00:08:55.895
But I want to show you also that

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:58.613
there's many many ways to view Snell's Law.

00:08:58.613 --> 00:09:01.562
You may or may not be familiar with the idea of

00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:03.746
an index of refraction.

00:09:03.746 --> 00:09:05.398
So let me write that down.

00:09:05.398 --> 00:09:08.115
Index of refraction.

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:11.398
Index, or refraction index.

00:09:11.398 --> 00:09:14.771
And it's defined for any medium, for any material.

00:09:14.771 --> 00:09:17.438
There's an index of refraction for vacuum, for air,

00:09:17.438 --> 00:09:19.095
for water.

00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:21.233
For any material that people have measured it for.

00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:24.685
And they usually specify it as n.

00:09:24.685 --> 00:09:28.721
And it is defined as the speed of light in a vacuum

00:09:28.721 --> 00:09:36.377
That's c. Divided by the velocity of light in that medium.

00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:40.315
So in our example right here, we could rewrite this.

00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:43.131
We could rewrite this in terms of index of refraction.

00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:45.167
Let me do that actually. Just cause that's sometimes

00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:47.254
the more typical way of viewing Snell's Law.

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:51.956
So I could solve for v here if I--one thing I could do

00:09:51.956 --> 00:09:54.910
is just--if n is equal to c divided by v

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.392
then v is going to be equal to c divided by n.

00:09:58.392 --> 00:10:01.208
And I can multiply both sides by v

00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:02.492
if you don't see how I got there.

00:10:02.492 --> 00:10:05.423
The intermediary step is, multiply both sides times v,

00:10:05.423 --> 00:10:08.562
you get v times n is equal to c, and then

00:10:08.562 --> 00:10:10.046
you divide both sides by n, you get

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:12.038
v is equal to c over n.

00:10:12.038 --> 00:10:16.521
So I can rewrite Snell's Law over here as

00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:21.552
instead of having v2 there, I could write

00:10:21.552 --> 00:10:23.244
instead of writing v2 there I could write

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:28.382
the speed of light divided by the refraction index

00:10:28.382 --> 00:10:30.100
for this material right here.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.946
So I'll call that n2.

00:10:31.946 --> 00:10:36.336
Right, this is material 2, material 2 right over there.

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:37.359
Right, that's the same thing as

00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:44.792
v2 over the sin of theta 2

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:52.582
is equal to v1 is the same thing as c divided by n1

00:10:52.582 --> 00:10:58.085
over sin of theta 1. And then we could do a little bit

00:10:58.085 --> 00:11:01.238
of simplification here, we can multiple both sides of

00:11:01.238 --> 00:11:04.156
this equation--well, let's do a couple of things. Let's--

00:11:04.156 --> 00:11:06.418
Actually, the simplest thing to do is actually

00:11:06.418 --> 00:11:08.543
take the reciprocal of both sides.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:09.797
So let me just do that.

00:11:09.797 --> 00:11:11.013
So let me take the reciprocal of both sides,

00:11:11.013 --> 00:11:21.500
and you get sin of theta 2 over cn2 is equal to

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:30.054
sin of theta 1 over c over n1.

00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:31.492
And now let's multiply the numerator and

00:11:31.492 --> 00:11:34.623
denominator of this left side by n2.

00:11:34.623 --> 00:11:37.362
So if we multiply n2 over n2.

00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:38.077
We're not changing it,

00:11:38.077 --> 00:11:40.002
this is really just going to be 1,

00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:41.838
but this guy and this guy are going to cancel out.

00:11:41.838 --> 00:11:43.031
And let's do the same thing over here,

00:11:43.031 --> 00:11:44.438
multiply the numerator and the denominator

00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:48.156
by n1, so n1 over n1.

00:11:48.156 --> 00:11:50.136
That guy, that guy, and that guy

00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:51.531
are going to cancel out.

00:11:51.531 --> 00:12:01.664
And so we get n2 sin of theta 2 over c is equal to

00:12:01.664 --> 00:12:06.700
n1 sin of theta 1 over c.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.967
And now we can just multiply both sides

00:12:07.967 --> 00:12:10.982
of this equation by c and we get the form of

00:12:10.982 --> 00:12:13.971
Snell's Law that some books will show you,

00:12:13.971 --> 00:12:16.736
which is the refraction index for the slower medium,

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.869
or for the second medium, the one that we're entering,

00:12:18.869 --> 00:12:23.269
times the index of the sin of the index of refraction

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:24.941
is equal to

00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:27.279
the refraction index for the first medium

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.956
times the sin of the angle of incidence.

00:12:31.956 --> 00:12:34.079
The incident angle.

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:36.295
So this is another version right here

00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:38.440
This is another version right there of Snell's Law.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.956
Let me copy and paste that.

00:12:39.956 --> 00:12:41.613
And if this is confusing to you,

00:12:41.613 --> 00:12:43.267
and I'm guessing that it might be,

00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:45.254
especially if this is the first time you're seeing it,

00:12:45.254 --> 00:12:47.046
we're going to apply this in a bunch of videos,

00:12:47.046 --> 00:12:49.931
in the next few videos, but I really just want to make sure,

00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:51.479
I really just want to make sure you're comfortable with it.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:55.085
So these are both equivalent forms of Snell's Law.

00:12:55.085 --> 00:12:58.121
One deals with the velocities, directly deals with

00:12:58.121 --> 00:12:59.469
the velocities, right over here,

00:12:59.469 --> 00:13:02.705
the ratio of the velocity to the sin of the incident

00:13:02.705 --> 00:13:03.836
or refraction angle

00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:07.095
and here it uses the index of refraction.

00:13:07.095 --> 00:13:09.941
And the index of refraction really just tells you

00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:13.515
it's just the ratio of the speed of light to the actual velocity.

00:13:13.515 --> 00:13:16.833
So something where light travels really slowly

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:18.556
where light travels really slowly,

00:13:18.556 --> 00:13:21.618
this will be a smaller number.

00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:22.610
And if this is a smaller number,

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.971
this is a larger number.

00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:25.038
And we actually see it here.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:27.500
And you're going to see a little tidbit of the next video

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.323
right over here.

00:13:29.323 --> 00:13:33.402
But here's a bunch of refraction indices

00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:34.548
for different materials.

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:38.202
It's obviously 1 for a vacuum, because for a vacuum

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.238
you have the refraction index is going to be c

00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:43.033
divided by the speed of light in that material.

00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:45.756
Well, in a vacuum it's traveling at c.

00:13:45.756 --> 00:13:47.387
So it's going to be 1.

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:50.121
So that's where that came from. And you can see in air,

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.971
the speed is only slightly smaller,

00:13:52.971 --> 00:13:54.998
this number's only going to be slightly smaller

00:13:54.998 --> 00:13:56.556
than the speed of light in a vacuum.

00:13:56.556 --> 00:13:59.315
So in air, it's still pretty close to a vacuum.

00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:03.382
But then for a diamond, it's traveling a lot slower.

00:14:03.382 --> 00:14:05.146
Light is travelling a lot slower in a diamond

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:08.023
than it is in a vacuum.

00:14:08.023 --> 00:14:08.646
Anyway, I'll leave you there,

00:14:08.646 --> 00:14:10.408
we're going to do a couple more videos,

00:14:10.408 --> 00:14:12.582
we're going to do more examples using Snell's Law.

00:14:12.582 --> 00:14:14.990
Hopefully you got the basic idea of refraction.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.459
And in the next video, I'll actually use this graphic right here to help us visualize

00:14:19.459 --> 99:59:59.999
why it looks like the straw got bent.
