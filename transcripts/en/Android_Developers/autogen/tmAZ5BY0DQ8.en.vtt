00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.220
 ah 

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.900
 it works 

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:15.660
 Hi first time here on hand not only for 

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:36.450
 children but the first games of 

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:38.220
 law, personal message also comes 

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.080
 Good night to everyone, everyone is starting. 

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.610
 to convey that android developer 

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.890
 relations brazil that directly 

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.650
 google's office in sao paulo 

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.030
 this time our legal effects 

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.920
 sound that I'm using for the first time. 

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:55.680
 I'm having fun then I'll have it 

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:57.510
 that I put up with it, I'm trying and 

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.210
 alternative time to see if it is 

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:01.980
 more convenient for people because 

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:03.540
 there were many comments that on 7 

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.700
 seven at night how are you doing before 

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.250
 A lot of people are in transit but a lot 

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.690
 people are stuck on the marginal 

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.710
 Other girls from São Paulo stay like this 

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.460
 ends up not being able to participate 

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.350
 renault 

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.060
 so I'm trying experimentally 

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:18.120
 make a late check-in right? 

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.950
 It's a good thing, it's cool, I just 

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:30.930
 arrive at the office countries that hit 

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:32.760
 A few odd hours there. 

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:39.840
 You look at the clock. Mourning says I confused. 

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:41.370
 to mpm again then it's always good 

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.290
 Let's start, then we have some. 

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.690
 questions of what have been done so 

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.760
 and I want to talk about a 

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.880
 novelty that appeared recently in the 

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.810
 duel against andrade dotcom that is well 

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.970
 cool for those who are developing 

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.100
 and who are and are looking for 

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:58.590
 a series of criteria to protest 

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.660
 Ram application quality is clear 

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.460
 I tried our design guide that 

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.960
 through which you can know if you 

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.420
 is following the new design pattern of the 

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.310
 android but what was missing was 

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.559
 a series of tests in a series of 

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.079
 items for you to check 

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:15.179
 publishing the application is for you to have 

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.499
 sure that you are all with the 

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:18.480
 quality goal 

00:17:16.499 --> 00:17:19.889
 obviously this lesson of the image is not only 

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.629
 follow all the items that magically 

00:17:19.889 --> 00:17:23.909
 you will have a good app but she 

00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:25.289
 It sure serves as a guide lets me 

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:26.759
 see if you can share my screen 

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:29.999
 Here to show you where it is. 

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:32.879
 This has worked out, you should be seeing 

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:36.299
 here a developers 12 point screen with 

00:17:32.879 --> 00:17:38.580
 so here is the website when you arrive 

00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:40.379
 click Distributed 

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.960
 this last item went to 

00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:45.090
 record and then this is a new function 

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.009
 who just talks about some points 

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.269
 important in relation to the quality of 

00:17:47.009 --> 00:17:50.879
 applications 

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:53.340
 is then tech 3 subsections one of them calls 

00:17:50.879 --> 00:17:54.990
 corep collor and what are the gas lines 

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.490
 for the quality of the applications is 

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.259
 general terms, ie any type of 

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.929
 application is established by 

00:17:58.259 --> 00:18:03.210
 while type then it has since design 

00:18:00.929 --> 00:18:05.070
 visual interaction with the user it passes 

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.399
 for various things like for example 

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.450
 by functionality and goes through 

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:11.789
 stability performance 

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.470
 each and every one of the sessions 

00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:15.690
 have a series of tests in which 

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.090
 small phrases are tests that 

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.190
 you can do to determine if the 

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.960
 application is following the 

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.840
 criterion then especially if you are 

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.490
 developer is displayed when this can 

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.470
 be useful but especially useful if you 

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.139
 there is a company for example you want 

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.610
 a systematic way is from Tuesday to 

00:18:31.139 --> 00:18:34.320
 application quality then it would 

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.269
 interesting for example in the process of 

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.460
 analysis of you have there you you 

00:18:36.269 --> 00:18:41.159
 incorporate into all or some of these 

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.080
 tests they come up with 1 and 10 

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:46.019
 conveniently thought out 

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.480
 is finally and another important selection here 

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:50.460
 is the snake tep so you have a body 

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.409
 have a tablet xoom tablet it assumes 

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.350
 the body is a tablet application has 

00:18:52.409 --> 00:18:57.389
 that follow the kms of the body but it has 

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.679
 some additional clinical silver types 

00:18:57.389 --> 00:19:00.450
 of tablets né 

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:02.850
 It's so interesting to read 

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:05.519
 in the session to see if your app 

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.929
 he in fact following all that in the one 

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:08.970
 one of the important points that you will 

00:19:06.929 --> 00:19:12.029
 see that is always is always very 

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:14.399
 emphasized is the adequacy of the 

00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:16.110
 android design patterns so I 

00:19:14.399 --> 00:19:17.549
 I always say that, I do not think so. 

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.610
 for whom then surely God is 

00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:22.710
 getting annoying but followed the standards of 

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.419
 android design is very important and it 

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.129
 very important because when the user 

00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:28.350
 i learned how to use android apps is 

00:19:26.129 --> 00:19:29.999
 he is getting used to that pattern of 

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.559
 design then if you follow 

00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:34.019
 design will be much easier 

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:36.450
 user use the app not so good 

00:19:34.019 --> 00:19:38.369
 part of these this beginning is about you 

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.109
 follow the android design patterns 

00:19:38.369 --> 00:19:41.580
 good part of them is easy to follow 

00:19:40.109 --> 00:19:43.679
 example does not invent something 

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.749
 works hard is a crazy function 

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:47.220
 new beck button for example he too 

00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:49.559
 it does very well the function of being a 

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.080
 beck button no then it's good not to put 

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:53.460
 another crazy feature another better 

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.169
 For example, do not change the 

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.700
 function of the home button unless 

00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:59.489
 You really have a good reason to 

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:02.100
 do this is something else you use 

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:03.749
 all android components in general 

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.269
 how they should be used as 

00:20:03.749 --> 00:20:07.529
 now take see them notifications other 

00:20:06.269 --> 00:20:11.480
 important thing is to use 

00:20:07.529 --> 00:20:11.480
 notifications so that notifications 10 

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:37.130
 It's fine, I think. 

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.560
 the revolt had a slight problem 

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:43.040
 technician was done as I was speaking 

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.270
 important to follow these egos lines to 

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.850
 number of applications to 

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.710
 terminals with application is already already 

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:52.010
 following those quality standards 

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:53.870
 It is not an important thing that he is 

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:57.230
 very well there is about permissions right 

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:59.120
 permissions are growing more and more 

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.190
 users are aware and permissions on the 

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.810
 There was a time when you want to 

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.090
 beginning of August mobile when the user 

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:07.520
 I had no idea that the caps mobile 

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.320
 they did not do much 

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.970
 attention permissions but more and more 

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.070
 both the user and us like google 

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.200
 we are not of importance each 

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:18.020
 once again the permissions model the 

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.490
 android as a fundamental mechanism 

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.900
 of security 

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.060
 so it's very important that you ask 

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.100
 user permissions only for 

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.090
 what really makes sense I see 

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.370
 many apps that ask for example 

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:30.470
 permission to send sms 

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:32.690
 except that ep is intended to 

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.670
 sending sms is very rare indeed one is 

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.540
 legitimate want to send sms always mission 

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.580
 of user 

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.440
 but then you can speak ah but this map 

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.990
 how is this I give a web option 

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.760
 to share is this ep through 

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.500
 sms or stay medium 

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.480
 But that's what makes you inner. 

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.490
 You do not need to ask the user for permission. 

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.200
 to send sms you can do it through 

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:53.210
 of the internet week however the system 

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.460
 will send that message through 

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.870
 the application values ​​of icms or 

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.460
 You do not have to send a week for 

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.010
 own account and for this you have to ask 

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.090
 self-permission 

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.320
 the important point that you will see 

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:07.100
 mentioned there and that many applications 

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.990
 sin is the audio issue in the audio in the 

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.300
 android app it should work 

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.550
 only when the application actually takes 

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.620
 screen and working unless the 

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.180
 purpose of your application is the 

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.440
 audioteca for example if you have a 

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.390
 music application that is playing 

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.290
 music while you're just doing other 

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.420
 things 

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.440
 then it is reasonable for you to play the 

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.360
 jingle ground 

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.610
 but for example it is a mistake if you have a 

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.560
 This game is not played after 

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.570
 user turns off the screen saves in his pocket 

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.130
 and keeps playing music is not any 

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.990
 user who has a musical taste 

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.910
 so it is a mistake if you are doing 

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:39.590
 This is something else that is a mistake 

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.270
 music keeps playing when the user 

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:43.700
 it's lockscreen so now it's over 

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:45.890
 connecting the phone is on the screen 

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:49.340
 music of your game returns the adriano still 

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:52.850
 is in the galaxy crimes also a mistake 

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.140
 now come back indeed poet is this was 

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.260
 automatically corrects for 

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.150
 you in the nude there bin because the order 

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.620
 given among the major was changed but 

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.900
 trusts in good practice whenever 

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:06.410
 determine if you actually own your quota 

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:08.330
 visible before you start playing the other 

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.430
 Another important point is the text calls 

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:13.340
 letterbox 

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:14.810
 Are you at the store buying a tablet? 

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.690
 that you are super happy with your new 

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.830
 nexus 7000 to run the application on it and 

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.840
 you suddenly see that the application 

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.980
 although not all have bought 

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.260
 these pixels are not 

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.310
 the mound pixels you bought 

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.750
 depending on the store you paid for 

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.910
 very expensive for these pixels in the then 

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.860
 you run your ep suddenly appears in the 

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.330
 little square that in the middle and 

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.280
 He appears in a tiny little square. 

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.410
 in the middle because the player spoke 

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.970
 tablet phone all the same then 

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.760
 I'm going to pick up a piece of the display 

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.540
 I will not use it to save time 

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.800
 programming 

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.660
 so this is an extremely 

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.700
 annoying user he wants to use the 

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.230
 whole screen then letterbox is what 

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.450
 happens when you try to cut 

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.490
 pieces of your display to make hair 

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.170
 ideally quality objective has to 

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.600
 occupy entire land whatever the 

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.830
 Screen size up to the largest you make 

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.390
 one thing that makes sense for screens 

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.740
 larger and therefore smaller is always a 

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.990
 thing that makes sense for smaller screens 

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:06.290
 but you cut a piece of paper never 

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:08.300
 It's right it's against something important and it's not 

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:11.710
 leave those services running after 

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:14.420
 of chantal in which to any erp 

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.650
 below a map again after I leave 

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.710
 for a period of one week 

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:20.420
 After a week I'll stay with him. 

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.640
 during the week is monitoring the 

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.010
 balance and petro and know from the 

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.080
 settings to determine if that 

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.920
 app is or is not a vampire of 

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.140
 drums 

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.910
 I hate battery vampire then by 

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.380
 more that the application is useful 

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.530
 this is one thing I have a colleague 

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.690
 my uncle is much older and he always talks 

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.350
 because, however much the goal is 

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.270
 useful 

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.460
 If he trains my battery, he's 

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.520
 making other apps useless 

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.320
 then every app gets trained 

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.730
 unreasonably battery users 

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.190
 mainly irritated 

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.110
 so this is the only other item 

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.700
 important not to let things count 

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.130
 you do not have to keep running 

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.960
 and use resources wisely 

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.340
 I remember you asking for GPS authorization 

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.380
 it's not a free thing 

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.299
 so even if the application depends on the 

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.970
 authorization to function properly 

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:09.649
 and you should make wise decisions with 

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.440
 about being closely monitored 

00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:14.960
 every time then if you, for example, are a 

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.909
 restaurant search application and 

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.889
 You determined you called it an act. 

00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:20.450
 infraction complain you finished at 5 

00:25:18.889 --> 00:25:21.440
 minutes ago the user was in 

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.240
 Pine trees 

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.070
 then it is reasonable to assume that the sun 

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.419
 continue pine as the city comes 

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.460
 five minutes ago 

00:25:26.419 --> 00:25:30.289
 you do not need to request dps data from 

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.370
 new being that it is 35 minutes hour 

00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:34.940
 it was on the cheek 

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:36.980
 it is so the is always interesting 

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.230
 you make wise decisions about 

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.330
 resource saving 

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:44.480
 another important point is that they 

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.830
 speak is to restore the state in history 

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.139
 been an important thing because the 

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.059
 next when on android like you 

00:25:48.139 --> 00:25:51.769
 know is the operating system that decides 

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:53.029
 kill or not an activity then when 

00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:54.500
 operating system has passed 

00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:57.470
 features low memory 

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.970
 he decides that the activity xyz good leave 

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.769
 I'll kill the good system. 

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.970
 physical activities, for example when the 

00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:04.580
 user wants to go back to her 

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:06.559
 Restoration of activities but android 

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.510
 knows nothing about how many enemies 

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:10.580
 user already killed in your game then 

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.440
 Android will only restore its activity 

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.789
 now the activity content will remain 

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.289
 after its activity dies it is 

00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:16.789
 responsibility 

00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:19.309
 so you have to know that the user 

00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:21.019
 already killed 3 enemies in that phase and 

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:22.639
 back to that state when 

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:24.169
 back the saints who active 

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:25.909
 if not you have that effect 

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:28.370
 bad that the user started playing his 

00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:29.690
 game or use the apps came out of your 

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.480
 Puppy came back to Rome wrote 

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.549
 e-mail sms and seven years later resolved 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.080
 back to your game and in that moment 

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:39.080
 he discovers that those three enemies 

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.110
 he killed and dedication time killing them 

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.210
 are back to life 

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:47.090
 and it was because of a blog was not for 

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:48.649
 cause of the difficult game then 

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:51.710
 that is, it is always important that you 

00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:53.330
 restore the state properly 

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:55.490
 another point they mention too 

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:57.260
 important is good and construction science is not 

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.210
 application stabilities 

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.950
 strength 11 every time he does not have to have 

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:03.110
 a good swell from fifa app 

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.460
 choose from time to time yet he 

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:07.730
 it's not a very good app, right? 

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:09.680
 The ideal is to never give things to 

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:11.210
 when the user gives 

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.260
 so the ideal you see what matters is the 

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:16.670
 What is going on, I think this is 

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.800
 more or less what they were think is 

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:21.680
 appreciates the main novelty of 

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.420
 The latter means of and also with 

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.950
 related to the site the wrap the actor jorge 

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.020
 punctual with another interesting novelty 

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:29.360
 is that we have launched a platform 

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:31.520
 called buckley ice cream in some 

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.400
 election said he is nothing more than a 

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.350
 then it drops appreciably to the application that 

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.000
 it comes along with google play then 

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.170
 when you're using ft google 

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.480
 play on your android 

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.590
 it has an app cultured in it that 

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.140
 functions as essentially a 

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:47.450
 google service repository is 

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.280
 currently the service you have there is 

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:51.200
 the authentication service then you already 

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.780
 can summon the oppressor times in the 

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.640
 have chances are on the android blog 

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.950
 nokia android brings beautiful dots 

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.020
 both with you will notice that 

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.030
 there is the king who talks about the 

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.490
 goal scored and how to use the target with him 

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.810
 through google places you can 

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.000
 to authenticate the user 

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:09.440
 get a stump on a target for later 

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.070
 you could call others only from 

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.680
 Google 

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:15.350
 so it's cool because you're what 

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:19.190
 you make the user go through the 

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:20.660
 1 to 1 had a familiar path that he 

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:23.030
 is accustomed to authentication that 

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.590
 those standard screens of the law group then 

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.300
 per user a much better experience 

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:28.490
 What do you mean, your 

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.350
 interface for this then I 

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:32.870
 definitely this is if you do not 

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.370
 read the android developer's blog one 

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.480
 time it is worth to stop there and 

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:39.020
 see the news 

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:40.430
 That is what we are going to say here. 

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.110
 questions but before you start with the 

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.160
 questions asked by reader mode find 

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.660
 I want to give priority to who 

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.940
 is participating in renault live 

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.260
 here then that 21 questions to ask 

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:55.340
 live please 

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:57.770
 just talk tomorrow a lecture on 

00:28:55.340 --> 00:29:00.050
 college about the standard spoke commented 

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.430
 the third round 

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.820
 I just want to know what happened. 

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:06.290
 some news about the tablet case 

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.910
 this ranking that is made it too 

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.650
 is done on tablets or however the 

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:18.470
 google tv 

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:20.360
 top-of-the-line 

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:23.330
 another and no one is perfect he is 

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.970
 agnostic regarding the device 

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.350
 globally the only thing I've ever had 

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.300
 you will only see the applications are 

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.920
 compatible with the tablet then the 

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.240
 ranking is the same only that it leaked 

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.310
 by the device 

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.840
 So what happens to you hours 

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.760
 certainly have all the staff that 

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.800
 was creating who he is compatible with 

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.630
 your device when you are viewing the 

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.220
 machine a device x it will not 

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.560
 show a y that is not compatible with 

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.870
 devices but the ranking is global or 

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.030
 be the relative ordering between items 

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.200
 and see if there is even though the exact list 

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.000
 be different depending on each 

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.010
 now to the status and 

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.690
 specifically also has had a 

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:59.000
 special category for tablets then 

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.740
 you have for example the fpx protagoras and 

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.300
 if you get into stf for tablets they are 

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.890
 essentially the applications that we 

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.200
 google we think are good examples of 

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.940
 tablet app but there is no 

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.740
 automatic filter for you to see by 

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.760
 example that time the application of 

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.410
 tablet né 

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.390
 even because it is difficult to define what is a 

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.860
 tablet indicative on why even good 

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.030
 part of mobile apps 

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.190
 works with boards 

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:21.080
 so it's very difficult for you to be 

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:23.060
 is difficult to tell if the application x 

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.170
 is a cell phone call 

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.820
 how much more then to explode 

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.280
 algorithm for automatic filtration né 

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:30.050
 so all those screens are really 

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.190
 ranking for the whole device but are 

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:36.080
 filtered for compatibility with your 

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:39.350
 sessions where this question yes yes that 

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.630
 same is to leave a question of one 

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:43.430
 right to make new mane is the 

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:45.890
 willian souza is here 

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:47.180
 good approach by inep to remove 

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.130
 ads to avoid keeping two 

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.090
 a version with the ad 

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.540
 others in advertisement 

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:55.130
 sometimes 12 and the two proteins are good 

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.140
 I particularly prefer the inep 

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:59.210
 cause the next you have one is always 

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.580
 You better have a listing on the goal alone. 

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:03.890
 because only if you have two listings you 

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.060
 It has two globe eps and reminds 

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.650
 respect your comments not 

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.840
 share one to the other then 

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:10.880
 user comments compliments or 

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.220
 epp I was this compliment will not be 

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.140
 shared automatically with one 

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.480
 paid blow then the users arriving 

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.850
 under pay he sees so you have only four 

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.950
 downloads and the only comment you have there 

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:24.170
 It's a guy who's complained a lot. 

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:26.480
 and then wait a little longer for you 

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:28.700
 then it is always recommended that you have 

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.500
 the minimum of lists possible to hear minimum 

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.750
 means a better case 

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.760
 so I definitely recommend doing 

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:36.360
 through grandson then you have one 

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.940
 application and through inep 

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.059
 I sold his grei to premium you come 

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.559
 to upgrade it to version is to train 

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:45.030
 a great advantage of this here you have 

00:31:43.559 --> 00:31:46.860
 programming a functional logic for 

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:50.429
 determine whether or not the user buys the 

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:52.140
 version is to train but I think it's worth 

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:53.400
 feather despite the additional complication I 

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.590
 I think it's worth it because you 

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.030
 has a listing only then you get together 

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:59.010
 all your downloads will go 

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.820
 reflect the free version but the 

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.870
 kiss 

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.610
 unless its strategy of 

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.530
 marketing is based entirely on the 

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:06.360
 free version hence the page version 

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.070
 It means you're not so 

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.390
 interested in the pedro version while 

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.790
 example the ad revenue then 

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:14.910
 I need to be the main point of 

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:16.679
 strategies is just one of the two 

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.790
 Yes, as far as possible, I think it's 

00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:20.760
 better have a minimum of messages 

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:23.400
 possible that this was important was 

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.950
 I need to pay you need this question for 

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.090
 that a county with the server to 

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:30.150
 developers I like to remember 

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:31.950
 is that if you have a tablet kite and the 

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:33.990
 mobile phones are separated by a 

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.910
 This play is usually an idea. 

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.980
 because precisely because the 

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.570
 user has certainly got much less 

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.559
 users who tried to follow users who 

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.570
 have cell phones 

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:44.100
 so if you did one is public there and 

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:46.049
 tablet users will download the version 

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.960
 of the tablet he sees that the business only has 

00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:51.030
 known from 2030 downloads or 300 

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.919
 downloads is it starts to attack the 

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:55.020
 Application that good, you do not have much 

00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:57.630
 people using when the lie, right? 

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.070
 you actually have users on the 

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.570
 version of the mobile phone, so it's always 

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:03.690
 cool you have a single version for 

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:06.540
 cell phone and treat them and means the 

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.710
 the android portuguese odivelas allows 

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.270
 do it the easy way you 

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:11.070
 put different neuro files and 

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:12.900
 put this different for tablets and 

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.400
 Cell phone so always better you 

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.690
 have a single version that works on 

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.130
 tablets and cell phone 

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.960
 The only exception I said to this 

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.820
 for example very specific games and 

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.490
 that use pdl a lot because 

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:26.309
 sometimes for example you have you have 

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:28.770
 device architectures using 

00:33:26.309 --> 00:33:31.799
 example textures is compressed a 

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:33.270
 different format is then and then 

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:34.799
 sometimes it's worth you to apply 

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.450
 different so that the user does not have 

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:38.760
 which download a lot of bundle of data 

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.260
 who will not use it but out games a lot 

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.240
 specific and very heavy and I think 

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.850
 It's always worth your while to make a 

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:46.559
 only goal scoring is treated for peace 

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:49.169
 and also for the paid version 

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:50.119
 inversion is done I think I think this 

00:33:49.169 --> 00:33:52.999
 would be my advice 

00:33:50.119 --> 00:33:54.349
 brown that are worth all cases except 

00:33:52.999 --> 00:33:58.009
 of sessions 

00:33:54.349 --> 00:33:59.209
 ah good next question if it is someone has 

00:33:58.009 --> 00:34:01.039
 a live question to ask and the 

00:33:59.209 --> 00:34:02.869
 renault does not reflect the posture and 

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:04.579
 asking a comment question 

00:34:02.869 --> 00:34:07.129
 Remember that I'm only reading the comments 

00:34:04.579 --> 00:34:08.329
 of the post in android developers, I am 

00:34:07.129 --> 00:34:09.559
 I do not see the comments on my 

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:12.799
 I hope I made my personal account 

00:34:09.559 --> 00:34:14.299
 is to have a fifth nickel question that 

00:34:12.799 --> 00:34:16.909
 there is already forecast arrival of unicef 

00:34:14.299 --> 00:34:18.379
 in Brazil you recommend it's good 

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:20.179
 this question in two-part question 

00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:23.029
 there is already a forecast of the arrival of r7 in 

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:25.789
 Brazil, I do not want you to have more 

00:34:23.029 --> 00:34:29.589
 unfortunately does not have a forecast 

00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:31.579
 you recommend the nexus the nexus seven 

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:33.619
 recommend nexus s certainly not 

00:34:31.579 --> 00:34:35.419
 recommends nexus s do not think it is one of the 

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:37.129
 one of the more legal devices that 

00:34:35.419 --> 00:34:39.079
 I already used and are not saying that. 

00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:41.809
 Why good that even if they tell me 

00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:43.819
 It's not like that because it's me. 

00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:46.970
 personally the olive group outside the 

00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:49.549
 google I use a lot in the other 17 is and I 

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.470
 I really like him because my father because 

00:34:49.549 --> 00:34:53.029
 he has a good cost benefit he snow 

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:55.609
 not very concerned that he is 

00:34:53.029 --> 00:34:57.380
 it's something else that I really like 

00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:59.029
 fact that I have a certain size is the 

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.589
 problem that had conquered this 10 

00:34:59.029 --> 00:35:03.559
 inches here they are very large 

00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:05.210
 to download on a daily basis are they are 

00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:07.400
 very difficult to use, that's how we are 

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:09.259
 they are heavy they sure are not leaving 

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.460
 some lighter the day but the tablets 

00:35:09.259 --> 00:35:11.239
 The initial 10 inch was very 

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.700
 heavy 

00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:16.069
 I liked it because it is very very 

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:19.249
 Practical in me the processor is very good 

00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:20.930
 and anyway the only thing that is a little 

00:35:19.249 --> 00:35:22.579
 bad and he only has a track on the 

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:24.259
 time command for things I do not 

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:26.359
 I can access for example from 3g with 

00:35:24.259 --> 00:35:27.769
 he but that means that's part of grace 

00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:29.210
 because his battery lasted much longer 

00:35:27.769 --> 00:35:31.759
 for example the euro banknote in the 

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:33.710
 galaxy nexus is precisely because the radio 

00:35:31.759 --> 00:35:36.140
 3g and consume much more battery than 

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.819
 What will you do and how will our time 

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:40.069
 galaxy nexus in the pocket in some cases 

00:35:37.819 --> 00:35:42.829
 friend stone in new galaxy nexus no use 

00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:45.410
 It's easy but then the answer is 

00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:49.759
 definitely the president recommends 

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:52.569
 much the nexus 7 as tablet is is someone is 

00:35:49.759 --> 00:35:55.190
 Thank you to do live on the coup 

00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:57.259
 You commented now on the theme 

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:59.359
 applications he hangs on the wire 

00:35:57.259 --> 00:36:01.369
 small screen that I have maybe then it is 

00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:03.350
 this will demonstrate an application of 

00:36:01.369 --> 00:36:06.020
 s 

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:07.610
 Are you going to show or not? I have more. 

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.250
 but I do not have any 

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:13.640
 application as I can demonstrate 

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:15.140
 no, I do not want to speak ill of any 

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.660
 application from any company on the 

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:20.710
 so it did not walk more than 15g of 

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:23.210
 find motives that do this right 

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:25.130
 but what to say 

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:28.130
 whenever you see an application that it 

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:29.960
 cuts pieces of your interface into the data 

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:33.260
 the recommendation is always going to google 

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.030
 in china much of seeing it to know that 

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.940
 Do you want to use all the fixed ones of your 

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:40.760
 tablet is that same floor is worth with other 

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:42.410
 with other things actually you in the 

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.670
 as a user he hates you too 

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.510
 the user anyone as users 

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.520
 android 

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.470
 we are very powerful creatures in the 

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.240
 our globe player comments is the 

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:52.790
 our king on the coup and that's one thing 

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.430
 that the developers they or I like 

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.950
 very much a team then in your 

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.540
 essential for us to see clearly in 

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.800
 application descriptions that start 

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.900
 with the carlos lock deal with three 

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.100
 batteries please do not have milk bad pro 

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.930
 my application 

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.970
 so either the user has a power 

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:10.010
 very great all this and it is always legal 

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:12.110
 the eyes of course use this for the 

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.400
 well to use this to encourage 

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.350
 players to make high application 

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.960
 quality as a developer 

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:19.970
 of course you have to always give 

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.620
 ears to users and do not let 

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.780
 angry because they have this weapon 

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.430
 quite powerful in their hand that thinks 

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:29.150
 much in the group and obviously it's not like 

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:31.880
 says the expression we are going now to the 

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:34.250
 next question that dodô moderator who 

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.510
 the following is from daniel de goiânia who 

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:37.430
 the spam 

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:40.100
 if I make an ep that works 

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:42.230
 exclusively or to give tips for the 

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.000
 bep game and if you put the name of the actor 

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:46.270
 for brad pit stops or tips for 

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.630
 bergson, this is considered to be 

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.400
 good 

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.690
 let's just take a general look at the 

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.280
 What do you want me to like you? 

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.780
 What today for the next is when you 

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.880
 places on the streets in the description of the 

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.830
 application on the mount of the bus that 

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.420
 just to make the app appear in 

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.950
 unrelated searches 

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.440
 then there are those applications that are 

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:05.390
 desperate and that for example the title 

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.820
 the application is called for example the 

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:10.100
 game x aa and in the title itself called 

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:12.860
 best do not know how much you like and ride the 

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:15.680
 game the application title is 20% title 

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.540
 and 80% random superlatives 

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.890
 this is expected because the 

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:22.609
 application is wanting artificially 

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:24.349
 to appear naked in the site's ranking is another 

00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:26.599
 thing in the application description he 

00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:30.050
 stay put terms warm brazil 

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:31.400
 original for example fan fest is not cold 

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.800
 amazed encapsulated here to try 

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.599
 make the arrangement of the coup and finds 

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:39.980
 that those terms are relevant poet 

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:41.809
 it's then we continually take the air 

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.309
 we suspend applications that do today 

00:38:41.809 --> 00:38:44.240
 I hope that today you take something that is 

00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:46.940
 extremely bad 

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.300
 we do not like iran the user does not 

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:52.099
 likes who likes it is now something else 

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.530
 which is especially expected is 

00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:55.220
 you try to make you try to cheat the 

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.300
 user 

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.160
 he thinks that just because the rain is a 

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:00.740
 something that he is not right 

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.619
 and in the case, for example, it is called an ep of 

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:05.210
 Portuguese project means I 

00:39:03.619 --> 00:39:07.130
 particularly I think if not here 

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.380
 we like it because when the user 

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:11.839
 look for bdp he says 

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:14.660
 and was a reasonable search result in the 

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:16.339
 Own a prayer, Mrs. 

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.020
 looking for the bb is reasonably 

00:39:16.339 --> 00:39:20.270
 reasonable to assume that it may have 

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:22.220
 interested in an ep called ric upp 

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.450
 I will not discuss whether it's cool or not 

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.950
 make an ep and quote 

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.079
 I will not say no, I will not go in 

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.880
 merit jack white right because it is not 

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:31.069
 mine does not know but assuming you 

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:34.369
 be allowed to do this on time 

00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:36.020
 somehow I wanted I did not 

00:39:34.369 --> 00:39:37.730
 I will consider this as what it is today. 

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.680
 because I do not wonder why when the 

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:41.359
 user search pp this is reasonable that 

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.770
 he wants to find the overweight also the 

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:44.540
 that it is unreasonable for example a 

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.880
 application of a game this I already saw 

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.680
 very very very much i will not cite examples 

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.510
 but I've seen many games that are 

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.660
 related are games about to shoot 

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:55.490
 things in other things and the game-training 

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:58.970
 suddenly in the description of him britney 

00:39:55.490 --> 00:40:00.410
 Spears Lady Gaga Do not Know 404 Unless 

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:03.650
 that what to say 

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:05.420
 and is the lady gaga britney spears are 

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.130
 somehow the game is that I 

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:10.099
 I hope you are. 

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:11.780
 maliciously try to get you a 

00:40:10.099 --> 00:40:14.930
 ranking position searches that are not 

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:17.630
 related but particularly you a 

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:18.680
 app that objective course gives tips 

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.809
 pro b pigs 

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.819
 He calls himself pt pt, I think he is. 

00:40:20.809 --> 00:40:25.670
 Great to be wrong and call yourself tips for 

00:40:22.819 --> 00:40:27.470
 beto what are tips to see pigs is topic 

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:29.230
 fame I do not know how many and how many 

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:32.080
 best downloads is final 

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:33.460
 is this here wortmann but sir 

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.840
 called that the research projects 

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.220
 I do not see any problem 

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:42.340
 is someone who is a question that does the 

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:46.119
 river and we will not go to the next 

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:47.980
 android near the voter is Gustavo 

00:40:46.119 --> 00:40:51.010
 oak budapest hungary 

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.170
 the fallible method prom is costly 

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:55.090
 would be a reference to a few way 

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.280
 sometimes there are problems in using the 

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:59.200
 where you want a variable the 

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.630
 field in the class had 

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.670
 called saw Fábio bahia only once 

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:06.670
 The Fawha Bahia and it is not no it is not 

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:09.520
 particularly expensive but if you go 

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.940
 often use a very closed loop 

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.340
 huh 

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.590
 brazil often generates a null that 

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.600
 will take up to five times per second 

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:18.609
 not worth calling all the time because 

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.450
 is a cost called function is always a 

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:21.190
 I do not like it 

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:24.490
 so what to say also the recommendation 

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:26.109
 It's if you talk a few times and you do not 

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.609
 like her in an intensive way can be 

00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:28.180
 called to live life when you 

00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:30.220
 want to 

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.630
 now if you are a loop and need 

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.160
 of high performance you will have to 

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:35.920
 keep thinking about it all the time 

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.540
 for this it is worth not only to level there but 

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.130
 want to compete for 

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.920
 any kind of method call 

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:43.630
 called method is expensive it is cheap to 

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.490
 do it from time to time but the face you 

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:47.410
 will upgrade with five times and 

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:50.350
 needs and needs to be fast 

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:53.380
 in this case I would recommend you record the 

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:55.420
 movie is the personally what to say my 

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:58.270
 programming method is to make a movie 

00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:00.280
 for that thing is not because it was level 

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.990
 baby be slow but because you can stay 

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.180
 cleaner to hear from you because every time 

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:05.619
 It's called riverbed you need. 

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.810
 Evolve the code to test the 

00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:09.730
 practice in the face of seeing bdr 

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:11.109
 power lower then you can 

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:13.000
 cause all those relatives and make a 

00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:13.900
 test to button the beam to a 

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.490
 variable 

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.800
 so I think it's much more elegant 

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:19.720
 the code becomes more readable when you are 

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.040
 I'm writing to emi ok, it does not put any 

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.410
 thing because you put the whole 

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.300
 expression is not johnny the prom but this 

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:27.040
 It's my personal style of guessing 

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.810
 that each one has its own style but 

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.580
 in terms of performance and I would only be 

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.770
 worried if you're calling the 

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:37.359
 dance a million kisses but other than that 

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:39.520
 I think it does not have any problem then 

00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:40.780
 Let's go to the next question, someone here. 

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.170
 too crazy to do the clean in the 

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.170
 renault 

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.680
 do not let her take advantage 

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:52.070
 to present the net marin grandson 

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:54.770
 universe navy then the navy grandson 

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:56.600
 is my colleague reveals problems to him 

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:58.430
 For those who do not know, I'm 

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.840
 moving to the United States or going 

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.680
 change the United States in the fifth 

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.260
 next week 

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:06.320
 So I'll go to work and 

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:08.810
 keeps seen with android damage or thirst 

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.280
 google then who will continue with the 

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:14.090
 relationship with developers is 

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:16.970
 Honest ladybug, that's good. Let's go. 

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:20.660
 next question I'll pass on the 

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:22.070
 goal taken in having is how long you 

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.070
 was inspired to ask a question to the 

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.900
 I live the next question that the ship 

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.970
 I had flamenco flag google maps api 

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.490
 the opinions of flamengo quis bes survs 

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:34.610
 application developer in the 

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:36.890
 philippines is to bring Portuguese, whether it be me 

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:39.080
 Can I get my data from google? 

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:42.140
 maps and piauí to use in the service of 

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:46.790
 location to issues involving good 

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:48.830
 The answer to this is actually complicated. 

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:51.820
 but if it were to be summed up in one word it is 

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:55.070
 dependent and the terms of service of the 

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.450
 they are extensive, I am not 

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.730
 Specialist in this because I do not work 

00:43:56.450 --> 00:44:00.710
 in the garbage team in pine forests 

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:03.920
 then but only with this information 

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:06.650
 that carry on the question is very 

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.020
 difficult to know if this use qualified 

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.790
 he is in or not one of the heroes in the 

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.290
 so that's how I recommend you read 

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:14.990
 the terms of service of the 

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:16.640
 sap and find out if its use is in 

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:20.320
 or not, but they know of trials here 

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.320
 This is more than it gives to decide 

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.349
 Well, someone has a question to ask. 

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:29.349
 live or leaving aside the 

00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:31.359
 comments from you is Bruno is 

00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:31.780
 I respect about after I've seen where 

00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:34.119
 come over 

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.460
 he had that system of updating the 

00:44:34.119 --> 00:44:38.140
 application updates a different part 

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.660
 as I had before analyzing 

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:42.940
 I only saw it once recently in 

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:45.609
 followed after I arrived I saw a game 

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.260
 that preview this but I have not seen more is of 

00:44:45.609 --> 00:44:51.280
 difficulty in programming this 

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:53.440
 method is the goal came out only a 

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.480
 code moved week application it 

00:44:53.440 --> 00:45:01.660
 makes the comparison but even so what 

00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:03.339
 they could say about whether there is that 

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.050
 partial updates actually 

00:45:03.339 --> 00:45:06.940
 incremental updates was one thing 

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:09.730
 that we launched is working on the 

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:12.130
 google what happens the update 

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:14.530
 incremental it should update the 

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:16.359
 parts of pkk that are needed to 

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:19.330
 reduce the traffic you need 

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:21.880
 to bring a peta is often this 

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:23.560
 it is possible is often not possible 

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.359
 on the developers side the 

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.580
 developer does not do anything 

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:29.589
 This is not authorizing if this 

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.640
 it's not happening, it's not any fault 

00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:33.880
 the developer's fault is entirely 

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:36.190
 Wow, but nowhere to people. 

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.390
 really want to ensure that 

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.070
 update will be made 

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:41.310
 incrementally in software than what 

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:43.410
 may or may not happen depending on the 

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:48.670
 depending on the application of the 

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:50.740
 specific circumstance is and this comes 

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:51.730
 happening with my apps or not 

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.880
 I know it's not guaranteed that it will 

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:57.730
 happen with all applications is not 

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:59.800
 and I think it depends a lot for example 

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:01.210
 of the pkk framework that I apply for 

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.760
 we're a little something here - 

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:05.290
 There is no way to make a pet 

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.940
 something this thing is not 

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.190
 minimally compatible then depending on 

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:10.720
 of the update the government made to 

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:13.660
 Sometimes we can not send a pet. 

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.040
 incremental is depending on the result of the 

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.690
 update, we can do it on 

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.420
 instrumental part and in this case it is 

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:21.550
 implemented so but I do not have 

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:25.450
 sure why this is not not 

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:27.940
 working to say more often 

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:30.640
 but promised you do not need attention and 

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:34.119
 prevention is not but it is not something that 

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.980
 is so big the morning the developer 

00:46:34.119 --> 00:46:38.500
 disagree 

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:40.300
 What makes you automatic, I have the suit. 

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.980
 should automatically do this then 

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.930
 if he is not doing it or because 

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.970
 I happen to be the ones you are applying for. 

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:47.380
 using are not allowed for example 

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:49.330
 savior by having something that makes 

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.619
 incompatible with this or because the group 

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:53.020
 is broken in some way that the 

00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:55.060
 people do not know this way anyway 

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.890
 it's not the developer's fault 

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.080
 did not come back yesterday to any blog 

00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:00.880
 personal happen this happens too 

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.700
 with those expansion files in the 

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:05.650
 in short a relevant commentary and a 

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:08.230
 common mistake that I see that some 

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:10.690
 second apps is the following they use the 

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:12.880
 that the way of expansion of applying and 

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:14.740
 after he uses it he decides to pick up and 

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.840
 delete the file was not now already 

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.800
 I will try to expand because it is 

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.810
 I need more 

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:22.270
 This is a mistake because the togo that goes 

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:23.619
 think the following my god disappeared disappeared 

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:25.630
 there is a provision to apply 

00:47:23.619 --> 00:47:27.580
 I think I'm going to download again then 

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:29.350
 they are trapped in a cycle of 

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.670
 stay down fat exp. 

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.650
 because the application very smart 

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:35.680
 resolved to delete or after it is finished 

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:38.170
 then definitely use the 

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.390
 advice is do not mess with the quote you 

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:42.700
 and he does not have to write and 

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:49.619
 try to mean do not try to stay 

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:59.380
 Deleted it we did not determine the question 

00:47:49.619 --> 00:48:08.500
 I do not think I have doubt in 

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:17.680
 relation to the law of the end at night starting 

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:20.140
 the play doh's play of being law 

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.380
 put an effective big excuse this 

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:25.750
 language that can be differentiated in the 

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.670
 appeal claimed I am is a good future 

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:30.760
 recognizes that anything that people 

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:32.320
 receives routinely because it does much 

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.150
 sense helm already has a way of you 

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.619
 find apps app 

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:37.540
 nothing more natural than you can 

00:48:35.619 --> 00:48:39.190
 also locate fpf football up to 

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.900
 because when you have a time it is 

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:43.030
 highlighted worldwide 

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.640
 it would be interesting the highlight graphic 

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:47.500
 appearing in the user's own language 

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.570
 currently we do not have it or 

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.670
 fmf football is 

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:53.920
 equal for all countries one of the 

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:55.870
 reasons why this was not 

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:58.120
 prioritized so far is because it is that 

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.440
 the filet that you want it to be is a brief and 

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.160
 it has to be much more serious because 

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.420
 text 

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.280
 if you have software that has a 

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:05.080
 paragraph of the text explained in ep alice 

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.660
 cooper is because it has to have a paragraph 

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:10.210
 explaining that ipea is probably in the 

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.740
 clue that is making reservation is not that 

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.120
 will be very successful then the idea of 

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:16.000
 fit strike that he explains 

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:19.410
 graphically that it does and finally 

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.720
 on the back in a sentence until the 

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:27.460
 time itself to the very application of the 

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:29.680
 gmail has reached exactly 

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.300
 So this is definitely a 

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:36.550
 pitbull is the highlight of the model is the 

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:37.690
 The following is how differential 

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.090
 configuration for devices 

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:42.190
 different through gmail is this is a 

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.870
 very fat question william is because it is 

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:46.180
 one thing that is is very easy to do 

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:48.250
 but sometimes very obvious then the 

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.020
 problem is the following but it is not 

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:53.080
 very sure for the mayor also wants 

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:56.470
 say those like the cannons in it then 

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.300
 apple ids that is is that control that 

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:59.980
 appears on the user's home screen that is 

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.120
 a way for the user to put 

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.370
 relevant information from the 

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.440
 application has for example has 

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:07.240
 that the egypt g mail that lets you see 

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:09.220
 your screen mails on the home screen 

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.690
 before you open you have a video by 

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.250
 example of weather forecast has many 

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:14.200
 things have in my opinion 

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:16.450
 are underutilized, you do not have a 

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:20.260
 huge market for minor minor egypt 

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:22.450
 and smaller and does not have enough areas 

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.610
 that is, users stay in the 

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:27.220
 sometimes because they need to go 

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.420
 look very interesting to think 

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.280
 on the device 

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.810
 they do not find so tip has a 

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:36.220
 Huge market users wanting to download 

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:37.690
 widgets widsets is sometimes for 

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.430
 certain categories 

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:42.190
 Now his question is very relevant. 

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.780
 we did not even all its should be 

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:46.200
 behaved exactly the same way 

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:48.010
 no tablet on the phone for example 

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.690
 should have a 

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:51.490
 different from the course by phone 

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:53.230
 if you just of course or ide on android 

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:54.760
 manifesto it always has the same layout 

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.290
 which is not desirable 

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.270
 if you want to declare layouts 

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:59.950
 different you have to do has 

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:01.930
 what to do with what's called the dem 

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.980
 resources nébula de mujerão percent 

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:05.560
 or false 

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:08.109
 It is the second resort you will declare 

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:10.660
 within a x ml that is called 

00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:12.970
 good example xml and old have succeeded 

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:14.890
 anyway it's a right value then you 

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:17.380
 declares it as goalkeeper value the type 

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:19.780
 to buller it as it is 

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:21.310
 declaring a file is ml points you 

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:23.650
 can put it according to what 

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:26.770
 you want in any folder in the 

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:29.680
 within the sub-month is you place 

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:31.660
 it in for example receive the traits 

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.700
 something is not going to show any 

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:36.310
 thing is a configuration qualifier 

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:38.080
 that it is extremely important to attribute abortion 

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:40.390
 whether by that resource 

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.070
 depending on the version of the android then 

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:44.560
 summarizing summarizing who arrived here 

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:46.510
 Do you have a resort you could call 

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.609
 example let's suppose you're just 

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:49.869
 Wishing you compliments noticed then you 

00:51:48.609 --> 00:51:52.240
 has an abundant resource is called 

00:51:49.869 --> 00:51:54.100
 establish a resource that should be 

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:57.369
 the water that is made to notice says that 

00:51:54.100 --> 00:52:00.490
 is doing in the old English 

00:51:57.369 --> 00:52:03.160
 the traits x large you will put there the 

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:06.760
 its bueno ml points and inside it you 

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:08.080
 defines the so-called stable with the 

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.210
 southern value 

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:13.390
 then you will create another xml file 

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:15.070
 within the directory rescue old 

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:17.410
 trace anything else for example the 

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:19.090
 phones or I am old in the 

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.500
 practice being able to buy everything else 

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:23.109
 inside it is created a file with the 

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:25.780
 same name and you put a resort with the 

00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:27.790
 same name whose value is false 

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:30.100
 this will make that feature 

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:31.780
 woman has no true tablets value and has 

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.670
 a value falls when you find 

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:36.640
 thing when you set the first 

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:39.460
 music for example x large else is 

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:41.320
 When will you set your idiot in the 

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:43.540
 your android manifests that you do it 

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.700
 has a parameter that android 2.1 nor 

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:48.520
 good points and I will not even see 

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:51.390
 can receive trophies and hardcore or he 

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:54.609
 can be a reference to what the 

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:56.470
 Boolean resource a powerful and it is in this 

00:52:54.609 --> 00:52:58.660
 point where you will point your resort 

00:52:56.470 --> 00:53:00.700
 you have just set the 

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:02.109
 which can be either false depending on that 

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:04.330
 Are you ready to play? 

00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:06.520
 then you do not enter two 

00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:09.220
 egypt sides android sea one 

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:12.340
 settings has android 2.0 or 

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:14.140
 equal to a resort bug is light and 

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:16.330
 another has black dots andré 

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:17.950
 pointing to denial 

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:20.200
 according to the treasure then you for example 

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:22.750
 tablet enamel does not know to point to 

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:24.430
 denial of that first is unfortunately 

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:26.530
 I'm not afraid it sums up smart for 

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:28.840
 connecting a leonine resource is 

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:31.150
 I set it right below the south define 

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.550
 one that is false but not easy 

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:35.470
 to do then it's pretty easy of all this but 

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:37.480
 not entirely obvious at first then 

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:39.130
 I think that's a good question and it's 

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.680
 super important make this concern 

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:43.180
 you to hedge and that is 

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.860
 appropriate by screen size of the 

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.540
 User's device is super 

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.340
 mainly important because 

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:54.310
 ovaries and want the isi to have said it 

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:59.530
 be optimized for non-brunet screens 

00:53:54.310 --> 00:54:05.380
 It hurts but then you're going to have 22 

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:06.910
 21 unifest xml to do because 

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.610
 I was sick and another to hit 

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:14.610
 Enamels tablet my spoke to him 

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:14.610
 with the chosen one is different from the channel 

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:19.200
 So when are you grounded? 

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:22.450
 idea when trying to enter the 

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.680
 xml that defines what trophy is the 

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:25.180
 that will be read and when you are 

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.130
 running a thing that is not a tablet is 

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.610
 the xml that defines how the sun will be 

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.230
 free 

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:32.070
 you do this by putting them 

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:34.570
 appropriately the older folders 

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.700
 through this will be the correct xml was 

00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:39.160
 selected is that the exam is to define the 

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:42.220
 stable dish or depending on the user 

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:46.750
 mounted and on your other brands you 

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:49.000
 defines it to point out that feature is 

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:51.610
 take a look at my talk from the 

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.850
 google wael that in our room that was mine 

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:57.010
 hard was dick we talked about how 

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:58.390
 make and bring up the user who are 

00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:58.990
 compatible with previous versions of the 

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.280
 android 

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:03.460
 one of the tricks we recommend 

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:05.410
 just use busdoors to do is 

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.760
 that are different depending on the 

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:09.190
 that you if you are for example we 

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:11.080
 Sincerely, I do not like comics. 

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:13.180
 same technique can be applied to 

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.840
 not only differentiate this year by 

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.490
 bin 

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.560
 as the difference also for example 

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:19.690
 stage of cell phone or any other 

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.180
 setting you want 

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:24.520
 Can you think that way? 

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:26.230
 that is to say any differentiation that 

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:28.060
 you can do through the exorcist 

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:29.650
 Can you do it through this? 

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.220
 technique are definitely not 

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:31.930
 technical 

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:34.349
 during the day in your pocket for 

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:34.349
 these cases 

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:41.349
 is someone else a question here live 

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:42.960
 in the recall are doubts and that is now 

00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:45.670
 to travel but if I continue to do 

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.450
 use of drugs in Brazil always has the 

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:47.710
 principle yes 

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.990
 The only difference is that I'm going 

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:52.690
 transmit through our studio and 

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:55.569
 kept the ninth but the time will be 

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:58.000
 fixed in Brazil where there is no time 

00:55:55.569 --> 00:55:59.559
 It's really convenient for two 

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.779
 You actually share because it's going to be for me. 

00:55:59.559 --> 00:56:03.190
 the winner does not mean that I can 

00:56:01.779 --> 00:56:04.720
 make legal from within normal hours 

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:06.579
 at the same time 

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.230
 automatically for a bonus is 

00:56:06.579 --> 00:56:09.400
 provided by the rotation of the 

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:10.900
 planet 

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.089
 He ends up falling at the right time. 

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.440
 Brazil also ends up falling more than 

00:56:13.089 --> 00:56:16.869
 pleasure night 

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:18.400
 so I'm sure the position 

00:56:16.869 --> 00:56:19.569
 geography of its roots in Brazil was 

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.710
 when it was quoted carefully 

00:56:19.569 --> 00:56:22.710
 designed to make this possible. 

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:31.580
 thank you to the team that 

00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:34.600
 designed the test is then someone has a 

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:34.600
 ask me to do the same 

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:39.550
 I'll leave one more question of one 

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:41.200
 then I do not think it ended up in the 

00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:42.850
 last question just comment 

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:45.250
 Inter has already done online with 

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:46.600
 play make a biographical film country ne 

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:48.880
 So I guess we broke up now. 

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.950
 questions 18 so now we 

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.170
 arrives at that tense moment of the night in 

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:55.690
 What do you or do you ask or start? 

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:59.130
 Then sing the ball asking questions. 

00:56:55.690 --> 00:57:03.010
 You do not want to wrap up the years. 

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:05.290
 products did represent themselves above the 

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:08.290
 standard on the Brazilian team rather than 

00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:11.560
 will bring more these news 

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:13.540
 I'll keep bringing what is 

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:16.480
 doing galt sam 

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:18.340
 at the beginning with the same format as 

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.410
 I was doing until today with news 

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:24.520
 What's the legal point of editing it there? 

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:26.260
 a kennel that is easier to invite 10 

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:28.510
 pixels to appear and repeated in the regal 

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:30.820
 kind of interview is right but I do not 

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:32.650
 I know very well how it's going to be 

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.000
 day to day side of the rebels but in 

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:36.310
 As far as possible I will always try 

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.060
 bring interesting things to each 

00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:39.060
 regatta we were thinking 

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.470
 Any good any more questions? 

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:55.859
 Ok, leave it and if anyone has any more 

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:55.859
 ask here to do in the post of the para 

00:57:56.210 --> 00:58:00.130
 the tax program takes to 

00:57:57.589 --> 00:58:00.130
 click here 

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:08.780
 Okay, so one more question, so I guess 

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:11.000
 I'm going to ask a question just for 

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:14.120
 to avoid that I have to sing my song 

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.910
 next question is this thing that 

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:19.760
 is that we build at the beginning of the 

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:22.160
 regal chance of this and quality checklist 

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:24.020
 of applications asks him if he 

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.050
 also applies to games or is only a 

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:28.280
 checklist applications you have a 

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:32.630
 difference between games and applications 

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:34.190
 in this case is good the last question ah ah 

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:36.680
 ah ah the answer to the question 

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:38.990
 next games applications they are 

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:41.030
 essentially different snows are in 

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:42.380
 general rules for applications do not 

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:45.110
 applied much more to applications 

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:47.000
 even games and keeping the rule separate 

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:49.850
 but we do not have a specific section 

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.980
 for games on that one is that one 

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:54.170
 list, but he always recommends that 

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:57.500
 games follow more or less great light 

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:59.930
 applications as long as you want 

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:01.670
 nothing basic is to have good sense in this you 

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:04.010
 have solved the game has hundreds of one 

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:05.870
 list that make no sense 

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:08.570
 so you can see in the game for example 

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:11.930
 follow the online costs of interface 

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:14.630
 android is more or less né mother e 

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:16.280
 also necessary because the purpose of the 

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:18.740
 user when he plays a game is 

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.990
 emergence a new experience to be 

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:22.790
 energy in the experience that joe is is not 

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:24.830
 I mean, he does not have as much 

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:28.580
 goal of having a productivity 

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:29.840
 something is, so if you 

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.160
 it's making game you do not need 

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.670
 follow that online market sometimes 

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:35.390
 very rigid then always 

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:37.040
 important 

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:39.440
 I mean follow that big loot 

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.870
 lines with some common sense for you 

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:44.020
 can make a game do not follow 

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:46.160
 literally for example imagine the 

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:47.720
 excellent until there's something 

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.200
 things that are anti patterns for games 

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.580
 huh 

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.110
 I've seen many games that are very 

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:53.570
 interesting but suddenly you arrive 

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:55.700
 at the end of the phase and you receive the 

00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:57.260
 android standard alubox said congratulations 

00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.240
 you went through phase 

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.100
 because when you left when I see that 

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.660
 default android nokia dialog he 

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:05.000
 You're not saying that the standard is ugly. 

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:07.430
 but when you receive the default 

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.380
 android on the chip midway and that breaks 

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:10.730
 experience of the game of the immediate 

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:13.310
 thinks that something very wrong in the 

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:15.380
 game is not the contest eg it's you 

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:16.790
 passed the stage defeated the boss but I 

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:18.030
 I could not record your status because 

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:19.860
 He gave 

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:21.540
 I always thought something very 

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:24.390
 when I see a little of those in the 

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.700
 then it is always recommended to do with 

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:28.620
 that visual interface of the game she 

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.300
 well integrated with the game above 

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:32.190
 do not do a thing that surprises 

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:35.190
 user suddenly appears a pope having 

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:36.840
 based on the android style question 

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:39.270
 The same thing applies to 

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.430
 pulp is the standard of android 

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:43.560
 although it is very easy to create it 

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:46.080
 should only be used for those warnings 

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.060
 which are crucial things for the user 

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.800
 something very wrong for example 

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.600
 has to save your file from an error in 

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.430
 time to save technology the most 

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:56.040
 is a network error and I tried to back up 

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:58.050
 but it is a backup and is reputed to be the 

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.760
 another is soon by remembrance then 

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:01.320
 all this dialogue, for example, the error 

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.220
 when you were trying to repair the 

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.190
 error lobby 

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:06.600
 in this case the dialogue but if it is not 

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:08.130
 a critical thing of this kind is always 

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.930
 walk you integrate it with visual of 

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:12.570
 your app same thing for example 

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:14.280
 When the story tried to send, I tried 

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:15.720
 record an appointment in the calendar and not 

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.790
 I was able to record because the time zone 

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.190
 wrong can not be something i'm doing 

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:21.570
 This is not to show up in red. 

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:23.400
 something that does not have clothes so much 

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:25.680
 user when a goal appeared on the 

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.630
 screen you give a part of the novel 

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.640
 It's practically a scary thing. 

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:31.470
 in the annex would lead to practically 

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.550
 a slap in the face of do 

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:34.170
 critical thing 

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:36.590
 This review Congratulations, you can 

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:40.170
 do it right then the user gets a little 

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:41.640
 bewildered with this is the same thing 

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:45.120
 as for example I have seen for example 

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.590
 that those neighborhoods progress in 

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.840
 area of ​​that progress bar but the 

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:51.120
 android pattern and lets use a bar 

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.350
 specific game and always gives the 

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:55.710
 impression that there is something like that 

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:57.300
 a lot of you want to download the game 

01:01:55.710 --> 01:02:00.990
 so you suddenly come back to the 

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:05.820
 system standard is good but have a 

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:08.700
 Brazil question has a lot of difference 

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:10.800
 between everything I can record a 

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:14.100
 their abpi television is the same as the 

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.350
 zero point and a different radio one 

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.420
 very different athlete has a lot of 

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:19.860
 difficulty one thing it is the same 

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:25.050
 standard only has to care per cent 

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:26.730
 television difference from that other 

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:28.050
 essentially the same lane on the left 

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:29.580
 for android it is not certain that neither 

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.890
 android version you hold national 

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:34.260
 it's an android you want a great 

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:35.640
 This is what is on a table, but it is the 

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.170
 I think the fundamental problem is that 

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.849
 he is not going to google tv is not on 

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.260
 however the technician tatá and we is not that 

01:02:38.849 --> 01:02:41.640
 be harder at nothing 

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.619
 I think that the fundamental problem that 

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.750
 players have to solve google tv is 

01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:46.799
 know what the user interested in 

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:49.650
 google tv 

01:02:46.799 --> 01:02:51.660
 certainly not the one for example an ep 

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:53.549
 which is very successful on the cell phone 

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.930
 it may not be so successful in 

01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:56.220
 Globe TV because there is no interest 

01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:58.289
 users there because you have to imagine 

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.579
 the case of easy use imagine how many 

01:02:58.289 --> 01:03:01.859
 hours using google tv 

01:02:59.579 --> 01:03:03.299
 He is sitting on the couch he is away. 

01:03:01.859 --> 01:03:05.250
 of the device 

01:03:03.299 --> 01:03:07.140
 then your device depends a lot on the 

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:08.460
 interaction with the user and maybe 

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.740
 suddenly this main user image 

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.450
 use for example does not have touchscreen 

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.480
 user can not get there with a finger 

01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:18.089
 screen and interact with the application 

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.740
 So this already kills a lot of people. 

01:03:18.089 --> 01:03:20.519
 applications that depend on the corner to 

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.750
 do that 

01:03:20.519 --> 01:03:23.250
 I remember that the user will have that 

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.650
 flight control had to enter since 

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:27.450
 and application is always very important 

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:29.369
 that the application makes sense in this 

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:31.289
 context you imagine the user when 

01:03:29.369 --> 01:03:32.940
 he is using the google tv app 

01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:35.700
 he is more interested in consuming 

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.960
 content of what interacts is 

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.029
 interested in interacting only when 

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.369
 that's going to hit the 

01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:43.380
 content so he wants it for example 

01:03:41.369 --> 01:03:45.089
 youtube is a good example of the application 

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:46.740
 works fine for google tv for wanting 

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:48.630
 the user interacts just to see the 

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.579
 next video and then will consume 

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:52.619
 quite content the same thing against 

01:03:50.579 --> 01:03:54.359
 the electrons because they show videos and 

01:03:52.619 --> 01:03:56.099
 about 60 do not remember the user what 

01:03:54.359 --> 01:03:58.079
 he is interested in doing is being 

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:59.579
 lazy is there on the couch to consume 

01:03:58.079 --> 01:04:01.859
 content and is not so interested 

01:03:59.579 --> 01:04:04.740
 enter paragraph text paragraphs and 

01:04:01.859 --> 01:04:07.380
 no not so interested present 

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:09.420
 in apps that take a lot of interaction 

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.039
 to do something interesting is 

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.990
 so I think the fundamental challenge 

01:04:11.039 --> 01:04:15.450
 How did you get on the technical side for the challenge? 

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:17.460
 fundamental is not knowing how to write the 

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:19.980
 fundamental challenge is to have 

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:23.819
 this vision of what to write for a drop 

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:26.069
 it the market for google tv it is 

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:28.470
 growing much more then according to 

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:30.240
 and inflation in the new countries will 

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.160
 appearing opportunities are appearing 

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.180
 new goes to new apps is to do 

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.650
 quite successful 

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:37.410
 then definitely recommended for 

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:39.210
 everyone who does not, who is not 

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:41.460
 start doing it still take a look 

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:43.230
 on the mastercard and start thinking about 

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.859
 first not so much on how to do 

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:47.380
 shadow google tv 

01:04:44.859 --> 01:04:49.390
 think if it makes sense your ep works 

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:51.339
 google tv itself does not make sense to think 

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:52.930
 in what other variant of the south would 

01:04:51.339 --> 01:04:55.089
 You suddenly have a school. 

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:57.039
 which works great for mobile and 

01:04:55.089 --> 01:04:58.359
 depends on interaction and suddenly has 

01:04:57.039 --> 01:05:00.009
 another version of it that is really cool 

01:04:58.359 --> 01:05:02.140
 design or TV that does not exist 

01:05:00.009 --> 01:05:05.680
 creation to the scene then lose everything 

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:07.749
 adapting the use case to the 

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:11.289
 However, adapting a question of adapting the 

01:05:07.749 --> 01:05:16.299
 code on this tip google tv itself 

01:05:11.289 --> 01:05:18.670
 One more question in New York is when 

01:05:16.299 --> 01:05:20.680
 puts a google player app 

01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:23.499
 directly available for the whole 

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.640
 planet I can imitate the countries or 

01:05:23.499 --> 01:05:28.119
 depending on the language I have 

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:30.279
 I automatically get it to restrict 

01:05:28.119 --> 01:05:33.210
 some countries have something of a law of 

01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:35.769
 country that does not accept an app 

01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:37.869
 what happens then when you publish 

01:05:35.769 --> 01:05:39.489
 google app is by default not 

01:05:37.869 --> 01:05:41.890
 I know that you specifically restricted 

01:05:39.489 --> 01:05:43.480
 it will be available to all 

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:44.890
 planets in the universe where it is 

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.170
 able 

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:48.759
 at the moment the applicant in the universe where 

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.170
 It works the planet earth people are 

01:05:48.759 --> 01:05:52.450
 trying to believe in our planet 

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:54.460
 moments but inside the planet earth he 

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:55.930
 it works by default it goes 

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.890
 operate in all countries that can 

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:58.960
 be a player 

01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:00.460
 if you make no choice 

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.660
 find I just want to be available 

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.220
 for all countries 

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.930
 now different countries have different 

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:06.789
 laws depending on the type of 

01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:07.930
 application it can be locked in 

01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:09.700
 some countries, right? 

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:12.640
 There are countries, for example, where 

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:16.539
 extremely are controllers about 

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:17.289
 g game app and gaming games 

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:20.589
 bit right 

01:06:17.289 --> 01:06:22.630
 there are a lot of good games but there are countries 

01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:24.819
 which control for example the application 

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:27.549
 that are of deck except it is any 

01:06:24.819 --> 01:06:30.130
 anything that might suggest gambling 

01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:31.779
 then it is in these cases that the 

01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:33.549
 its application-side only not looking like a 

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:34.509
 certain country is not by some filter 

01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:36.880
 buckley 

01:06:34.509 --> 01:06:38.140
 but that's what I said. 

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.299
 it was you who did not want to specify which 

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.380
 are the countries where you will block 

01:06:40.299 --> 01:06:42.630
 over active or not 

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.799
 and recalls that it is entirely 

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:46.089
 Developer's responsibility to know 

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:48.249
 in which countries it can launch a 

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:49.660
 application on the other and does not 

01:06:48.249 --> 01:06:51.819
 monitoring applications that are 

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:54.999
 sent auto-tracking 

01:06:51.819 --> 01:06:56.680
 to determine for example if you 

01:06:54.999 --> 01:06:58.330
 tries to send a small porch or 

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.710
 Do you intend to 

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:01.750
 a small one that has some form of 

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:04.510
 abuse of Google's terms of service is 

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:05.920
 but we are not an authority to 

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:07.150
 say what you can and can not do 

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.180
 in each country, right? 

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:11.620
 so if you make an ep that plays in a 

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:14.410
 country is the responsibility of the 

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:16.150
 developer is to know what the laws are 

01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:18.370
 of each country what you can do or 

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:22.290
 no we do not do a previous review 

01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:25.780
 in editorial and applications 

01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:27.850
 so it's always important to be aware of 

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:29.650
 these legal matters, we do not 

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:31.960
 we are no tax authority in the 

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:33.160
 responsibility is always the responsibility of the 

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.660
 developer collect taxes 

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.980
 properly then we do not have 

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:37.980
 no authority in this area 

01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:41.579
 This is interesting because it gives a lot of 

01:07:39.509 --> 01:07:43.140
 freedom on the other hand has 

01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:45.019
 developer has enough and has to 

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:50.569
 use this fairly responsibly 

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:53.699
 It's one more question about 

01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:56.369
 advertising is as in the case where I 

01:07:53.699 --> 01:07:58.469
 I bought the app the go go won 

01:07:56.369 --> 01:07:59.759
 something about it forced to use but the 

01:07:58.469 --> 01:08:02.699
 I can create a mechanism 

01:07:59.759 --> 01:08:09.150
 advertising and not use the property where 

01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:11.729
 What do we mean, do not you remember? 

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:13.380
 who was at the service of the goal but 

01:08:11.729 --> 01:08:14.849
 as far as I know if you can have many 

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:18.119
 apps that use other 

01:08:14.849 --> 01:08:19.920
 public announcements in the new then 

01:08:18.119 --> 01:08:21.000
 I think there's no restriction on you. 

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.859
 can make your own solution 

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.619
 advertising you can invent your 

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:27.270
 own solution 

01:08:24.619 --> 01:08:28.739
 I particularly already mean not me. 

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:31.529
 I am not an authority in this is not just because 

01:08:28.739 --> 01:08:33.509
 I'm talking here but I give one 

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:36.929
 serious look at the google service 

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:38.579
 play but so far as I can remember it is 

01:08:36.929 --> 01:08:40.739
 My memory is not very good, I do not 

01:08:38.579 --> 01:08:43.109
 I remember that we went and today but how far 

01:08:40.739 --> 01:08:44.460
 lembro does not have any restriction on goal 

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:50.029
 play about it 

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:53.309
 It is then, but I would respond. 

01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:55.290
 about advertising is interesting 

01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:56.639
 not only about advertising, it reminds 

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:58.589
 something stronger than this is the 

01:08:56.639 --> 01:09:01.319
 there is not a 

01:08:58.589 --> 01:09:02.759
 to play or not play then there is a lot 

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:04.859
 people who think government is a 

01:09:02.759 --> 01:09:07.109
 monopoly then if you use android you 

01:09:04.859 --> 01:09:10.020
 have to use the other one is lie 

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:12.089
 copley it you can publish a map 

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.679
 google play and you prefer free 

01:09:12.089 --> 01:09:16.139
 to publish one and any other 

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:17.579
 market or even a web stream without 

01:09:16.139 --> 01:09:19.949
 no market at all can much 

01:09:17.579 --> 01:09:22.259
 Well you'll meet on the web and leave now. 

01:09:19.949 --> 01:09:24.150
 download a sinner such hebe you want 

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:26.040
 do this you do not like the gol players 

01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:27.750
 did not need the suit even has a 

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.400
 thing that is fundamental and to differentiate 

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:31.049
 which is what the terms of service of the 

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.940
 google play and what you can or can not 

01:09:31.049 --> 01:09:35.730
 to do with android what you can or not 

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.349
 to do with android is to that limit, right? 

01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:39.480
 because it is a relationship between you and 

01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:42.509
 Not only is our user limited by our 

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.920
 relationship or you but what you 

01:09:42.509 --> 01:09:46.440
 can make a goal is a little more 

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.759
 for example is to have a series of 

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.920
 a category of ethics that can not 

01:09:47.759 --> 01:09:52.460
 enter the goal plate for example to apps 

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:54.560
 as with explicit sex content 

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.700
 It's certain that you can not get into the goal, that's it. 

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.320
 does not mean that you can not do the 

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:59.239
 android is not only means it can not 

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.950
 publish a book of this type new player 

01:09:59.239 --> 01:10:02.420
 but nothing prevents you from for example from 

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:05.090
 follow a trend directly through 

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:07.100
 the same thing with use by 

01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:09.050
 make apps that are apps that are 

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:11.510
 other markets you can not publish 

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:13.910
 in google play, it's me, for example. 

01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:16.040
 I can publish the ep and call bruno play 

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.840
 inside the goal board you want is 

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.969
 decide that he does not like the goal and I want to 

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.570
 make a new store called by a 

01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:22.340
 player 

01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:24.650
 and I can not put the bruno play 

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.150
 inside the goal is but I can publish the 

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:26.960
 group on a play through the web by 

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:28.940
 example 

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.910
 then you can not make a goal and 

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:34.730
 you can do from the web is really 

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:35.540
 important as was the case of creating 11 

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.739
 no play 

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:39.560
 but anyway you have to enable 

01:10:36.739 --> 01:10:41.930
 the android they receive apply in sta no 

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.280
 how google play accepts the 

01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:46.430
 applications that scroll down and 

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.590
 automatically was already released 

01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:51.469
 is the user has to have to put the 

01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:52.820
 crytek box from receiving assets from 

01:10:51.469 --> 01:10:57.469
 other sources, right? 

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:59.510
 and yes it's true because if I enter 

01:10:57.469 --> 01:11:01.340
 I directly focused on modifying where I 

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:05.989
 I have access to this part of wanting 

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:09.140
 unrestricted use of a source code 

01:11:05.989 --> 01:11:10.550
 even this is taught us to respect the 

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.980
 android source code because it is a 

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:15.080
 source code does not win on your machine is 

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:17.239
 You can do whatever you want with it, right? 

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:20.090
 so there is no restriction of this 

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:21.620
 type when you can occur within the 

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:22.489
 license terms you can do what 

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.960
 you want 

01:11:22.489 --> 01:11:26.210
 including android source code 

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.680
 modify freely on it was in the 

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:29.750
 your device you can modify 

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.300
 freely distribute the devices 

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:35.530
 you can freely modify and 

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:38.090
 manufacturing devices including various 

01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:39.800
 manufacturers make neither a manufacturer 

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:41.390
 You must have google permission to 

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.460
 use android source code 

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:44.630
 the manufacturer needs to knock on the door and 

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:47.120
 said so I can use the product 

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:48.710
 android year everyone automatically 

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.080
 can use the code was to change 

01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:53.390
 so this is one of the great advantages 

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:55.040
 of android on what's different from saying 

01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:56.390
 You're free to do this to your 

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.880
 device is because there are 

01:11:56.390 --> 01:12:01.250
 devices where you can replace the 

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:04.430
 there are devices where you can 

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:05.590
 you can not, that means it's a 

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:07.030
 thing that depends on the factory 

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:08.710
 agents do not have seven 

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:10.420
 manufacturers that allow 

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:12.159
 other than most do not 

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:14.830
 but if you buy for example google 

01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:16.869
 spirit of peace with the galaxy nexus you 

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:19.960
 You can do this, you can not 

01:12:16.869 --> 01:12:22.480
 It's very easy to give it a 

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:24.040
 that what you want in him it's done 

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.150
 to make it the effect you can 

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:29.290
 do this kind of thing 

01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:32.530
 Then you can download to finish I go 

01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:34.090
 just barely reached the area in 

01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:36.130
 which you can download to the strong loop 

01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:38.739
 you can install on your own device 

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:39.760
 can you make a website book me 

01:12:38.739 --> 01:12:41.650
 wanted a version of android is very 

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.199
 best of the original contract and the eyes 

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:45.820
 can pick up and install kilos and 

01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:47.940
 sixty-one inscription with it only that 

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.889
 The only thing we have one 

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:52.360
 certification process to ensure 

01:12:50.889 --> 01:12:54.219
 that the abuses that we 

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.690
 we got the droid brand 

01:12:54.219 --> 01:12:58.150
 they are compatible with a series of 

01:12:55.690 --> 01:13:00.130
 tests to avoid having you there 

01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:01.510
 android device that does not 

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:04.330
 are compatible with anything 

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:07.030
 to maintain this compatibility is 

01:13:04.330 --> 01:13:09.520
 working fine I just give the name 

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:11.619
 from android to those devices that 

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.869
 function fashion compatible so 

01:13:11.619 --> 01:13:15.880
 compatible with what we expect more 

01:13:13.869 --> 01:13:17.320
 means that if these mean if the 

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.639
 device you did not work 

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.070
 when in this way you can call 

01:13:18.639 --> 01:13:22.810
 something else and did not understand the 

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:25.090
 just can not say it's not time for the 

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:28.570
 official android device 

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:31.179
 so I saw on the river a while until already 

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:33.940
 about how the update medium worked 

01:13:31.179 --> 01:13:37.030
 of operators 

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:39.130
 victims is a type of democracy that 

01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:40.810
 source code came to the manufacturer 

01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:41.920
 manufacturer to make a modification and 

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:43.690
 operator 

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.300
 I loved doing this change after 

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:49.420
 google having to release for later power 

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:52.300
 having a cult has something more complex 

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:53.860
 said is a very high cost or what the 

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:56.619
 what can you say about why 

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:58.150
 of this delay even taxi x 

01:13:56.619 --> 01:14:00.520
 Brazil has not yet been used 

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:03.099
 I have nexus united states that he 

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:06.489
 soon reorganized many people report 

01:14:03.099 --> 01:14:09.460
 x even though a nexus was not 

01:14:06.489 --> 01:14:11.800
 updated on the galaxy it's not quite a 

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:13.060
 galaxy odor is administered by 

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.520
 samsung in Brazil, right? 

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:17.980
 it does not automatically receive the 

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.360
 first goal and I definitely do not 

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.090
 I do not recommend 

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.190
 ah I do not recommend plugging it 

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:26.110
 bild of him 

01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:28.180
 I mean why do you ask the question 

01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:30.070
 your guarantee but if you are, if you want to 

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.880
 you be brave you can take 

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:33.520
 do it right 

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.190
 You can pick it up and give it a go. 

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.080
 boot or e on the bike and battión install there 

01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:40.510
 It's very easy to do this, why do 

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.130
 with the direction of the event the actor jeremy 

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:44.110
 binnie are available you can still 

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:45.010
 download download on the net the public today 

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:47.590
 officially 

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:50.380
 You can lower the tone of the galaxy. 

01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:54.310
 nexus project because he bin and I'm me 

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:56.620
 I recently did this xis here 

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:58.450
 in Brazil it worked very well now it's 

01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.440
 recommended does not recommend 

01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:01.570
 because it makes you miss 

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.730
 guarantees but the period of 

01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:06.970
 for example I do not see why in the 

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:09.040
 urn but he's answering your question 

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:11.590
 original is why why is it so difficult 

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.990
 update therefore no update is 

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:15.370
 something that depends 

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:17.020
 that is to say, it depends on the 

01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:19.720
 manufacturer or operator because at the end 

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.120
 it is they who are responsible to the 

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.890
 consumer to support that 

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:28.360
 I can tell if you think I'm a 

01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:30.550
 operator, so I'm responsible. 

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.560
 to users because that 

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:36.130
 phone I asked him to work and 

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.840
 if I upgrade if and directly to 

01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:39.850
 google fort immediately 

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.190
 without much testing is betrayal and 

01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:44.620
 example to finish my support team 

01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:46.630
 to support these cases and it would be 

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.920
 or not be irresponsible on my part 

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:49.600
 what power could have for example a 

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.550
 android modification that works 

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.410
 very well certain devices but in this 

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:54.220
 device that I was selling 

01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:55.810
 last year 

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.700
 it might not break I do not do it 

01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:59.140
 update and suddenly you just can not 

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:02.050
 make calls 

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:03.850
 then it is a very responsibility 

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:06.460
 large number that the operating 

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:08.530
 keep your devices running 

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:10.690
 on the other hand obviously does not have a 

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:13.390
 capitalism in which the interest of the 

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:15.130
 of manufacturers is to see devices in the 

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:17.080
 so naturally they will prefer the 

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:19.000
 times you buy if it were a new one 

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.070
 but sometimes it is not so capitalist 

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.600
 because the following is the 

01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:24.580
 personal cell technologies 

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.230
 fast development a lot that 

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.960
 I've seen complaints about why it manufactures 

01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:31.090
 x does not update the device and it is because 

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.530
 sometimes does not give children health and 

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:33.099
 can handle a more 

01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:34.840
 recent 

01:16:33.099 --> 01:16:36.609
 today because if you put cell phone and 

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.679
 much Spanish sweat to the air force 

01:16:36.609 --> 01:16:40.780
 of the type of put and realizes that 

01:16:38.679 --> 01:16:41.889
 it rotates half the speed it gives 

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:44.649
 another version 

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:46.959
 so mobile devices are things 

01:16:44.649 --> 01:16:49.899
 extremely complicated you write the 

01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:50.739
 Driver 17 is a really slow thing and 

01:16:49.899 --> 01:16:52.719
 expensive 

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:54.849
 so I mean I've never worked in a 

01:16:52.719 --> 01:16:58.449
 operator or manufacturers to know 

01:16:54.849 --> 01:16:59.829
 exactly what it costs but I already 

01:16:58.449 --> 01:17:02.169
 I have worked with engineering of 

01:16:59.829 --> 01:17:04.300
 software and I have already worked writing 

01:17:02.169 --> 01:17:05.979
 driver is inclusive I know it is 

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.659
 extremely complicated you make a 

01:17:05.979 --> 01:17:09.669
 driver for an embedded device 

01:17:07.659 --> 01:17:11.559
 so you especially keep the 

01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:13.510
 things updated when things like that 

01:17:11.559 --> 01:17:14.919
 change is necessary to make a version 

01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:17.199
 new android has a full suit 

01:17:14.919 --> 01:17:18.760
 with experience and do not even decide that 

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:22.749
 will map different memory and 

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:24.489
 Suddenly my panties broke so it is 

01:17:22.749 --> 01:17:26.889
 reasonably complicated you make a 

01:17:24.489 --> 01:17:29.499
 Existing device update is well 

01:17:26.889 --> 01:17:30.849
 complicated is then a series of factors 

01:17:29.499 --> 01:17:33.249
 who join him 

01:17:30.849 --> 01:17:34.929
 he really does what we have 

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:36.729
 as ideal for the android system what 

01:17:34.929 --> 01:17:38.590
 understood the world with the Android system 

01:17:36.729 --> 01:17:41.109
 This is not so important. 

01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:42.609
 the fact that the manufacturer does not 

01:17:41.109 --> 01:17:45.789
 android should not be so with the sky 

01:17:42.609 --> 01:17:47.379
 that the ecosystem and the 

01:17:45.789 --> 01:17:49.209
 face west gives all the tools 

01:17:47.379 --> 01:17:50.399
 for developers to 0 are 

01:17:49.209 --> 01:17:54.459
 compatible with multiple platforms 

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:56.409
 because it's a lie if I 

01:17:54.459 --> 01:17:57.820
 said not one day all Brazil will 

01:17:56.409 --> 01:17:59.559
 be the same, everyone will have the 

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.989
 latest version of android takes me people 

01:17:59.559 --> 01:18:04.929
 in my opinion this is not going to happen 

01:18:01.989 --> 01:18:06.369
 because this will only happen if people 

01:18:04.929 --> 01:18:08.559
 had very strict control of the 

01:18:06.369 --> 01:18:10.300
 droid is something that is not in the 

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:12.699
 ours do not speak our philosophy today 

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:14.889
 On day our philosophy I asked of 

01:18:12.699 --> 01:18:16.749
 diversity is a philosophy 

01:18:14.889 --> 01:18:18.639
 manufacturers may they should have this 

01:18:16.749 --> 01:18:20.979
 freedom to put the version of android 

01:18:18.639 --> 01:18:22.689
 they want the devices according to 

01:18:20.979 --> 01:18:23.649
 what makes the most sense for them and 

01:18:22.689 --> 01:18:26.590
 by users 

01:18:23.649 --> 01:18:28.030
 then it adversity you will be 

01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:30.129
 always in the heart of android will be 

01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:31.629
 Difficult you have a hard time imagining 

01:18:30.129 --> 01:18:34.959
 android ecosystem without this diversity 

01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:37.510
 platform and the ecosystem and the 

01:18:34.959 --> 01:18:39.639
 sk is all are prepared for this 

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:41.109
 they are made for it so I do not 

01:18:39.639 --> 01:18:43.300
 I think this is a very negative thing. 

01:18:41.109 --> 01:18:44.409
 on the contrary, I have this diversity 

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:47.020
 freedom is a very very thing 

01:18:44.409 --> 01:18:49.090
 positive android differentiating it 

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:51.250
 before other platforms I think 

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:52.810
 this explains in large part the success of the 

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:54.520
 android on the market out there is not for 

01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:57.250
 That's what we have over a thousand 

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:59.620
 android devices on the market 

01:18:57.250 --> 01:19:04.600
 I think it's much more than what 

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:07.360
 many other platforms and in case of 

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:10.390
 a scenario of being a top of the line is 

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:13.360
 new update is because there were still 

01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:15.280
 time producing android testing is 

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.130
 now he launches the new one in my time 

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:20.050
 still if the explanation can happen 

01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:23.670
 this is because it is because the android is 

01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:23.670
 all very fast then for example 

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.940
 just left because can win leaves 

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:30.130
 I'm still in the middle of the phrase to speak 

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:33.010
 Look, it'll just roll right back to 

01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:35.080
 me then is the person the other actions 

01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:37.630
 happen so fast then if you are 

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:39.370
 a manufacturer probably if you are 

01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:41.050
 if you have for example if you pass a 

01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:42.430
 year them a positive return 

01:19:41.050 --> 01:19:43.720
 sometimes it's hard for you to keep 

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:45.460
 conversion and sometimes have problems 

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.920
 For example, the system has a 

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:49.930
 specific technical reason why the 

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.160
 garden does not work our goal x 

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:53.500
 so I'll try to cross the avenue 

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.030
 break because no one else does something x 

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:56.590
 with memory here does not work with 

01:19:55.030 --> 01:20:00.460
 my abduction plaque 

01:19:56.590 --> 01:20:02.560
 It happens then, but it means 

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:04.570
 background is the freedom for the 

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:06.850
 and for the manufacturer to do so is 

01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:08.350
 for example your users 

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:10.000
 that is, user has the freedom to 

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:11.560
 buy other positives and for him it is 

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.500
 much is crucially important to have 

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:16.120
 gerb even so he will look for another 

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.940
 manufacturer another operator in our 

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.530
 part of the freedom of the market and 

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:22.090
 user can choose whatever they want 

01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:23.500
 the manufacturers he has to respect 

01:20:22.090 --> 01:20:26.620
 that's because nobody but nobody 

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:29.440
 would buy their devices and 

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:32.130
 respect for example in the case of 

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:36.100
 apple releases developers a beta 

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:38.770
 month or so, as well as the 

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:40.750
 android does not use family it already with 

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:42.880
 he shows when he is already doing 

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:44.920
 an event that shows the new android already 

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:48.370
 shows the final version already analyzes already 

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:50.770
 releases the source code is there is a good 

01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:53.620
 watch a beta that gets first 

01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:55.690
 google professionals with a limited 

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:58.870
 and sim developers fine 

01:20:55.690 --> 01:20:59.860
 good to good obviously we make goals 

01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:02.560
 internal 

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.880
 so our people have access 

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.340
 things as they are developing 

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:08.290
 but we do not have a public program 

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:10.420
 It's not supposed to do that so we do not 

01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:12.760
 has a public initiative to do 

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:14.410
 for example air let's make a beta 

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.940
 open for developers 

01:21:14.410 --> 01:21:17.890
 I think this is a suggestion 

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:19.780
 good evening and I think a lot of people already 

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:21.640
 they did it but for now we do not 

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:23.800
 has a forecast to make a program 

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.730
 themselves because even so what the 

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.930
 people want 

01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:28.930
 we suddenly made a program 

01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:30.310
 of these is that it would stop self 

01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:32.140
 encourages you to do things that are 

01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:34.150
 compatible with 

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:36.100
 ideally in the ideal world when it launched 

01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:37.540
 When did you launch jelly bean? 

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:40.900
 application 2 15 years should break 

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:42.550
 none in the ideal world our side in 

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:44.949
 all those who were 23 years old 

01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:46.630
 working continue and it's just not 

01:21:44.949 --> 01:21:48.250
 true if any developer 

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:49.660
 players are using something 

01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:50.320
 that they should not for example map and 

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.850
 private 

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.040
 I see a lot of application that uses skin 

01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:56.290
 Private for example picks only private 

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.340
 rather than public pirates 

01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:59.830
 and then released a new version of android 

01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:01.420
 mg by breaking because they change did 

01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:05.860
 private partnerships 

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:07.150
 then in that case telling her what 

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:08.890
 it means who is wrong in this case 

01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:11.230
 he is a player who only uses private 

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:13.540
 but in the ideal world, I do not want to 

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:14.890
 public beta because it should be 

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.690
 really compatible 

01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:18.550
 This is something we always have to do. 

01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:20.050
 a public beta to look for and if these 

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:21.670
 repetitive things could be the pressure 

01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:24.640
 during even doing things that are 

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:27.250
 100% backwards compatible 

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:29.500
 in summary, there is no plan 

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:31.660
 current spirit of making certain 

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:33.100
 but the suggestion is not very 

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.770
 interesting I would particularly like 

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:37.480
 to see it happen 

01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:38.260
 Good, we think it ended on time. 

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.330
 right here 

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.860
 so it's good for whoever it was 

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:43.930
 with questions I would like to ask in 

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:46.030
 today will make this new way here 

01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:48.130
 in two weeks 

01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:49.449
 questions through the decree that will 

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:51.400
 post a link soon 

01:22:49.449 --> 01:22:53.290
 It's good, thank you, everyone who watched it. 

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.989
 It's nice, I'm glad to talk to you. 

01:22:53.290 --> 01:22:58.180
 and see you in two weeks 

01:22:55.989 --> 01:23:00.520
 the next rival and promises to return another 

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:03.840
 instead of directly serving good 

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.840
 Thank you all and mistake
