00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.158
Social networks have been around as long as

00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:04.548
there’ve been people forming communities but the

00:00:04.548 --> 00:00:06.997
modern study of social networks is different because

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:09.583
it’s now possible to put together social networks that

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:12.381
include data on millions of people. Now that’s more

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:14.469
than any one individual could possibly hope to

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.015
understand in detail. Unit four explores the notion of

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:19.515
statistics, numbers that summarize complex

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.099
structures like social networks. We’re going to take a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.599
look at how we can compute statistics quickly, so we

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.391
can get a handle on the biggest social networks

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.000
around. Here we go.
