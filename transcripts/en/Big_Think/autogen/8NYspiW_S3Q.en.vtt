this power to make choices about whether
 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.280
this power to make choices about whether
you will move towards others in grace

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290
you will move towards others in grace
 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.950

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230
you're essentially a creating a Gehenna
 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.649
you're essentially a creating a Gehenna
on earth and so you're creating a hell

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659
on earth and so you're creating a hell
 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.700
on earth and so you're creating a hell
on earth so I begin with these as very

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710
on earth so I begin with these as very
 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.140
on earth so I begin with these as very
powerful words and pictures of what we

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150
powerful words and pictures of what we
 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.570
powerful words and pictures of what we
as human beings can create right now and

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580
as human beings can create right now and
 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.050
as human beings can create right now and
when you talk about that apparently for

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060
when you talk about that apparently for
 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.999
when you talk about that apparently for
a lot of religious people being right

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009
a lot of religious people being right
 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.890
a lot of religious people being right
isn't enough it's being right and other

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900
isn't enough it's being right and other
 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.860
isn't enough it's being right and other
people being wrong it's being in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
people being wrong it's being in
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.430
people being wrong it's being in
other people being out it's being part

of the chosen and other people not being
part of the chosen for many people going

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760
part of the chosen for many people going
 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.990
part of the chosen for many people going
back to why spirituality has been so

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000
back to why spirituality has been so
 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.660
back to why spirituality has been so
sort of corrupted for so many people for

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670
sort of corrupted for so many people for
 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.920
sort of corrupted for so many people for
many people their fundamental

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930
many people their fundamental
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.600
many people their fundamental
understanding of the spiritual life was

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
understanding of the spiritual life was
 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.789
understanding of the spiritual life was
figuring out who's got it who doesn't

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799
figuring out who's got it who doesn't
 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.390
figuring out who's got it who doesn't
who's in who's out and I I begin with a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400
who's in who's out and I I begin with a
 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.500
who's in who's out and I I begin with a
much more inclusive love for everybody

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510
much more inclusive love for everybody
 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.250
much more inclusive love for everybody
but then we can right now choose to live

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260
but then we can right now choose to live
 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.860
but then we can right now choose to live
particular ways in this world it's

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870
particular ways in this world it's
 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.740
particular ways in this world it's
really interesting like if you look at

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750
really interesting like if you look at
 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.569
really interesting like if you look at
the Bible which for many people in the

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579
the Bible which for many people in the
 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.130
the Bible which for many people in the
Western world was sort of the guiding

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
Western world was sort of the guiding
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.250
Western world was sort of the guiding
the Old Testament there isn't really any

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260
the Old Testament there isn't really any
 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.780
the Old Testament there isn't really any
sort of view of the afterlife the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
sort of view of the afterlife the
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.140
sort of view of the afterlife the
closest you get is a word for pit a word

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150
closest you get is a word for pit a word
 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.479
closest you get is a word for pit a word
for abyss which basically means you die

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489
for abyss which basically means you die
 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.599
for abyss which basically means you die
and you're not here so this idea that

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609
and you're not here so this idea that
 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.910
and you're not here so this idea that
the whole thing is about when you die is

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920
the whole thing is about when you die is
 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.080
the whole thing is about when you die is
not really the way that lots of people

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090
not really the way that lots of people
 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.360
not really the way that lots of people
have thought about it and that the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370
have thought about it and that the
 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.089
have thought about it and that the
phrase eternal life was a very first

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099
phrase eternal life was a very first
 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.740
phrase eternal life was a very first
century Jewish way of talking about

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750
century Jewish way of talking about
 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.740
century Jewish way of talking about
living in harmony with the divine right

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750
living in harmony with the divine right
 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.559
living in harmony with the divine right
now so eternal life wasn't a kind of

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569
now so eternal life wasn't a kind of
 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.809
now so eternal life wasn't a kind of
life that happens when you die eternal

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819
life that happens when you die eternal
 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.990
life that happens when you die eternal
life was understood to be a certain

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000
life was understood to be a certain
 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.240
life was understood to be a certain
quality of life that you're experiencing

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250
quality of life that you're experiencing
 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.430
quality of life that you're experiencing
right now where you're in right

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440
right now where you're in right
 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.559
right now where you're in right
relationship with the earth with the

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569
relationship with the earth with the
 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.360
relationship with the earth with the
environment with each other with

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370
environment with each other with
 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.000
environment with each other with
yourself that was considered eternal

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010
yourself that was considered eternal
 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.610
yourself that was considered eternal
life so I think we should start here I

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620
life so I think we should start here I
 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.510
life so I think we should start here I
think this is where the action is

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520
 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.580
you
