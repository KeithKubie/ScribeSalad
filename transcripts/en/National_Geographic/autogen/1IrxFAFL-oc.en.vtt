beyond the immediate impact zone it's

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510
beyond the immediate impact zone it's
 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.480
beyond the immediate impact zone it's
not the first strike that counts

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490
not the first strike that counts
 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.969
not the first strike that counts
it's the devastating wave of heat and

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979
it's the devastating wave of heat and
 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.950
it's the devastating wave of heat and
shrapnel that spewed out from ground

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960
shrapnel that spewed out from ground
 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.950
shrapnel that spewed out from ground
zero

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960
zero
 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.460
zero
we can see the streak come in the vapor

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470
we can see the streak come in the vapor
 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.670
we can see the streak come in the vapor
plume come off ejecta heading downrange

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680
plume come off ejecta heading downrange
 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.180
plume come off ejecta heading downrange
and we see these big giant blocks that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190
and we see these big giant blocks that
 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.050
and we see these big giant blocks that
begin to break off do the shock wave

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060
begin to break off do the shock wave
 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.249
begin to break off do the shock wave
when you think about an impact do you

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259
when you think about an impact do you
 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.290
when you think about an impact do you
think about getting hit by the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300
think about getting hit by the
 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.980
think about getting hit by the
projectile what's much more dangerous I

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990
projectile what's much more dangerous I
 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.990
projectile what's much more dangerous I
think is all that stuff heading

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000
think is all that stuff heading
 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.850
think is all that stuff heading
downrange carrying with it

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860
downrange carrying with it
 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.490
downrange carrying with it
vapor dust hot gas in broiling most of

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500
vapor dust hot gas in broiling most of
 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.870
vapor dust hot gas in broiling most of
North America that's the stuff that's

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880
North America that's the stuff that's
 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.150
North America that's the stuff that's
very scary
