00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.435
These three choices are correct. At the spot where two lines cross, or

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:09.340
intersect, they have to go through the exact same point, which is why they are

00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:14.080
able to touch in the first place. So this point of intersection lies both on

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:19.005
this orange line and on this purple line. They both pass through this location.

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:24.383
Remember, though, that a point on a line gives us x and y values that satisfy

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:29.836
the equation for that line, or in other words, make it true. If a point lies on

00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:35.112
both lines, then it must do that for both of those equations. That means that

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:40.311
for any two lines that intersect, there's some pair of x and y values that we

00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:46.736
could plug into either equation, and create a true statement for each. This is

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:53.456
the same thing as saying that these values create a solution to both equations.
