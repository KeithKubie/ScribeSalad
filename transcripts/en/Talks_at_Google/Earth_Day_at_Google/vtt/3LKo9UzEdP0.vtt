RACHEL: Today, we have
Beth Greer joining us here

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.530
in San Francisco.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.820
It's very exciting.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.760
To give a little bit
of intro about Beth,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.930
I met Beth through
a mutual friend.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.972
And her book, which is
called "Super Natural Home"

00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:17.320
is what we're going to
be talking about today.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.790
And I couldn't put it down.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.060
It was actually quite
riveting how many things that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.590
I had in my own house
or that I put on myself

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.721
or would eat that actually
were not that healthy in most

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:32.700
circumstances to even
have in your home.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.226
So I am really excited
to bring Beth here today.

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:38.600
And she's going to talk about
her book, like I mentioned,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.683
and help us understand
what we bring into our work

00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:43.795
environment, our bodies,
and our home that matter

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:45.250
and to be healthy.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.810
So we'll hear her
ultra-practical advice

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.500
on what you can do today to
limit exposure to chemicals,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.164
toxins, what I like to call
icky things and, in general,

00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:58.455
the things that just aren't
safe for your health, home,

00:00:58.455 --> 00:00:59.830
or person.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.210
So without further ado,
please welcome Beth.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.459
BETH GREER: Thank you, Rachel.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.250
BETH GREER: So every one of
you in this room already knows

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.580
a lot about going green.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.280
I mean look at the company
you're working for-- Google.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.460
How incredible.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.720
They have an amazing
recycling program.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.190
And they have solar panels.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.130
And they feed you amazing
food, organic food

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.690
sourced from local forms.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.130
That's fantastic.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.685
How many of you are
eating organic at home?

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:29.840
OK, good.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.850
And how many of you are
driving energy-efficient or

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.450
fuel-efficient cars
or biking to work

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.170
or maybe taking
the rail or ferry?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.910
Yay!

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.380
Well, that's fantastic.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.920
So I think that there's
a missing shade of green

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.540
though, because energy
efficiency is great.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.250
Reducing your carbon
footprint is amazing.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.650
But there's this missing shade.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.850
And I think that it's avoiding
the chemical toxins that we're

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.400
all exposed to in our food,
in our everyday products that

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.410
might be actually
making us sick.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.030
So I wanted to read
something to you.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.939
I think you might
have seen it here.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.669
And I would love
to get some input

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.340
and get your opinion about
what you think of this.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.790
For the first time in
the history of the world,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.330
every human being
is now subjected

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.070
to contact with
dangerous chemicals

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.940
from the moment of
conception until death.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.266
So when do you think
that was written?

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:30.764
AUDIENCE: Rachel Carson.

00:02:30.764 --> 00:02:31.430
BETH GREER: Yes.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.160
So would you believe it's
not written recently?

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.925
And you know.

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:39.550
It was written in 1962,
over 50 years ago,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.150
by Rachel Carson, who's the
author of the book "Silent

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.310
Spring," which
she's the forefront

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.510
of the environmental movement.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.350
And what's happened
in the last 50 years?

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.650
Well, it's actually
gotten worse.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.990
There are about 80,000
chemicals on the market today,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.690
manufactured today.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.600
And we are exposed to, on
average, about 6,000 of them.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.069
And the kicker is that
only a very small fraction

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.235
have been tested for safety.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.040
Think about our health
crisis right now.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.700
How many of you know of
people who have diabetes?

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.000
What about people
who were diagnosed

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.710
with cancer this year?

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.490
So almost all of us, right?

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.190
There are scientific
studies that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.825
are proving that these chemicals
are impacting infertility.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:38.580
And they're hormone disruptors.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.640
They're causing girls to
go into puberty early.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.360
It's really disturbing.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.540
The autism rate alone.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.360
Just in the past 10 years,
autism has increased by 78%.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.650
So really, what is going on?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.720
These chemicals
can make you feel

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.140
sleepy and grumpy
and itchy and sneezy.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.610
How may of you ever felt like
one of the seven dwarfs, right?

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.780
So in my case, it started with
a sharp pain in my shoulder.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.410
And I remember this.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.670
It was 11 years ago.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.120
I was in Maui in December 2002,
enjoying the beautiful climate.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.530
And this pain came
out of nowhere.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.000
And when I came
back to this coast,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.530
I went to my chiropractor
to see what was going on.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.820
And he suggested I get an MRI.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:45.670
And this is what
was in my chest.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.310
Not a tennis ball,
but it was a tumor.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.530
It was this big.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.640
Imagine having that inside you.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.950
And I just thought, how
did this happen to me,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.370
when I was doing
everything right?

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.180
I thought I was leading
a healthy lifestyle.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.090
I ate well.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.290
I exercised.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.710
I watched my weight.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.560
I didn't smoke.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.170
I even had a
meditation practice.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.840
So how could this happen to me?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.096
So I went to three top surgeons.

00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:15.470
And they all wanted
to remove it.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.870
They scanned it.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.280
And it was benign.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.880
But they said that this
thing could turn cancerous

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.960
at any moment.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.040
And so one wanted to cut
me under my collarbone

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.750
to get it out.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.410
The second one wanted to
cut me under my armpit.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.240
And the third wanted
to go in from the back

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.970
and remove one of my ribs.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.354
Well, they couldn't agree
on how to remove it.

00:05:35.354 --> 00:05:37.270
But they all agreed that
it was risky surgery,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.360
that I could lose the feeling
in my hand permanently.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.630
And so I just thought, I need
to just stop for a moment

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.000
and just figure this out.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.130
And I got quiet.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.620
I took a breath.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.860
And I just asked for guidance.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.020
And what came to
me was simplify.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.010
So I thought, OK,
what can I simplify?

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.500
What is the easiest thing to do?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.310
And it's the food
that I was eating.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.710
We all eat three times a day.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.030
We have the most
control over that.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.649
And so I looked at
what I was eating.

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:09.440
Even though I thought
I was eating healthy,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.890
I was eating processed food.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.920
I was eating out a lot.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.110
We don't know what's
in our restaurant food.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.330
And so I just decided to do
something kind of radical

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.120
and eat food without any
product labels whatsoever.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.270
And I went on a juice cleanse.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.020
And you know what?

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.440
In just three days,
the pain that I was in,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.910
which was really considerable,
started going away.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.580
And that was remarkable to me.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.950
And I just thought, wow,
I'm on to something here.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.800
What else can I simplify?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.460
And so I took a look at what
I was putting on my skin,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.080
because our skin is not the
barrier that we think it is.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.240
It allows in
microscopic chemicals.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.142
And I looked at my
deodorant, my shampoo.

00:06:46.142 --> 00:06:47.850
And I'm going to talk
about some of this.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.770
There was a paragraph worth
of ingredients on there.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.850
So I switched out
to all natural.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.570
And then I decided
to look at what

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.315
I was surrounding myself with.

00:06:57.315 --> 00:06:59.520
Our household cleaners
are really toxic.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.670
And I'm going to share that
with you in a little bit too.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.170
Switched out to all natural,
got a natural mattress.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.580
And six months-- it took me six
months-- the pain went away.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.070
And six months later, I
had this tumor scanned.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.912
And it had disappeared.

00:07:15.912 --> 00:07:16.940
It disappeared.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.866
It was life changing for me.

00:07:19.866 --> 00:07:21.490
It was just such a
life-changing moment

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.350
to realize that our bodies
are self-healing organisms

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.870
if we get out of the way and
feed them natural products

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.700
and put natural
products on our skin

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.820
and clean with
natural products, just

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.440
become as natural as possible.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.540
So I am going to share with
you some things on this table.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.220
And my promise is
that by the time

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.370
you leave here today that
you're going to really come away

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.860
with feeling empowered
and confident in choosing

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.730
natural safe products,
even though some

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.660
of the information I'm going to
tell you is a little bit scary.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.260
So let's talk about
Brad for minute,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.350
because this is-- one of
the things I love to do

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.930
is I just go into the
stores and buy stuff

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.180
that the average
person is buying.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.340
And so what do you think the
shelf life of a loaf of bread

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.440
should be?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.447
Should be.

00:08:15.447 --> 00:08:16.730
AUDIENCE: A week?

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.050
BETH GREER: A week.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.140
Three, four days, right?

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:20.639
OK.

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:23.550
So if I have to tell
you, and I wrote it down.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.480
This was purchased
February 21, 2013.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.550
I bought these two
loaves of bread.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.760
It is now November 2013.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.330
And it is as squishy
as the day I bought it.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
It's not been in my
refrigerator or my freezer.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.370
It's been sitting
out in my pantry.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.679
There's no mold on it.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.580
So this contains
something that you

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.320
need to pay attention to--
calcium propionate, which

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.720
is a preservative.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.260
And when they feed it
to laboratory animals,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.230
it causes them to
have ADHD behavior.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.110
So it sounds funny.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.770
But it's really kind of sad.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.310
And so an easy switch
would be to buy

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.540
bread that doesn't have
preservatives in it.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.740
And so maybe you have to
freeze it or refrigerate it.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.520
It will save your health.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.020
OK.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.145
Then I went into the store.

00:09:14.145 --> 00:09:15.860
And there's this
blueberry muffin mix.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.850
And it says right on the label,
right on the front cover,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.340
it says artificially flavored
with imitation blueberries.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.060
And I thought, what?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.070
What could be in here that could
make artificial blueberries?

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.570
Do you have any thoughts?

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.610
What?

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.590
AUDIENCE: Raisins.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.170
BETH GREER: Raisins?

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.690
That would be a
healthy choice, right?

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.189
OK.

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:39.790
So I'm going to tell you--
hydrogenated lard, partially

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:44.780
hydrogenated lard, hydrogenated
soybean and cottonseed oil.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.570
So first of all, when
you hydrogenate an oil,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.960
it creates trans fats.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.410
And it causes heart disease.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.880
So we're feeding
this to our children.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.520
I had given a talk.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.980
And this woman said, I
just made that for my kids.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.550
And she didn't notice,
because it was in small print.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.550
She didn't notice it was
artificial blueberries.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.510
How hard would it
be to just throw

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.260
in some natural blueberries
or some raisins?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.710
This also has three
artificial colors.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.110
So I want to just tell you
about artificial colors.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.580
They're banned in Europe.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.520
But they're sold
here in America.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.060
So why are they
banned in Europe?

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.300
Because they've done studies
on artificial colors.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.330
And normal children who
were given these colors

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.360
had temper tantrums,
anger issues.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.040
So we might be unsuspectingly
feeding ourselves and our kids

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.470
this stuff that
really shouldn't be.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.190
Here's Fruity Pebbles.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.160
This is gluten-free.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.201
So people are looking
for a gluten-free option.

00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:44.200
They think it's healthy.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.380
But this is also made with
hydrogenated oil, which

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.080
I found shocking
that children are

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.840
given this hydrogenated oil.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.060
And it's got four colors in it.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.500
The other thing
this has in it is

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.740
9 grams of sugar in a serving.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:03.220
So 9 grams of sugar
is a tablespoon.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:03.780
OK.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.132
3/4 of a cup is a serving.

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:06.090
I don't know about you.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.380
Most people pour in a big bowl.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.360
They're not just eating 3/4 of
a cup, which is about this much.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.834
So you're getting a big
dose of stuff in here.

00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:18.500
And so then I thought,
OK, well this one

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.450
looks healthy-- Fiber One.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.570
It's got 60 calories per
serving, got a lot of fiber.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.930
But it has zero sugar.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.660
So I thought, well, what
are they sweetening it with?

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.320
Aspartame.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.360
So aspartame is found in Equal.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.390
This is the same thing.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.960
Now, in case you didn't know,
aspartame they're saying

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.080
can be a neurotoxin.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.520
It can really mess
up your brain.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.530
And so one of my
clients, I remember,

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.930
she got a packet of Nestle's
hot cocoa mix in the mail.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.660
But it was a low-calorie one.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.330
And she drank it.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.152
And she had a dizzy spell.

00:11:55.152 --> 00:11:56.610
Didn't really think
anything of it.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.151
And the next day
she had another cup.

00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.310
And after that, she had
another dizzy spell.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.130
And so she looked at the
thing, and she saw aspartame.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.670
So she started to
connect the dots.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.460
And then about a week later,
she went to a restaurant.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.382
And she ordered a
slice of pecan pie.

00:12:13.382 --> 00:12:14.840
And when she got
up from the table,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.380
she had another dizzy spell.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.170
And so she asked
the chef, excuse me,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.450
what did you sweeten
your pecan pie with?

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.620
And he said, oh, Equal.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.200
So she was smart.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.120
She was able to
connect the dots,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.400
because other people
have dizzy spells.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.150
And then what happens?

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.840
They go get anti-dizzy
medication from their doctors.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.030
When in actuality, the
simple thing is just

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:43.000
start reading the labels and
avoid things like aspartame.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.540
This Crystal Light
contains also aspartame.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.615
And it's got two colors in it.

00:12:48.615 --> 00:12:49.740
Do you drink Crystal Light?

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.281
AUDIENCE: No.

00:12:50.281 --> 00:12:52.205
I'm just thinking about
people eating lunch.

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.415
It surprised me.

00:12:54.415 --> 00:12:55.540
BETH GREER: Oh my goodness.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.037
So let's see.

00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.370
What else can I talk about here?

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.210
Here, Dr. Pepper, this
is Diet Dr. Pepper.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.940
Also, this has aspartame in it.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.620
I just find it alarming.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.720
My teenage daughter had
this in her backpack.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.430
And I said, rather
even that you had

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.160
sugar rather than just this.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.670
And then to pay attention
to, for example,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.550
this Vitamin Water.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.980
They have the servings.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.820
There's 2 and 1/2 servings
in this container.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.510
So if you're
drinking it, thinking

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.420
this is kind of
healthy for you, you're

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.940
getting the equivalent of a can
of Coca-Cola in terms of sugar.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.049
So this has 13 grams
of sugar per serving.

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:46.340
But this is 2 and 1/2 servings.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.215
So you multiply that.

00:13:47.215 --> 00:13:48.880
You're getting 39
grams of sugar.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.730
That's astonishing.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.530
And you think it's healthy,
because it's vitamin.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.730
I see shock in the audience.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.130
And then this one, popcorn.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.800
This also has--

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.460
AUDIENCE: God, that looks bad.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.670
BETH GREER: It looks bad?

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.080
Partially hydrogenated--

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.720
AUDIENCE: What's the story?

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.390
BETH GREER: It's got the
partially hydrogenated

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.410
vegetable oil in it.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.310
So we make our own
popcorn at home.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.380
So easy.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.965
I use coconut oil in a pot
and heat it up-- delicious.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.070
So does anyone
have any questions?

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:28.690
First, I've talked
about what goes in us.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:29.190
Right.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:29.981
Well, those are OK.

00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:33.460
You just have to see what the
artificial-- is it artificially

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.000
sweetened?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.570
And is it artificially colored?

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.450
So that's what you want
to pay attention to.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.730
But the electrolytes are great.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.260
And yes, doctors are not
trained in nutrition.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
They get a couple of hours
in their years of study.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.010
And so they don't know about
this for the most part.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:53.547
People like Dr. Oz are now
starting to talk about it.

00:14:53.547 --> 00:14:54.880
But it is kind of controversial.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.240
But I really think we
really need to pay attention

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.850
to this, because this can
really impact your health.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.270
And I think the number
one thing to think about

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.650
as a takeaway on the food
thing is to really try

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.970
to avoid processed
foods, because that's

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.850
where you're going to get
all the sugar, the coloring,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.610
the additives, the
flavorings, and also

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.040
the genetically modified foods.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.270
If you're concerned about
that, probably 80% to 90%

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.780
of our soy and cotton--
cotton too-- but soy and corn

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.280
are genetically modified.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.750
And I know there's
pediatricians that

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.840
are taking that these
kids who-- there's

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.709
a big influx of problems
with their bellies now.

00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:38.000
They're getting diarrhea and
constipation and all this.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.050
When they take them off
the GM foods, they heal.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.310
Their gut heals.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.500
And it's all that stuff that
is sneaked into these breakfast

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.400
bars.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.570
Like here, this
Kashi, for example.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.620
It has no high fructose
corn syrup, which is great,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.749
because they figured
out the buzz word,

00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:57.290
because they know
people, like, oh, I

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.680
don't want to eat high
fructose corn syrup.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.290
So it makes it look
like it's healthy.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.620
But this has GM soy in it.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.360
It's Roundup Ready.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.110
Anyway, something
to pay attention to.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.860
Yes?

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.800
Well, no, Splenda is
highly, highly processed.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.430
And it can be a
migraine trigger.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.969
And Sweet 'n Low I'm going
to talk about in a second.

00:16:16.969 --> 00:16:18.010
And then Stevia is great.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.060
It's made from a plant.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.602
So you need to look for--

00:16:23.602 --> 00:16:25.370
AUDIENCE: And agave
as well is good.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.720
BETH GREER: Agave is
good, yeah, and honey.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.130
All those natural
sweeteners are great.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.130
Did you have a question?

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.940
AUDIENCE: How do
you feel about meat?

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.590
BETH GREER: About what?

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.214
AUDIENCE: Meat.

00:16:34.214 --> 00:16:35.270
BETH GREER: Meat.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.530
Oh, well, eat meat.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.860
I only eat meat that's pasture
raised, organically grown,

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.780
that sort of thing, because
the beef industry notoriously

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.490
injects their cattle
with growth hormones

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.150
and antibiotics and all that.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.640
So if you're going
to eat meat-- I

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.640
can't tell you one
way or another.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.840
But it works for my body.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.130
But I make sure that my
chicken also is pasture raised.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.520
I get a little bit neurotic
when I go into a restaurant.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.750
It's like, where's
your meat from?

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.609
And is your wine biodynamic?

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.069
And what kind of oil are
you using on your salad?

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:18.660
I mean you can go a little nuts.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.890
But I go with the 80/20 rule.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.430
80% of the time I feel
like I try to do my best.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:25.930
OK.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.530
So plastic bottles.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.230
The number one, like these
Crystal Geyser bottles,

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.640
apparently don't leech
any kind of harmful,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.770
they say, I don't know
for sure, but they

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:39.850
say they're pretty safe.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.620
But they're meant
for a single use.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.030
A lot of people reuse them.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.950
And that can be a problem,
because you're also

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.160
getting bacteria.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.760
You can reinfect
yourself with bacteria.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.190
The hard plastic
bottles contain BPA.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.870
Now, there's been this
whole controversy about it.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.920
And you'll see a lot of
bottles that say BPA free.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.590
However, they're using BPS now.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.560
So it's an untested chemical.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.620
So you think it might be safe.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.750
So the safest thing, what I do
is I use a glass water bottle.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.070
And I fill up.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.830
So as long as we're
talking about water,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:20.090
we should talk
about our tap water.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:25.080
The Associated Press did a study
on our tap water in America

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.560
and discovered that there
is pharmaceutical drugs

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.020
in significant quantities
in our tap water.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:36.480
So antidepressants, birth
control pills, hormones,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.060
Viagra, all that stuff,
we're drinking all that.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.740
So I recommend getting a
filter on your home tap

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.330
and then using either a
glass or metal bottle.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.770
And then you should
be good to go.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.510
OK.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:57.810
So I'm going to move
on to what goes on us.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.639
So we were talking a little
bit about the Sweet 'n

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:01.680
Low, which is saccharine.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.730
So I went into my store.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.350
And I was looking at toothpaste.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.030
And every single
toothpaste I could

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.600
find, except a natural one,
like Tom's, for example,

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.600
contains saccharine.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.340
Saccharine is an
artificial sweetener.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.880
So they've done studies
on laboratory animals.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.480
And they've discover that
when you give these animals

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.100
saccharine, they
develop bladder cancer.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.000
So I'm not saying that
you brush your teeth--

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.580
I remember my daughter had
a sleepover with this girl.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.140
And the girl goes, oh, well,
what kind of toothpaste

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.109
do you use?

00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:35.650
Because she had a
natural toothpaste.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.450
And then my daughter
says, what are you using?

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:38.010
Crest.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.020
Don't you know that
could kill you.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.120
So I go running in there.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.650
No, no, no, your toothpaste
is not going to kill you.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.010
But my message is to
really-- it takes time.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.410
Look, I was 50 when
I got my tumor.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.470
So this is over time.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.090
And the good news
is that we have

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.490
so many great,
great products that

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.590
are healthy now that
are on the market

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.390
that we didn't have before.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.790
So I use Coral White.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.550
I love this toothpaste.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.411
It's made from sea coral.

00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:09.160
And then this one.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.660
I like this Eco-DenT.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.100
It's just baking
soda toothpaste.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:13.950
It's fantastic.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.420
It works just the same.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.660
And you're not getting
exposed to the saccharine.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.950
And then another toothpaste, I
just wanted to share with you,

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:32.670
Colgate Total has triclosan in
it, which is an antibacterial.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.300
And it's also a pesticide.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.890
So for example, this
Dial antibacterial soap,

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.150
the number one ingredient
on here is triclosan.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.330
So we don't need
to use triclosan.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.400
Bottom line, all the
doctors are saying

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.980
that the best way
to wash your hands

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.820
is to use regular
soap and water.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.490
And when you're
using this, you're

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.740
going to develop
antibiotic resistance.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:00.110
So if you do need an antibiotic,
it could be really dangerous

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.050
for you to use this stuff and,
especially, when you're putting

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.770
it in your mouth, because let's
say if your gums are bleeding

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.600
or it's going under your
tongue into your bloodstream.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.100
So you want to just choose the
most natural, safest product.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.001
So let's see what other
goodies do I have?

00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:18.500
Yeah.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.070
You can use these
sanitizing gels.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.653
They're great.

00:21:20.653 --> 00:21:23.316
I like EO or Clean Well.

00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:25.315
These are all natural,
made with essential oils.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.750
Let me just talk to you
about labeling for a minute.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.230
So I always tell people to
look for the fewest amount

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.900
of ingredients on a label.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.910
So this bottle of
Listerine looked great.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.740
It only has four ingredients--
eucalyptus, thyme, menthol.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.080
What could be so bad?

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.690
And then in the fine
print it says, peel here.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.490
And so then when
you peel this back,

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.040
this is where all your
other stuff comes in.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:01.680
So it's got 26.9% alcohol.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.170
It's a little crazy, right?

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.260
So alcohol actually
dries out your mouth

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.069
and can give you more cavities.

00:22:10.069 --> 00:22:12.110
They want you to just keep
using it and using it.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.780
And also they've done
studies on people

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.040
who rinse their mouth with
alcohol-based products.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.830
And it can give
you mouth cancer.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:25.120
So it's just better to go
with something natural.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.660
My favorite thing now is
this healthy gum drops

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.770
from Living Libations.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.000
And I put some on a toothbrush.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.230
It's just essential oils.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.460
And it's just fantastic.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.260
And I don't even
use the sudsy thing.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.100
You just have to get used to not
having the suds in your mouth.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.760
But I love it.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.710
Let's see, deodorant.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.010
Well, looking at this
one, this Ban roll-on,

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.210
it only had one
ingredient on there.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.340
So that surprised me.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.490
And it's aluminum.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.910
Now, they're linking
aluminum to Alzheimer's.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.202
And so that's not really great.

00:23:02.202 --> 00:23:04.660
But I thought, well, how can
this only have one ingredient?

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.150
And there's no peel here label.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.400
So I'm standing there in
Walgreen's picking away

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.440
at this thing.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.450
And then when you
pull it back, there

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:16.040
are all your other-- a paragraph
worth of preservatives,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.150
additives, fragrance.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.780
So let me talk to you a
little bit about fragrance.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.850
The word fragrance on
a label can mean up

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.460
to 100 different
synthetic ingredients.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.946
It's the manufacturer's
catch phrase

00:23:30.946 --> 00:23:32.320
that they can just
say fragrance.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.870
They don't have to
say what's in there.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:43.220
The thing is that with all
of this stuff, our bodies--

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.990
it's like taking in so much.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.280
It's the food.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.190
It's the chemicals in
the bread and the cereal

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.620
and the toothpaste and then the
skin care and the deodorant.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.160
It creates this burden.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.900
And some of the chemicals
that were tested

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.630
were only tested alone.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.650
They weren't tested in
relation to the rest.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.840
So it creates this
body burden on us.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.510
And I'm convinced that that's
how I got rid of this tumor

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.700
by clearing out my
body, not having

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.680
these chemicals on there,
not exposing myself to it.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.690
And then my body healed.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:25.750
And I believe that everybody
can feel better if they just

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.870
switch to natural things.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:31.970
This is one.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.520
This is produced in Canada.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.510
And so it says,
drug facts, which

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.740
I thought that was fascinating,
because it is a drug.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.512
These are drugs.

00:24:39.512 --> 00:24:40.220
That's the thing.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.510
We're not really
getting the picture.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.320
These chemicals are drugs.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.940
They interact like drugs.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.680
And this one, again, peel
back and you see all the stuff

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.210
in here.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:57.170
Now, Tom's for
example, well, this

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.270
should be safe and natural.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.600
But the number one ingredient
on the stick deodorant

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.110
is propylene glycol.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.280
Does anyone know
where that comes from?

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.340
Antifreeze.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.190
So it's a penetration
enhancer they call it.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.380
So when you put it on,
they want all the stuff

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.280
to go deeper into your skin.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.340
So think about that.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.620
Maybe you're shaving
under your armpits.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.770
And then you put this on.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:29.280
And you wonder, why is there so
much disease and breast cancer?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.930
This could partially be
responsible for that.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:36.100
What I use is baking soda.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.180
I like this one, this pure
Bob's Red Mill baking soda.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.235
And I put it in my salt shaker.

00:25:43.235 --> 00:25:46.120
And I just sprinkle
it on my hand.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.650
And it works 100%.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.670
It's amazing.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.510
Grandma was right, right?

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.830
I have a client in
Southern California.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.052
And she's a yoga instructor.

00:25:57.052 --> 00:25:58.010
She does Ashtanga yoga.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.334
And she sweats a lot.

00:25:59.334 --> 00:26:00.750
And she said, oh,
I can't do that.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.380
I'm always reapplying
my deodorant.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.630
I said, well, just try it, OK?

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.190
And she did.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.370
And she's a believer now.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.210
And she's so happy.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.690
So it's really cool.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.730
And then another
thing to be aware of

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:19.740
are these aerosols, because
they contain hydrofluorocarbons.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.350
And they eat away
at the ozone layer.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.120
So this one contains that.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.620
It contains fragrance, which we
talked about; propylene glycol,

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.010
which we talked
about; and triclosan.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.700
It's got a big punch in here.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.020
It seems so innocuous.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.790
I grew up with Right Guard
and Secret and all this stuff.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:47.690
So just something
to be aware of.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:52.720
So let me talk a little
bit about makeup.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.840
I know that that's an issue for
people and curious about it.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.160
And so some of the mascara
contains mercury in it,

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.490
for example.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.650
We don't want that on our eyes.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.370
Some lipsticks contain
lead, which we don't want.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:12.870
So I love this one company
called Peacekeeper Cosmetics.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.200
They make a wonderful
lipstick and lip balms.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:22.380
And they have a
great philosophy,

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.010
where they give
back their proceeds

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.470
to urgent women's issues.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.830
And so that's great.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.700
And I like Jane Iredale.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.200
Let's see.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.660
This is Aveda, which I think
is pretty clean as well.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:42.330
So Chapstick contains parabens.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.440
And that surprised me.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.389
And parabens are found
a lot in our makeups

00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:48.680
and our personal care products.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.846
And those are preservatives.

00:27:49.846 --> 00:27:52.310
They're antimicrobial
preservatives.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:56.560
And so they've done studies.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.430
And they've found parabens
in breast cancer tumors.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:06.210
So it's so simple these days to
find a great, natural products.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.039
Well, they can be an irritant.

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:10.080
I don't think they're
necessarily cancer-causing.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.970
But they can be an irritant.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:19.630
There's a great website
called Skin Deep.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:22.690
And it's part of the
environmental working group.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.260
And you can go and
look at your products

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.150
and see what you're using
and then how it stacks up.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.410
Another great
nonprofit is the Center

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.500
for Environmental Health.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.740
They have some great
suggestions as well.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.750
It does allow in the
microscopic chemicals.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.990
So things like nanoparticles
you have to really pay attention

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:46.600
to, because nanotechnology
was designed initially

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:56.110
in the medical arena to allow
certain drugs and things

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.150
to help cancer
patients and like that.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.660
But now, they've decided
to put it in our makeup

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.830
and in our moisturizer and in
our sunscreen, for example.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:11.960
So Jergens has an
ultra-healing moisturizer.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.850
And you think that it's healthy
because it says healing.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.390
I wanted something
to heal my skin.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.840
But It's got two parabens
in it and fragrance.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.670
And then it's got 10
unpronounceable chemicals

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:23.170
in here.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.870
You can use a simple thing
like coconut oil on your skin

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.260
as a great moisturizer.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.740
There's jojoba oil.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.180
I have recipes in
my book to tell you

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:43.030
how to make some
easy stuff like that.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.780
I think a great thing
to do is to wear

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.490
a hat if you're sensitive.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.220
I like to get at least a half
an hour of sun on my body

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.790
if I can because
of the vitamin D,

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.930
because vitamin D is
so critical for health.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.510
But just make sure you're
looking for a natural sunscreen

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.800
if you do decide to use it,
something that's non-toxic.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.910
And again, you can go to the
EWG site and look that up.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.680
And I also have a recipe in my
book for a natural sunscreen

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:15.110
actually made with vitamin C.
It doesn't act as a barrier.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:16.740
But it actually
goes into the skin

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.490
and protects you from burning.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:19.862
And I've used it in Hawaii.

00:30:19.862 --> 00:30:21.320
I've used it on my
little daughter.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.090
And it works great.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:25.630
OK.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:31.162
So let's go on to
what surrounds us.

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:35.160
Well, let's talk about
household cleaners.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.040
So this is Windex.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.140
It says it kills
99.9% of bacteria.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.440
And then it's got
active ingredients,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.130
which is only 0.18%.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.830
And then the inactive
ingredient is 99.82%.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.680
What does that mean,
inactive ingredient?

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.750
Does anyone have an idea?

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.430
They're not telling us
what's in here, basically.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.090
They don't have to buy law.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.010
I know that there
are some senators who

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.920
are trying to work on
getting these manufactures

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.320
to tell us what's in here.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:13.710
But basically, 99% of this
stuff we have no idea.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.220
But I do have an idea.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.290
On the back, it says,
precautionary statement.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.080
Hazardous to humans
and domestic animals.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.780
So why would anybody want
to use this in their home

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.420
to clean if it's hazardous?

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.520
It makes no sense.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.120
And one of my clients, he said
to me, oh, well, we use this.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.590
But it's just vinegar, because
it says vinegar on the bottom.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.190
He thought this
was just vinegar.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.780
And it's like, no, this
is not just vinegar.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.910
Keep out of reach of children
and pets right on the back.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.920
This is not just vinegar.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.400
But what I do use,
which is really great,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.460
is vinegar and hydrogen
peroxide to clean with.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.980
I put just plain old
hydrogen peroxide.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.190
It costs like $1 a
bottle and white vinegar.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.270
And then I spray
down my countertops,

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:06.470
my wooden countertops,
whatever, alternate.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:12.380
And it kills 99.9% of e.
coli, salmonella, bacteria,

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.710
everything that
this Windex does.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.670
And it's pennies.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.220
And it's nontoxic.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.910
You don't have to worry about
your pets or your children.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.339
So how great is that?

00:32:22.339 --> 00:32:24.130
And if you don't like
the smell of vinegar,

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.300
try some essential oil.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.070
I like this.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:32.050
Well, this is lavender
from Mountain Rose.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.120
Just make sure it's
100% essential oil.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.870
Because sometimes
a product might

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.390
say made with essential oil.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.760
So those two words,
made with, that

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.900
could mean there's
only one drop,

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.680
let's say, of
essential oil in there.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.480
So you really want to
just pay attention.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.020
And that goes for everything.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.360
For bread, this one
says 100% whole wheat.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.340
Some breads will say
made with whole wheat.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.150
And that can mean just
a small percentage.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.960
So let's see.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.160
And then candles,
scented candles.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.490
One of my clients
had a chronic cough.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:15.350
And for two years, she
was on cough medicine,

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.100
cough suppressant.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.040
The doctors didn't
know what was going on.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.440
So she said to me, when I go
to a hotel, it's so funny.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.535
I don't cough.

00:33:21.535 --> 00:33:23.400
And I just thought,
OK, well, there's

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.400
something in your house.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.540
And I walked into her
bedroom and went [COUGHS].

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.830
It was already like this.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.110
And she had these scented
candles everywhere.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.751
And she used scented
hair products.

00:33:31.751 --> 00:33:34.000
And I said, look, you've got
to get rid of this stuff.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.040
And we got rid of it.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.800
And her cough went away.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.450
Then you tell your
doctor, right?

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.520
But this too.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.360
This also has the
peel here label.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:52.300
And it has lots of information
about it and additives.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.810
I can smell this without
even ever opening it.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:55.900
I can smell this.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:01.360
So what I like to do is I
go to the farmer's market.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.540
And I love to buy just beeswax
candles with natural cotton

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.870
wicks.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:10.040
Have you seen those wicks
that have metal in there?

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.850
So they make the
candle burn longer.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.230
But you know what that metal is?

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.830
It's lead.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:16.790
It's lead, right?

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.819
So we're breathing that in.

00:34:18.819 --> 00:34:20.860
So if you have a home with
lots of these candles,

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.469
if you look on the ceiling,
I've seen soot up there.

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:26.659
It's getting in our lungs.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:30.100
So that's not a good thing.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.800
And let's see.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.739
Room spray.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:38.010
I love to just use
just a regular--

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.690
this is an organic
hydrosol of rose.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:47.320
And this is just lovely instead
of using those air fresheners.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.259
They've done studies
with people who

00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:53.550
use air fresheners in the home.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.160
And the children have
upper respiratory problems.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.320
Let's see.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.070
And then, I guess,
lastly I wanted

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.750
to just talk about the
electromagnetic fields.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.210
Just briefly, we are being
bombarded with these fields

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:11.290
that you can't see them.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.730
But if we could, I saw
a documentary once.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.860
It's like we're living with
this mesh in front of us.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.155
So I really recommend that
you unplug your Wi-Fi at night

00:35:22.155 --> 00:35:24.280
when you go to sleep,
because when you're sleeping,

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.090
you really want to rejuvenate.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.060
And that's the
best time to do it.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.900
If you're sensitive
to these things,

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.020
the Wi-Fi, in particular,
if you'd shut it off,

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.210
it would be great.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.722
Take your electronics out
of your bedroom altogether.

00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.180
That would be the
best thing to do.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:48.000
Also, any sort of a unit, like,
for example, one of my clients,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.210
her son had headaches
for two years.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.700
And I went into his bedroom.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.990
And he had a giant air purifier
right next to his headboard.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.660
So I said, why do
you have this here?

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.440
And she says, well,
he's allergic.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.740
But I use this meter that
I have, this gas meter.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.680
And I measured.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.190
And the field coming off
of this thing was enormous.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.980
And I just moved
it 10 feet away,

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.130
because it drops
off very quickly.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:18.050
And the next morning, the
mom called me up and said,

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.967
his headache is gone.

00:36:18.967 --> 00:36:20.550
Do you think I gave
him a brain tumor?

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.805
I'm just so worried.

00:36:21.805 --> 00:36:25.840
And it's like, no,
but this is something

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.040
that you just need
to pay attention to.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.820
Or there was the home
I went into where

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.450
the baby wasn't sleeping.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:33.500
And the crib was
up against a wall.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.840
And I said, what's on the
other side of the wall?

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.710
And there was a giant
refrigerator there

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.930
that was giving
off a huge field.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.200
So we moved the
crib across the way.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:48.330
And the baby slept
really great after that.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.670
So I know that some
of this information

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.210
may seem overwhelming
or that you're not

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.510
going to know where
to go from here.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:01.836
And I found myself,
in 1987, halfway up

00:37:01.836 --> 00:37:06.360
a 100-foot cliff in Joshua
Tree National Monument.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.970
I was on an Outward
Bound Exhibition.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:13.759
And I really thought
I was so happy,

00:37:13.759 --> 00:37:14.800
because I got halfway up.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.175
And I really wanted
to come down.

00:37:16.175 --> 00:37:17.400
And I'm an ex-New Yorker.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.010
And going up that
high, I've only

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.437
been up elevators to
high-rise buildings.

00:37:23.437 --> 00:37:24.770
So I really wanted to come down.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:28.340
And the guy who was down below
with the ropes belaying me,

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.450
he said, look, just pull
yourself up three inches,

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.720
stand on your tiptoes.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.830
And you'll see a whole
new set of possibilities

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.065
may open up to you.

00:37:37.065 --> 00:37:40.740
And I thought, well, that's so
profound being on this cliff

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.660
and hearing this.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.890
And so I did.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.470
I stood on my tiptoes.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.510
And I saw another hand
hold and foot hold.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:47.880
And I got up to the top.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.400
And I was just
ecstatic about it.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.100
And I thought, I'm
going to remember

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.330
this the rest of my life.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:55.192
And so I just wanted to share
that with you that if you're

00:37:55.192 --> 00:37:56.650
feeling a little
overwhelmed or not

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.280
knowing where to
go with this, what

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.200
are your three inches for you?

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.180
Maybe it's just changing
your bread or your lipstick

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.490
or your household cleaner.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.610
Pick one thing that
you can do that you

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.200
feel that will have an impact.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.220
And you'll see that
over time you'll

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.800
be healthier and
happier and greener.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.870
And it will be great.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.600
And look, we're all
in this together.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.930
So let's work together.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.290
And I'm here to support
you if you need coaching.

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.940
I do in-home coaching.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.400
And I do some consulting.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.150
I can do things by Skype even.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.930
So let me know if
you need my help.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.790
I'm here to do that for you.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.399
Thank you.

00:38:41.399 --> 00:38:44.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:44.990
Yeah.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:48.170
And are there any
more questions?

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.550
It's on Amazon.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.040
And also on my
website, BethGreer.com,

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.430
you can go there.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.850
And I have a free
assessment for people

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:00.140
who want to find out how you
might be unwittingly being

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.410
exposed to these
chemical toxins.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.550
You can fill that out.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.062
And you'll be in the know.

00:39:06.062 --> 00:39:08.470
You'll know what to avoid.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:11.610
Well, there are instruments
that you can purchase.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.380
And one of them is
called a Gauss meter.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.010
And one of them is an RF meter.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:21.670
It measures the fields
from computers and Wi-Fi.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.420
And the third one-- you actually
need three, unfortunately--

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:30.660
is a dirty electricity meter
called a Stetzer meter.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:35.290
I have information about
those on my website as well.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.720
Farmers' markets are
really a great resource.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.327
I like to go at like
just a quarter to 1:00.

00:39:41.327 --> 00:39:43.160
If the farmers' market
is from 8:00 to 1:00,

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.460
I get there 15 minutes before.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.810
They're giving away
bags of broccoli for $1.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.130
It's fantastic.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.020
They have something called
CSA, community-supported

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:52.780
agriculture.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.290
And they deliver
boxes to your home.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:56.920
They may even have
it here at Google,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.940
where you can share
in those things.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.780
Plant a garden for yourself.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:08.120
Yes, eating meat that is
pasture raised but maybe eat

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.401
less of it.

00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:11.400
But I also think that
you're going to save money

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.860
in the long one with
health care costs.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.720
I don't see doctors anymore.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.670
How expensive would
that surgery have

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.600
been for me and then the
rehabilitation and the pain

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.420
killers and all that.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.160
And I really think you
can't buy health like this

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.840
to feel so good.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.020
I'm 61 right now.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:37.210
And I feel so much better and
more energetic and younger

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.930
than I did 10, 20 years ago.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:41.867
I know it's the food.

00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:43.700
People ask me, what do
you put on your skin?

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.610
It's what I'm not putting on
my skin that makes it glow.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:50.541
Thank you, everyone.

00:40:50.541 --> 00:40:51.290
Thanks for coming.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:56.043
[APPLAUSE]
