00:00:00.672 --> 00:00:01.681
- [Instructor] We're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.243
is try to evaluate the
definite integral from zero

00:00:04.243 --> 00:00:06.910
to pi of x cosine of x dx.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.421
Like always, pause this video and see

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:15.236
if you can evaluate it yourself.

00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:16.437
Well when you immediately look at this,

00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:18.459
it's not obvious how you
just straight up take

00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:21.230
the anti-derivative here
and then evaluate that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.314
at pi and then subtract from that

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.933
and evaluate it at zero, so
we're probably going to have

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:29.003
to use a slightly more
sophisticated technique.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:33.215
And in general, if you
see a product of functions

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:35.721
right over here, and if
one of these functions

00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:39.114
is fairly straightforward to
take the anti-derivative of

00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:42.808
without making it more
complicated like cosine of x,

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:46.184
and another of the functions
like x if you were to take

00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:48.116
its derivative, it gets simpler.

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:49.737
In this case, it would just become one.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:51.847
It's a pretty good sign
that we should be using

00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:54.353
integration by parts.

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:58.551
So let's just remind ourselves
about integration by parts.

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:01.617
So integration by parts,
I'll do it right over here,

00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:04.446
if I have the integral
and I'll just write this

00:01:04.446 --> 00:01:06.597
as an indefinite integral
but here we wanna take

00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:09.066
the indefinite integral
and then evaluate it at pi

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.829
and evaluate it at zero,
so if I have f of x

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.746
times g prime of x, dx,

00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:22.300
this is going to be equal
to, and in other videos

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.879
we prove this, it really
just comes straight

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:25.771
out of the product rule that you learned

00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:27.761
in differential calculus,
this is gonna be equal

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:31.928
to f of x times g of x minus,
you then swap these around,

00:01:34.638 --> 00:01:37.221
minus f prime of x, g of x, dx.

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:43.061
And just to reiterate what I said before,

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:47.089
you wanna find an f of x that
when I take its derivative,

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:49.589
it simplifies it, so simplify,

00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:56.336
and you wanna find a g
prime of x that when I take

00:01:56.336 --> 00:02:00.336
its anti-derivative, so when
I take its anti-derivative,

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:02.618
it doesn't get more complicated.

00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:04.618
So not more complicated.

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:09.757
Because if the f of x gets
simplified when I take

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:12.303
its derivative, and the
g prime of x does not

00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:15.217
get more complicated when
I take its anti-derivative,

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.348
then this expression will
maybe be easier to find

00:02:18.348 --> 00:02:20.669
the anti-derivative of.

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.261
So let's do that over here.

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.248
Between x and cosine of x, which one

00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:28.076
gets more simple when
I take its derivative?

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:31.322
Well the derivative of x is
just one, so I'm gonna make that

00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:35.631
my f of x, so I could
write that over here,

00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:39.686
so my f of x, I will
say is x, in which case,

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:43.853
f prime of x, f prime of x,
is going to be equal to one,

00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:49.773
and then what would my g prime of x be?

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:52.828
Well my g prime of x,
cosine of x if I take

00:02:52.828 --> 00:02:55.322
its anti-derivative, it
doesn't get more complicated.

00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:57.857
The anti-derivative of
cosine of x is sine of x.

00:02:57.857 --> 00:03:00.173
So let me make that my g prime of x.

00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:03.896
So g prime of x is equal to cosine of x

00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:07.515
in which case g of x, the
anti-derivative of cosine of x,

00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:10.284
well it's just sine of x or
another way to think about it,

00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:12.426
the derivative of sine
of x is cosine of x.

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.801
Now you could think about
plus C's and all of that

00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:16.295
but remember, this is gonna
be a definite integral

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:18.589
so all of those arbitrary
constants are going to get

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.387
canceled out.

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:21.842
So now let's think through this.

00:03:21.842 --> 00:03:26.487
Let's just apply the
integration by parts here.

00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:29.343
In this particular case,
all of this is going to be

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:31.821
equal to, so I'm saying
that is equal to this,

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:34.269
I'm gonna skip down here,
it's going to be equal

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.558
to f of x times g of x.

00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:41.458
So that is f of x is
x, g of x is sine of x,

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:44.958
f of x times g of x, minus the integral

00:03:47.334 --> 00:03:51.278
of f prime of x, f prime of x is just one,

00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:54.488
we could write it like
that, one times g of x,

00:03:54.488 --> 00:03:58.553
g of x is sine of x, so we
could write it like this,

00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:00.986
but one times sine of x, well
we could just rewrite that

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:03.831
as sine of x, it'll make
it a little bit simpler,

00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:07.998
sine of x, dx, and then
remember, this is a definite

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.815
integral, so we are
going to want to evaluate

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:15.529
this whole thing at pi
and at zero, and then take

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.795
the difference between the two.

00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:21.756
But what is the indefinite
integral of sine of x dx?

00:04:21.756 --> 00:04:25.316
Well, or to say the anti-derivative of it,

00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:29.181
we know that the derivative
of cosine is negative sine

00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:31.505
of x, and so in fact what
we want, we could bring

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:33.912
this negative sine into the
integral, so we could say

00:04:33.912 --> 00:04:36.830
plus the integral of negative sine of x,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.227
now this clearly the anti-derivative here

00:04:39.227 --> 00:04:42.585
is cosine of x, so this
thing is going to be

00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:45.531
cosine of x, and now we
just have to evaluate it

00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:47.683
at the end points.

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:50.936
So let's first evaluate
this whole thing at pi.

00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:54.916
So this is going to be
equal to pi sine of pi,

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:57.666
pi sine of pi, plus cosine of pi,

00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:04.354
and then from that I'm going
to subtract this whole thing

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:08.521
evaluated at zero, so let me
do zero in a different color,

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:13.135
at zero, so it's going
to be zero times sine

00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:16.635
of zero plus cosine of zero, so let's see,

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.540
sine of pi is just zero
so this is just going to

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.538
cancel out.

00:05:21.538 --> 00:05:25.101
Cosine of pi, that is negative one,

00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:28.319
and then this is zero,
and then cosine of zero,

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.668
that is one, so you have
negative one minus one,

00:05:32.668 --> 00:05:35.213
so this all gets us to negative two,

00:05:35.213 --> 00:05:36.957
and we are done.

00:05:36.957 --> 00:05:39.372
Using integration by parts,
we were able to evaluate

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.289
this definite integral.
