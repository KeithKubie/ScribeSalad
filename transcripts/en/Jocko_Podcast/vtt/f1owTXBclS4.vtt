00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.380
Knowing what you know about war and the teams, if you could go back in time,

2
00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:09.820
what would you have done differently? Man, I wish I could go back in

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.120
time day. Berg and I are doing an event, uh,

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.760
earlier this week and he was, he, he said, uh, you know,

5
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:22.630
I'm glad I'm not Ramadi. I know lave probably wishes he was everybody 100%.

6
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:25.660
I would go there right now. Yeah, let's go. Um,

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.840
and it's what I would do differently is the recognition that uh,

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.500
we were super aggressive. We took a lot of risk. Um,

9
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.780
what I would do differently is I would actually be even more aggressive.

10
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.230
I would be a hundred times more aggressive. I would be putting up, you know,

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.660
a concept operations brief for your,

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.720
for your approval to send up the chain to swim across the river and hit targets

13
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.440
and, and you know,

14
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.710
put in some cyber Overwatch's it and just completely ruined the bad guys program

15
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.580
going on in south central. My,

16
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.640
when they had complete freedom movement before they had any expectation that we

17
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:06.100
could be there before I could get to us. And I think, uh,

18
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.710
they would never see a common, which means that a,

19
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:12.130
we would have more impact and it would actually be safer for us, uh,

20
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:14.440
because they wouldn't mix back in it. So they would probably hammer hammers.

21
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:18.070
But we, we recognize that we could get away with a lot more, um, you know,

22
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.340
than we could. Uh, and looking back on it, I just, when you,

23
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:22.720
when you come into an area and they're like, hey,

24
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:25.750
don't go in and you're all going to get killed, he, you want to be cautious.

25
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.390
You wanna you don't want to just jump into things.

26
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:30.730
You want to mitigate risk and control. Certainly. Uh,

27
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.840
but we recognize we could get away with a lot more than we thought we could.

28
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.570
And more often than not, bring, bring guys home. And of course,

29
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:40.220
that's the one thing I would change. Obviously, if I could change, if, uh,

30
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.890
I would trade places with Mark Lee and Ryan, Joe and my platoon in a second,

31
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.670
uh, I'd trade places with Mike Montour and [inaudible] and in a second,

32
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.390
and I wish I could do that. Uh, and I can't, but, uh, that is the,

33
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.620
that is what I would change. Um, but, uh, I certainly would, uh,

34
00:01:56.621 --> 00:01:57.940
if we could go back to her again,

35
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:01.180
we would be even more aggressive and we'd have even more impact.

36
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.960
There's a term that they used to say in the teams,

37
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:05.980
I don't know if you've ever heard it.

38
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.150
You probably did when we'd be doing special reconnaissance training and guys

39
00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:12.640
would say, trust your camouflage. Did you ever hear that expression?

40
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.030
You may not have. I don't. I don't believe so.

41
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.070
So what it was was when you got good at putting your camouflage together,

42
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.890
you could really get aggressive in getting up and observing a target.

43
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.930
Because if you trust your camera,

44
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.560
if you've done a good job with your Cammie paint, your Ghillie suit and, and,

45
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.800
and putting yourself together, well the enemy's not gonna be able to see you.

46
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.050
But it's really weird to be, you know,

47
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.320
40 meters from a target that you're looking at.

48
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.800
Then there's a guy walking around and you feel completely naked.

49
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:44.530
Like they can see what they can't see you at all. They can't see you at all.

50
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.610
And so it takes them, it takes them time to learn, to trust your camouflage.

51
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.320
And I think, you know,

52
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.820
obviously hindsight is 2020 and when you look back at your Marty like you look

53
00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:56.500
back and you think to yourself, well, we could have done this.

54
00:02:56.501 --> 00:02:58.510
We could have done that. We could've gotten closer to that target.

55
00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.500
We could have done more things

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.800
<v 1>because our,</v>

57
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.150
hindsight's 2020 and also we learned over time to trust our camouflage.

58
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.290
And the longer we were there, the the, the more aggressive, you know,

59
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.990
operations took place. But yeah, that's,

60
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.700
hindsight's 2020 isn't it? That it is.
