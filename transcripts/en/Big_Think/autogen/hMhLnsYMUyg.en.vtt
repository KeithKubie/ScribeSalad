careful about when brands have an iconic
 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.320
careful about when brands have an iconic
status there's a shared perception of

status there's a shared perception of
ownership by the public and it's very

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060
ownership by the public and it's very
 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.530
ownership by the public and it's very
easy to lose that trust because people

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540
easy to lose that trust because people
 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.930

it and it'd be like fighting with your

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820
it and it'd be like fighting with your
 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.010
it and it'd be like fighting with your
sibling and getting into one of those

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020
sibling and getting into one of those
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.510

clientele we didn't want to be in that
 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.480
clientele we didn't want to be in that
position so we were very very careful to

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490
position so we were very very careful to
 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.610
position so we were very very careful to
deconstruct what we thought were the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620
deconstruct what we thought were the
 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.830

elements that made magnolia magnolia and
 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.730
elements that made magnolia magnolia and
take it to the next level and that same

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740
take it to the next level and that same
 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.249
take it to the next level and that same
trust and iconic nature and ownership

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259
trust and iconic nature and ownership
 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.160
trust and iconic nature and ownership
still exists it's actually growing so

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170
still exists it's actually growing so
 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.229
still exists it's actually growing so
it's very easy to exploit that I can

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239
it's very easy to exploit that I can
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.080
it's very easy to exploit that I can
take that trust and oh and sell other

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090
take that trust and oh and sell other
 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.540
take that trust and oh and sell other
products I can take that trust and go

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550
products I can take that trust and go
 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.450
products I can take that trust and go
into a grocery store but

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460
into a grocery store but
 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.730
into a grocery store but
I think that's diluting the brand equity

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740
I think that's diluting the brand equity
 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.220
I think that's diluting the brand equity
at this point I think that we need to be

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230
at this point I think that we need to be
 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.160
at this point I think that we need to be
a stronger brand I think we're very

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170
a stronger brand I think we're very
 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.020
a stronger brand I think we're very
clear of who we are but we need to

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030
clear of who we are but we need to
 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.000
clear of who we are but we need to
strengthen that in the perception of who

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
strengthen that in the perception of who
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.650
strengthen that in the perception of who
we are now twill we stand for in the

marketplace and I think there will be
 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.810
marketplace and I think there will be
opportunities to exploit that without

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820
opportunities to exploit that without
 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.810
opportunities to exploit that without
