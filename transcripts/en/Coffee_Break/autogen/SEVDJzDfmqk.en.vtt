right this is an incredibly intensive

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889
right this is an incredibly intensive
 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.190
right this is an incredibly intensive
system that I thought but the reason for

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200
system that I thought but the reason for
 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.220
system that I thought but the reason for
it is because I really believe that time

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
it is because I really believe that time
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.750
it is because I really believe that time
management is one of the most important

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
management is one of the most important
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.400
management is one of the most important
things you can do pretty much anything

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
things you can do pretty much anything
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.980
things you can do pretty much anything
in your life is achievable if you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
in your life is achievable if you
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900
in your life is achievable if you
leverage your time in the right way and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
leverage your time in the right way and
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.720
leverage your time in the right way and
I just don't think most people including

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
I just don't think most people including
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.670
I just don't think most people including
myself you know for a lot of my life

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
myself you know for a lot of my life
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.009
myself you know for a lot of my life
have a good grip on what we do with our

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
have a good grip on what we do with our
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.490
have a good grip on what we do with our
time and are very intentional with their

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
time and are very intentional with their
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.970
time and are very intentional with their
time so that's kind of the thesis behind

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
time so that's kind of the thesis behind
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.970
time so that's kind of the thesis behind
this whole system and I think for anyone

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
this whole system and I think for anyone
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650
this whole system and I think for anyone
who's going to embark on this they

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
who's going to embark on this they
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.720
who's going to embark on this they
should have the proper view to it is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
should have the proper view to it is
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490
should have the proper view to it is
kind of a pain to deal with this

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
kind of a pain to deal with this
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.799
kind of a pain to deal with this
sometimes I think you have to know why

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
sometimes I think you have to know why
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.770
sometimes I think you have to know why
you're doing it and kind of like I said

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
you're doing it and kind of like I said
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.590
you're doing it and kind of like I said

just make your own systems that's why I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
just make your own systems that's why I
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.479
just make your own systems that's why I
made this smorgasbord system as you can

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
made this smorgasbord system as you can
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.969
made this smorgasbord system as you can
see this is not some app and the reason

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
see this is not some app and the reason
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.649
see this is not some app and the reason
I didn't use an app is because of the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
I didn't use an app is because of the
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.690
I didn't use an app is because of the
fact that nothing was doing quite what I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
fact that nothing was doing quite what I
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910
fact that nothing was doing quite what I
wanted it to do and so I had to make my

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
wanted it to do and so I had to make my
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830
wanted it to do and so I had to make my
own system so to some extent I really

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
own system so to some extent I really
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200
own system so to some extent I really
believe in kind of doing it yourself so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
believe in kind of doing it yourself so
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.810
believe in kind of doing it yourself so

that's kind of productive but you can't

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
that's kind of productive but you can't
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.359
that's kind of productive but you can't
really be captured in some category like

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
really be captured in some category like
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.830

haircut something like that waste of
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.920
haircut something like that waste of
time is just a straight-up waste of time

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
time is just a straight-up waste of time
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.940
time is just a straight-up waste of time
and these others are pretty

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
and these others are pretty
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.130
and these others are pretty
self-explanatory

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140
self-explanatory
 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.850

okay so I track my time in 16-hour days

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
okay so I track my time in 16-hour days
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.719
okay so I track my time in 16-hour days
because I don't

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
because I don't
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.140
because I don't
spend a ton of time putting in sleep I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
spend a ton of time putting in sleep I
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.130
spend a ton of time putting in sleep I
usually sleep from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
usually sleep from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m.
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.170
usually sleep from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m.
that's usually when I'm sleeping so I

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
that's usually when I'm sleeping so I
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.420
that's usually when I'm sleeping so I
just consider that that's always that's

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
just consider that that's always that's
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.369
just consider that that's always that's
always things asleep if you want to

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379
always things asleep if you want to
 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.800
always things asleep if you want to
track the whole time you can do that but

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
track the whole time you can do that but
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.630
track the whole time you can do that but
I would suggest tracking in 16 hours it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
I would suggest tracking in 16 hours it
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.710
I would suggest tracking in 16 hours it
just makes it easier if you want to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
just makes it easier if you want to
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.940
just makes it easier if you want to
change this time you can change it here

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
change this time you can change it here
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.220
change this time you can change it here
just change this first row to like 7:00

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
just change this first row to like 7:00
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.960
just change this first row to like 7:00
a.m. for example and all the rows will

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
a.m. for example and all the rows will
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.320
a.m. for example and all the rows will
automatically change all right so the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330
automatically change all right so the
 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.270
automatically change all right so the
after you change these things over here

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280

change the color because the colors ties
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.050
change the color because the colors ties
to use a macro so what's a macro it's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
to use a macro so what's a macro it's
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.229
to use a macro so what's a macro it's
just a short little piece of code that

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239
just a short little piece of code that
 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.270
just a short little piece of code that
helps things go a little smoother so to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
helps things go a little smoother so to
 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280
helps things go a little smoother so to
access your macro you need to change a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290
access your macro you need to change a
 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.600
access your macro you need to change a
