00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.980
Fascinated me with your Twitter page and you like,

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.370
first of all, how you are a doctor, right?

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.280
<v 1>Well, I'm a PhD. I can't save anybody's life. I could perform, you know,</v>

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.320
Victorian surgery, amputation or something, but anybody can, right? Yeah,

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.730
no, this is, this is a prop. Um, so this is, this was a,

6
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:25.630
it was a real fun thing to get through customs when I was coming in from

7
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:29.980
Britain. It's a Victorian amputation saw. It's called the clockwork saw.

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.670
And um, for people who are just listening, it's,

9
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.850
it's a circular saw and there would have been a crank that you wound it with and

10
00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:40.570
then you'd release it and it would spin sort of automatically. Oh yeah.

11
00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:42.400
And the idea was that it would make it faster.

12
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:46.570
But the reason why I love this sauce so much is that it was a massive failure.

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.860
And, um, I don't think we talk about failure enough in science and medicine.

14
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.100
You know, all the things that work, there's a lot of things that don't work.

15
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:57.970
And so this guy who invented this saw, when he tried it out,

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.480
it was spinning so fast that he took off his assistance fingers. Oh,

17
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.930
Jesus Christ, oops. It never got out of prototype phase.

18
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.840
So I had to recreate it for my YouTube channel.

19
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.510
<v 0>Now when you were in those old days when they didn't have antibiotics and</v>

20
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.040
antiseptic, and when they saw someone's leg off or something like that,

21
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.500
how many times those people live?

22
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.900
<v 1>Well, you could pull through the operation. That was one part of it.</v>

23
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:29.860
But then of course you could die a postoperative infection. So my book,

24
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.520
the Patreon art really focuses on this one guy named Joseph Lister,

25
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.810
who applies germ theory and develops antisepsis. So germ fighting techniques,

26
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.740
and most people don't know who he is, but they know the product. Listerine.

27
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.340
So Listerine was named after him by, uh,

28
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.910
I always tell people that. So basically, uh,

29
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.500
Lister was a British surgeon and he came to America in 1876 to convince the

30
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:54.940
medical community of germs.

31
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.090
And there was a guy in the audience and he decided to create this product.

32
00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:01.420
Listerine. But it wasn't even a mouthwash in the 19th century.

33
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.480
It was used to treat gonorrhea. Whoa. So,

34
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.360
but also I don't endorse that little Listerine.

35
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.010
I could just see all the comments already on the YouTube, you know,

36
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:15.610
she told me to throw a story and I didn't know I, I don't endorse that.

37
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:18.700
And I'm sure the Listerine company is not too pleased I talking about that

38
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:23.440
either. So Listerine now just is for breath, right? Yeah,

39
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:28.060
yeah. It's, yeah, it's, it's a, it's an antiseptic mouthwash and so

40
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.510
<v 0>good for you. Like is it good to kill all that stuff inside your mouth? Like</v>

41
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.460
<v 1>I'm not a real doctor or a medical historian. I'm a medical historian.</v>

42
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:39.790
I would say that Dennis would say that that was strings still a good product.

43
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.810
[inaudible] bacteria. Yeah, form of it. Something like that.

44
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:45.820
I just use something, I don't know if it's cropped mouthwash.

45
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.390
You got to switch to Listerine now in honor of, of Joseph Lister.

46
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.070
<v 0>So how did he know? How did he know that there was germs? That they were real?</v>

47
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.420
<v 1>So let me, let me take you back to sort of before he walks on the scene.</v>

48
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:58.970
So these operating theaters, they were filled to the rafters,

49
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.130
ticketed spectators,

50
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.280
people actually bought tickets to see someone get their leg hacked off. Oh God,

51
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.500
no, I, you know what, no one's asked me that.

52
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.040
I don't know how much the ticket would cost for that. That's spectacle.

53
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.570
Now I really need to look into that.

54
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.900
But people would pay to watch that they paid for the book,

55
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.590
what they pay to watch now. Right. You know, we could say, you know,

56
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.770
and when I sent you my book, I signed it and I said,

57
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.890
I thought that being strapped to the Victorian operating theater was the

58
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.240
original fear factor because I can't imagine anything worse than being strapped

59
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.020
to this table. And so we're talking about before anesthesia.

60
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:36.160
So you're fully awake.

61
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.620
And one of my favorite surgeons is this guy named Robert list and he's six two,

62
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.540
he's really tall for the 19th century.

63
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.840
And he could hold you down with his left arm and you could take your leg off in

64
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:51.070
about 30 seconds. Oh Jesus. Which is what you'd want. That's what you'd want.

65
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.580
But that's still a long time. It is. Yeah.

66
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.390
I mean if we just sat here for 30 seconds with dead air time and you could think

67
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:02.170
about hacking through that leg and

68
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.490
I wonder how many people would be at the end of this podcast.

69
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.920
Like five people would be still out there listening. Um, so,

70
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:14.020
so he was incredibly fast. He was known as the fastest knife in the West end.

71
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.170
He would walk in, he was a showman. So he'd walk in and he'd say,

72
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.890
tie me gentlemen and you could just hear the ripple of pocket watches as they

73
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.410
came out there is, yup.

74
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.010
There he is in that photo. Yeah.

75
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.780
So actually the list and knife that he invented was this long bladed knife,

76
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:34.420
which they think Jack the ripper may have also used,

77
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.050
which is why those rumors are that Jack the ripper may have been a medical

78
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:42.550
practitioner, but a really common thought.

79
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.120
Yeah. I mean we're never going to know who he is. It's unknowable.

80
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.190
We're still kind of obsessed with this.

81
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.130
I've heard so many different versions that, yeah.

82
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:54.130
And recently there was some kind of bogus DNA test of,

83
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:57.160
of a shawl that they said belonged to one of the victims,

84
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:02.050
but it's impossible to prove the Providence of the object, but that was listed.

85
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:03.580
So he's six two, he's really tall.

86
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.190
One of my favorite stories is he would go so fast as he was switching

87
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:09.581
instruments,

88
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:13.510
he'd hold these bloody instruments in his mouth just to illustrate how different

89
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:17.470
this was. That's the face I wanted.

90
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.220
I wanted to just be just totally disgusted through this whole segment. Um,

91
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.020
and as he was switching instruments,

92
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.440
he accidentally cut off his assistance finger and then as he was switching

93
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:26.861
instrument,

94
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:30.700
he slashed the code of the spectator and the assistant died of gangrene.

95
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.590
The patient died of gangrene and the spectator died of fright. So it's juggling.

96
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.180
He died of the red blood. Well he got slashed in the,

97
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.600
with the jacket and I guess he had a heart attack from the stress.

98
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:47.350
And so it's jokingly referred to as the only operation with a 300% mortality

99
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:51.010
rate. You did a good job that day. He killed three, three people in one.

100
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:55.720
And you say slashed, you mean he cut the spectator or just, no,

101
00:05:55.721 --> 00:06:00.320
he just cut their coat as he was kind of switching instruments to kill someone.

102
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:03.110
I thought people were tougher back then. Well, not that guy.

103
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.650
And now he lives forever in the butchery and art is that guy.

104
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.650
I had a heart attack. He must've had a heart attack.

105
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:13.700
It said he died a afraid maybe that wasn't real. Maybe it wasn't a core shit,

106
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.560
doesn't it? A little bit like no, you, no, no, no, no, no.

107
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:21.890
Of course these stories, you know, they get, they get blown out or proportion.

108
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:26.870
Yeah. Just seems like, did you cut someone's jacket, let die? Well,

109
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.670
it's, you know, it's a stressful situation.

110
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:30.710
People are getting their limbs hacked off, you know,

111
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:35.540
your blood pressure would be really high. Um, and the, in these theaters were,

112
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.960
I mean the, the floor of the operating theater was crowded as well,

113
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.750
so they'd have to actually clear the floor sometimes. So you can imagine,

114
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.140
you know, you're strapped to this and the leg wasn't the worst thing.

115
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.200
So one of the tweets that you shared of mine, which, uh,

116
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:53.120
your platforms seem to enjoy quite a lot and sold me a lot of books by the way.

117
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.110
Thank you. Um,

118
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.150
well it's this story about this guy who was suffering from a bladder stone and

119
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:00.980
it got stuck in his urethra.

120
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.020
And so out of desperation he stuck a nail down his penis and he hammered it to

121
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:08.780
break it up. I remember that. And uh, yeah,

122
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:11.490
people went nuts on your platform for that story. So they,

123
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.120
they obviously are ready for this interview. How did that work again?

124
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.970
It didn't work right? It did not work. Now he died. Oops.

125
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:19.400
That guy definitely died. Um, but it's,

126
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.840
it really illustrates how desperate people were back then and how few options

127
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.780
they had. There's the image of it.

128
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.450
I don't think you'll have to show this on YouTube, Jamie.

129
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.690
That was the one I said.

130
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.720
I'm sure it's a medical image on YouTube. Really. It's clearly a penis.

131
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.160
There's, there's penises and breasts on YouTube. Penis photos.

132
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.280
Think they look at us more carefully. All right, well it's not on there.

133
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.350
I'm just, okay, good. I'll tweet it later for people.

134
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.450
You have people want to see it. We'll tweet.

135
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.090
Twitter is the most open of all platforms.

136
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.580
I'll let you get away with almost everything. You can have porn on Twitter.

137
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.280
Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't have any problems with Instagram.

138
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:05.570
I put that stuff up, but, but maybe again, things get removed some Instagram.

139
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:06.530
It's really kind of interesting.

140
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.000
It seems to be dependent upon how many people complain. Yeah,

141
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:14.420
probably there's, there's always those people out there looking to be offended.

142
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.000
I just think they just want to do something.

143
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:21.860
They just want to press that button. Yeah. There we go. I know I get a L,

144
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.970
you know, at this point there's so many objects that that can cause a fence,

145
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:28.130
of course, with medical history and it's, it's, you know,

146
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.340
there's a lot of dark history Bodysnatchers and things like that.

147
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.210
And I'm a firm believer that we should tell these stories openly because they

148
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:38.260
happened in medicine and science grew as a result of it. But,

149
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:41.360
but they're not easy subjects to discuss with an audience,

150
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:43.790
especially when you have so many characters on Twitter and you're,

151
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.830
you're trying to get out a complex idea, but also like you're not just, ER,

152
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.190
there's a lot of Twitter pages that I follow where people just try to gross

153
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:56.070
people out. You're actually educating people the history

154
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.090
<v 0>and we all should be really thankful that these people went through all this</v>

155
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.890
stuff so that we don't have to.

156
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.760
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. I always say to my audience, so I,</v>

157
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.350
I'd been going around the world sort of demolishing romantic notions about

158
00:09:08.351 --> 00:09:10.750
people who might think about what it's like to live in the past.

159
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.310
Cause it was pretty, pretty bad.

160
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.790
And I have visuals as well and I've had four men faints so far.

161
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.730
It's always been, man, it's just a commentary right now. It's always been men.

162
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.390
Yeah, it was that guy. Yeah, those, those weaklings coming to my lecture.

163
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:33.040
And I think what it is though is people think I'm going to see something gross

164
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.890
so I'm not going to eat. And then their blood sugar plummets.

165
00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:39.580
So it's not really the crisis, but they're not really prepared, you know,

166
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.860
and they're, yeah. And they're standing.

167
00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:46.150
Sometimes I give lectures at this incredible museum called the old operating

168
00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.190
theater in London. It's the second oldest in the world.

169
00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:51.760
And so you have to stand because it's like a Victorian operating theater and so

170
00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:53.680
people lock their knees or whatever.

171
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.540
<v 0>Oh wow. So you give actual lectures in the real theaters where they used to cut.</v>

172
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.300
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I did my book launch there and if people want to see it, um,</v>

173
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:04.290
I filmed sort of a,

174
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:09.291
like a theatrical scene of a young Lister attending an operation in that theater

175
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:13.200
and it's on my YouTube channel condo under the knife. Um,

176
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:17.040
and I really want to get this made into a movie. Um,

177
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.850
I'm trying to come into Hollywood and convince Hollywood that this Quaker

178
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:24.990
certain from the Victorian period deserves the cinema a feature,

179
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:29.280
but it is an Epic story. He saved more lives than any other person to ever live.

180
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.050
<v 0>Well, look at it is an Epic story.</v>

181
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.480
And for anybody who's ever gone through operations,

182
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:36.600
and I've gone through several of them, we owe those people a massive,

183
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.510
<v 1>yeah, you don't have to be awake strapped to the table.</v>

184
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.830
Both my knees reconstructed. Yeah. Wake up and they're fixed. Yeah,

185
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.980
it's amazing. And in the past, before anesthesia,

186
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:52.120
a lot of times patients were sat in chairs so they weren't laid down. Um,

187
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.750
and they were sat in these very high chairs so that their feet dangled so they

188
00:10:55.751 --> 00:10:57.100
couldn't brace against the knife.

189
00:10:57.101 --> 00:11:00.190
If you think about pushing off with your right, um, there's a,

190
00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:04.600
there's a story about a guy named Robert Penman and I know we have images and

191
00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:08.950
I'm sure YouTube won't take those down. Um, he, he comes to, uh,

192
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:09.940
Robert Liston,

193
00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:13.660
the fastest knife in the West end in the eight and 1828 and he has this huge

194
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.800
facial tumor growing. I mean, it's been growing for about eight years.

195
00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:19.240
It's taking off his whole face.

196
00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:22.870
He can't breathe now and list and looks at him and says,

197
00:11:22.871 --> 00:11:26.320
I can't do this operation, which is tantamount to a death sentence.

198
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.140
But he goes up to Scotland and he goes, there he is. Wow. Yeah, it's,

199
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:34.210
it's incredible when you see that painting. Um,

200
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.280
so Penman goes up to Scotland and he sees a guy named James Simon Sime agrees to

201
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:44.281
do this operation and payment is sat for 24 minutes in a chair restrained while

202
00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:49.150
this thing is caught out of his face, drops in a bucket. And, and um,

203
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.570
yeah. Well we have a picture of him later in life, you know, and he,

204
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:56.470
yeah,

205
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.920
it looks kind of like an ugly Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln wasn't really known

206
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:03.760
for his looks. He doesn't have a thing on his face though. Yeah. I mean,

207
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:07.600
you could see that the jaw is definitely slimmer,

208
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.080
but he doesn't look too deformed considering what he went through.

209
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.190
So it is incredible. Um, you get such crazy stories,

210
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:19.990
like there's a woman who has a mastectomy in 1840 without any anesthetic.

211
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.530
Now at this time, you would have, if you were wealthy or if you're middle-class,

212
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:25.030
you'd have this operation in your home.

213
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.210
You just have it on like your kitchen table, which is,

214
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.630
which would have been safer than going into the hospitals. Yeah.

215
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:34.900
Because the hospitals were crawling with all kinds of infection.

216
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.910
So hospitals were places for the poor.

217
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.910
And to give you an idea of how gross it was,

218
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.540
the bug catcher who had read on the beds of lice,

219
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:46.900
he was paid more than the doctors and surgeons in this time. Yeah.

220
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.450
Cause I mean that's pretty important, right? There's maggots,

221
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:51.460
all kinds of things crawling around in these hospitals.

222
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.530
So if you are wealthy or middle class,

223
00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:58.330
you had your surgeon come to your home and so she has a surgeon come and the

224
00:12:58.331 --> 00:13:01.870
surgeon determines that yes, the bras has to come off and says,

225
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.420
I'm going to return, but I'm not going to tell you the day,

226
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.580
which would make me more anxious.

227
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.920
He thought it was going to help her not focus on it,

228
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.950
but all you would be thinking about right is when is this guy going to show up?

229
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.120
That's a person without breasts. Yeah, yeah, exactly. He was like,

230
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:17.650
I'll just show up. It'll be easy.

231
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.510
And so he shows up and he goes into her bedroom and he opens his hand and shows

232
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.980
of the knife he's gonna use and he says to prepare her soul for death.

233
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.050
Like this isn't very confidence inspiring.

234
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:32.230
Any doctors listening don't tell your patients to prepare their soul for debt.

235
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.050
And um, and she's,

236
00:13:34.051 --> 00:13:39.051
she does survive and she talks about how it's so vascular that the blood blinds

237
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:42.550
him at one point. And so like, just when you think it can't get worse,

238
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.200
he can't see and he's under,

239
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.780
she is under his hand for an hour and a half cups away and she survived. She,

240
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:52.900
she ends up living a long and somewhat happy life.

241
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:54.310
I'm sure she had a lot of nightmares. Yeah,

242
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.670
there was see us or do they tie this woman down? Like how do they, Oh yeah,

243
00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.620
they would've definitely had to restrain her. I mean,

244
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:05.020
I mean people were probably a little bit stronger or more able to adapt to pain

245
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:08.890
than we are. But nonetheless, there would have been some pretty heavy restraint.

246
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.410
That was in the 1840s.

247
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.120
So we know when cancer became common or was it always common?

248
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.710
Humans? That's a good question.

249
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:22.711
The oldest archeological record I believe is 2000 years old of metastatic

250
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.840
cancers. So it's older than you think.

251
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:29.980
They're diagnosing it for for centuries and centuries.

252
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:33.400
I'm not really an expert in history of cancer, but it is around.

253
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:36.730
And so with breast cancer, you know,

254
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:39.130
probably by the time it got to the stage of mastectomy,

255
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:40.270
it probably would've spread.

256
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.530
If you think about like you know it being visible to the naked eye yet she

257
00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:46.300
survived. She did survive.

258
00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:49.360
And so then you have to question whether she had breast cancer or maybe it was

259
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:54.050
some kind of like, yeah, maybe a, and she went through that for that. But yeah,

260
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.890
and again,

261
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.630
before antiseptics before Lister comes on and comes up with germ fighting

262
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:00.141
techniques,

263
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:03.770
this would have been so dangerous because you have this open cavity and wounds.

264
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.820
And so Joseph Lister, when he comes up with his antiseptic techniques,

265
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:11.420
he actually performs a mastectomy on his sister, on his dining room table,

266
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.230
which, and she survives. And that's in the book. See this,

267
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:16.760
this would be a great movie. Don't you think?

268
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.760
I do think it would be a great movie. It's like,

269
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.200
it would be a great movie for the Cohen brothers. Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.160
Cause it's so chaos Phil. I know. And all of that kind of grittiness and yeah.

271
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.680
Good period pieces too. Yeah. They could make it more entertaining.

272
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.730
Make this happen. Joe. I'm not a part of that world.

273
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.450
This guy with the face where they cut that tumor out of his face.

274
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:42.860
So for 24 minutes,

275
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.490
that's all it took to cut that thing out of his face and that, that case. Yeah.

276
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:49.160
And remember of course it depended on the skill of your surgeon.

277
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:53.270
So he goes to a very good surgeon named James Syme. Um, but there,

278
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.020
there a story. So going back to penises, um,

279
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.660
there's lithotomy is the removal of the stone,

280
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.910
which you saw kind of a demonstration there. Um, and it was incredibly painful.

281
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.250
So they stuck a rod on the penis and they cut through the scrotum.

282
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:08.390
They removed the stone.

283
00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:11.210
And of course there was no pain medication and it was just awful.

284
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.230
Did they drink it? You know, it's kind of a myth because of course,

285
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.340
drinking within your blood, but someone asked me, they said,

286
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.960
I heard that surgeons would punch the patient out, and I was like, Oh,

287
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:27.890
you have to be really good to knock someone out on a first punch.

288
00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:30.710
And of course he'd do more damage. You could do a lot of damage to the hat.

289
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.370
That's definitely didn't happen.
