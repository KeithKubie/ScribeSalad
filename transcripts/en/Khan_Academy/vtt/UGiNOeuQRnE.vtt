00:00:00.354 --> 00:00:02.627
- [Instructor] Over
the course of the 1600s

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:05.242
the English continued to settle along

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:08.420
the eastern seaboard of North America.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.877
Now we've already talked about
the settlements at Virginia

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:14.350
and those of Massachusetts

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.145
and a little bit about the
settlement of New York,

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.391
which was first founded by the Dutch

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.917
as New Amsterdam in 1624.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.647
In this video I want to talk a little bit

00:00:23.647 --> 00:00:25.957
more about the Middle Colonies.

00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:28.404
These colonies that were here kind of on

00:00:28.404 --> 00:00:30.770
the center of the eastern seaboard,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.116
south of Massachusetts and north of

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:36.421
the Southern Colonies of Virginia,

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:38.588
particularly Pennsylvania,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.983
New York,

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:43.001
New Jersey,

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.649
and this little, tiny purple
colony right here, Delaware.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.652
Now what's unique about
the Middle Colonies

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:53.952
compared to the northern
or southern colonies

00:00:53.952 --> 00:00:56.414
is not just that they were kind of in

00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:57.997
a central location,

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:01.747
but also that they were
proprietary colonies,

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:06.279
which means that they were the property

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:08.029
of individual owners.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.011
So unlike Jamestown, for example,

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:15.364
which was founded by a
company, the Virginia Company,

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:18.716
the colony of Pennsylvania
was founded by one man,

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:19.799
William Penn,

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:25.194
who was granted his land
by the king of England

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:27.429
in exchange for a debt that the king

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:28.891
had owed his father.

00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:32.384
So in the early years of
these proprietary colonies,

00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:35.143
they were kind of the playgrounds

00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:37.653
of the people who owned them.

00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:40.398
They could set their own
rules for the most part.

00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:42.896
And that freedom resulted in colonies

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:45.646
that were more ethnically diverse

00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:49.909
and more religiously tolerant

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.056
than their neighbors
to the north or south.

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:56.069
So let's look at the
colony of Pennsylvania

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.125
as an example.

00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:00.329
So Pennsylvania was
founded by William Penn,

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.846
and Penn was a English aristocrat

00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:06.328
from a very good family who'd converted

00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:08.245
to the Quaker religion.

00:02:10.882 --> 00:02:13.134
Although the real name for Quakers was

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:15.884
the Religious Society of Friends,

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:21.976
they got the nickname Quaker because

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:25.842
they seemed to quake when they
were in religious ecstasy.

00:02:25.842 --> 00:02:28.391
Like the Puritans, Quakers faced religious

00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:31.580
persecution in England
because they did not

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.208
follow the Church of England,

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:36.918
which was a form of
rebellion against the king

00:02:36.918 --> 00:02:38.790
who was the head of the Church of England.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.907
But in addition to the
Quakers' strange ideas

00:02:41.907 --> 00:02:45.216
about religion, they also
had some strange ideas

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:48.628
for the time period about social status.

00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:51.005
Quakers believed that all people had

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.477
the light of God in
them and therefore were

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:56.323
more or less equal in stature.

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:59.174
So for example, women
could preach in church,

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:01.839
as you see in this image right here.

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:05.634
So when William Penn
converted to the Quaker faith,

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:08.226
Penn had a really rough time of it.

00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:11.922
So he came upon an idea that perhaps he

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:15.161
could make a haven for Quakers

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.764
and for religious dissenters more broadly

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.050
in the New World.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.140
So he negotiated with the king

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.804
who owed his father a debt,

00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:25.000
and in exchange for this debt,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.667
the king granted Penn
land in North America,

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:32.559
which was named Pennsylvania,

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.368
sylvania being Latin for forest.

00:03:35.368 --> 00:03:38.906
So kind of Penn's forest, Penn's woods.

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:42.388
And Penn decided to extend
his religious tolerance

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:46.221
not just to Quakers, but
really to all people.

00:03:47.057 --> 00:03:50.825
All Protestants, no matter what their

00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:54.144
particular sect, could have citizenship,

00:03:54.144 --> 00:03:56.092
run for office, vote,

00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:58.838
and Catholics and even Jews

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.424
were welcome in Pennsylvania,

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:02.956
although they did not have the right

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:04.873
to vote or hold office.

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:10.547
This was incredibly
radical for the time period

00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:13.439
when it was common for nations to have

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.931
a state religion and to persecute those

00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:18.195
who didn't follow that religion.

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:21.466
Penn advertised for his new colony

00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:25.282
and particularly hoped
that industrious people,

00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:27.998
people with skills like carpentry

00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:30.550
or blacksmithing, would
come to Pennsylvania

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.723
and make it a prosperous colony.

00:04:32.723 --> 00:04:33.563
And they did.

00:04:33.563 --> 00:04:35.677
The ease of getting citizenship,

00:04:35.677 --> 00:04:37.298
the religious tolerance,

00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:40.883
and the plentiful and
cheap land of Pennsylvania

00:04:40.883 --> 00:04:43.140
drew many settlers to the colony

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.389
such that its principal
city, Philadelphia,

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.472
was the largest city in North America

00:04:50.578 --> 00:04:52.101
before the Revolution,

00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:55.088
with about 40,000 inhabitants.

00:04:55.088 --> 00:04:57.768
Because Quakers were pacifists,

00:04:57.768 --> 00:05:01.906
that is they did not
believe in violence or war,

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:04.684
they even lived peacefully
with Native Americans

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:07.416
in the early years of
Pennsylvania settlement.

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:10.236
But as more immigrants of different faiths

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:13.727
came to Pennsylvania
and began pushing west,

00:05:13.727 --> 00:05:16.931
that short era of peaceful
co-habitation ended.

00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:19.752
Likewise, because Quakers believed in

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:23.028
the innate equality of all human beings,

00:05:23.028 --> 00:05:25.528
they were not fond of slavery.

00:05:27.397 --> 00:05:30.001
The environment in the Middle Colonies

00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:33.755
was not so cold as it was in the north,

00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:36.631
not so hot as it was in the south,

00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:38.631
it was kind of middling.

00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:43.884
And so it was a very
good place for farming,

00:05:43.884 --> 00:05:46.967
particularly cereal crops like wheat.

00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:50.407
You can see this print here

00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:53.793
shows wheat growing in this field.

00:05:53.793 --> 00:05:56.293
And just as the name suggests,

00:05:57.285 --> 00:05:59.930
Pennsylvania had a lot of wood,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.683
so it was also a good place for timber.

00:06:03.683 --> 00:06:06.367
And the excellent ports at Philadelphia

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:09.238
and New York City made it an excellent

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.571
place for trade.

00:06:11.963 --> 00:06:14.270
Because it was such a
good place to grow food,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.828
the Middle Colonies got the nickname

00:06:15.828 --> 00:06:17.974
the Breadbasket Colonies.

00:06:17.974 --> 00:06:21.327
And the patterns of land
ownership reflect this.

00:06:21.327 --> 00:06:23.408
Since the soil was good,

00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:26.638
your average farmer owned more land

00:06:26.638 --> 00:06:29.494
than a New England farmer,

00:06:29.494 --> 00:06:32.494
but not as much as a Virginia farmer

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:37.401
who would've had many
acres to grow tobacco.

00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:39.482
So much like the environment,

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.524
the farms in the Middle Colonies were

00:06:42.524 --> 00:06:43.941
middling in size.

00:06:48.093 --> 00:06:50.784
In fact, if I had to
put the Middle Colonies

00:06:50.784 --> 00:06:52.618
on a spectrum,

00:06:52.618 --> 00:06:55.303
in many places I'd put
them right in the middle

00:06:55.303 --> 00:06:57.593
when it came to an economy

00:06:57.593 --> 00:06:59.709
that was more agrarian.

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:02.519
The Middle Colonies had
a little bit of both,

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.456
unlike the Chesapeake
and southern economies

00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:07.873
which were strongly agrarian.

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:13.328
And unlike the New England colonies

00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:16.140
who began manufacturing quite early.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.767
Likewise, when it comes
to the distribution

00:07:18.767 --> 00:07:20.699
of wealth in the Middle Colonies,

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.940
once again I'd put the Middle Colonies

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.621
right here in the center.

00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:29.097
There were plenty of middling farmers,

00:07:29.097 --> 00:07:30.986
many indentured servants,

00:07:30.986 --> 00:07:34.844
and a handful of people
who became quite wealthy,

00:07:34.844 --> 00:07:37.906
unlike the Chesapeake where there were

00:07:37.906 --> 00:07:42.024
a handful of extremely wealthy landowners

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:45.014
while most people lived at the bottom

00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:46.329
of the social scale,

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:48.968
and unlike New England where small farming

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.187
led to a fairly even middle class.

00:07:52.187 --> 00:07:55.199
So the Middle Colonies had a mixed economy

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.199
of industry and farming,

00:07:59.338 --> 00:08:02.818
and a fairly balanced class structure

00:08:02.818 --> 00:08:05.901
with people at many different levels,

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:10.162
putting them smack dab in the middle.

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:12.983
But for all of the ways
that the Middle Colonies

00:08:12.983 --> 00:08:15.682
were middling, there were also a few ways

00:08:15.682 --> 00:08:17.867
that they were quite extraordinary.

00:08:17.867 --> 00:08:19.548
Well, we've already mentioned that

00:08:19.548 --> 00:08:23.327
the Middle Colonies had a
level of religious freedom

00:08:23.327 --> 00:08:26.171
that was virtually unmatched anywhere

00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:27.323
else in the world.

00:08:27.323 --> 00:08:30.050
For example, Pennsylvania
extended citizenship

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.550
to all Protestants

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.869
and tolerated Catholics and Jews.

00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:41.915
In comparison, the Chesapeake
and Southern Colonies

00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:46.010
required citizens to belong
to the Anglican faith,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.819
the Church of England,

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.817
and religious tolerance
for the Catholic Church

00:08:50.817 --> 00:08:55.580
in Maryland and New Englanders
were extremely strict.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.984
For example, in Massachusetts Bay,

00:08:58.984 --> 00:09:01.472
anyone who was not Puritan

00:09:01.472 --> 00:09:03.608
was expelled or executed.

00:09:03.608 --> 00:09:05.695
Although there is of course the exception

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:09.607
of Rhode Island, where
religious dissenters

00:09:09.607 --> 00:09:11.216
could find safe haven.

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:13.291
The other extraordinary aspect of these

00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:16.015
middle colonies was just the sheer amount

00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:18.515
of ethnic diversity there was.

00:09:20.122 --> 00:09:22.303
By the time of the American Revolution,

00:09:22.303 --> 00:09:23.553
less than half,

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:27.331
only about 49% of inhabitants

00:09:28.347 --> 00:09:29.991
were from England

00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:32.656
or had an English background.

00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:35.656
The rest were German, French, Dutch,

00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:38.094
Scotch-Irish.

00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:42.711
And just a few Africans as there was

00:09:42.711 --> 00:09:45.266
relatively little slavery.

00:09:45.266 --> 00:09:47.970
In comparison, New England was perhaps

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.803
the least diverse of the colonies.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.853
Most people were English,

00:09:55.635 --> 00:09:59.302
with a handful of
remaining Native Americans

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:02.649
and Africans.

00:10:03.992 --> 00:10:06.824
And the Chesapeake and Southern Colonies

00:10:06.824 --> 00:10:09.574
were largely African and English,

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:14.986
with again just a few Native Americans.

00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:18.833
The people of the Middle Colonies spoke

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:22.268
many languages, practiced many faiths,

00:10:22.268 --> 00:10:26.696
