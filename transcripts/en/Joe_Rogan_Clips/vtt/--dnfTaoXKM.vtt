WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.320
Probably a good idea,
but then you look at Whitaker,
who's 85 such you,

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.900
he's stocky.
He's not like huge.

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:10.980
He's like the perfect size Whitaker cause he's still can knock out anybody,

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.090
but he's got awesome cardio and he's strong.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
He's not as strong as Yoel Romero,
but he's strong enough to hold them off.

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.540
No one is who is one is you got to get that,

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.750
that Cuban gene pool to get that because you know what I'm saying?
Like there's,

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.070
there's certain gene pools like that fucking mountain from game of Thrones.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.460
There's some gene pools out there,
man.
But yeah,

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.270
and then we throw in steroids in that pool.
Oh you do?
Do you say admitted to it?

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.380
Of course he did.
Of course he did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was like,
yeah,
no shit.
Yeah.

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.610
And then when they kept asking him about the guy you currently taken,
he goes,

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.740
listen,
I don't want really want to talk about this.
It's like,
yeah,
no,

14
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.130
of course I am.
Why are they asking questions like that?

15
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:53.290
And that's the strongest man contest.
But think about,
come on dude,

16
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.810
who's going to win you?
Who gives a fuck.
How about a style bender?
Verse Whitaker?

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.000
Yeah,
the all oceanic fight.

18
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.000
Are you really going to fly to Australia for that powder?

19
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.690
Are you thinking about it?
Dude?
There ain't.

20
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.400
There ain't two dudes on this planet and get me to fly to Australia too.

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.780
There's not it.
No dudes on this plan to be there live though.
Nels.
Yo,

22
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.750
I'd rather be here.
Tom,
you're crazy.

23
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.740
I love Australia.
But now for Brianna was like,
Yo Dude,
get,

24
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:23.800
does stray light like I'm on my way.
Say No more fam.
No,

25
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.060
not two dudes.
Yeah,
but that fight,
dude.

26
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:30.090
I want to see that fight in the flesh.
Live.
You're going to do it.

27
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.210
I think I might.
I want to see that.
That goes down.

28
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.110
I want to see fight would occur is a fucking animal man.

29
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.350
Just thinking about how much pain that guy had to be in to an almost fight with

30
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:45.840
a hernia and a ruptured.
He had a ruptured rectum,
right?

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.810
Was it ruptured rectum,
I thought was just a hernia.
That was fine.
No,
no.

32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.820
I think he had two major injuries.
No,
I know his intestines were popping through.

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.610
Yeah,
but I think it was another one.
Damn.
His rectum was fucked up too.

34
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.550
Isn't that,
didn't have a tear because I called a Jamie and find the hemorrhoid.

35
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.950
No,
no,
no.
Like a tear in his ass.

36
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.030
You don't think about the lighthouse drain from sparring?

37
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.150
Just think about getting taken down while you're trying to throw a kick.

38
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.110
You land fucked up on your hip.
Never ripped my asshole.

39
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.560
You can rip your ass hole.
I'm just saying I had drastic,

40
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.710
you catch a kick in the ass hole easily for sure.
Sure.
People whose eyes,

41
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:26.580
how about someone misses spinning back,
kick low and it just catches your tank.

42
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.230
Oh Man.
Just the heel hits your taint,
rips your tank away from the bone.

43
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.630
That shit happens.
I wonder what I,

44
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.890
I don't even know what the odds would be.

45
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:42.180
I would assume Whitaker's a slight favorite in that fight.
I would say so.
Yeah.

46
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:43.200
I would say,
you know,

47
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.230
based off one Helvin did well based off with Calvin did based off Whitaker's uh,

48
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.390
two fights with EOL.
He's been the only guy to hold yo off.

49
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.060
Although it does have said that.
I did think that you all won the second fight.

50
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:58.200
Interesting.
I thought Yo.
I think by go either scoring Yo wow.

51
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.850
Had them rocked and hurt by the new scoring.

52
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.910
I felt like it should have been worth more.
You does.
She had been at ten eight.

53
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.870
Yeah.
I mean he had him almost out hurt.
He hit him.
He staggered.

54
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.020
We didn't see him do that to Yo UL,

55
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.430
but buddy did survive around and survived.
He survived.
He won more rounds.

56
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.400
It's like how much all of the draw,
if you're watching a fight,

57
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:21.580
if a fight is a fight,
if it was,
I mean I understand it's a sport,

58
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.260
but it's the sport of fighting.

59
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.470
If you're watching a fight and one guy is really fucking a guy up and the other

60
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.440
guy never does that,
who do you think won that fight?

61
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.960
Do you think that you're right,
you can't.
Yeah,

62
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.230
but do you think the guy that just moves around and touches him with the Jab,

63
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.410
and I'm not saying this with Whitaker did,
but just as as a what if,

64
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.160
if a guy's just moving around for four rounds and he's touching you with a jab

65
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.410
and lay kicking you and shut and you were like fighting in the street,

66
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.220
but then in the fifth round you knock him down four times.

67
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.160
You beat the fuck out of him and he's running away from you.

68
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.690
His nose gets bloodied,

69
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.450
you end the fight with your hand raised without a mark on your face and the

70
00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:00.670
other guy's face is pizza.

71
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.120
Maybe I'd look at my boys by Dan for that first 20 that boy is moving.
Right,

72
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:07.210
right,
right.
It's quick.
It's a good question.
It's cause like what?

73
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.270
How much is that round work has a sport though.
Yeah,
that's what it is.

74
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.820
Because as a sport,
yeah,
it's tough to judge it.

75
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.410
If you're going to judge it on a scorecard,
you have to be,
it has to be punitive.

76
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.150
The question is like how much is it worth for a guy to really take it to a guy

77
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.150
and almost stop him?
See I don't,
I think there should be more draws.

78
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.410
I don't have a problem with the draw.

79
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.880
I don't have a problem with drugs when that fight,

80
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:30.580
if there was drama like that makes sense.
Redo it.
Let's get a clear cut winner.

81
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.750
I think when a person gets really rocked like that,
it's worth more than a point.

82
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.020
I think it's worth more than two points.
I think it's worth a lot.

83
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.950
You think she'd be like ten seven think it's a big deal.
Got then you fuck you.

84
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:44.670
Fuck you are fucking real life here cause or rough.

85
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.680
Well no cause real life you're kind of fucked,
right?

86
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.490
Like to the idea that you could go through around,

87
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.800
you don't know who won right around where.
It's like a lot of feeling out,

88
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.210
a lot of touching,
you know,
this and that and you know,
okay,
perfect example.

89
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.570
First round.
Anderson Silva versus style vendor.
Okay.

90
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.420
You could give it to style bender for sure,
but it was,

91
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.590
it was a round where they were feeling each other out.

92
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.410
There was not one big moment where,
Oh my God,
style benders,
take it over.

93
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.550
This fight is almost done.

94
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.270
So that's ten nine but yet another fight where a guy beats the shit out of a guy

95
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.840
and doesn't drop him and they have exchanges,
but the guy gets rocked and hurt.

96
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.020
That is that ten nine two I know it's weird.
What if he had takes them a drop?

97
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.690
Some of the guy barely survives.
You Hammer fist them attended the bell.

98
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.380
Is it ten nine in the old system?
It is,
but what is it in the new system?

99
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:33.640
Is it ten eight but if it's,

100
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.680
even if it's ten eight I think it should be more than ten eight like that guy

101
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.290
ran out,
but the only thing is your fuck.

102
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.910
Let's say you do at ten six or seven right.
Then get dropped.

103
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.540
It's going to be tough.

104
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.150
You got to get him in his argument against what I'm saying.

105
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.420
Here's the argument against it.
Frankie Edgar versus gray Maynard.

106
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.950
Especially the first one,
right?
Gray Maynard drops him as him,

107
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:55.600
badly hurt in the first round.

108
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.590
Frankie manages to survive and come back and win enough rounds.

109
00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:02.530
And when the fight exception though,
but it is exceptional.
It's kind of,

110
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.940
if you gave him like five points for that round.
Yeah.
