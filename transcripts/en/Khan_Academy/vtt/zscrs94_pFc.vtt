Shantanu: We tell teachers that you
shouldn't be the sage on the stage

00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:15.720
but you should actually
be the guide on the side.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.219
But they really don't have the tools

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.954
that are necessary to really
make that possible today.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.759
One of the big differences
with Khan Academy

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:30.975
is that we're not trying to just replicate
the existing systems using technology

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:34.196
to augment the way existing
instruction is done.

00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:38.572
We're fundamentally thinking
about reinventing instruction.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.343
Sal: We've gotten letters
from teachers who said,

00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:44.142
"Hey, you've already given the lecture
on L'Hopitals rule or the unit circle."

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:47.370
Instead of me giving the
basic lecture on that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.658
and then assigning
homework, we flip the model.

00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:52.486
I'm assigning the lecture
for them to watch at home

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:53.946
and then they can watch what I assign.

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:56.114
But then if they have some
questions they can re-mediate

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:58.693
and watch stuff that was
taught in previous sections.

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:02.590
Or if they're bored they can move
ahead and go as advance as they want.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.566
Then when they go into the classroom
they can actually do problems,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.282
they should do their
homework in the classroom.

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:10.237
We have this teacher dash board right now

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:13.370
where it shows all of the
students and all of the concepts.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.642
Within a glance a teacher
can see whose mastered what,

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:18.095
who's struggling with what,

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:20.920
where each student is in their
development and learning.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.287
They can see in real time where
all the students are in aggregate.

00:01:24.287 --> 00:01:25.819
The coach will be able to see who's stuck.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.264
They can click on any one of the concepts

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:30.726
and see exactly what the
students have been up to.

00:01:30.726 --> 00:01:33.268
By problem, they can see how
long they spent on each problem.

00:01:33.268 --> 00:01:34.512
Did they get it right or wrong?

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:37.171
Did they watch the video before
or after working on that problem.

00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:40.751
If they saw that they got a problem wrong
they can actually click on that part

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.128
and see the exact problem
that they got wrong,

00:01:43.128 --> 00:01:45.659
so they can really diagnose and
do very focused interventions

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.442
to kind of make sure that all
of the students are progressing.

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:52.203
In every other industry, if you want to
diagnose why something is not working,

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:54.513
you try to get as much
data on it as possible,

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.283
so that you can really say, "Okay,"

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.928
"I need to just tighten
that part right over there."

00:01:58.404 --> 00:02:00.889
What we're trying to do is give
teachers that level of data.

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.191
Shantanu: We can just try to
impact individuals directly

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:07.383
without having to change the
entire educational system.

00:02:07.383 --> 00:02:12.153
Sal: To roll out it's actually super
simple, it's all web based, it's all free,

00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:15.623
so literally if a school has internet
connectivity and has computers,

00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:19.865
any type of computer, they're ready
to start 1 + 1 and get to Calculus.
