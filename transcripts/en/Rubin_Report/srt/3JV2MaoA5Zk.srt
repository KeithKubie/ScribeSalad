1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,940
joining me today is the editor
of human progress, that Oregon,

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:12,560
a senior policy analyst at the Center
for Global Liberty and prosperity.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,410
Marion Tupe. Welcome to the Rubin
report. Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,470
I am a very excited to have you on.
Uh, we've met once before, uh, for, uh,

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,590
dinner.
Uh,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,180
but what you're doing with human
progress I think is just spectacular.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,270
You guys are actually promoting good news.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,300
There is actual good news and good
things happening in the world and it

10
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:38,330
seemingly, uh, is something that
people don't often talk about.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,120
So I think you're doing great work and
we're going to spend an hour talking

12
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:44,420
about a lot of the good
stuff that is happening. Uh,

13
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:47,780
but I always like to start with
a little bio on people. So, uh,

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,520
tell me a little bit about yourself. How'd
you end up working for human progress?

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,450
Well, I was born, uh,

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,210
behind the iron curtain and what
was then a communist Czechoslovakia.

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,360
And so,
uh,

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,500
from early age I started to understand
the importance of political and economic

19
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:08,820
freedom. Oh, be hit neither, um,

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,450
in regular and it pretty quick.
And that's right. And then, uh, um,

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,840
when the wall came down in 1999,
uh,

22
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,920
me and my parents went for
Christmas in Vienna. Uh,

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,240
that was the first time that you could
actually leave your country and you could

24
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:28,930
travel abroad as a family. Uh,
how old were you at the time?

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,370
I was 13. Um, uh,

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,400
because before then, uh, people
still could travel to the west,

27
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,180
but they would keep the, the, the,
the children behind as hostages.

28
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:42,850
But now that the wall came down
and it comes from collapsed,

29
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,230
you could travel anywhere he wanted.
So we decided to go to Vienna. And,

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
and the moment that we crossed the
border into a western capitalist liberal

31
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:54,274
democracy,

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,630
it was like stepping out of a black
and white movie into a color film.

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,210
Uh, everything was just so much
beautiful, so much more beautiful. Um,

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,010
the shops were full, people were
smiling, that was color everywhere.

35
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,960
And, uh, so I think that even
at that early stage of my life,

36
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:17,980
I started to think about
what makes countries rich,

37
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:22,660
what makes countries poor. And that's,
I think where my interest in, uh, in,

38
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,010
in all of that started.
Really.

39
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,010
Yeah. Tell me a little bit
about your, your education.

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,240
Well, I, uh, went to high school
and a undergraduate in Johannesburg,

41
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:35,400
South Africa of all
places, uh, because, uh,

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,470
when the wall came down and my
parents emigrated to, to South Africa,

43
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:44,450
they are medical doctors. And so
with our expertise was needed. Um,

44
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,570
so as a kid I got to see both the fall
of communism and also the fall of a part

45
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,490
eight,
which is kind of a unique experience.

46
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,160
I'm very glad I had the kind of
childhood or upbringing I had. Um,

47
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,290
and, uh, I,

48
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,700
so I finished my undergraduate at
the University of Witwatersrand in

49
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,534
Johannesburg,

50
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,550
and then I went to do my master's and
my phd at Saint Andrews in Scotland.

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,930
Um, yeah. Well,

52
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,920
what's it like being in these
places when something is falling,

53
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,960
like communism or apartheid?

54
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:20,140
Because we seem to live in a time right
now where a lot of people think that

55
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,690
we're watching parts of the
west kind of fall. And you,

56
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:27,010
you've seen some stuff
fall. Yes. I think that, uh,

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,580
for the vast majority of the
population in Czechoslovakia, oh,

58
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,520
clearly the fall of communism
was a tremendous blessing.

59
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:38,220
There was immense amount of optimism,
um,

60
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,350
about the future and also unavoidable
disappointment with some aspects of the

61
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:48,850
Utopian future that people
have imagined. Nonetheless. Um,

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,930
just about anybody who analyzes economics
and politics in central and eastern

63
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:57,160
Europe over the last 25 years
concludes that people are much,

64
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,140
much better off than they used to be.

65
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,490
And I think the similar thing was
happening for a vast majority of South

66
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,240
Africans, especially black South
Africans who never had a vote,

67
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,290
whoever had political rights or most
political rights and are partied.

68
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,780
And of course in 1994,
um,

69
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,230
so Africa held its first
multiracial democratic elections.

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,030
And as a consequence there was also a
tremendous amount of optimism, again,

71
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:26,260
followed by the inevitable
disappointments as reality set in.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,310
Nonetheless,

73
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,310
it's an extraordinary time of
enthusiasm and optimism and tremendous,

74
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,220
I think, um, that sense of
brotherhood between people. Yeah.

75
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,770
Do you think that's necessary?

76
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:42,760
That sort of Utopian vision of when things
are changing that everything is going

77
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,580
to be magically fixed and better.
And then as you're saying,

78
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,800
then there's that period
where you go, oh, it didn't,

79
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,260
everything didn't magically
get fixed at once,

80
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,590
but you sort of need that vision to,
to get there.

81
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,020
You sort of need that to
kind of see in the distance.

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,560
I think you appeal to a Utopian vision
of the future as you consolidate,

83
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,160
uh, democracy, uh, in,
in, in the case of, um,

84
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,180
in the case of Eastern Europe and as
you consolidate multiracial democracy in

85
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:15,550
the case of, uh, in the
case of South Africa,

86
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,470
but ultimately utopianism
is the great enemy of, uh,

87
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,470
of, of human progress. Uh,

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,200
because I think that human
progress needs to be,

89
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,290
needs to be measured in terms of the
past rather than some sort of a utopian

90
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:36,100
future. Human progress is an
incremental, uh, process, um,

91
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,870
where you are trying to decide,
okay, is today better than yesterday?

92
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,710
And if so, that is progress. Um,

93
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,220
problems are going to be with us forever.
The question is,

94
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,340
are we actually improving incrementally
in important areas of human wellbeing on

95
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,220
daily basis?
Is that one of the problems with how we

96
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,160
ingest news? Because I was
telling you before we started,

97
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:05,600
like I went on human progress this
morning and it feels good to me.

98
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,930
I mean the layout of the site is great
and you and the images and the colors and

99
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:09,141
all that,

100
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:14,141
but like seeing so many consistently
good things trending that you don't see

101
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,450
anywhere else. And we're going to,
we're going to get into many of them.

102
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,650
Is that just,

103
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,310
is it hard to get clicks because
people don't like the Oh,

104
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,940
things are a little better than yesterday
and a little and the long trends when

105
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:32,300
they just want the day to day
craziness and headlines and all that.

106
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,670
Yes.
Uh,

107
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,280
I wouldn't be the first one to
point to the nature of news.

108
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,000
Uh,

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the fact that news is about things that
happen as Steven pinker always likes to

110
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,110
say,
you know,

111
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:50,250
there is no journalist standing in the
middle of a city that is a piece saying,

112
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:54,390
you know,
I'm here in a Luanda the capital of um,

113
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,020
whatever it is on goal. I think. Um,

114
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,260
and there is no civil war. Uh, you know,

115
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:04,560
journalists go to places where terrible
things happen and their report on those

116
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:05,394
things.

117
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,350
And so that gives a secured image
of what is happening in the world.

118
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,900
If it bleeds, it leads. I mean, that is,

119
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,790
that is a well known phenomenon combined
with the nature of the social media.

120
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:22,080
Certainly I think that, um, uh,

121
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,710
Twitter and uh, and, and smartphones,

122
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,560
uh, make terrible things
immediate and intimate. So,

123
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,491
uh,
you know,

124
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:36,930
we were able to watch tsunami
in Japan in real time.

125
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,330
We saw the destruction and death of
thousands of people in real time,

126
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,570
whereas, you know, a couple
of decades, a few decades ago,

127
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,550
and certainly few centuries ago,

128
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,080
you would never have known that a terrible
thing has happened on the other side

129
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:55,800
of the world.

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,300
Does that complicate your work?

131
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,800
Do you think that that people get
information so quickly that then maybe are

132
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:05,520
making misjudgments because they're
not looking at the sort of long view of

133
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:05,820
history?

134
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,770
I'm not sure if it complicates things
because pessimism is part of human nature.

135
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,660
Um, it, uh, it also enables us to, to,

136
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,400
to respond, uh, to the
stories in a quicker time, uh,

137
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,620
to be able to say, uh, on
our website at least. Look,

138
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,250
it is true that there was
in this particular case, um,

139
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,340
so now me and people have died,

140
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,950
but look at the longterm
trends in terms of uh,

141
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,050
people dying and property being damaged
due to extreme weather events or natural

142
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:46,950
catastrophes. And the train
is, the trend is declining.

143
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,840
So we are also able to use the
social media to, to respond to it.

144
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,280
Um, the, the, the problem is the good
news doesn't get picked up. Yeah.

145
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,900
Uh,

146
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,900
as often as the bad news
because the bad news leads,

147
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,770
uh, the, the good news doesn't, yeah. And
there's just a psychological component.

148
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,390
There might be an evolutionary reason.

149
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:13,530
We focus on the bad things maybe for
survival or something to that effect. Yes.

150
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,540
John tooby and [inaudible]
from University of, uh,

151
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,950
is it southern California? It's
not about Barbara. Yeah. Um,

152
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,970
they are, uh, they are
the pioneers of, uh,

153
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,800
of evolutionary biology. Uh, they
believe that our brains have evolved,

154
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,370
um, in, uh, at a time in, you know,

155
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,580
tens of thousands of years ago when the
world was just a much more inhospitable

156
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:46,020
place than what it is today.
Um,

157
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,000
the world where there was
omnipresent danger from, uh,

158
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,770
other tribes from wild
animals, from poisonings, um,

159
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,080
and, um, um, at a time when
life expectancy was very low.

160
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,350
And,
uh,

161
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,490
they like to say that our modern
skulls house and shunned mines and we,

162
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:10,881
and,

163
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:15,881
and the kind of psychological responses
that we have evolved for tens of

164
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,000
thousands of years ago,
um,

165
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,200
are difficult to apply to modernity,

166
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:26,400
which is just so fundamentally different
than what it was until relatively

167
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:30,280
recently. The, the, the key
period here in time histories,

168
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,300
the last 200 to 250 years when the
world really has changed beyond all

169
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:40,360
recognition. Yeah. So in a weird way,
are we almost, we as humans are real,

170
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:44,610
most victims of our own success. I mean,
that's sort of what it sounds like.

171
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,310
Like we've,
we've done so much good.

172
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,340
We have advanced so far that now were
we mitt picco about little things

173
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:56,070
constantly and think they're massive when,
yeah,

174
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,790
we're not dying of mass. We're,
we're doing a lot with disease,

175
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,770
which we're going to get two and,
and a whole bunch of other things.

176
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,850
We've made our lives way
safer and extended our lives
and all of these things.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,840
So we're almost a victim of
all of that. Goodness. Yes.

178
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:13,740
So from an evolutionary perspective,
again, the research of others,

179
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:18,741
not my own overreaction to a
potentially bad thing happening head,

180
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,750
a lower cost to the organism,
in this case,

181
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:28,650
a human being than under reaction.
Um,

182
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,600
if you overreacted, uh, so something
that may have been potentially harmful,

183
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,300
you all reacted to it,
but, but you survived.

184
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,940
Whereas if you underreact it to something
that was potentially harmful, then,

185
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,300
uh, your gene pool ended
right there and then, yeah.

186
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:49,500
So those genes that can get passed
on. So, yeah. So, so yes. Um,

187
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,070
um, the complexity of
the modern economy, um,

188
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,030
the complexity of the social interactions,
um,

189
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,950
global trading system for
example, is, uh, certainly, um,

190
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:08,050
uh, much greater than what
our ancestors were exposed to.

191
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,420
And so it is,
um,

192
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
perhaps not surprising that
a lot of people are, um, uh,

193
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:18,340
there'll be a little bit uneasy or
continue to be uneasy. Then again,

194
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,430
the website is there to show
people precisely how bad
things were before and how

195
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,870
good things are now. So don't
get depressed, um, too much.

196
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,720
Um, there is a good story to
be told about humanity. Yeah,

197
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,600
it's interesting when
I go speak at colleges,

198
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:39,000
one of the lines that I think does
actually work with young people who are,

199
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:39,221
you know,

200
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,580
if they're protesting and
they're screaming about
the patriarchy and evils of

201
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:46,030
capitalism and all of this stuff,
I'll always say to them, you know,

202
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,260
does anyone in this room not have
it better than their grandparents?

203
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,920
And certainly in the United States,
but if you live in the western world,

204
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,330
basically everybody does pretty much.
I have yet to find someone that doesn't.

205
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,600
And I always think that's really
effective way of getting people who,

206
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,030
who are so focused on the negative to go,
oh, something good must have happened.

207
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:11,440
Because, you know, even though I like
to, to scream about my victimhood, it,

208
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,050
it's a lot better than what my
grandparents had. Yes. I mean take, uh,

209
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,080
something like, uh, like a,

210
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,090
a women's equality or gay quality or
even caring about the environment and uh,

211
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,940
and um, uh, and animal rights or
any more welfare, I should say.

212
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,980
Um, Jonathan Heit from, uh, um,

213
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,180
New York University says that capitalism
actually fundamentally transforms,

214
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,130
uh, our, uh, sense of values. Um,

215
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,070
um,
because or priorities I should maybe say,

216
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,980
because when we are extremely poor,
uh,

217
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,020
which is to say the first
99.9% of Homo sapiens on earth,

218
00:13:56,531 --> 00:14:00,190
right. Um, uh, the, the,

219
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,570
the primary objective of any individual
human being was, was to survive.

220
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,730
Uh, you had to somehow get hold of enough
calories to make it to the next day.

221
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,150
You had to somehow avoid being murdered
by somebody who wanted your stuff.

222
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,940
Yeah. Um, uh, you had to
somehow protect your family.

223
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,660
You had to keep away from
cold, from heat, et cetera.

224
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,930
But in the last 200 years or so,
our incomes have skyrocketed. Uh,

225
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,780
the world is roughly speaking,
adjusted for inflation.

226
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:35,830
I can't say this often enough because
we'll always have that are not adjusting

227
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:39,310
for that course. We are adjusting
for inflation adjusted for inflation.

228
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,730
The World Everage is roughly 12
times better off than what it was in,

229
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:50,350
uh, in 1820. Hmm. So we
have become much richer.

230
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,710
And when you no longer have to
worry about things like survival,

231
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,270
you start caring about
things, uh, like, um,

232
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,420
the nature of the society
that you live in. Uh,

233
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:07,370
the fairness of treatment of
your fellow human beings. Uh,

234
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,780
you start caring about women equality,
as I said,

235
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,340
you'll start caring about gay rights.

236
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:18,080
You start caring about animal protection
and environmental protection. So,

237
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:22,040
um, uh, so in that sense, um, the, the,

238
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,100
the tremendous increase in incomes and,

239
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:30,101
and general wealth of the society has
also contributed to creating and much

240
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,600
fairer and much more egalitarian society.
So capitalism isn't all evil.

241
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,890
Is that what you're telling me?

242
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,550
People who think capitalism is evil?
I,

243
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:46,170
I highly recommend that they visit Cuba.
They visit Venezuela there,

244
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,900
visit North Korea in countries which have,

245
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,060
which have taken deliberately a
step in the opposite direction. Um,

246
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,280
capitalism has its problems.
Uh,

247
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,310
liberal democracy has its problems
and it is our task to try to fix these

248
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:03,260
problems on the margins.
Uh,

249
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,290
but to throw out the economic and
social underpinnings of modernity,

250
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,750
of this, of this extraordinary
age of abundance, uh,

251
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,740
would be a mistake.

252
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,870
Are you shocked at the amount of people
in the West that seemingly want to do

253
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:25,850
just that? Um, uh, no. Uh,

254
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,684
I'm much,

255
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,370
I'm not in a shocked by the fact that
in eastern Europe where I'm from,

256
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,953
um,

257
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,380
people who are in their early teens and
into the later teens p people who have

258
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,470
never experienced communism,

259
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,480
people who are born after the fall
of the Berlin Wall are now embracing

260
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,730
socialist ideas.

261
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:53,390
Or at least those socialist ideas are
now increasingly popular amongst young

262
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:56,750
people. Which day, which is certainly
are and amongst people of my generation.

263
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,070
What do you chalk that up to you?

264
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,210
Cause I don't think it's just that they
didn't experience it as it is. It, is it,

265
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,150
is it just that Utopian dream that we
all have or is it just that it all sounds

266
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:09,320
good? The endless cry of equality, which
of course never turns out to be equality.

267
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,340
It all is just,

268
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:15,341
if you don't want to really deeply think
about a system or then communism or

269
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,730
socialism is, is pretty good. Well,
mountain freedom, I like to say that, uh,

270
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,480
that every generation needs to be
educated in the benefits of freedom.

271
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,920
And I think that even filing fighters,
we're talking about something about, uh,

272
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,090
you know, we are always one
generation away from, from tyranny.

273
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,370
Now what that meant was to say that

274
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,100
there is something perhaps
in human nature, um,

275
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,930
that drags us back into that,
um,

276
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,140
into that tribal socialistic mindset.
Now,

277
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:50,760
there are a lot of different
theories about that.

278
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,780
One possible theory is that
actually as we grow up,

279
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,260
we grow up in a,
uh,

280
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,630
in the only functioning communist,

281
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,850
a communist society or communist
institution, which is the family.

282
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,190
Hmm. Um, in a family, uh,
especially in nuclear family, uh,

283
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,140
people share wildly. Um,
children are not expected to,

284
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,760
uh, earn their breakfast, uh, by, uh,

285
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,730
um, uh, I dunno, bringing home
the Bacon or whatever are,

286
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,690
you know, things get chair very, very
equally and so forth. And that can work.

287
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,410
Um, on a, on a sort of
nuclear family level,

288
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,480
the further you go, the
less it works. I mean,

289
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,540
what you are prepared to do for your
children is not the same what you are

290
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,950
prepared to do for your cousins.

291
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,620
It's not the same what you are
prepared to do for your second cousins,

292
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,870
for your fellow citizens
and for that matter,

293
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:53,650
for people on the opposite side
of the world. And so, uh, the,

294
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,930
the fact that we are able
to conduct our affairs,

295
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,070
um, uh, on, on a, uh, along these,

296
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,020
along these socialist lines,
uh, in, in nuclear family, um,

297
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,260
doesn't then translate into,
into the society as a whole.

298
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:15,030
So they may be one reason. Another
reason may be that, that, um,

299
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,890
um, there is some within human
beings within human psychology,

300
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,220
a tendency to want to bring down
people who have gotten too far up.

301
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,820
If you're thinking about
tribal society, uh, or,

302
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,790
or these roaming groups of
hunter gatherers of say,

303
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:37,200
between 50 and hundred and 50
people, um, where everybody,

304
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,323
uh,

305
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,150
you didn't want all the women and all
the foods to be monopolized by the one

306
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:50,300
alpha male. So the, usually there
was some sort of a combination of,

307
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,510
of an alliance made by other males
to bring this up on the hill down.

308
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,180
So there would be a greater sharing.
And,

309
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,700
and that was good for the
Alpha male too, right? I mean,

310
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:04,000
he wanted to survive himself
and if he survived, it is
right. I mean, I mean in, in,

311
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,940
uh, amongst the chimps and so
forth, uh, the, the Alpha male,

312
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,450
that's usually and very poorly.
Um,

313
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,340
so that may be another reason, uh,
and other reasons maybe that, uh,

314
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,700
in the Hunter Gathering Society,
uh,

315
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,030
some of the food would be
shared equally. Uh, there was,

316
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,500
for example, if you killed an animal,
uh, there was no refrigeration.

317
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:33,280
You couldn't store it. There wasn't no
accumulation of wealth in that sense. Uh,

318
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,050
and so things did get shared amongst
the members of the group. Uh,

319
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,080
plus there wasn't an accumulation
of wealth because, um,

320
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,330
because you are constantly moving,

321
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:46,980
so whatever your acquired was limited to
whatever you are able to carry on the,

322
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,980
on your back. Yeah. Um, so yes,

323
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,790
the differences between people,
um,

324
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,110
at least to the extent that we are
experiencing now is something that is

325
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:03,790
probably quite new from an evolutionary
standpoint. So all of these reasons, um,

326
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,260
ensure that, um, and,

327
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:11,270
and many more ensure that young people
or rather every generation needs to be

328
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,140
explicitly educated in why the
economy that we have today,

329
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,430
which is so different from
what our ancestors have
experienced is actually good

330
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:25,390
for us. Free trade is a
very good example. Um, uh,

331
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,080
free trade contributes to their
kind of growth and yet, uh, um,

332
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,560
every generation you have a new
push for protectionism. Again,

333
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,650
the complexity of the economy has outpaced
our ability to understand it without

334
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,000
explicit learning. Yeah. All right.

335
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:44,410
So let's talk about a whole bunch of
these trends that are happening right in

336
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:46,210
front of our eyes,
but as you said,

337
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:50,080
they're happening incrementally so people
don't necessarily focus on them enough.

338
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,540
Uh, well I'll let you kick off
the first one. What do you,

339
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,590
what do you think is the most encouraging
worldwide trend at the moment,

340
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,730
or what's exciting you the most?

341
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,390
So the human progress is
unabashedly unabashedly about, uh,

342
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:05,810
it's a huge human centric,
uh,

343
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,450
which is to say that we consider the
welfare and the flourishing of a human

344
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:14,110
being, all human beings, uh, to be, uh,

345
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,730
to be a really important of
primary importance. Yeah,

346
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,470
that's an interesting distinction because
you didn't call it earth progress or a

347
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,011
great,
I mean,

348
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:24,700
the idea was that this is so that
humans can figure out the best place,

349
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,630
the best way to live here, and
hopefully that's good for the earth too.

350
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:33,080
But that humans actually our number one
here, yes, we can certainly talk, um,

351
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,130
late into show about is it possible for
humans to coexist with the earth and the

352
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:44,791
animals and what can we do to make
sure that that actually happens?

353
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,720
But human progress is a
humanistic project and, um,

354
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,123
uh,

355
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,630
clearly there is no more fundamental
aspect of human flourishing than staying

356
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,220
alive. And, uh, here, uh,

357
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,160
we have seen tremendous improvement.
Um,

358
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,720
prior to 18 hundreds,
uh,

359
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,880
life expectancy around the world was
anywhere between 25 and 30 years.

360
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:15,010
Since time in memorial,
uh, as late as 1950, sorry,

361
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:18,970
as late as 1900 in the richest
countries of the world,

362
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,470
life expectancy was only 50 years.
Today,

363
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,960
globally it's 70 years in do
United States is 78 years.

364
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,290
And in places like Japan,
it's 88 years. So wait, let's,

365
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:36,100
let's not gloss over that because those
were some powerful numbers. So in 1900,

366
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:38,890
the average life expectancy was 50 years.

367
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,030
So being in rich countries in rich
countries and rich guide reason,

368
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,020
that's even more impressive, so to
speak, how we've advanced it. So you're,

369
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,270
you're saying basically in the
hundred 20 years since then,

370
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:54,400
or so we've extended it by
20 years of being slain by,

371
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,090
so two years in, in the west, in which
countries, and by bots and, and, and,

372
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,181
and every,

373
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:05,181
each person today say somebody living
in Malaysia lives 20 years longer than

374
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:09,860
rich people did in 1900.
Yeah, that's incredible.

375
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:13,160
So in 120 years in,
in rich western countries,

376
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:17,030
we extended life 30 years in 120
days. I mean, that's, that's,

377
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,110
that's almost unfathomable actually.
Uh, it's, it's, it's wonderful.

378
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,520
So that's the first thing is that
people want to stay alive, um,

379
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,990
because they, they, they enjoy it. Yeah.

380
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,570
Can you give me some of the markers
of how we actually did that? Well, uh,

381
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,430
one thing is decline in violence,

382
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:38,330
which against Steven pinker
has written a whole book about,

383
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,080
um, um, uh, you know, um,

384
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,820
rates of people dying in wars.
I have,

385
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,490
have declined certainly since the
end of the Second World War. Um,

386
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,200
today for the first time in human history,
uh,

387
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:57,270
there is no hot conflict between two
states that have declared war on each

388
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:01,040
other.

389
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,450
So we still have a frozen conflict
between North Korea and the United States.

390
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,700
Uh, we have, uh, we have the Russian
invasion of the eastern Ukraine,

391
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,920
but even then, Russia and Ukraine
are not officially at war.

392
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,130
So there's this old concept
of two countries, you know,

393
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,700
declaring war on each other and then
going towards this actually has actually,

394
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,280
well at this stage it has disappeared.
Um,

395
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:31,610
would almost be unfathomable these days
were two warring countries with full on

396
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:34,430
wars were invading each other
in the traditional sense.

397
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:37,460
It would almost be hard to imagine what
that would look like now that that is

398
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:41,500
very awkward cause that, yeah. Um,
hopefully it stays that way. Um,

399
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,330
one thing to remember about,
about,

400
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,750
about human progress is that there is
nothing predetermined determined about it.

401
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,670
It is not linear. There are obviously
things which can go terribly wrong.

402
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,680
Uh,
the 20th century,

403
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:59,030
you have the first world war and possibly
the most unnecessary major conflict,

404
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:04,300
uh, in, in recent centuries,
uh, followed by, uh,

405
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,340
the Second World War and the Holocaust,
the Gulag and what have you.

406
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,790
But the remarkable thing about human
progress and humanity as a whole,

407
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:17,030
it's, is that at this quite robust,
at the end of the 20th century,

408
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:20,630
life expectancy are still longer than
what it was at the beginning of the 20th

409
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:22,850
century.
You are still consuming more calories,

410
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:25,070
more people went to school
and so on and so forth.

411
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,090
In spite of the 20th century of being
actually quite violent anyhow, since the,

412
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:30,620
since the end of the Second World War,

413
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,010
a world has gotten
progressively more peaceful.

414
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,040
Then of course you have
medical breakthroughs. Um,

415
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,920
let's pause on the violence part for
just a sec because I think it's one of

416
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:43,830
those things where you can say that to
people and you can talk all about the

417
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:46,480
wars that don't exist anymore
and that there aren't, you know,

418
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,340
genocides the way they were in, on
all of those things. It does though,

419
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,200
admitting that some bad
things are still happening.

420
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,160
I think people just don't buy it.
They,

421
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,620
they see school shootings or they see,
you know,

422
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:01,890
a riot here or something happening
all over the place and they just

423
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,530
automatically believe
things are getting worse.

424
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,460
That sort of gets us to where we started
about how technology is a part of this.

425
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,290
But how difficult is that for you just
to get the truth across to people and

426
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:17,040
have them actually accepted while at the
same time they are looking at, you know,

427
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:20,600
a shooting or this or that that they
can just quickly see online. Yeah,

428
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,020
you've got to look at the longterm trends
and try to figure out whether things

429
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:29,160
in fact are getting worse
or whether this is a blip.

430
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,390
Um, you know, the line of
progress, again, it's not linear.

431
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:37,890
It has Jagat and um,
and there is no, uh, uh,

432
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,350
once again, there's no
guarantee that, uh, that,

433
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,260
that things will continue to improve.
So you have to look at a longterm trends.

434
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:51,261
I think the Atlantic around his story a
few months ago after the latest a school

435
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:51,751
shooting,

436
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:56,430
showing that actually the number of
kids dying at schools horrible as it is.

437
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,330
Yeah. Um, have been, uh,
on a decline. Um, so yeah,

438
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:03,900
so longterm trends,
um,

439
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,160
and then having journalists to actually
reported those long term trends that,

440
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,240
that that would be key. So,
so violence is one thing.

441
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,740
It will live in less violent times.

442
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:17,340
The second thing is that the medical
breakthroughs were absolutely fundamental.

443
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,170
Uh, and here I would point to simply
to two things. One was vaccination. Um,

444
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,430
a guy called Jenner in a Mitt,
I believe,

445
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:28,350
mid 18th century England.

446
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,740
Notice that milkmaids didn't get,
uh,

447
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:37,200
didn't get smallpox. Smallpox was
absolutely horrifying disease. I mean,

448
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:40,440
your body would be covered with these,
um,

449
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,240
with these youth hostels and,
and you know,

450
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:50,120
80% of kids who got it dyed a up to
60% of adults who've got it, who died,

451
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,150
you know, died. Uh, in, in
the 18th century, France,

452
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:59,151
it was estimated 95% of the population
got smallpox at one point of their lives

453
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:04,950
or another, and gender. Notice
that milkmaids didn't get smallpox.

454
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,400
That's because they got a milder
version of the POCs from cars.

455
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,320
And so he started inoculating
people with the POCs from the cow.

456
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,060
And because the Latin
word for cow is a vodka,

457
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:25,020
our word vaccination come some from that.
And that was a major improvement.

458
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,310
The other thing that happened
was, um, uh, was said,

459
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:33,570
humanity discovered the
germ theory of disease.

460
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,123
Um,

461
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,840
we didn't know that disease
will spread via germs.

462
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,230
People had all of weird ideas about
humors in the body and me as somatic

463
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,110
theories and what have you.
And it was all nonsense. Uh,

464
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:55,230
but the upshot of us being so ignorant
about how disease spreads or is that

465
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,120
people, for example, if
didn't wash their hands.

466
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,390
And you can imagine,

467
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:06,830
right farmer is using human excrement in
order to fertilize his fields and comes

468
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,270
home and sits down to dinner.

469
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,190
Or You can imagine what sort
of diseases literally now, um,

470
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,350
Jews funny enough who washed their hands,
uh,

471
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,650
as part of their religious
rituals at penny to fall, uh,

472
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,270
less sick and die at a lower
rate than the rest of the,

473
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,700
of the European population.
But once again,

474
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:33,130
because people are so ignorant
about how diseases spread,

475
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,510
they assumed it wasn't magic,

476
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,820
which again led to a pogroms and
discrimination against the Jews. But,

477
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,500
um, even doctors, uh, didn't, um,

478
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,230
doctors also didn't change their clothes,
uh,

479
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,190
because the more blood and Gore
you head on your clothes, uh,

480
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:55,690
the more it signified to the potential
patient that you are a doctor in great

481
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:58,210
demand. Right? So, so,

482
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,000
so doctorates we're actually a massive,

483
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:05,470
a reason or on one of the major
reasons why disease spread.

484
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,000
They went from their second
corpses to delivering babies,

485
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,470
introducing pathogen into,
into, into the body of a, uh,

486
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,110
of a mother and a,

487
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,440
and all that stopped basically after a
discovery of the germ theory of disease.

488
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,190
Uh, and, and, uh, uh, child mortality,

489
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:30,940
maternal mortality started to decline in
life expectancy to shut up as a result.

490
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,110
Yeah. What else is going on with
the diseases of today that we're,

491
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:38,800
we're getting close to eradicating some
things that still exist, right? Well,

492
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:41,490
we are very close to eradicating polio.
Uh,

493
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,880
there are some what's called wild
cases of polio in, uh, in, uh,

494
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,780
places like the Congo. Um, uh,

495
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:53,110
of course we have, we have, uh,

496
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,700
made HIV aids, uh, or
rather we have, we have, uh,

497
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,790
created drugs of that no longer
make HIV AIDS death sentence.

498
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,790
Um, which, you know,

499
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,250
considering it only took a from 1981 when
we first started talking about each of

500
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:14,590
the age to about 1994,
1995,

501
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:18,270
when the first antiretroviral
drugs came along, uh,

502
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,360
only 14 or 15 years. Uh, that sort
of markable accomplishment. I mean,

503
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:27,070
people have lived with small bugs for
Millennia. Um, so we have, we have,

504
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,210
we were able to do that.

505
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,860
Now the other thing which is quite
extraordinary is that cancer rates are

506
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:36,430
declining. Now. The reason why
that's so interesting is that

507
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,430
incidentally of cancer increases with age.

508
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,910
So as people grow older and on average
we continue to to increase our life

509
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:50,750
expectancy, the chances of you contracting
or developing cancer, not contracting,

510
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:55,040
but developing cancer get much higher.
Cancer is basically just um,

511
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,710
cells dividing, uh, during
a normal process, um,

512
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,640
of, of human body, um, uh, existing.

513
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,990
Uh, but uh, the more
subdivision of cells you get,

514
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:12,560
the more likely it is that one of
them is going to go crazy and start

515
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,160
subdividing without control and
cause cancer and you're going to die.

516
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,110
And the fact that cancer rates for men
and women are declining certainly in rich

517
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:23,780
countries, even though life
expectancy is shooting up,

518
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:25,790
that's again an extraordinary,

519
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,280
an extraordinary achievement because of
early detection, because of better drugs.

520
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,260
Now with Crispr cas nine,
the um, the gene editing, uh,

521
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:41,270
system, uh, we are probably going to be
able to focus on personalized medicines.

522
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:46,271
So we are going to be able to create
drugs specifically for one individual or

523
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,320
group of individuals who share. Um, can,

524
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:54,160
can you explain CRISPR a little bit
just for those that are, you know,

525
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:55,640
you don't have to give
you a major recreation,

526
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:57,560
but like the sort of the most
simple explanation of it.

527
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:00,650
I was reading something on the site today.
Backwards bird. Yeah. Well it's, it's,

528
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:04,960
it's a gene editing technique,
uh, which is to say that, uh,

529
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,060
hypothetically, and hopefully we're
not very far from, from that. Uh,

530
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,290
from that time you'll be able
to splice out of the genome, uh,

531
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,330
to cut out from the genome,
uh,

532
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:21,430
genes which are responsible
for a congenital diseases.

533
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,880
Uh, which would be a, which
would be a very nice, uh,

534
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:29,870
it would be very nice to know
that if a child gets born,

535
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,960
it will develop multiple sclerosis,
uh, 20 years down the line and die in,

536
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,930
in terrible pain.

537
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,800
So these are the sorts of things that
we could do it with CRISPR. Yeah. Uh,

538
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:41,000
I want to move on to the environment,

539
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:44,160
but is there anything else on
the mathematical side? I mean,

540
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,710
education is the obvious
example. Uh, obviously, uh,

541
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,360
80% of the world is literate,

542
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,380
whereas most of the time
people were not literate on,

543
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,010
there's now a gender parity
between boys and girls,

544
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,370
pretty much on average in
the world. Uh, again, uh,

545
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:08,000
something to be happy about because
historically our girls were kept from

546
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:12,560
education at a higher rated than boys.
I mean, even in Afghanistan and now,

547
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,330
uh, girls are allowed to
go to school, which again,

548
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:19,580
is a wonderful thing.
And nutrition, I would,

549
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:24,110
I would really like to end with
nutrition, which is to say that, um,

550
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,290
famine has disappeared from the world,
uh,

551
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,420
outside of war zones.

552
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:34,421
We all remember those images of starving
children with inflated Belize in

553
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,830
Ethiopia in the early 1980s.
Yeah. And, um, uh, that's,

554
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:45,570
that's pretty much uh,
disappeared. And, um, um,

555
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,553
uh,

556
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:51,630
hunger was basically a normal human
condition throughout our history.

557
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:53,940
And, uh, today, um,

558
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,950
and average African consumes
as many calories as the
Portuguese did in the early

559
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:02,280
1960s.
Just about everywhere in the world,

560
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,250
people are consuming more calories than,
uh,

561
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,660
than what the USDA recommends,
should be the average intake.

562
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,910
And in, in Africa, they are
certainly reaching that threshold.

563
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:18,930
And Africa is important because
that's really where absolute poverty,

564
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,200
um, continues to be a major problem. Um,

565
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,210
I think it's fair to say that
absolute poverty is, uh, going to,

566
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,250
is ending as a global problem. It
is now going to remain as a, as a,

567
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,640
as a, uh, as an African problem. Um,

568
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,530
that is concentrated in a couple
of African country in, in,

569
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,360
in a few African countries,
including places like the Congo.
