00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.850
&gt;&gt; And gentlemen, please
welcome the Librarian

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.510
of Congress, Dr. James
H. Billington.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:28.940
[ Applause ]

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.240
&gt;&gt; James Billington:
Thank you very much.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:40.710
We are honored this evening on the
occasion of the first presentation

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.570
of the Kluge Prize for lifetime
achievement in the human sciences

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.250
to have a number of
distinguished guests.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.540
I'd like to first of all recognize
and thank Her Royal Highness,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.670 position:56%
Victoria, the Crown Princess of
Sweden is with us for this occasion.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.810
Ambassador Jan Eliasson, Mrs.
Kerstin Eliasson of Sweden.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.630 position:56%
They represent the country in which
the Nobel awards are being conferred

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.170
in this very season
and their guidance

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.990
and help has been instrumental
in perfecting, we hope,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.220
this procedures for this prize.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.280
I'd also like to mention and thank
Mr. Bronislaw Geremek the charge

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.440
d'affaires of the Polish
Embassy for being with us tonight

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.520
and I would also pay special thanks
and our gratitude to John Kluge

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.420
who is the benefactor of not
only this but of a wide variety

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.810
of fellowships to bring
scholarship into this city who has,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.160
with his characteristic modesty,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.960
asked not to be specially
recognized,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.510
but his name has to mentioned.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:04.700
[ Applause ]

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
And I want to pay special
thanks this evening

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.330
to the congress of
the United States.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.060
We are, the Library of Congress,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.200
founded at the very time the
congress decided to relocate

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.790
in the new capitol
here in Washington.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.900
We have with us tonight
a variety of congressmen

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.240
who are either coming
or about to come.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.380
Senators Ted Stevens, Christopher
Dodd, Representatives Vern Ehlers,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.390
Rush Holt, Jack Kingston, Dale
Kildee, John Larson, Jim Leach,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.590
John Mica, Jim Moran,
David Price, Ralph Regula,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.630
Rodney Frelinghuysen,
and Edmond Markey.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.040
The congress has created
and faithfully nurtured

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.950
within its own branch this enormous
knowledge and information asset

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.290
for the intelligent governance of
the United States and it has chosen

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.240
in its wisdom to allow free public
access to our ever-growing body--

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.670
to-- of an ever-growing
body of knowledge

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.530
to an ever-growing audience here
and virtually through the internet

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.370
to keep democracy dynamic.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.800
And especially thank the joint
committee on the library,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.440
which is the oldest joint
committee of the congress,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.340
which is led by its
chairman, Senator Ted Stevens,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.170
the President Pro Tem of the
Senate of the United States

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.540
and a distinguished
senator from Alaska.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.240
As vice chairman, Representative
Vern Ehlers of Michigan.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.820
This committee has been of
great importance historically

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.960
to the library and it's
an honor to have members

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.520
of the committee with us tonight.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.030
Also from our appropriations
committees that make it possible

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.340
for this institution to function.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.640
And it is my great pleasure and
distinct honor now to introduce

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.100 position:56%
to you one of the really truly
great supporters of this institution

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.090
and its long 203-year history,
the distinguished chairman

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.850
of the senate appropriations
committee,

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.200
the chairman of the joint committee
on the library, a great friend

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.140
of learning, and the
President Pro Tem of the Senate

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.510
of the United States, the Honorable
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:28.730
[ Applause ]

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.800
&gt;&gt; Ted Stevens: Good evening,
friends of the Library of Congress.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.620
I'm very pleased to be
here tonight on behalf

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.360
of the United States
Congress for the awarding

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.460
of the first John W. Kluge
prize for lifetime achievement

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.660
in the humanities and
social sciences.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.930
And I'm-- of course, I've
already given my congratulations

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.860
to Professor Kolakowski
for his high honor.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.860
As chairman of the congress's
joint committee on the library,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.860
it was my privilege to
participate in the capitol ceremony

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.320
when John Kluge presented the
Library of Congress an endowment

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.510
of $60 million to establish
the Kluge Center.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:15.750
[ Applause ]

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.360
This award is the capstone
of the Kluge Center's mission

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.170 position:56%
to bring the world's leading
thinkers to our Library of Congress.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.580
To use its rich resources
to stimulate scholarship

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.200
and interaction with
policymakers in Washington,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.190
thus bridging the scholarly
and policymaking worlds.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.710
I join all of you once more
in thanking our great friend,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.410
John Kluge, for his generous
philanthropy to this library.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.340
Our Librarian of Congress,
Jim Billington,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.250
also deserves our eternal gratitude
for his visionary leadership

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.590
of this great institution.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.510
It's nice to be with you.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:04.500
[ Applause ]

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.620
&gt;&gt; James Billington: Thank you
very much, Senator Stevens.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.950 position:56%
We meet tonight in an institution
that arose from the personal library

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.400 position:56%
of the great humanist Thomas
Jefferson in a building that's named

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.730
for him and has been gloriously
restored by the congress

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.730 position:56%
of the United States, which created
this institution in the first place.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.320
And we are celebrating in
this ceremony the highest form

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.290
of Jefferson's pursuit of
happiness, the pursuit of truth.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.370
This is the essence of
what happens in big ways

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.500
and small in any library.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.890
The pursuit of truth, after all,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.510
helps keep us from the
pursuit of each other.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.010
[ Laughter ]

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.520
This pursuit has been the
life's work of the first scholar

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.940
to be awarded this
unique international prize

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.160
in the study of humanity.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.430
And, you know, it's rather
appropriate in the way

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.670
that it should be someone from
Poland since people like Brzezinski

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.280
and Kosciuszko were part of the
founding fathers, fought in our war

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.420
of independence, and
helped bring this country

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.760
into being in the first place.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.800
Kluge prize is designed with a high
level of scholarly accomplishment--

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.400
and with the high level of
compensation I might add

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.530
of the Nobel awards--
and it fills in a gap

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.890
between the national sciences that
are so well honored on the one hand

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.680
of the Nobel prizes and
peace and literature,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.530
which are recognized in the others.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.140
It is for this lifetime of
achievement in the scholarship

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.590
of the human condition that
this award is being made

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.190
and it's appropriate, I think,
to make it in America's capital

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.490
since so much scholarly work

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.660
in these fields has been
done in this country.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.170
First and foremost, the criterion
we established was achievement

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.450
of high distinction in
a chosen academic field

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.410
as attested to by one's peers.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.180
Additional considerations
were whether--

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.020
are whether or not his

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.330
or her scholarly work has
also [inaudible] disciplines

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.690
in a significant way and, in
some sense, the broader public

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.770
of the humanity, which
is the subject of this.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.850
By all three of these, Leszek
Kolakowski emerges as a giant

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.130
of the second half
of the 20th century.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.830
In a wide variety of
languages and formats,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.510
he has focused his life
on asking big questions.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.760
He is a gifted and accessible
philosopher, a theoretician

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.270
of European culture, a historian
of religion, and an essayist

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.620
of enormous sweep, all filled
with the gentle irony and humor

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.700
that great humanists
often are able to display.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:50.110
And last, but by no means least,
he was a major contributor to

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:55.750
and an intellectual inspiration for
the solidarity movement in Poland,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.090
which played such a decisive
role in the peaceful, nonviolent,

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.950
and deeply democratic emergence
of Eastern Central Europe

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.210
from the totalitarian system
that had been imposed on it

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.470
and was long thought by many to
be a permanent system of rule.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:17.120 position:56%
The modern world has given birth to
something we call an intelligentsia.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.450
People of learning whose lives are
somehow set apart from the ordinary

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.560
and are centered on cultivating
ideas for higher moral purposes.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.290
The word intelligentsia
arouses some suspicion

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.900
in the English-speaking world
because it suggests people cut off

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.820
from everyday life likely
to promote utopian ideas

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.790
that could have disastrous
practical consequences.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.310
But the word intelligentsia
was, in fact, invented by Poles

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.310
in the early 19th century after
they had lost their freedom.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.740
And the better anti-utopian version

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.610 position:56%
of an intelligentsia played decisive
role in helping bring freedom back

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.370
to Poland in the late 20th century.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.230 position:56%
Arnold Toynbee and his mighty
12-volume study of history suggested

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.700
that large-scale systems of
government continue to prevail

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.350
until they meet challenges
to which they cannot

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.130
by their very nature find
an adequate response.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.810
The solidarity movement in Poland
was that type of challenge.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.040
It was a mass-based
religiously-grounded bottom-up

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.110
nonviolent challenge to a
top-down anti-democratic elite

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.070
with an atheistic etiology and
an authority based on fear.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:33.260
It had no way of adequately
meeting the challenge posed.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.560
The word intelligentsia

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.640
in its original Polish
usage was simply taken

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.940 position:56%
from the Latin word for intelligent.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.960
And Leszek Kolakowski embodies that
quality and he spoke more clearly

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.830
and more influentially
to the intelligence

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.570
of the rising better-educated
generation in Poland

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.320
than any other single figure.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.710
He was the voice of hope
that helped free people

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.450
from the paralysis of fear.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.980
The chain of events that
down the communist system

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.490
in Eastern Europe began in Poland
with a movement inspired both

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:12.920
by religious faith, of which
Kolakowski has made studies as deep

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.690 position:56%
as any European scholar of his time,

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.430
and also by straightforward human
enlightened intelligence applied

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.000
to inhuman social realities,
which Kolakowski performed

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.030
with elegance and significance.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:33.450
In the words of the-- one of
the great leaders of solidarity,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.140
Bronislaw Geremek, who later
became foreign minister of Poland--

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.860
and I'm quoting this, which is,
I think, the right introduction.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.770
We have, incidentally, a formal
citation, which I'm not going

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.550
to read, but I think these
words speak eloquently.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.110 position:56%
He said Leszek Kolakowski's work had
an influence on the course of events

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.840
that is difficult to overestimate.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.500
His work achieved that fulfillment
which is the eternal dream

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.690
of philosophers and the
ambition of intellectuals.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.470
To influence the fate of the world
and further people's aspirations

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.410
of freedom, it accompanied
resistance to repression

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.140
and dictatorship in Eastern and
Central Europe at every stage.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.490
This skeptical student
of enlightenment,

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.790
this scholar of the
highest intellectual rigor,

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.610
this opponent of all
illusions played

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.210
that most romantic and
promethean of roles.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.430
He was the awakener of human hopes.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.380
Kolakowski was asked in
an interview recently what

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.490
of his many achievements
he was most proud of.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.020
And he said, with his
characteristic modesty,

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.130
simplicity of great
philosophers, I'm not proud.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.900 position:56%
If there is any doubt that the study
of humanity can help do great things

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.960
for humanity without
violence and with out--

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.010
from one dogmatism to another,
he stands before us tonight.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:06.860 position:56%
The man who is not proud, but of
whom we at the Library of Congress--

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.180
and I think all of us here--
are very proud and grateful--

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.940
have every reason to be,
since we are hailing him

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.430
as the first recipient of this
prize in the human sciences

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.520
for a lifetime of rare achievement.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.770
We are going to bring out-- in
just a moment, we will present him

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.370
with a medal and then
we will be seated

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:35.810 position:56%
and we will have the world's
premiere of a special salute written

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:41.870 position:56%
for him by one of the current
senior scholars at the Kluge Center,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.730
the holder of the Papamarkou in
education here at the library,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.900
Miss Libby Larsen, a great
composer from Minnesota,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.190
and this will be the
first time you--

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.240
anyone in the world will
have heard this fanfare

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.320
that she has written specially
for this occasion and for this man

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.270
and it's my pleasure to bring
him out now and to present him

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.130
with the first John W. Kluge prize

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.130
for lifetime achievement
in the human sciences.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.510
Ladies and gentlemen,
Leszek Kolakowski.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:48.590
[ Applause ]

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.480
You sit down, now.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.130
We speak-- we sit and listen to the
fanfare first, before you speak.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.710
&gt;&gt; Leszek Kolakowski: Oh, I see.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.710
[ Laughter ]

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.330
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, the
Library of Congress is pleased

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.020 position:56%
to present the world premiere
performance of Fanfare for Humanity,

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.060
an original composition by
Libby Larsen commissioned

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.900
for the Kluge prize.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.500
Dr. Larsen is the current occupant
of the Harissios Papamarkou chair

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.070
in education at the
John W. Kluge Center.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.510 position:56%
Please now welcome Dr. Libby Larsen.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:16:00.510
[ Applause ]

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:51.510

00:16:51.510 --> 00:17:05.500

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:24.510
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Leszek Kolakowski.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:37.190
[ Applause ]

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.720
&gt;&gt; Leszek Kolakowski:
The Library of Congress.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.990
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:50.370
I couldn't have heard properly
everything what James Billington

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.790
said because I was
put in a dark cellar,

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:01.150
but I presume that what he
said was friendly to me.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:10.320
Now, what is really
extremely difficult

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.630
to express the gratitude
towards this extraordinary

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.320
distinction properly.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.030
I'm not even sure to whom, except
of course for a few people,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:30.480
should I express this gratitude
because, well, to James Billington

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.340 position:56%
in the first place, of course he was
the main architect of the system.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:44.180 position:56%
Mr. Kluge, who was-- who established
the whole-- the whole thing.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:52.040 position:56%
And then mister-- it was Gifford who
had a lot of work, if I understand,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.780
in preparing the whole thing.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.130
But, apart from that, there
were-- as far as I was told--

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.700
there were many people who
were active in the process

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:11.220
of selecting this--
reviewing and selecting--

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:18.370
so, I don't know their
names, so-- hardly any.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.940
So, I have to-- I have to
thank them collectively only.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.110
Thank you very, very much.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.410
I--

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:43.520
I repeat-- I repeat what I
already had the opportunity

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.930
to say here today.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:56.040
I learned about the Kluge award
a few months ago when I was--

00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:02.640
I got a letter asking me to
nominate a candidate for the award.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:10.590
Which I did and, unfortunately,
didn't-- I didn't succeed.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.950
This person did not get the award.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.250
All right.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:25.830
So-- then, however, I knew
nothing about the Kluge Center.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.730
I only-- I learned about
it only quite recently.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:38.800
And I found it astonishing and
truly a marvelous, great idea,

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:49.180
which will be, I hope, an extremely
helpful instrument to [inaudible]

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:58.820
with a corporation of scholars
from various countries,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:06.100
various parts of the world,
and, which is new, corporation

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:13.490
and exchange of thought between
scholars and politicians.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:24.220
Something that is extremely
needed and useful.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.730
I hope it will work.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:36.240
I think we should all thank James
Billington for this great idea

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.140
and I thank him, especially.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:48.830
Well, then I have to
thank many people,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:56.760
including, of course, my two girls.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.580
My wife, Tamara, and
my daughter, Agnieszka,

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.930
who are always extremely
helpful in whatever I'm doing.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.290
It's not that they're
uncritical, no.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:12.640
Very often-- very often, they
criticize what I'm doing,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.230
criticize my texts, and more often

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.760
than not they are right
in their criticism.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.690
So, I thank both them-- them both.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.660
Now, I would like to
say a few words.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.540
It won't be long, I promise.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.620
And there is something
which has a title--

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:44.500
has a title-- what the past is for.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.920
What the past is for.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:53.630
So, I start with a few
words about the future.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:57.260
And this futurology.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:03.580
According to my definition,

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:12.120
futurology is an extremely serious
science whose subject not only is

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.670
nonexistent, but necessarily
nonexistent.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:22.990
That is to say it-- the future
does not exist and never will,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.110
which is a common-sense remark.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:32.340
But we have a science about
this nonexistent subject.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:41.960
Well, perhaps we would
not find this worrying

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.480
if it did not immediately bring
to our attention an analogous

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.200
but much more terrifying insight.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.450
Mainly that the past
doesn't exist either.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:01.520
From the time Saint Augustine
and his classic reflections

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.370
on the subject, the
mystery of time is absurd

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.980
and its tormented nearly
all major philosophers

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:15.250
up to Bergson, Husserl, and Sartre.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:23.490
The past, by definition, is an
ocean of events that once happened

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:29.170
and this-- and those events are
either retained in our memory

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:37.040
or so that they exist only as
part of our psychological reality

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:44.270
or they are reconstructed by us on
the basis of our present experience

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.020
and it is only this
present experience,

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.960
our present reconstruction
of the past, that is real.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.980
Not the past as such.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:01.460 position:56%
In other words, the entire
[inaudible] of the past exists only,

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:08.860 position:56%
it seems, as a portion of our-- more
strictly, of my own-- consciousness.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.840
The past in itself is nothing.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:21.130
This argument can strike
us as a kind of sophistry

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:27.680
or a bizarre philosophical
exercise, but it's not so.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.380
It's not sophistry.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.390
It is serious.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:40.910
However, we can also look at
the question from another angle.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:48.520
Everything we see or touch is
obviously a product of events

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:54.050
that had happened once,
perhaps 10 seconds ago,

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.330
perhaps 10 million years ago.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:03.070
It is not-- is it not therefore
proper and reasonable to say

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:09.350
that whoever we see
or touch is the past?

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:15.080
In metaphysical terms, the
past is perhaps nothing; but,

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:21.130
in terms of our direct
experience, the past is everything.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:27.460
Our entire knowledge of the
so-called external world is nothing

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.930
but a continuous, uninterrupted
stream

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:39.000
of acts whereby what was
the past becomes present.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.440
Yes, we may say that far from being
nothing, the past is everything.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:53.360
And the enigma is time is not
just something philosophers have

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.820
constructed to amuse themselves.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:02.080
We-- when they try to
unravel its mysteries.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.640
No. The mysteries are
accessible to everyone.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.740
And so, of course,
not everyone likes

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:13.250
to spend time in thinking
about time.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:20.780
It is only philosophers who try to
express this everyday experience.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.770
So, now the digression.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.340
Philosopher is not
there to be liked.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.930
It's not to like them.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:35.490
I remember a colleague of mine,
a professor of philosophy,

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:41.190
telling me about his six-year-old
son who was the first time

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:48.710
in the school and the teacher asked
all the children to say their names

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:54.400
and then to ask what their father--
what their fathers were doing

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.490
and the boy refused to say
anything and the teacher was angry.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:04.260
And later, at home, he explained
but I couldn't tell them

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:10.260 position:56%
that my dad is a philosopher because
all the children would laugh at me.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:15.480
And, indeed, they would
have laughed at him.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:23.590
But, if the boy had said that his
father was, say, a circus clown,

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.420
they would have laughed as well.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:34.290
Even so, it is a nice, respectable
job to be a circus clown.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.230
Moreover, they would have
laughed if the boy had said

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:42.570
that his dad was a
garbage collector,

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.150
even though the profession

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:50.000
of garbage collector is
not only respectable,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.910
but it's one of the most
important in today's world.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:29:00.180
Without garbage collectors,
we would not survive for long.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:06.670
And so, in matters of
philosophy, let us not rely

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.720
on the opinions of those kids.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.170
One might add-- one might
add that the profession

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:19.880
of a philosopher has
a significant affinity

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.090
with the two professions I've just
mentioned, that of a circus clown

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.870
and that of a garbage collector.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.960
But this was a digression.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:38.230
Let's go back to the
problem of the past.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:45.300
So, our direct experience may be
plausibly interpreted as a form

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:52.360 position:56%
of contact with the past, but we can
also speak of knowledge of the past

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:59.510
in a more specific sense, mainly
our knowledge of human history.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:05.680
And we may ask what this kind
of knowledge of the past is for.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.610
In the tradition of
the enlightenment,

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:15.320 position:56%
we sometimes find a kind of
disrespect for historical knowledge.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:21.250
Either because history, more often
than not, is an infinite display

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.720
of human stupidity and cruelty

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.850
or because nothing profitable can
be learned from what mankind was

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:37.070
up to earlier or else because
history is not a science.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:45.080
It is indeed arguable that we
cannot use historical knowledge

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:51.520
to help in our present work.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.530
It's not a technical help
we can expect from it.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.170
It may be true.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:07.310
It may be true that whatever people
know about say military exploits

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:12.920
of Alexander the Great or
Hannibal would not be of much use

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:20.020
in improving the skills of today's
generals and that knowledge,

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:24.300
say of the political intrigues
of the French Royal Court

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.790
in the 17th century
would not be of much help

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.960
to contemporary politicians.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:38.740
However, the limited
technical support to be gained

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:43.300
from an acquaintance with the
historical events is not a good

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:49.910 position:56%
reason for concluding that therefore
historical knowledge is irrelevant

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.610
to our life.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:32:00.400
We are, of course, the cultural--
though not necessarily physical--

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.040
heirs of Alexander the Great,
Hannibal, and French monarchs.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.860
Not to say that their life,
their deeds or misdeeds--

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.770
not the reason that they
do not matter to our life.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:21.640
To say so would be almost as silly
as saying that it would not matter

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.610
to me if I were suddenly to erase

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:32.370
from my memory my own past personal
life just because, obviously,

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:36.170
I live in the present,
not in the past.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:42.460
The history of prior generations is
our history and we need to know it

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:49.080
in order to be aware of our
identity in the same sense

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.040
in which my own memory
builds my personal identity.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.360
Makes me a human subject.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:02.540
So, we learn history in
order to know who we are.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:09.320 position:56%
From that assumption that history
is not a science, but rather an art,

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.470
it does not follow of
course it is not interesting

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:17.140
or unworthy of being cultivated.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.440
Obviously not.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:24.420
So, but here's a trivial point.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:29.150
But saying that history is
not a science may suggest

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:34.880
like that unlike the natural
sciences it simply does not try

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.730
to establish general laws,
but is concerned only

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:45.170
with particular events,
unique and unrepeatable.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:50.230
This question has been
discussed since the 19th century.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:55.590
It resulted in the well-known
distinction made by Rickert

00:33:55.590 --> 00:34:01.520
between nomothetic and
ideographic disciplines.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.120
Between disciplines in which laws
are discovered and disciplines

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:15.270
which are just concerned with the
narration of single occurrences.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:21.540 position:56%
In fact, yes, there is no such thing
as the laws of history in the sense

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:29.130
of true and justifiable statements
that would tell us what--

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:35.710 position:56%
that tell us in what certain
well-defined conditions some certain

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:41.340
well-defined phenomena
necessarily invariably occur.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:48.470
The belief in laws of history was
a Hegelian or Marxian delusion.

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:55.830
Human history is a collection of
unpredictable accidents and each

00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:05.640
of us can easily cite any number
of instances where an event

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.890
that was clearly decisive in
shaping the history of mankind

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:15.740
for subsequent decades,
centuries, could have gone

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.600
in different way than it did.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.320
There was no-- there
was no necessity

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:29.720
in its happening or in its result.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:37.230
The phrase the laws of history has
also been used to describe tendency

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:43.570
or trends that are bound to
prevail in the near future.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:49.990
This use was particularly
frequent in Marxist doctrine

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:57.240 position:56%
and its ideological meaning calls
that future events could be foreseen

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.960
on the allegedly scientific basis.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:09.470
Alas, all the predictions
made by Marx or later by--

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:17.260
or by later Marxists-- all of
them that were demonstrably false.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:23.260
So far, development went in an
entirely different direction.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:29.140 position:56%
The middle classes, instead of
gradually shrinking and disappearing

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:34.250
as the Marxist prophecy
would have it, grew and grew.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:40.460
The market, far from being an
obstacle to technological progress,

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:47.030
as Marxists claimed, proved to
be its more powerful stimulus.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.410
The relative and absolute
popularization

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:55.350
of the working class
failed to occur.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:37:01.310
The falling rate of profit, which
was supposed to be the cause

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:07.140
of collapse of capitalism
proved vain hope.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:12.140
The proletarian revolution,
it is revolution resulting

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:17.170
from the conflict between
industrial workers of capitalism.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.820
This revolution never happened.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.660
The Russian revolution was
in a way an example of it.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:33.320
What perhaps comes-- came-- came
the closest to such a revolution,

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.960
at least conceptually-- that was
perhaps the worker's movement

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.130
in Poland in the early 80's.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:47.320
As this movement, it was
directed against a socialist state

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:53.850
and carried under the sign of
cross was the blessing pope.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:58.020 position:56%
So much for [inaudible] predictions.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:03.000
One may say that, in general,
futurology, so-called,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.120
is not unhealthy state and
this for a number of reason.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:14.520
But there's another important way
in which the nihilistic approach

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.170
to history is expressed today.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:24.650 position:56%
There is a post-[inaudible]
phrase, also known as postmodernism,

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:31.800
and it says there are no
facts, only interpretations.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.300
This is in-- in the one sense,
it is trivially true and,

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.540
in another sense, it is
absurd and dangerous.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:47.450
It is trivially true that
any description of a fact--

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:53.990
even the simplest-- involves the
entire history of human character.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:39:04.960
When I say, for instance, this
morning, on October 29, 2003,

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.190
I ate yogurt for breakfast.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:14.240
My words encompass the entire
history of the European calendar

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.250
with all its arbitrariness.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:23.250 position:56%
They encompass the concept of
breakfast and the concept of yogurt,

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.520
which are all human inventions.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:32.770
The language I use is a product of
human history and, in this sense,

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.950
whenever we use it,
we interpret the word.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:42.270
The word never shows itself
to us, so to say directly,

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:46.630
so to say stripped and
naked in its purity.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:50.920
We always perceive it
mediated by our culture,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.440
our history, our language.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:40:01.000
But this saying that there are
no facts, only interpretations,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.400
has another and dangerous meaning.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.310
Since historical knowledge
is supposed to consist

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:16.110
in the description of facts,
of things that really happened,

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:22.830
the idea that there are no facts
in the normal sense implies--

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:27.010
this idea implies that
interpretations do not depend

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:30.020
on facts, but the other way around.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:35.520
The facts are produced
by interpretations.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.770
Let us suppose that I stole
a bottle of wine from a shop.

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.910
The saying, Mr. K stole a bottle

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:49.620
of wine would be an interpretation
which generates a fact.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.840
The fact in itself does not exist.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:59.900
Consequently, phrases like Mr. K is
guilty of stealing a bottle of wine

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.650
or Mr. K should be punished

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:07.360
for his crime have no
meaning in relation to a fact.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.950
They are just parts
of the interpretation.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:16.250
In other words, the
concept of modern judgment

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:21.870
and therefore also the concept
of good and evil are empty.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:25.870
They don't refer to
an empirical reality,

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:30.030
but only to our way of
judging the reality.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:35.470
Judging according to an a
priori conceptual [inaudible].

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:46.730
The doctrine that there are no
facts, only interpretations,

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:54.060 position:56%
in fact, abolishes the idea of human
responsibility and moral judgements.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:00.140
Moreover, in effect, it considers
any myth, any legend or fable just

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:06.160
as valid in terms of knowledge
as any fact that we have verified

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:11.930
as being verified as such according

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:16.020
to the standards of
historical inquiry.

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:23.310
In epistemological terms, any
mythical theory is just as good

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:27.190
as any historical established fact.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:33.230
The story of Hercules fighting
against Hydra is not worse,

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:37.300
not less true in historical
terms than the history

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.710
of Napoleon being defeated
at Waterloo.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:45.820
There are not valid rules
for establishing truth,

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.980
consequently there is
not such thing as truths.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.150
There is no need to elaborate

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:57.880
on the disastrous cultural
effect of such a theory.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:06.300
Now, the upfront of my
remarks is, in fact, banal.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:12.210
Also, the legacy of myths
is certainly an important

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:17.280 position:56%
and fertile source in human culture.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:23.670
We must defend and support simply
traditional research methods

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:30.700
elaborated over century-- centuries
and establish the factual cause

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.940
of history and separated
from fantasies.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:42.490
However, narrating those
fantasies might be the doctrine

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:46.540
that there are no facts,
only interpretations,

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:50.570
should be rejected as obscurantist.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:58.990 position:56%
And we much perceive-- prevent-- we
must preserve our traditional belief

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:01.090
that the history of mankind--

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:05.500
the history of things
that really happened--

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:10.160
woven of numerable unique
accidents is the history

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.120
of each of us human subjects.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:21.210
Whereas the belief in historical
laws is a figment of imagination.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:27.060
Historical knowledge, obviously,
is crucial to each of us.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.500
To schoolchildren and students.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.150
To young and old.

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:38.840
We must absorb history as our own,
with all its horrors and tragedies

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.220
as well as its beauty and splendor.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.400
It's cruelties and
persecutions as well

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.800
as all the magnificent works
of human mind and hand.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:59.220
We must do this if we are to know
the proper place in our universe.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.830
To know who we are
and how we should act.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:11.040
One might-- one might ask what the
point of repeating such banalities.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.510
The answer is simply that
it is important to keep

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:19.650
on repeating them again
and again because this--

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:25.850
our banalities we often find
it convenient to forget.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:30.840
And if we forget them and
if they fall into oblivion,

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.940
we'll be condemning our culture--
that's to say our sense--

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.380
to ultimate and irrevocable ruin.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.070
That's all I wanted to say.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:46.510
Thank you very much
for your patience.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:46:00.490
