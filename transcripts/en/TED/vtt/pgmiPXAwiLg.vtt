00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.475
A few years ago,

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.458
I set out on a mission to find God.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.649
Now, I'm going to tell you
right up front that I failed,

00:00:20.673 --> 00:00:22.259
which, as a lawyer,

00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:24.440
is a really hard thing for me to admit.

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:27.774
But on that failed journey,

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:30.228
a lot of what I found was enlightening.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:33.801
And one thing in particular
gave me a lot of hope.

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:38.304
It has to do with the magnitude
and significance of our differences.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:43.441
So, I was raised in America
by Indian parents -- culturally Hindu,

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:47.807
but practicing a strict and relatively
unknown religion outside of India

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:48.987
called Jainism.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.559
To give you an idea
of just how minority that makes me:

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:57.508
people from India represent
roughly one percent of the US population;

00:00:57.973 --> 00:01:00.159
Hindus, about 0.7 percent;

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:06.965
Jains, at most .00046 percent.

00:01:07.557 --> 00:01:09.122
To put that in context:

00:01:09.513 --> 00:01:12.692
more people visit the Vermont
Teddy Bear Factory each year

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:15.431
than are followers
of the Jain religion in America.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:18.356
To add to my minority mix,
my parents then decided,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.074
"What a great idea!
Let's send her to Catholic school" --

00:01:21.098 --> 00:01:22.116
(Laughter)

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.319
where my sister and I
were the only non-white,

00:01:24.343 --> 00:01:26.700
non-Catholic students
in the entire school.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:31.611
At the Infant Jesus of Prague School
in Flossmoor, Illinois --

00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:34.107
yes, that's really what it was called --

00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:37.815
we were taught to believe
that there is a single Supreme Being

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:40.047
who is responsible for everything,

00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:41.301
the whole shebang,

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:45.481
from the creation of the Universe
to moral shepherding to eternal life.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.174
But at home,

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:49.967
I was being taught something
entirely different.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.461
Followers of the Jain religion

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.594
don't believe in a single Supreme Being

00:01:54.618 --> 00:01:56.398
or even a team of Supreme Beings.

00:01:56.747 --> 00:01:58.786
Instead, we're taught that God manifests

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.812
as the perfection of each of us
as individuals,

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:04.320
and that we're actually
spending our entire lives

00:02:04.344 --> 00:02:06.223
striving to remove the bad karmas

00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:10.559
that stand in the way of us
becoming our own godlike, perfect selves.

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.617
On top of that, one of the core
principles of Jainism

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:17.287
is something called "non-absolutism."

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.727
Non-absolutists believe
that no single person

00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:24.256
can hold ownership or knowledge
of absolute truth,

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.232
even when it comes to religious beliefs.

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.114
Good luck testing that concept out

00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:32.569
on the priests and nuns
in your Catholic school.

00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:33.909
(Laughter)

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:35.710
No wonder I was confused

00:02:35.734 --> 00:02:39.290
and hyperaware of how different
I was from my peers.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.843
Cut to 20-something years later,

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:44.750
and I found myself to be
a highly spiritual person,

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:46.328
but I was floundering.

00:02:46.352 --> 00:02:47.982
I was spiritually homeless.

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:51.812
I came to learn that I was a "None,"

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:54.974
which isn't an acronym
or a clever play on words,

00:02:54.998 --> 00:02:57.044
nor is it one of these.

00:02:57.663 --> 00:03:00.377
It's simply the painfully uninspired name

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.144
given to everyone
who checks off the box "none"

00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:07.516
when Pew Research asks them
about their religious affiliation.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.564
(Laughter)

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:11.057
Now, a couple of interesting
things about Nones are:

00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.263
there are a lot of us,

00:03:12.287 --> 00:03:13.773
and we skew young.

00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:21.286
In 2014, there were over 56 million
religiously unaffiliated Nones

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.487
in the United States.

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.165
And Nones account
for over one-third of adults

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.951
between the ages of 18 to 33.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.442
But the most interesting thing
to me about Nones

00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:35.768
is that we're often spiritual.

00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:40.012
In fact, 68 percent of us believe,
with some degree of certainty,

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:41.416
that there is a God.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.953
We're just not sure who it is.

00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:44.977
(Laughter)

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:47.826
So the first takeaway for me

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.911
when I realized I was a None
and had found that information out

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:53.743
was that I wasn't alone.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.179
I was finally part of a group in America

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:57.681
that had a lot of members,

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.340
which felt really reassuring.

00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:02.422
But then the second,
not-so-reassuring takeaway

00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:04.677
was that, oh, man, there are a lot of us.

00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:05.923
That can't be good,

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:09.800
because if a lot of highly spiritual
people are currently godless,

00:04:09.824 --> 00:04:13.559
maybe finding God is not going to be
as easy as I had originally hoped.

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:16.907
So that is when I decided
that on my spiritual journey,

00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:19.005
I was going to avoid the obvious places

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.525
and skip the big-box religions altogether

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.207
and instead venture out
into the spiritual fringe

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.540
of mediums

00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:27.746
and faith healers

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:29.543
and godmen.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.374
But remember, I'm a non-absolutist,

00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:36.317
which means I was pretty inclined
to keep a fairly open mind,

00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:38.429
which turned out to be a good thing,

00:04:38.453 --> 00:04:42.167
because I went to a witch's potluck dinner

00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:45.103
at the LGBT Center in New York City,

00:04:45.127 --> 00:04:46.839
where I befriended two witches;

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:51.555
drank a five-gallon jerrican
full of volcanic water

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:52.959
with a shaman in Peru;

00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:56.593
got a hug from a saint
in the convention center --

00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:57.962
she smelled really nice --

00:04:57.986 --> 00:04:59.715
(Laughter)

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:03.486
chanted for hours in a smoke-filled,
heat-infused sweat lodge

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.997
on the beaches of Mexico;

00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.246
worked with a tequila-drinking medium
to convene with the dead,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.628
who oddly included both
my deceased mother-in-law

00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:15.828
and the deceased manager
of the hip-hop group The Roots.

00:05:15.852 --> 00:05:16.935
(Laughter)

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:19.702
Yeah, my mother-in-law told me
she was really happy

00:05:19.726 --> 00:05:21.732
her son had chosen me for his wife.

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:22.907
Duh! But --

00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:24.870
(Laughter)

00:05:24.894 --> 00:05:26.052
Yeah.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.165
But the manager of The Roots

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.505
said that maybe I should cut back
on all the pasta I was eating.

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.137
I think we can all agree

00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:36.199
that it was lucky for my husband
that it wasn't his dead mother

00:05:36.223 --> 00:05:37.706
who suggested I lay off carbs.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.824
(Laughter)

00:05:38.848 --> 00:05:42.727
I also joined a laughing yoga group
out of South Africa;

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:47.588
witnessed a woman have
a 45-minute orgasm --

00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:48.935
I am not making this up --

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:51.521
as she tapped into
the energy of the universe --

00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:53.366
I think I'm going to go back there --

00:05:53.844 --> 00:05:56.216
(Laughter)

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.406
called God from a phone booth
in the Nevada desert at Burning Man,

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.498
wearing a unitard and ski goggles;

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:08.064
and I had an old Indian guy
lie on top of me,

00:06:08.088 --> 00:06:10.098
and no, he wasn't my husband.

00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:12.535
This was a perfect stranger named Paramji,

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.322
and he was chanting into my chakras

00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:19.024
as he tapped into the energy forces
of the Universe to heal my "yoni,"

00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:22.039
which is a Sanskrit word for "vagina."

00:06:22.063 --> 00:06:23.387
(Laughter)

00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:24.983
I was going to have a slide here,

00:06:25.007 --> 00:06:26.838
but a few people suggested

00:06:26.862 --> 00:06:31.177
that a slide of my yoni
at TED -- even TEDWomen --

00:06:31.201 --> 00:06:32.560
not the best idea.

00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:33.742
(Laughter)

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.591
Very early in my quest,

00:06:36.615 --> 00:06:39.951
I also went to see the Brazilian
faith healer John of God

00:06:39.975 --> 00:06:41.740
at his compound down in Brazil.

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:45.215
Now, John of God is considered
a full-trance medium,

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:47.760
which basically means
he can talk to dead people.

00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:51.938
But in his case, he claims
to channel a very specific group

00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:53.400
of dead saints and doctors

00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:55.803
in order to heal
whatever's wrong with you.

00:06:55.827 --> 00:06:58.775
And although John of God does
not have a medical degree

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:00.883
or even a high school diploma,

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:03.352
he actually performs surgery --

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:05.861
the real kind, with a scalpel,

00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:07.741
but no anesthesia.

00:07:08.893 --> 00:07:10.053
Yeah, I don't know.

00:07:10.077 --> 00:07:13.547
He also offers invisible surgery,
where there is no cutting,

00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:14.728
and surrogate surgery,

00:07:14.752 --> 00:07:18.850
where he supposedly can treat somebody
who is thousands of miles away

00:07:18.874 --> 00:07:21.076
by performing a procedure on a loved one.

00:07:21.747 --> 00:07:23.590
Now, when you go to visit John of God,

00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:25.750
there are all kinds
of rules and regulations.

00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:27.356
It's a whole complicated thing,

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.639
but the bottom line is that
you can visit John of God

00:07:30.663 --> 00:07:33.870
and present him with three things
that you would like fixed,

00:07:33.894 --> 00:07:36.991
and he will set the dead saints
and doctors to work on your behalf

00:07:37.015 --> 00:07:38.198
to get the job done.

00:07:38.222 --> 00:07:39.231
(Laughter)

00:07:39.255 --> 00:07:41.730
Now, before you snicker,

00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:43.238
consider

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:45.234
that, at least according to his website,

00:07:45.258 --> 00:07:47.040
over eight million people --

00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:48.980
including Oprah,

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.575
the Goddess of Daytime TV --

00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:54.304
have gone to see John of God,

00:07:54.328 --> 00:07:56.992
and I was pre-wired to keep an open mind.

00:07:58.124 --> 00:08:01.742
But to be honest, the whole thing for me
was kind of weird and inconclusive,

00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:03.517
and in the end, I flew home,

00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:06.032
even more confused
than I already started out.

00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:09.295
But that doesn't mean
I came home empty-handed.

00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:13.158
In the weeks leading up
to my trip to Brazil,

00:08:13.182 --> 00:08:15.951
I mentioned my upcoming plans
to some friends

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:17.921
and to a couple of colleagues at Google,

00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:19.616
where I was a lawyer at the time.

00:08:20.028 --> 00:08:22.536
And I might have mentioned it
to a couple more people

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.751
because I'm chatty,

00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:24.983
including my neighbor,

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.768
the guy who works at the local
coffee shop I go to each morning,

00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:30.915
the checkout lady at Whole Foods

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:33.822
and a stranger who sat
next to me on the subway.

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:36.959
I told each of them where I was going

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:38.154
and why,

00:08:38.178 --> 00:08:42.599
and I offered to carry three wishes
of theirs down to Brazil,

00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:45.392
explaining that anyone going
to see John of God

00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:47.226
could act as a proxy for others

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.422
and save them the trip.

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:52.930
And to my surprise, my in-box overflowed.

00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:55.807
Friends told friends who told friends,

00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:58.067
and those friends
apparently told more friends,

00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:00.501
other strangers
and the guys at their coffee shops,

00:09:00.525 --> 00:09:02.929
until it seemed that days
before I left for Brazil

00:09:02.953 --> 00:09:05.888
that there was no one who did not
have my email address.

00:09:06.765 --> 00:09:11.115
And at the time, all I could conclude
was that I had offered too much

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:12.296
to too many.

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.981
But when I actually reread
those messages a few years later,

00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:20.937
I noticed something completely different.

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:26.052
Those emails actually shared
three commonalities,

00:09:26.885 --> 00:09:28.709
the first of which was rather curious.

00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:34.431
Almost everyone sent me meticulous details
about how they could be reached.

00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:38.135
I had told them,
or their friends had told them,

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:41.292
that along with the list
of the three things they wanted fixed,

00:09:41.316 --> 00:09:44.914
I needed their photo, their name
and their date of birth.

00:09:45.533 --> 00:09:49.665
But they gave me full addresses, with,
like, apartment numbers and zip codes,

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:52.044
as if John of God was going
to stop by their house

00:09:52.068 --> 00:09:54.420
and see them in person
or send along a package.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.607
It was as if, in the highly unlikely event
that their wishes were granted

00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:00.823
by John of God,

00:10:00.847 --> 00:10:03.620
they just wanted to make sure
that they weren't delivered

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.614
to the wrong person or the wrong address.

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.804
Even if they didn't believe,

00:10:07.828 --> 00:10:09.432
they were hedging their bets.

00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:13.698
The second commonality
was just as curious,

00:10:14.612 --> 00:10:15.998
but far more humbling.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.145
Virtually everyone --

00:10:19.925 --> 00:10:21.230
the stranger on the subway,

00:10:21.827 --> 00:10:23.135
the guy at the coffee shop,

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.853
the lawyer down the hall,

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.482
the Jew, the atheist,
the Muslim, the devout Catholic --

00:10:28.873 --> 00:10:32.085
all asked for essentially
the same three things.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.687
OK, there were a couple of outliers,
and yes, a few people asked for cash.

00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:41.093
But when I eliminated what were
ultimately a handful of anomalies,

00:10:41.527 --> 00:10:43.841
the similarities were staggering.

00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:48.119
Almost every single person

00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:52.667
first asked for good health
for themselves and their families.

00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:55.378
Almost universally,

00:10:56.212 --> 00:10:57.686
they next asked for happiness

00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:59.980
and then love,

00:11:01.439 --> 00:11:02.615
in that order:

00:11:03.824 --> 00:11:05.579
health, happiness, love.

00:11:07.585 --> 00:11:10.512
Sometimes they asked for a specific
health issue to be fixed,

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:13.858
but more often than not, they just
asked for good health in general.

00:11:15.222 --> 00:11:16.498
When it came to happiness,

00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:19.207
they each phrased it slightly differently,

00:11:20.052 --> 00:11:24.648
but they all asked for the same
specific subtype of happiness, too --

00:11:26.282 --> 00:11:28.363
the kind of happiness that sinks in

00:11:28.832 --> 00:11:30.775
and sets down roots in your soul;

00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:34.857
the kind of happiness
that could sustain us,

00:11:35.922 --> 00:11:38.848
even if we were to lose
absolutely everything else.

00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:41.739
And for love,

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.997
they all asked for the kind
of romantic love,

00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:48.997
the soul mate that we read about
in epic romantic novels,

00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:53.616
the kind of love that will stay with us
till the end of our days.

00:11:55.893 --> 00:11:57.908
Sorry, that's my husband.

00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:02.250
Crap! Now I forgot my place.

00:12:02.274 --> 00:12:04.293
(Laughter)

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:09.977
(Applause)

00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:16.161
So by and large,

00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:18.573
all of these friends and strangers,

00:12:18.597 --> 00:12:21.951
regardless of their background,
race or religion,

00:12:22.762 --> 00:12:24.426
all asked for the same things,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.212
and they were the same things
that I really wanted,

00:12:27.236 --> 00:12:30.038
the simplified version
of the basic human needs

00:12:30.062 --> 00:12:34.683
identified by social scientists
like Abraham Maslow and Manfred Max-Neef.

00:12:35.668 --> 00:12:38.786
No one asked for answers
to the big existential questions

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.215
or for proof of God or the meaning of life
like I had set out to find.

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:45.578
They didn't even ask for an end
to war or global hunger.

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:50.482
Even when they could have asked
for absolutely anything,

00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:53.541
they all asked for health,
happiness and love.

00:12:55.418 --> 00:12:58.166
So now those emails had
a third commonality as well.

00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:02.572
Each of them ended in the exact same way.

00:13:03.597 --> 00:13:07.363
Instead of thanking me for carting
their wishes all the way to Brazil,

00:13:08.427 --> 00:13:09.642
everyone said,

00:13:11.285 --> 00:13:12.757
"Please don't tell anyone."

00:13:14.738 --> 00:13:16.954
So I decided to tell everyone --

00:13:16.978 --> 00:13:18.209
(Laughter)

00:13:18.233 --> 00:13:19.731
right here on this stage,

00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:23.211
not because I'm untrustworthy,

00:13:23.867 --> 00:13:27.109
but because the fact
that we have so much in common

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:30.619
feels especially important for us
all to hear, especially now,

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.690
when so many of the world's problems

00:13:32.714 --> 00:13:36.701
seem to be because we keep focusing
on the things that make us different,

00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:38.608
not on what binds us together.

00:13:39.765 --> 00:13:44.141
And look -- I am the first to admit
that I am not a statistician,

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.710
and that the data I presented to you
that I just accumulated in my in-box

00:13:48.734 --> 00:13:53.835
is more anecdotal than scientific,
more qualitative than quantitative.

00:13:54.394 --> 00:13:57.616
It is, as anyone who works
with data would tell you,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.464
hardly a statistically significant
or demographically balanced sample.

00:14:01.488 --> 00:14:05.549
But nonetheless, I find myself
thinking about those emails

00:14:05.573 --> 00:14:09.125
every time I reflect back
on the bias and prejudice

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:10.666
that I've faced in my life,

00:14:11.131 --> 00:14:14.025
or when there's another hate crime
or a senseless tragedy

00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:16.661
that underscores the disheartening sense

00:14:16.685 --> 00:14:19.538
that our differences
might be insurmountable.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.380
I then remind myself that I have evidence

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.986
that the humbling, unifying commonality

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.620
of our humanity

00:14:27.644 --> 00:14:30.612
is that, even when presented
with the opportunity

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.789
to ask for anything at all,

00:14:32.813 --> 00:14:34.750
most of us want the same things,

00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:37.479
and that this is true
no matter who we are,

00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:40.096
what name we call our god,

00:14:40.702 --> 00:14:43.824
or which religion, if any, we call home.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.904
I then also note

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:50.295
that apparently some of us
want these things so badly

00:14:50.821 --> 00:14:52.598
that we would email a None,

00:14:53.319 --> 00:14:56.606
a spiritually confused None like me --

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.738
some might say otherwise
confused as well --

00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:04.523
and that we would seek out this stranger
and email her our deepest wishes,

00:15:04.547 --> 00:15:07.892
just in case there is
the remote possibility

00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:11.557
that they might be granted
by someone who is not a god,

00:15:11.581 --> 00:15:13.970
much less our god,

00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:16.967
someone who is not even
a member of our chosen religion,

00:15:17.998 --> 00:15:19.999
someone who, when you
look at him on paper,

00:15:20.023 --> 00:15:22.513
seems like an unlikely
candidate to deliver.

00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:25.519
And so now,

00:15:26.494 --> 00:15:29.623
when I reflect back on my spiritual quest,

00:15:31.758 --> 00:15:33.878
even though I did not find God,

00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:37.519
I found a home in this:

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.291
even today, in a world
fractured by religious,

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:49.206
ethnic, political, philosophical,
and racial divides,

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.264
even with all of our obvious differences,

00:15:52.288 --> 00:15:53.703
at the end of the day,

00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:56.026
and the most fundamental level,

00:15:56.886 --> 00:15:58.280
we are all the same.

00:15:59.613 --> 00:16:00.776
Thank you.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:06.413
(Applause)
