00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.440
I've been doing some thinking.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to kill my dad.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.416
I called my sister.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.936
"Listen,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.520
I've been doing some thinking.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.320
I'm going to kill Dad.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120
I'm going to take him to Oregon,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.976
find some heroin,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.240
and give it to him."

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.856
My dad has frontotemporal lobe dementia,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.616
or FTD.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.576
It's a confusing disease
that hits people in their 50s or 60s.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.496
It can completely change
someone's personality,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.600
making them paranoid and even violent.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.336
My dad's been sick for a decade,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.896
but three years ago he got really sick,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.256
and we had to move him out of his house --

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.216
the house that I grew up in,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.240
the house that he built
with his own hands.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.376
My strapping, cool dad
with the falsetto singing voice

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.829
had to move into a facility
for round-the-clock care

00:01:06.853 --> 00:01:08.333
when he was just 65.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.616
At first my mom and sisters
and I made the mistake

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.720
of putting him in a regular nursing home.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:17.856
It was really pretty;

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.816
it had plush carpet
and afternoon art classes

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.640
and a dog named Diane.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.880
But then I got a phone call.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.640
"Ms. Malone, we've arrested your father."

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.000
"What?"

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.760
"Well, he threatened
everybody with cutlery.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.096
And then he yanked
the curtains off the wall,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.440
and then he tried
to throw plants out the window.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.480
And then, well, he pulled all
the old ladies out of their wheelchairs."

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.576
"All the old ladies?"

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.776
(Laughter)

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.056
"What a cowboy."

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.736
(Laughter)

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.376
After he got kicked out of there,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.976
we bounced him between
a bunch of state-run facilities

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.256
before finding a treatment center
specifically for people with dementia.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.336
At first, he kind of liked it,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.296
but over time his health declined,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.576
and one day I walked in

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.816
and found him sitting hunched over
on the ground wearing a onesie --

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.000
those kinds of outfits
that zip in the back.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.976
I watched him for about an hour
as he yanked at it,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.400
trying to find a way out of this thing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.856
And it's supposed to be practical,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.040
but to me it looked like a straightjacket.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.280
And so I ran out.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.080
I left him there.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.696
I sat in my truck -- his old truck --

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.336
hunched over,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.560
this really deep guttural cry
coming out of the pit of my belly.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.360
I just couldn't believe that my father,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.800
the Adonis of my youth,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.720
my really dear friend,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.560
would think that this kind of life
was worth living anymore.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.280
We're programmed
to prioritize productivity.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.056
So when a person --
an Adonis in this case --

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.736
is no longer productive
in the way we expect him to be,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.600
the way that he expects himself to be,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.960
what value does that life have left?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.496
That day in the truck,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.696
all I could imagine
was that my dad was being tortured

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.680
and his body was
the vessel of that torture.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.840
I've got to get him out of that body.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.440
I've got to get him out of that body;
I'm going to kill Dad.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.840
I call my sister.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.200
"Beth," she said.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.936
"You don't want
to live the rest of your life

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.776
knowing that you killed your father.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.896
And you'd be arrested I think,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.496
because he can't condone it.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.776
And you don't even know
how to buy heroin."

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.816
(Laughter)

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.096
It's true, I don't.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.480
(Laughter)

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.256
The truth is we talk
about his death a lot.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280
When will it happen? What will it be like?

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:04.376
But I wish that we would have talked
about death when we were all healthy.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.880
What does my best death look like?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.960
What does your best death look like?

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.840
But my family didn't know to do that.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.200
And my sister was right.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.760
I shouldn't murder Dad with heroin,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.760
but I've got to get him out of that body.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.920
So I went to a psychic.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.856
And then a priest,
and then a support group,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.495
and they all said the same thing:

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:31.616
sometimes people hang on
when they're worried about loved ones.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.840
Just tell them you're safe,
and it's OK to go when you're ready.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.840
So I went to see Dad.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.336
I found him hunched over
on the ground in the onesie.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.376
He was staring past me
and just kind of looking at the ground.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.656
I gave him a ginger ale

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.296
and just started talking
about nothing in particular,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.240
but as I was talking,
he sneezed from the ginger ale.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.616
And the sneeze --
it jerked his body upright,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.576
sparking him back to life a little bit.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.776
And he just kept drinking and sneezing
and sparking, over and over and over again

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.360
until it stopped.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.480
And I heard,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.296
"Heheheheheh,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.056
heheheheheh ...

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.760
this is so fabulous.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.920
This is so fabulous."

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.296
His eyes were open
and he was looking at me,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.176
and I said, "Hi, Dad!"

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.180
and he said, "Hiya, Beth."

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.456
And I opened my mouth to tell him, right?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.056
"Dad, if you want to die, you can die.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.320
We're all OK."

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.776
But as I opened my mouth to tell him,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.240
all I could say was, "Dad!

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.600
I miss you."

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.896
And then he said, "Well, I miss you, too."

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.616
And then I just fell over
because I'm just a mess.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.880
So I fell over and I sat there with him

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.640
because for the first time in a long time
he seemed kind of OK.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.496
And I memorized his hands,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.000
feeling so grateful that his spirit
was still attached to his body.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.320
And in that moment I realized

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.240
I'm not responsible for this person.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.056
I'm not his doctor,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.360
I'm not his mother,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.496
I'm certainly not his God,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.256
and maybe the best way to help him and me

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.080
is to resume our roles
as father and daughter.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.720
And so we just sat there,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.016
calm and quiet like we've always done.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.440
Nobody was productive.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.320
Both of us are still strong.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.296
"OK, Dad. I'm going to go,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.606
but I'll see you tomorrow."

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.000
"OK," he said.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.080
"Hey,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.800
this is a pretty nice hacienda."

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.176
Thank you.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.480
(Applause)
