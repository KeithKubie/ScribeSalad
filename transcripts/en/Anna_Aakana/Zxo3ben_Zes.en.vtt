00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
I'm a 28 year old woman who just read this book, and holy shit!
[Hallelujah-music]

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.360
Mind blown!

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.700
Mind blown!

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.940
Mind blown!

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.100
I was like:

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.600
"What"?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.380
And then I was like

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.609
"Why didn't no one tell me this"!?

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.840
And finally,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.580
OH, MY GOD!

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.860
I wish I knew about this way earlier,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.300
because, when my parents gave me the 'talk',

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.820
it wasn't informative,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.700
at all.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.120
[piano music starts]
- Anna-kay, we need to have the talk with you.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.340
- Oh, no. No, I don't want any fucking part of that

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.840
- No.
- [whispers] Okay.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.740
I know you're wondering a lot about

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.260
sex.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.660
Anna, let's talk about the sex.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.700
I know it's very scary and you probably have a lot of confusing feelings

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.700
And questions about what to do, and how it works. I just want you to know,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.920
if you have a sex before you are married ...

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.080
... I will break your legs.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.360
[music stops]

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360
Okay, love you baby, bye-bye

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.020
- So, I went into my sexual awakening only with the knowledge that I had from anime porn,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.180
reading my mom's romance novels and the few articles that were up on the Internet.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.200
[Hallelujah-music and sound of early routers]

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.280
- Ooooohh...

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.800
- Okay, so let's get to the information, right? Here are the three things that that book taught me that I wish I knew about sex

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.640
way, way, way, way, way earlier.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.760
One - arousal concordance: Even though you may be mentally aroused, your body may not match up.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.960
According to sexual studies, men only get an erection 50% of the time that they're mentally aroused.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.640
For women, it's 10%.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.600
So when I'm turned on, my body only complies with the correct sexual response 10% of the time.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.860
I mean TMI, I'm always, like, self-conscious of being dry, even if I'm very turned on,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.940
because you're told that the amount of lubrication your body produces is an indicator of how aroused you are.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.540
So, if my body doesn't line up with how I feel, I keep feeling like there's something wrong with me.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.999
But no, it's totally normal - in fact,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.519
it's the majority of our experiences.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.360
And the book puts a very big emphasis that lube is your friend.
Make lube a lifelong friend

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.800
Two -  not experiencing orgasm from penetration is

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.280
completely normal.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.260
In fact how far the clitoris is from the vaginal

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.920
canal, is a big predictor of whether or not you'll be able to orgasm from intercourse alone.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.060
The farther away the harder it is.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.300
Wow!
You know my whole life

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.530
I thought something was wrong with me,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.589
but it's just science and my body's physical limitations. Rejoice ladies with clits far away from their vaginal canal,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.959
we are inhibited by factors out of our control.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.200
Three - desire comes from context.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.560
It may sound obvious, but not all people can actually experience

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.460
spontaneous desire. You know, I'm someone who can easily put myself in the context of like wanting to be intimate,

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.279
but some people simply need to create an environment to let desire emerge.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.989
I used to feel like really rejected or disheartened if my partner didn't want me when I wanted them,

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.919
and this book outlines not only the different ways people get aroused, but all the factors that influence that arousal and how you can manipulate

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.880
them for your own benefit. 
As a whole, the book just basically reassured me that I am normal and all these misconceptions

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.000
that I've had about sex since middle school were completely addressed, because in sex ed you're kind of taught one approach to sex

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.900
that's not really informative still.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.016
- Okay, class. Dicks, they're just like bananas, okay?

00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:20.660
So all you need to know is, you can just open them up,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.300
and they're nutritious,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.000
an' it's good for you. *hrmupf*

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.740
- I'm Anna Akana.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.740
