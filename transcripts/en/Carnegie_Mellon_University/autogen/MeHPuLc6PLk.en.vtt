should we protect the show and what
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.520
should we protect the show and what
should we should reveal so hence the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
should we should reveal so hence the
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350
should we should reveal so hence the
importance of the kind of research we we
