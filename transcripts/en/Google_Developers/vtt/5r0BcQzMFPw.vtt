00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:15.400
Marks: Hello there, I'm--

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.767
I've been asked
to talk to you about, um,

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:20.667
the social web, um,

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:24.868
and how entrepreneurs
can take advantage of that.

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:29.133
So...the way--
the way I look at this

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.133
is that, um,

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.267
the web keeps developing
over time.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.734
So it's--the web grew
out of an open network

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:38.234
on open standards.

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:41.434
Um, we built it that way
so that, um,

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:43.501
you could run applications
without worrying about things.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.834
So you didn't have
to worry about

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:46.133
where other computers were,

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.734
you could just
send a message to them.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:49.434
That was the first thing
that happened.

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:51.767
Um, then when we got
to the web, it was,

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:54.133
"I don't have to worry
about where my documents are.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.067
"I can get those
from anywhere in the world.

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.634
"Oh, and I don't have
to worry about user interfaces.

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:00.734
"I can just write a form
and the form will post that

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.133
to the other side of the world
where my server is."

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.033
So there's increasing
abstraction over time.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.868
Um, because these
abstractions are there,

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.567
it means, basically,
you have to write less code.

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:13.367
So the trend that's been
happening over the last year,

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:14.868
and the one that we've been
very involved with

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:16.033
in OpenSocial,

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:19.067
is coming up with abstractions
for social--

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:20.701
for the social part
of the web.

00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.367
Um, a year ago,
what we saw was

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.400
there were lots of different
social networking sites,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.434
and people were spending
lots of time on them.

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:29.367
But to develop for them
was very hard.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:31.400
'Cause each of them
had a separate API.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.334
Um, you often had
to wedge, um, code in there

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:35.801
through--through back doors

00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:37.667
or embedding flash
or something like that.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:39.334
So building something
that worked across many sites

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:40.634
was quite hard.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:43.868
Um, so we put together
the open social initiative

00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:45.834
to come up with a way,

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:47.133
a common set of APIs

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.267
for social applications
on the web,

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:52.167
to make the social part
of the web, um,

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:54.834
as easy as writing
HTML forms.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:56.767
That's the goal, to make it
something you can just

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:58.367
rely on being there.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:00.300
Um, and a year on,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.534
we're very excited
with what's happened with that.

00:02:02.534 --> 00:02:06.300
Um, I'm speaking today from
OpenSocial's first birthday.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.434
Um, and we just announced
that we have

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:11.200
over 600 million users
of OpenSocial worldwide,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.667
across, um, most
of the countries in the world.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.234
I can't even remember
the list of countries.

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:19.634
So that's, um,
that's very exciting.

00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:22.534
But the point of this, really,

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:26.067
is that, um, is to make
application development easier.

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:28.767
At the moment, if you want
to build a social application,

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:30.968
you have to find out information
about people.

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:32.968
And that tends to mean
you write a large form

00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:34.234
for them to fill in,

00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:35.667
where they have to tell you
who they are,

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:36.868
where they live,

00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:38.667
any other personal information
you need.

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:40.167
And then the second thing
you have to do

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:41.334
to make it really social

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:42.534
is find out
who their friends are

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.167
and gather the same information
from them.

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:45.934
So you either end up saying,

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:47.634
"Tell me who
your friends are,"

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:50.567
or you--they have to re-friend
everyone on your side,

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.667
or you go into the
"let me import your address book

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:55.734
and email your friends
and tell them to join my side."

00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:57.567
Um, and that ends up
annoying people

00:02:57.567 --> 00:02:58.634
more than it helps them.

00:02:58.634 --> 00:02:59.968
Um, the other thing is

00:02:59.968 --> 00:03:02.133
when you go to a website
that has a big form at the front

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:03.434
asking for information,

00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:05.734
people sort of back away from it
and leave.

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:08.033
And so you find that what
you've got into a database

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:11.267
is a sort of bad copy
of their real information

00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:12.400
that they store
somewhere else.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.567
'Cause they're a set of sites

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:15.000
they actually trust
with social information.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.701
'Cause those sites are--
specialize in gathering.

00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:21.300
So, um, what you're
able to do with OpenSocial

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.067
is to draw on those
existing sites

00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:24.634
that have
these large collections

00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:25.901
of social data,

00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.200
um, build your application

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.167
that specializes
in what you want to do,

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.200
um, and then take advantage

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.934
of the social network
that already exists.

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:35.200
So you can...whatever
your application's about,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.501
you can almost always
enhance it

00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:37.734
by making it more social,

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.968
by making it something
you do with friends.

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:42.701
Even if it's just a,
um, a news site

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:44.133
that's telling stories,

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:46.133
um, you can be more
interesting stories

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:49.000
that your friends have
read or recommended,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.701
um, than--than you are
in general

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.634
the stories that--that
everyone's looking at.

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:57.200
So by--just by adding that
little social feedback loop,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.167
you can make each, um,
each experience

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:03.634
more interesting.

00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:06.467
Um, so another
aspect of this--

00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:08.534
now, there--there's--

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:10.767
in building
social applications,

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:12.834
there's a lot of talk
about becoming viral

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:14.467
and spreading.

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:16.901
And--and there's--there's been
a set of applications built

00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:18.367
whose primary goal

00:04:18.367 --> 00:04:20.400
is to get as many members
as possible.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.567
Um, and this is--
this--this is--

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:24.934
there's, you know, we're seeing
a backlash against that.

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.934
And what I like to argue
is that this is--

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:29.033
this is because people
are using the wrong metaphor.

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:31.234
If you think of yourself
as a virus,

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:32.234
you're basically saying,

00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:33.734
"I would like
to be a disease.

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:36.000
"I would like to take advantage
or people to spread myself,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.801
and that's my only goal
in life."

00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.534
So what I say people do
is think of different metaphors.

00:04:40.534 --> 00:04:42.367
Think of organic metaphors.

00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:46.167
Um, think instead
of infecting someone,

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:47.434
think of inviting them.

00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:49.167
Um, so think
of how plants work.

00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:50.334
Plants have fruit.

00:04:50.334 --> 00:04:51.934
A fruit is a seed,

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:54.000
but it has something delicious
wrapped around it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.567
If you send someone
an invitation

00:04:55.567 --> 00:04:57.334
that actually
makes them happy,

00:04:57.334 --> 00:04:58.634
they're much more likely
to follow through,

00:04:58.634 --> 00:05:00.467
plant the seed,
and grow it. 

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.601
So if you se--rather than
sending out invitations

00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:05.267
to everyone
in the address book,

00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:07.400
um, if you let people

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.534
send out photographs
of people,

00:05:09.534 --> 00:05:11.033
um, that contain them,

00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:12.300
they're much more likely
to look at it.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.434
If I get an email with

00:05:13.434 --> 00:05:15.300
"Your friend has
a photograph of you,"

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.267
um, I'm gonna look at that,
go back, and click on that.

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:20.367
So think about how you can
actually spread this stuff

00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:22.534
so it's a natural part
of the experience

00:05:22.534 --> 00:05:25.634
rather than something
you're exploiting

00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:27.467
for your--for your own ends.

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:29.434
Because if you behave
like a disease,

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:30.901
people develop
an immune system,

00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:33.100
and they learn to reject you,
your applications.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.834
And that's something
we're seeing now.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.234
Um, the applications
that spread rapidly

00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:39.167
go up like this,
and they collapse like that

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:40.601
as people start
uninstalling them

00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:43.133
and as containers
start banning them.

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:44.801
Um, I said container there,

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.000
so I should back up
and explain that a little bit.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.167
Um, with OpenSocial,
we split the development world

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.601
into what we call containers
and applications.

00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:54.801
The idea is the container

00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:56.400
is the custodian
of the social data.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.667
It's the place that knows
who your friends are,

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.300
has information
about you and them,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.267
and can reveal that
to the application.

00:06:02.267 --> 00:06:03.934
Now, clearly,
they have to do that

00:06:03.934 --> 00:06:05.701
with permission
of the users.

00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:07.167
So there are
three people involved.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.534
There's the container,
the application,

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.701
and the user.

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:11.300
Um, and the user chooses
which applications

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.667
to add to the container,

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:14.701
and the container manages
the personal information

00:06:14.701 --> 00:06:16.667
so the application doesn't
have to worry about that.

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.467
Um, and also, the other--

00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:21.834
the key thing,
the value that, um,

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:24.067
the application
gets from the container

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:27.067
is the friends of the user
can see that application too,

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:28.868
and they can learn
to install it.

00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:32.200
So it can spread,
um, rapidly in that way.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.000
But, as I say,
you shouldn't be focusing

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.300
on spread as your goal.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.133
You should be focusing
on delighting the users

00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:38.567
so they want it to spread,

00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:40.601
rather than they feel like
something's taking them over

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.501
and exploiting them.

00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:45.801
Um...the--

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.167
so the other thing
that I want to mention

00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:49.667
about the growth of OpenSocial

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.267
and the way it's changed
in the last year,

00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:54.701
um, up until recently,

00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:55.868
the model for OpenSocial

00:06:55.868 --> 00:06:57.701
has been literally
having an application

00:06:57.701 --> 00:06:59.667
embedded inside
somebody else's site.

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:01.667
So if you've got
the container site,

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:04.033
the application was part
of their page.

00:07:04.033 --> 00:07:06.300
Um, this has some advantages.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.334
It makes the context
very clear to the user.

00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:10.734
It makes it easier
to integrate, um,

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:12.100
the--the friend stuff

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.801
'cause it's fairly clear
what's going on.

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:15.834
But the drawback is that, um,

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:17.901
you have to write it
in JavaScript.

00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:20.067
Um, and...

00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:21.868
well, you can write some
in CSS as well,

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:24.200
but primarily, you're writing
JavaScript application.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.734
Um, and plus
your application

00:07:25.734 --> 00:07:29.000
can only actually run code
when somebody's looking at it.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.567
So one of the things
we added in OpenSocial.8

00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:34.167
is a REST API,

00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:36.133
which makes it easier
for you to write

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:38.667
your application
on your own server over here,

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.167
and call
into the social network,

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:41.934
um, use the information
from there,

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:43.501
and present that
back to the user there.

00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:46.834
So what we use is a set
of open protocols for that.

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:49.267
We use, um, REST,

00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:51.901
which is the basic standard
for communicating on the web.

00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:55.100
We use OAuth
to authenticate that,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.033
um, and to let the user say,

00:07:57.033 --> 00:07:58.801
"Yes, this application's
allowed to do something

00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:00.200
with my application."

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.567
Um, and the three parts
of OpenSocial are--

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:05.434
well, actually, there's
four parts of OpenSocial

00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:07.067
that are exposed
with REST APIs.

00:08:07.067 --> 00:08:09.534
The first is the people
and contact stuff,

00:08:09.534 --> 00:08:11.067
finding out who you are,
who your friends are,

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:12.400
and information about you.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.701
Um, the second
is data persistence.

00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:16.801
You can actually store data
within the container,

00:08:16.801 --> 00:08:18.901
which means when the app
is running in the container,

00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:21.033
it can have access
to that quickly.

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:23.834
And also, it handles
the hard problem

00:08:23.834 --> 00:08:25.868
of I'm storing information
for user--

00:08:25.868 --> 00:08:26.968
for one user.

00:08:26.968 --> 00:08:28.300
I need the information
for that user

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.567
plus his friends.

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:31.601
Um, for a large number
of users,

00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:33.467
that's actually quite
a hard database problem.

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:35.133
But the social networks
have already sold that

00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:37.234
because they already have
large numbers of users,

00:08:37.234 --> 00:08:38.834
and they solve that problem
every day.

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:40.234
So you're basically
piggybacking

00:08:40.234 --> 00:08:42.000
on their ability
to do that there.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.601
The third one
is activity streams.

00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:46.801
Now, this is the page
where you have a list

00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:48.267
of what you and your friends
have done

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:50.601
within the--
the social network site.

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.467
That's been extended
with OpenSocial

00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:54.133
so that anything you do
with the applications

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.734
could show up in there too.

00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:59.167
And with .8, you can
run an application remotely

00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:01.033
and send activities
into the site.

00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:02.734
So if they do something
on your site,

00:09:02.734 --> 00:09:04.634
their friends on the social
network can see that too.

00:09:04.634 --> 00:09:06.634
And again, it adds value
for everyone.

00:09:06.634 --> 00:09:08.834
It adds value for you
because the social network

00:09:08.834 --> 00:09:11.834
where people are watching and
loading the pages 20 times a day

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:13.934
has information
about your applications.

00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:16.667
It adds value for, um,
for social network

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.100
because stuff that's
happening elsewhere is--

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.400
becomes part
of their world.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.734
And it adds value
for the people

00:09:21.734 --> 00:09:23.334
'cause they can
keep track of their friends.

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:25.167
So again, you know, you have
this ability to do this.

00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:26.734
You could abuse that
and fill it with noise,

00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:28.767
but if you do, you'll get
shut down fairly quickly.

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:30.634
So think about how
you can keep that

00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:32.434
in a way that adds value
to all three.

00:09:32.434 --> 00:09:33.934
Then the fourth thing
is messaging.

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:35.434
You can send messages
to people

00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:36.734
through the social network.

00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:39.200
Um, and this is--
this is, um, valuable

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.734
in that there is
a large group of people

00:09:41.734 --> 00:09:43.601
who have moved
from using email

00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:45.234
as their primary
messaging system

00:09:45.234 --> 00:09:46.901
to using social networks
for that.

00:09:46.901 --> 00:09:49.033
Because this--explicitly
because the social networks

00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:50.167
are whitelisted.

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:52.567
So if your application
has gained trust

00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:53.767
of both parties,

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:55.200
it can send messages
between them.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.634
And that--that makes that
more useful for them too.

00:09:57.634 --> 00:10:00.267
So the mod--the model here

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:04.033
is very much adding new
infrastructure to the web

00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:06.901
such that every application
you make can become social.

00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:08.601
Um, the other, think way
of looking at it

00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:09.901
is it's freeing you

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.434
from having to maintain
that database of users.

00:10:12.434 --> 00:10:14.100
One of the things
you often have to do

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.467
in doing web applications
is say,

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:16.834
"Okay, your user database.

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:18.868
I need to start collecting
this stuff."

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.067
And it's a sort of bunch
of extra make work

00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:22.367
you have to do
at the beginning

00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:24.334
before you can focus on
what you really want to build.

00:10:24.334 --> 00:10:26.834
So this means that you can
delegate that to other sites

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:30.434
and not worry about, um,
how that works.

00:10:30.434 --> 00:10:32.400
And that's--
that's a strong piece

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.334
of the, um, what
we're calling the...

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:38.801
um, open stack
of standard protocol

00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:40.501
that's for connecting
between sites.

00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:43.367
Um, there's--there's a set
of these,

00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:44.667
and I won't go
into every place--

00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:47.801
OpenID, OAuth,
and OpenSocial

00:10:47.801 --> 00:10:49.434
are the three
key ones to know about.

00:10:49.434 --> 00:10:52.467
OpenID means using
another site's URL

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:54.601
as a login instead
of an email address.

00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:57.734
OAuth means getting
authorization--

00:10:57.734 --> 00:10:59.000
letting you use
a grant permission

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.934
to access another site
in a standardized way.

00:11:01.934 --> 00:11:04.434
And then OpenSocial
is the specification

00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:06.834
that defines
what kind of data

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.634
you're exchanging
over these connections.

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:11.167
And also has the connection
to the gadget model

00:11:11.167 --> 00:11:13.167
so you can actually embed
an application

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:16.467
entirely inside
another site as well.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:17.567
Man: Great.

00:11:17.567 --> 00:11:18.767
- Kevin: Okay.
- Man: Nice job.

00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:20.601
Kevin: How long was that?
