00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.377
In fact, let's do a quiz on MOV Z

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:05.753
and MOV N performance when we do If conversions.

00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:08.990
So this is the original code. Let's say that

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.106
this branch here is 50% of the time taken. So

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:14.059
half of the time we end up doing this,

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.800
and half of the time we end up doing this.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.880
So we can say then that the if conversion

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.870
code works better, when the prediction accuracy is below, what?

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.860
Assuming a 30 instruction misprediction penalty for this branch, and assuming

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.740
of course that this branch is always perfectly predicted, because it's easy.
