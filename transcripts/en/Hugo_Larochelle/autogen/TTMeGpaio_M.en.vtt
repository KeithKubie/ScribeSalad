00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 in this capsule we will see the rule 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.270
 from the separations that will us 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.230
 to identify independence 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.120
 conditional then the rule of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.290
 separation it's a rule that is 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.710
 general that will allow us 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.720
 to identify any 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.930
 conditional independence of gender if 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.420
 I have a node x so we go there 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.269
 determine if these donors are 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
 independent and give a number of 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.980
 hours 10 hours until z 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 m any and died road that the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.309
 number of us on which I condition 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.170
 could be zero in any 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.660
 would condition on the empty set so 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.829
 we would condition on none would 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.559
 so checking a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.539
 normal independence and not come 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.640
 conditional dependence so the arrival 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.440
 separations that will allow us to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.539
 identify it these water independences 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.539
 in any case for any 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.390
 which network beziers and we see between 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.190
 other than that it is obvious that the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 three examples we saw a capsule 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.309
 previous ones are going to be cases 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.010
 finally that they are beautiful 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.880
 and well identified by the rule of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.939
 separation then the way that works 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.060
 this rule is that we are going to say that x 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.060
 va was dependent on y sacha z 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.650
 if all the paths not directed during 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.430
 days and I mean to all 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.750
 paths between nodes 2 x 2 y that do not 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.200
 do not necessarily respect the meaning 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.420
 arrows so xy my independence 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.729
 shopping and knowing did 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.450
 if all the paths not directed between aix 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:42.240
 and z are blocked by two nodes 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.030
 helpers and so we have to determine how 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.829
 what a path becomes blocked and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.979
 this part one that often not very 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.630
 intuitive among others the rule from here to 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.000
 which I ask you to wear a 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.549
 special attention but so we go 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.829
 say that a path is blocked if at least 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.140
 we will call end who will satisfy 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.110
 any of the following conditions 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.729
 the condition in the condition of 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.550
 so there must be an en 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.300
 be and 1 hour with arrow in 30 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.150
 followed by an outgoing arrow 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.990
 or who is an egg with two arrows 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.210
 outgoing which is such that n belongs to 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.380
 my set of variables z is so 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.610
 marked in fact that it's both 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.470
 first examples that we treated the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.230
 previous capsule where we have a big 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.260
 parent a parent who would be aisne then 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.840
 a child hockey and that's the second 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.320
 where we made a parent with two 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.050
 children 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.320
 here it's that kind of us there and in this 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.660
 case we have that the path is blocked if 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.550
 n is observed then in the same way 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.580
 in the previous capsules we saw that 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.250
 we did have dependence between 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.890
 e here an eye here where we read here or here 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.130
 if the parent in question were 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.310
 observed so that's the first rule 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.060
 are found a place that is satisfied that 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.430
 the path is stuck at this zero to and the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.640
 second possibility this is actually 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.290
 a place where we have two incoming arrows 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.200
 so that's the case where we stop two 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.720
 parents here who are pointing to the same 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.500
 child or between the child and the dance that 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.750
 if the new being stuck at n 6 n 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.820
 does not belong to the observed variable 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.950
 none of the descendants of m 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.410
 so it must not only she 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.670
 does not belong to all 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.080
 variables and teens up to zm who are 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.550
 observed but also all 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.160
 descendants of hatred do not have to 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.110
 hold this together they noticed 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.950
 that a particular case is still 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.510
 would only have 3 we got two by 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.300
 hour then a child and as in 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.970
 the example we saw and both parents 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.910
 are independent only if she 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.890
 does not belong to z and the subtlety or 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.840
 the more general aspect we add 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.400
 is that its a serious that more than 3 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.410
 knots it is also necessary that the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.700
 descendants of hatred do not belong 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.780
 to z who we look at some examples 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.200
 the application of the rule of 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.200
 separations 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.739
 first example in a new network 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.879
 bezian that we see here that is the kind 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.070
 network of beziers to make 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.690
 medical diagnosis 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.600
 so is the variable or the new 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.120
 age and gender are independent a priori 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.030
 so in this case it's the crucible of 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.710
 the empty set then what one has to 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.169
 to do is to identify all the paths 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.690
 in the hands not directed to angie 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:36.050
 gender and determine if they are blocked 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.470
 by a place on the way then a 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.760
 first path is the path that leaves 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:49.729
 hedge enters into smoking then so 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.650
 way here and there between gender because 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.479
 if the path is a single draw it is the no 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.180
 tuxedo which is an honor with two 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.770
 arrows in 30 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.910
 then is the path blocked 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:06.010
 know us there well since smoking here 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.840
 wages that are 15 hours and then 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.550
 calcium is long all hand so 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.770
 what do these four knots do there 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.310
 are not observed sadek belong 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.750
 not at all obviously aims 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.660
 actually this way is blocked 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.840
 so the first way the way that 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.669
 goes through smoking is stuck honor 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.979
 tuxedo which is a place with flash 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:32.539
 footprints and with two arrows hinders 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.460
 there is a second way the one that 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:39.470
 goes through total exposure 6 and who passes 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.410
 then by ken goes back to smoking and 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.940
 arrived gender in this case we still have 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.229
 once a wall with arrows to 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.050
 get into that if it's the knot 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:52.070
 cancer 'here only two arrows in train 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.900
 on the way and for the same reasons 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.620
 to say that nikon sony his descendants 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.970
 belong to the empty set which 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.520
 the set of variables observe so 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.430
 that no variables observed for these 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.610
 same reasons the beautiful honor 15h 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.889
 block their way this folder this 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.160
 second path exists no other 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.479
 way and gender and so we have him 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.640
 even showed that all paths are 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.350
 blocked and so the answer is that yes 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:26.490
 and I have gender are independent 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:28.230
 a priori second example we have been 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.180
 long color will know if his 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.920
 independence his luck mocking age and 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:40.800
 surround him here know if they are 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:44.190
 independent sacha smoking first 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.800
 way between h and the next day it's the 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.590
 path that we see here so that goes through 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.770
 tuxedo then who goes to canes on who 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.360
 happens above all but in this case 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.920
 can we block the path 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.100
 we can look at one hour 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.350
 tuxedo no smoking is a place that 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:06.750
 in arrow in 30 that an outgoing arrow 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:09.810
 so a big umbrella a child and 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.180
 tuxedos and observe and for this type of 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.950
 here we here the rule to block the 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.630
 way is that the hand must be 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:21.320
 observed so the path is well and truly 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:24.960
 second path block the one that goes through 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:28.620
 the one who goes through traffic explosion 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:32.220
 this cancer 'that happens are all going 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.710
 die then in this case we can 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.940
 to watch is it stuck to 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.870
 exposure of the toxic her naked breasts with 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:42.030
 incoming and outgoing flash 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:45.960
 actually here we have incoming arrow 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:47.370
 followed by an outgoing arrow and for the 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.380
 block it must be observed 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.910
 but expose all toxic it's not 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.040
 observed only tuxedo who 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.500
 then observed in the same way that a 

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.760
 only who is also a knot with arrow 

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:02.670
 get in flash coming out so answer is 

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.740
 managed to observe you soon as smoking 

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.420
 which is observed and therefore the path is 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.450
 no more stuck at cancer level ' 

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:11.340
 so because of that the way of the 

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.370
 second way is not blocked and 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:20.010
 so help and their moods are not 

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:23.820
 independent sacha tuxedo third and 

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:28.880
 last example is what exposure to 

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:32.300
 take 6 and tuxedos his independence h1 

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.300
 and joe 

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.580
 identify the paths so we have a 

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:45.020
 way first path that goes through edu 

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.970
 and then who came smoking like that so 

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.880
 here we can block the path only 

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.490
 at a place to edge it's an art with 

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.830
 two outgoing flashes and the queen we 

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.920
 says that to block this is there you have to 

00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:01.910
 that the north issue be observed edge 

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:05.660
 and eddy actually observed so the 

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:07.790
 blocked way second way then one 

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.520
 could reach smoking from a 

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:14.660
 exposed toxic through ken sure 

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:17.060
 like this and here now the name in 

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.690
 question her naked breasts with an arrow 

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.770
 in thirty-one others the cantor in 

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.720
 helping what if the rule applies 

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.150
 it is the judgment that says that the 

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.990
 node or his descendants is not 

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:31.910
 observed by cons so one does not go 

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:35.540
 block this way there because among these 

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:38.950
 descendants there is love to me so 

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:42.740
 it's a descendant of caine sisters here 

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:44.090
 but rumor him and observe so at 

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.480
 because of that we can not block their 

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:49.550
 way to this part of the because we do not 

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.250
 can not block it at 3 pm there is 

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.930
 no other no one in this way there the 

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.180
 way two years you exposed or toxic 

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.340
 and tuxedos and so because of that the 

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.770
 path must not block so one more 

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.810
 times here we only have exposure to toxic 

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:06.280
 and tuxedos are not independent 

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.280
 Sasha and slowly
