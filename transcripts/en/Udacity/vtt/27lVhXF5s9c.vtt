00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.440
One activity that helps people
warm up in the diverge stage

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.890
is the crazy eights.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.390
You give everyone a sheet of paper, and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.200
you ask them to fold it three times to
create eight different rectangles, then,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
in each rectangle,
you put one idea related to the product.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.640
Now, you only have five
minutes to do this activity.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.150
So you go as quickly as possible,
and you try and

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.040
push yourself to put something
in every single box.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.350
Now, this activity can be a little
bit intimidating to people who aren't

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.065
as designers.

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:29.545
So here are a few tips for
what you can do.

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:32.034
First, it's a good idea
to remind yourself and

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:34.685
the team about common UI elements.

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:39.215
Most UI components are very basic
shapes, like rectangles and circles.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:41.370
And they can be drawn pretty easily.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.530
You might remind your team of some of
those shapes, like list, and icons, and

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.180
buttons, and titles.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.130
You might also just spend a few
minutes looking at mobile patterns, so

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.840
that way you can check out
what others have done.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.770
You might also download free mobile or
web UI kits.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.130
So that way you can go through
some of those design components.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.510
Just be sure not to leave these
resources up during an activity,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.050
because the focus should
be on sketching ideas.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.820
All right, now it's your turn.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.660
Set a timer for five minutes and

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.985
sketch eight ideas you have that are
related to the Super Duper Shopping App.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:17.425
Now, keep in mind the activity
that you did with the Golden Path.

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:21.295
And remember that main user journey or
that story that you created.

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:24.825
Once you've completed this activity,
