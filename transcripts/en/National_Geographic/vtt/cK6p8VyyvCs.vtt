KATIE COURIC: As more
young people like David

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:05.133
hole up in their rooms
with their devices,

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.567
studies show a generation
delaying adulthood.

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:12.000
Fewer get driver's licenses,
have after school jobs,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.567
or date.

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:18.033
But most alarming, the suicide
rate for girls ages 15 to 19

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:22.300
doubled between 2007 and 2015.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.200
Dr. Larry Rosen, a
leading psychologist,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.567
is especially concerned
about what all this tech

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:30.867
is doing to developing brains.

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:34.667
LARRY ROSEN: We know what the
blue light does to their brain.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.333
Night after night, it leaves
these little molecules

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.934
called beta amyloids.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.600
And they build into plaques.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.633
And when they look at the
brains of Alzheimer's patients,

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.934
they have a lot of
plaque in their brains.

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:48.333
And I think that we're
heading toward a major problem

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.000
as these kids who
have been using phones

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.066
for the last 10
years start to get

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.533
into their 20s, 30s, and 40s.

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.533
And I think we're going
to start seeing a lot

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.066
of memory problems coming up.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:57.900
KATIE COURIC: Wow.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.266
That's pretty scary.

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.400
Tech is not only
affecting our brains.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.633
It's also affecting
our creativity.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.400
LARRY ROSEN: When you
are being creative

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.767
or your mind is wandering or
you're dreaming or daydreaming,

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:13.467
a different part of
your brain is activated.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:17.533
Part of what we're doing to
ourselves, as well as our kids,

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.133
is that we're not allowing
enough of that time.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.867
Because it's so easy to
just pull out your phone

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:23.834
and check the news or whatever.

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.834
It doesn't matter.

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:29.667
It stifles your ability
to live within boredom.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:32.200
And boredom is important,
because boredom then clicks

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
in the creative activities.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.200
We don't allow ourselves
to get bored anymore.
