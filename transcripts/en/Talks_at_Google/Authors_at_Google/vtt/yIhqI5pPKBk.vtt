SPEAKER 1: So, Colson Whitehead
is "The New York Times"

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.530
best-selling author
of "The Noble Hustle,"

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.016
"Zone One," "Sag Harbor,"
"The Intuitionist,"

00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:14.380
"John Henry Days,"
"Apex Hides the Hurt,"

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.400
and one collection of
essays, "The Colossus

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.030
of New York," a
Pulitzer Prize finalist

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.820
and a recipient of the MacArthur
and Guggenheim fellowships.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.070
He lives in New York City.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.310
And today we're so lucky to
have him in the Bay Area.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.127
We're getting him
on a great day,

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:30.710
as "The Underground
Railroad" was just

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.440
chosen to be on the long list
for the National Book Award

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.200
this year.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.810
So with that, please welcome
Colson Whitehead to Google.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.607
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:44.190
COLSON WHITEHEAD:
Thank you, kind sir.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.140
Thanks to y'all for coming out.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.420
The book is called "The
Underground Railroad."

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.860
I first had the idea for
it about 16 years ago.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.890
I was laying on my couch, as I
like to do in the afternoons,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.960
nursing a depression, and
came across a reference

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.700
to the Underground
Railroad and thought, oh,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.720
isn't it funny how
when you're a kid

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.770
and you first hear those
words, it's so evocative.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.140
You think it's a literal
railroad underground.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.720
And of course, you find out that
it's not, and you're quite sad.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.420
So that's a premise, not
much of a story there.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.060
So I kept thinking about it,
and I sort of added, well,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.240
what if each state
our protagonist

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.160
goes through-- South
Carolina, North Carolina--

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.640
is a different state of
American possibility,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.890
as in "Gulliver's Travels,"
sort of a natural comparison.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.620
And that was the story.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.190
And I didn't feel up to
writing it 16 years ago.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.350
I didn't feel ready.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.780
I sort of assumed I
would screw it up.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.600
But if I put it off and maybe
tried again later with a few

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.910
more books under my belt,
a little more mature,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.640
it might actually turn out OK.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.530
So each time I finished a
book, I would go to my notes

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.009
and try to figure
out if I was ready.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.950
And the answer was
would always be no,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.410
until about 2 1/2 years ago.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.650
I had an idea for a book
that was all ready to go.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.380
I had sold it to my editor.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.400
And I decided to tell my wife
about this Underground Railroad

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.510
idea and see what she thought.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.220
And she said, I
don't want to say

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.070
that your idea about a
Brooklyn writer going

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.590
through a mid-life
crisis is dumb per se,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.340
but this Underground Railroad
book sounds really good.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.880
So that was one person.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.540
And then I went to my agent,
who I've been with for 18 years

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.720
through thick and thin, and
I told her about the idea.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.370
And she said, well,
both ideas sound good,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.060
which is not very helpful.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.030
But then she emailed
me two days later,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.152
which she never
does, and said, I've

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:06.110
been think about the
Underground Railroad idea,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.440
and maybe you should pursue it.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.510
So that was two people.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.190
I went to my shrink,
told her the idea.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.524
And she was like,
what are you, crazy?

00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:15.940
I mean, we both
know you're crazy,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.640
but I think this Underground
Railroad story is up

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.520
your alley.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.960
And so I went to
my editor, to whom

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.610
I'd already sold that book
about the writer going

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.740
through a mid-life crisis,
and he responded with,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.796
giddy up, motherfucker,
which is publishing for,

00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:36.920
I think that's a good idea.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.350
You should pursue it.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.750
So I did.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.940
The story is about Cora, a young
girl in a plantation in Georgia

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.930
running North.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.750
In this first section I'll read,
she's on her home plantations.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.240
She's a stray, an orphan, in
the parlance of the plantation.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.940
Her mother has run
off years before,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.920
and she has no relatives.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.720
She's about 16 or 17.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.610
She's not entirely sure
because slave masters

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.690
didn't keep track of
their slaves' ages,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.500
in the same way you might
know that your dog Scruffy is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.769
eight years old and not
know his exact birthday.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.800
There's a man named
Caesar, who's come,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.160
a new slave on the plantation.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.690
He was raised in Virginia
on a small family farm

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.540
and was promised that when his
master died, he would be freed.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.190
Unfortunately, is master's
niece had other plans and sort

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.610
of liquidated him and his
parents along with the rest

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.580
of her aunt's possessions.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.880
And he's sold down South,
which is always terrible

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.850
because the South is-- that the
slave system is more and more

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.530
brutal the more south you go.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.650
So he's come to this
plantation where Cora is.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.660
It's owned by the two Randall
brothers, James and Terrance.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.180
And this section,
it's the birthday

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.880
of a man named Old Jockey, the
oldest slave on the plantation.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.360
And whenever he
senses that there's

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.400
a need for a pick-me-up
on the plantation,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.960
things are getting bad and
people need to release,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.891
he says it's my
birthday, and they

00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:23.140
have a birthday feast for him.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.320
And it could be once a
year, twice a year, but they

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.310
have a big celebration
and they have dancing.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.760
And the last person
to introduce is

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.370
a kid named Chester, who's a
10-year-old and has no family,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.116
and Cora has sort of
taken him under her wing.

00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:41.700
"The music stopped.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.480
The circle broke.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.690
Sometimes a slave will be lost
in a brief eddy of liberation,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.190
in a sway of a sudden
reverie among the furrows

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.090
or while untangling the
mysteries of an early morning

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.130
dream, in the middle of a
song, on a warm Sunday night.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.970
Then it comes always,
the overseer's cry,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.800
the call to work, the
shadow of the master,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.930
the reminder that she's only
human being for a tiny moment

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.410
across the eternity
of her servitude.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.400
The Randall brothers had
emerged from the great house

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.870
and were among them.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.420
The slaves stepped aside,
making calculations

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.220
of what distance represented
the right proportion of fear

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.680
and respect.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.670
Godfrey, James's house
boy, held up a lantern.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.020
According to Old
Jockey, James' favored

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.390
the mother, stout
as a barrel and just

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.320
as firm in countenance.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.250
And Terrance took after the
father, tall and owl-faced,

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.670
perpetually on the verge
of swooping down on prey.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.580
In addition to the
land, they inherited

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.800
their father's tailor,
who arrived once

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.530
a month in a rickety carriage
with his samples of linen

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.107
and cotton.

00:06:52.107 --> 00:06:54.190
The brothers dressed alike
when they were children

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.910
and continue to do
so into manhood.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.580
Their white trousers
were as clean

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.870
as the laundry girls'
hands could make them,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.580
and the orange lantern glow
made them look like ghosts

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.090
emerging from the dark.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.920
'Master James,' Jockey said,
his good hand gripped the arm

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.056
of his chair as if to
rise, but he did not stir.

00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:19.675
'Master Terrance.' 'Don't let
us disturb you,' Terrance said.

00:07:19.675 --> 00:07:21.900
'My brother and I were
discussing business and heard

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.930
the music.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.540
I told him, now that is the
most god-awful racket I've ever

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.760
heard.'

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.230
The Randalls were drinking wine
out of goblets of cut glass

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.820
and looked as if they'd
drained a few bottles.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.500
Cora searched for Caesar's
face in the crowd.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.620
She did not find him.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.140
He hadn't been
present the last time

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.740
the brothers appeared
together on the northern half.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.690
You did well to remember
the different lessons

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.174
of those occasions.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.340
Something always happened
when the Randalls ventured

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.460
into the quarter,
sooner or later,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.960
a new thing coming
that you couldn't

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.910
predict until it was upon you.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.670
James left the daily
operations to his man Connolly

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.430
and rarely visited.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.940
He might grant a
tour to a visitor,

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.240
a distinguished neighbor,
or a curious planter

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.570
from another neck of the
woods, but it was rare.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.890
James rarely
addressed his niggers,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.430
who'd been taught by
the lash to keep working

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.540
and ignore his presence.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.070
When Terrance appeared on
his brother's plantation,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.720
he usually appraised each
slave and made a note

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.870
of which men were
most able and which

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.700
women were most appealing.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.840
Content to leer at
his brother's women,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.100
he grazed heartily upon
the women of his own half.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.360
'I like to taste my
plums,' Terrance said,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.600
prowling the rows of cabins
to see what struck his fancy.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.890
He violated the
bonds of affection,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.370
sometimes visiting slaves
on their wedding night

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.430
to show the husband
the proper way

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.040
to discharge his marital duty.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.810
He tasted his plums and broke
the skin and left his mark.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.880
It was accepted that James was
of a different orientation.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.225
To hear his valet
Prideful tell it,

00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:03.860
James confined his erotic
energies to specialized rooms

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.730
in a New Orleans establishment.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.720
The madam was
broad-minded and modern,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.340
adept in the trajectories
of human desire.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.670
Prideful's stories were hard
to believe, despite assurances

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.410
that he received his reports
from the staff of the place,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.430
with whom he'd grown
close over the years.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.850
After all, what
kind of white man

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.990
would willingly
submit to the whip?

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.310
Terrance scratched
his cane in the dirt.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.060
It'd been his
father's cane, topped

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.630
with a silver wolf's head.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.570
Many remembered its
bite on their flesh.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.060
Terrance said,
'then I recollected

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.730
James telling me about a
nigger he had down here

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.960
could recite the
Declaration of Independence.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.530
I can't bring myself
to believe him.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.070
I thought perhaps
tonight he can show me,

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.736
since everyone is out and
about, from the sound of it.'

00:09:57.736 --> 00:10:00.535
'We'll settle it,'
his brother said.

00:10:00.535 --> 00:10:05.440
'Where is that boy Michael?'
No one said anything.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.060
Godfrey waved the lantern
around pathetically.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.360
Moses was the boss
unfortunate enough

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.870
to stand closest to
the Randall brothers.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:18.410
He cleared his throat,
'Michael dead, Master James.'

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.410
Michael, the slave in
question, had indeed

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.240
possessed the ability
to recite long passages.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.740
According to Connolly, who
heard the story from the nigger

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.080
trader, Michael's former
master was fascinated

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.770
by the abilities of
South American parrots,

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.100
and reasoned that if a bird
could be taught limericks,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.780
a slave might be taught
to remember as well.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.260
Merely glancing at
the size of the skulls

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.860
told you that a nigger possessed
a bigger brain than a bird.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.580
Michael had been the son
of his master's coachman,

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.510
had a brand of animal
cleverness, the kind

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.900
you see in pigs sometimes.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.880
The master and
his unlikely pupil

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.520
started with simple
rhymes and short passages

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.870
from popular British versifiers.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.670
They went slow over the words
the nigger didn't understand

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.360
and, if truth be told, the
master only half understood.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.170
But they made miracles,
the tobacco farmer

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.070
and the coachman's son.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.720
The Declaration of Independence
was their masterpiece.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.470
Michael's ability never amounted
to more than a parlor trick,

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.450
delighting visitors before
the discussion turned,

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.310
as it always did, to
the diminished faculties

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.750
of niggers.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.220
His owner grew bored
and sold the boy South.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.150
By the time Michael
got to Randall,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.510
some torture or punishment
had addled his senses.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.920
He was a mediocre worker.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.050
He complained of
noises and black spells

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.400
that obscured his memory.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.640
In exasperation,
Connolly beat out

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.700
what little brains he had left.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.840
It was a scourging that Michael
was not intended to survive,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.130
and it achieved its purpose.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:12:00.640
James said, 'I should have been
told,' his displeasure plain.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.220
Michael's recitation had been
a novel diversion the two times

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.250
he trotted the nigger
out for guests.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.870
Terrance liked to
tease his brother.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.990
'James,' he said, 'you
need to keep better account

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:16.670
of your property.'
'Don't meddle.'

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.470
Terence continued,
'I knew you let

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.660
your slaves have their
revels, but I had no idea

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.230
they were so extravagant.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.480
Are you trying to make me look
bad?' 'Don't pretend you care

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.060
what a nigger thinks about you,
Terrance.' James' glass was

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.670
empty.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.770
He turned to go.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.180
'Oh, one more song, brother.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.880
These sounds have grown
on me,' Terrance said.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.150
George and Wesley, the
musicians, were forlorn.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.110
Noble and his tambourine
were nowhere to be seen.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.120
James pressed his
lips into a slit.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.810
He gestured, and the
men started playing.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.300
Terrance tapped his cane.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.620
His face sank as he
took in the crowd.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.490
'You're not going to dance?

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.010
I have to insist--
you and you and you.'

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.960
They didn't wait for
their master's signal.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.610
The slaves of the northern
half converged on the alley

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.330
haltingly, trying to
insinuate themselves

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.910
into their previous
rhythm and put on a show.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.130
Putting on a show for
master was a familiar skill,

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.990
the small angles and
advantages of the mask.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.690
And they shook off
their fear as they

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.580
settled into the performance.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.500
Oh, how they capered and
hollered, shouted and hopped.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.820
Certainly, this was the most
lively song they'd ever heard.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.850
The musicians, the most
accomplished players

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.490
the colored race had to offer.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.710
Cora dragged herself
into the circle,

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.940
checking the Randall brothers'
reactions on every turn,

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.880
like everyone else.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.670
Jockey tumbled his hands
in his lap to keep time.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.540
Cora found Caesar's face.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.380
He stood in the shadow of the
kitchen, his expression flat.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.180
Then he withdrew.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:01.630
'You.' It was Terrance.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.280
He held his hand
before him as if it

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.640
were covered in some eternal
stain that only he could see.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.170
Then Cora caught sight of
it, the single drop of wine,

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.580
staining the cuff of
his lovely white shirt.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.220
Chester, the boy,
had bumped him.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.490
Chester simpered and bowed
before the white man,

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.360
'Sorry, Master.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.820
Sorry, Master.' The cane crashed
across his shoulder and head

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.570
again and again.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.870
The boy screamed and
shrank to the dirt,

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.400
as the blows continued.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.540
Terrance's arm rose and fell.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.310
James looked tired.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.720
One drop.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.660
A feeling settled over Cora.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.220
She'd not been under
its spell in years,

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.270
ever since she brought
the hatchet down

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.040
on Blake's doghouse and sent
the splinters into the air.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.070
She'd seen men hung from
trees and left for buzzards

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:58.230
and crows, women carved up
open to the bones with the cat

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.600
o'nine tails, feet cut
off to prevent escape

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.450
and hands cut off to stop theft.

00:15:06.116 --> 00:15:07.490
She'd seen boys
and girls younger

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.990
than this beaten that
had done nothing.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.570
This night, the feeling
settled on her heart again.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.900
It grabbed hold of her.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.650
And before the slave
part of her caught up

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.640
with the human part of her, she
was bent over the boy's body

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.560
as a shield.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.700
She held the cane in her hand,
like a swamp man handling

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.560
a snake, and saw the
ornament at its tip.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.350
The silver wolf bared
its silver teeth.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.910
Then the cane was
out of her hand.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.760
It came down on her head.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.705
It crashed down again.

00:15:36.705 --> 00:15:40.070
And this time, the silver
tooth ripped across her eyes,

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.439
and her blood
splattered the dirt."

00:15:44.439 --> 00:15:46.730
This next a brief reading is
about a woman named Ethel.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.210
[INAUDIBLE] escaped a
plantation and moves

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.270
to South Carolina
and North Carolina.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:58.300
In North Carolina, in
this alternative history

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.040
of that state, the
government has come up

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.870
with a final solution to solve
the problem of the Negro, which

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.000
is to abolish Negroes.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.250
And if you're caught in the
street, you can be killed,

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:11.749
lynched.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.750
The people doing the work
of the slaves, because there

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.990
are no slaves now,
are Irish immigrants,

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.970
who are taking over the work
and will become assimilate

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:27.890
into American society.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.390
Martin is a reluctant
abolitionist.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.807
His father worked in
Underground Railroad.

00:16:39.807 --> 00:16:42.390
And one day, when he was putting
his father's affairs in order

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.000
after his father dies,
he gets a message

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.390
that there's someone
waiting in the railroad.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.440
And that's how he discovers that
his father is an abolitionist,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.640
and he ends up being
an accidental conductor

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.670
on the Underground Railroad.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.090
His wife Ethel is
even more reluctant,

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.560
and this is her story.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.150
And it ends with Cora
hiding in their attic

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.950
because she can't
get a passage out

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.939
of North Carolina for a while.

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:17.230
"Ever since she saw a woodcut
of a missionary surrounded

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.490
by jungle natives,
Ethel thought it

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.859
would be spiritually
fulfilling to serve

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.079
the Lord in dark Africa,
delivering savages

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.594
to the light.

00:17:27.594 --> 00:17:29.010
She dreamed of the
ship that would

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:33.050
take her, a magnificent schooner
with sails like angel wings,

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.610
cutting across the violent
sea, the perilous journey

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.920
into the interior, up rivers,
wending mountain passes,

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.520
and the dangers escaped-- lions,
serpents, man-killing plants,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.620
duplicitous guides--
and then the village,

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.850
where the natives receive her
as an emissary of the Lord,

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.740
an instrument of civilization.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.520
In gratitude, the niggers
lift her to the sky,

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.770
praising her name--
Ethel, Ethel.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.150
She was eight years old.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.040
Her father's
newspapers contained

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.459
tales of explorers, unknown
lands, pygmy peoples.

00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:14.750
The nearest she could get to
the image in the newspaper

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.000
was playing "missionary
and native" with Jasmine.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.540
Jasmine was like
a sister to her.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.050
The game never lasted
long before they switched

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.860
to the game of "husband
and wife," practicing

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.670
kisses and arguments in the
cellar of Ethel's house.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.270
Given the color of
their skins, there

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.530
was never any doubt
over the roles

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.820
in either game, Ethel's habit
of rubbing soot into her face,

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.870
not withstanding.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.620
Her face blackened, she
practiced expressions

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.990
of amazement and wonder
in front of the mirror

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.830
so that she'd know
what to expect

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.020
when she met her heathens.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.610
Jasmine lived in the upstairs
room with her mother Felice.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.440
The Delaney family
owned Felice's mother.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.620
And when Edgar
Delaney turned 10,

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.730
he received Felice as a present.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.250
Now that he was a
man, Edgar Delaney

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.540
recognized that
Felice was a miracle,

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.830
tending to the
affairs of her house

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.960
as if she were born to it.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.310
He recounted her darky wisdom
as a matter of routine,

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.460
sharing her parables
about human nature

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.940
with guests whenever she
disappeared into the kitchen.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.210
So that when she
returned, their faces

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.770
glowed with affection
and jealousy.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.850
He gave her passes to visit
the Parker plantation every New

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:35.290
Year's Day feast.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.010
Felice's sister was
a washerwoman there.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.310
Jasmine was born nine
months after one such visit,

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.730
and now the Delaneys
owned two slaves.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.610
Ethel thought that a slave was
someone who lived in your house

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.120
like family but was not family.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.500
Her father explained
the origin of the Negro

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.930
to disabuse her of
this colorful idea.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.720
Some maintained
that the Negro was

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.450
a remnant of a race
of giants who ruled

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.350
the earth in an ancient time.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.530
But Edgar Delaney knew
that there were descendants

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.970
of cursed black Ham,
who had survived

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.970
the flood by clinging to the
peaks of a mountain in Africa."

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.940
This was actually a real
belief of racists in the 1830s.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.634
It's crazy.

00:20:25.815 --> 00:20:28.180
"Ethel thought that
if they were cursed,

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.500
they required Christian
guidance all the more.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.840
On her eighth birthday,
Ethel's father

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.730
forbid her to play
with Jasmine so as not

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.110
to pervert the natural state
of relations between the races.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.200
Ethel did not make
friends easily, even then.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.670
She sobbed and stomped for days.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.850
Jasmine was more adaptable.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.410
Jasmine assumed simple
duties around the household

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.260
and took over her
mother's position

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:58.530
when Felice's heart seized and
she fell mute and paralyzed.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.480
Felice lingered for months,
her mouth open and pink,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.590
eyes foggy until Ethel's
father had her removed.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:10.530
Ethel observed no disturbance
in her old playmate's face

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.650
when they loaded her
mother into the cart.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:17.580
By then, the two did not speak
outside of household matters.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.830
The house had been
built 50 years before,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.100
and the stairs creaked.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.250
A whisper in one room carried
over into the next two.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.370
Most nights after
supper and prayers,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.020
Ethel heard her father going
up the crooked stairs, guided

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.740
by the bobbing
light of his candle.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.000
Sometimes she sneaked
to her bedroom door

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.390
and caught a glimpse of
his white bed clothes

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.810
disappearing around the corner.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.270
'Where are you going,
father?' she asked one night.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.310
Felice had been gone two years.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.180
Jasmine was 14.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.610
'Going upstairs,' he said.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.260
And both experienced
a strange relief now

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.470
that they had a term for
his nocturnal visits.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.890
He was going upstairs.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.380
Where else did the stairs lead?

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.970
Her father had given
one explanation

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.820
for the separation of races
and fratricidal punishments.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.230
His nighttime trips
elaborated on the arrangement.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.480
Whites lived downstairs,
and blacks lived upstairs.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:19.030
And to bridge that separation
was to heal a biblical wound.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.640
Her mother had
held a low opinion

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.250
about her husband going upstairs
but was not without resources.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.740
When her family sold
Jasmine to the coopersmith

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.200
on the other side of town, Ethel
knew it was her mother's doing.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.900
There was no more going upstairs
when the new slave took up

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.720
residence.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.600
Nancy was a grandmother, slow
in her steps and half blind.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.710
Now it was her wheezing that
penetrated the walls, not

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.440
footsteps and squeals.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.600
The house had not been so
orderly and clean since Felice.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.700
Jasmine had been
efficient but distracted.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.380
Jasmine's new home was across
the way in colored town.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.020
Everyone whispered that the
child had his father's eyes.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.010
One day over lunch,
Ethel announced

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.880
that when she was
old enough, she

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.550
intended to spread the Christian
word to African primitives.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.060
Her parents scoffed.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.430
It was not something that good
young women from Virginia did.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:18.510
'If you want to help savages,'
her father said, 'teach school.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.340
The brain of a five-year-old
is more savage and unruly than

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.930
the oldest jungle
darky,' he said.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.310
Her course was set.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.220
Ethel filled in for
the regular teacher

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.330
when she was under the weather.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.990
Little white children were
primitive in their own way,

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.860
chirping and undeveloped,
but it wasn't the same.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.860
Her thoughts of the jungle
and a ring of dark admirers

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.590
remained in her
private preserve.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.260
Resentment was the hinge
of her personality.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.460
The young women in her
circle comported themselves

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.110
in a foreign ritual
undecipherable.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.320
She had little use for
boys and later men.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.150
When Martin appeared,
introduced by one of her cousins

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.700
who worked at the
shipping company,

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.780
she tired of the gossip
and long relinquished

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.560
an interest in happiness.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.380
A panting badger,
Martin wore her down.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.160
The game of husband and
wife was even less fun

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.430
than she supposed.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.610
Jane, her daughter,
at least, turned out

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.820
to be an unexpected mercy,
a tidy bouquet in her arms.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.620
Over the years, life
on Orchard Street

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.430
passed into a tedium
that eventually

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.490
congealed into comfort.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.500
She pretended not to see Jasmine
when they passed on the street,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.320
especially when
her former playmate

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.710
was in the company of her son.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.260
His face was a dark mirror.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.090
Then Martin was summoned
to North Carolina.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.800
He arranged his father's funeral
on the hottest day of the year.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.770
They thought Ethel fainted
from sadness, when it was just

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.840
the barbaric humidity.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.720
Once they got a taker for
his father's feed shop,

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.220
they were done, he assured her.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.870
The place was backward.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.360
If it wasn't the heat,
it was the flies,

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.040
if not the mice,
then the people.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.940
At least in Virginia
lynch mobs maintained

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.020
a pretext of spontaneity.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.120
They didn't string
up people practically

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.580
in your front lawn the same
time every week, like church.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.670
North Carolina was to
be a brief interlude,

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.690
or so she thought, until
she came across the nigger

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.600
in her kitchen.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.200
George had dropped out of
the attic for some food,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.720
the lone slave Martin
helped before Cora arrived.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.140
It was a week before the
race laws went to effect,

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.200
and violence against
the colored population

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.230
was on the rise in rehearsal.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.050
A note on their doorstep
had directed Martin

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.940
to the mica mine,
where the railroad is,

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.210
and George waited for
him, hungry and irritated.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:49.290
The tobacco picker thumped
around the attic for a week

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.250
before a railroad agent
took him on the next leg,

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.360
boxing him up in a crate
and shoving the thing

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.590
through the front door.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.050
Ethel was livid,
then despairing.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.450
George acted as Martin's
father's executor,

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:07.770
illuminating Martin's
secret inheritance.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.600
Slavery is a moral issue
and never interested Ethel.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.380
If God has not meant for
Africans to be enslaved,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.210
they wouldn't be in chains.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.660
She did, however,
have firm ideas

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.660
about not getting killed
for other people's

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.530
high-minded ideas.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.910
She and Martin argued over
the Underground Railroad

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.010
as they hadn't argued
in a long time.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.250
And that was before
the murderous fineprint

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.580
and the race laws
manifested itself.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.390
Through Cora, that
termite in the attic,

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.710
Martin's father reached
from beyond the grave

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:43.790
to punish her for her joke
those many years before.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.950
When Martin went upstairs
to help the girl,

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.210
it was not in the same way
her father had gone upstairs.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.740
But both men came
down transformed.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.810
They reached across the biblical
rift for a selfish purpose.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.800
And if they could, why not her?

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.500
Everything had been denied Ethel
her whole life-- to mission,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.440
to help, to give love
in the way she wanted.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.160
When the girl got
sick, the moment Ethel

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.350
awaited for so long
had finally arrived.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.170
Ethel went upstairs,
as her father

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.110
had done, to confront the
stranger who lived in her house

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.650
as family.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.830
The girl lay on the sheets,
curved like a primeval river.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.460
She cleaned the girl,
washing her filth from her.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.980
She kissed the girl on
her forehead and neck

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.480
in her restless slumber, with
two kinds of feeling mixed up

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.760
in those kisses.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.800
She gave her the
holy word, a savage

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.160
to call her own at last."

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.094
Thank you.

00:27:45.094 --> 00:27:49.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.070
So are there any questions?

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.850
SPEAKER 1: In 2012, you came
out with "11 Rules for Writing."

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.100
"Rule number two-- don't
go searching for a subject.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.970
Let your subject find you."

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.720
You touched on this briefly,
but how did "The Underground

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.212
Railroad" keep finding you?

00:28:06.212 --> 00:28:07.920
COLSON WHITEHEAD:
Well, I think, I really

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.690
thought 16 years ago
that was a good idea

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.600
and wanted to do justice to it.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.874
And every couple years
when I took out my notes,

00:28:14.874 --> 00:28:16.790
I would realize that I
was not up to the task.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.800
That list of writing
tips is sort of

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.920
like a joke on the
sort of cliches

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.990
you hear in writing class.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:32.530
But they contain a kernel of
truth, like a lot of cliches.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.380
But I often tell my
students something

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.950
that I didn't remember
to apply to myself, which

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:46.870
is that if a story sounds
scary or too challenging

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.830
and beyond the scope
of your powers,

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.900
maybe that's the story
you should be writing.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.640
Don't write the safe one
that you know you can do.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.660
Write the story that
scares you shitless

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.032
and the one you don't
know you can do.

00:29:00.032 --> 00:29:01.740
So I think that finally
brought me around

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:07.062
to tackle this 2
and 1/2 years ago.

00:29:07.062 --> 00:29:08.770
SPEAKER 1: And so I
can't help but think,

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.770
so you're a New York author.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.260
"The Underground
Railroad," you're

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.409
taking it from a metaphor to
being this very physical thing.

00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:16.950
Did you think about
New York when you

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.290
were writing this book at all?

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.790
COLSON WHITEHEAD:
Well, probably not

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.390
when I first heard of
it in fourth grade.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.280
I envisioned like
a subway tunnel.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.910
And there is one
station in the book.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.870
She goes through different
states and a couple

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.180
of different stations.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.090
So some of them are very simple.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:39.810
Some of them are hacked out
of the rock and very dim.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.990
And then there's one that
is basically a New York

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.210
subway, with the
white subway tile

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.300
and could pass for a
station in New York.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:54.460
So I've used the train as a
metaphor in my book "John Henry

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.160
Days," and the
elevator is a metaphor

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.880
in both "The
Intuitionist," which

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.320
is about elevator inspectors,
and that was actually

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.620
informed by being a New Yorker.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.120
I'm not sure how
the rules are here.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.390
But in New York, there's a
little sheet in the elevator,

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.230
and each year, the elevator
inspector signs his name,

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.580
and he comes around and
same signature, same person,

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.770
but different ink.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.060
You go to school or work,
and they come and have

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.680
inspected your elevator.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.775
So if you go to your
friend's house, the same guy.

00:30:26.775 --> 00:30:29.050
It's like they have
beats, like cops.

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:33.452
So I thought, what if
an elevator inspector

00:30:33.452 --> 00:30:34.660
had to solve a criminal case?

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.360
And so both that
book and this book

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.480
are partially inspired
by living in New York

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.750
and spending a lot of time in
elevators and trains, I guess.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.230
SPEAKER 1: So we have one
question from the Dory.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.430
Courtney wants to thank
you for being here.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.150
She wants to know
how you decided

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.970
to have a female
protagonist tell the story?

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.850
The intersectionality between
gender and race during slavery

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.580
was incredibly complex.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.290
What was more compelling to you
about the story a woman would

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.200
tell from this time
as opposed to a man?

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.700
COLSON WHITEHEAD:
Yeah, I always try

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.830
to mix it up from book to book.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:14.870
So my book for this one
was basically a humor

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.740
book about the World
Series of Poker

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.070
and was crammed with jokes.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.830
And this one has no jokes,
and I was definitely reining

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.690
in my more satirical impulses.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:29.590
So keep that in mind-- my
last three protagonists

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.660
were men who were
very meditative

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.950
and break that cycle.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.680
I think was important to have
someone who is not like that.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:48.980
And then you write about the
intersectionality in slavery.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.890
When you're a woman,
when you hit puberty,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.500
you're expected to produce.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.840
And that means producing babies
because more babies means

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.380
more hands to pick cotton.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.210
More cot means more money
and more babies to sell.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.880
And your body's not your own.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.590
You're prey to the desires
of your master, other slaves.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.370
There's no law on
the plantation,

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:19.960
except what exists according
to the whims of your owner.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:26.370
So that was going to make
it a more complicated story

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:27.860
and a challenge.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:33.150
And also, I haven't explored
a mother-daughter relationship

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.390
before in fiction.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.270
And that's definitely
part of what drives

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.280
Cora to leave the plantation.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.100
So I'm always trying
to try new things

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:49.110
and also create
challenges for myself.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:53.280
And having a female protagonist
in this book was one.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.220
And people say, is it hard?

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.440
All characters are hard
if they're believable.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.330
They take a lot out
of you to make them

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.590
live and breathe on the page.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.530
So I wouldn't say it was
more hard than having

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.490
a male protagonist.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:10.760
If you're doing your job,
it should be difficult.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.360
And if you do your
job, your protagonist

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.290
should be credible, whether
they're male or female.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.880
So thanks for the question.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.920
AUDIENCE: You've talked about
how it took you about 16 years

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.050
to write the book because
you weren't ready.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:28.460
Can you talk a little bit more
about how it affected you,

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.110
how you had to grow
up or grow in some way

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.480
to be able to tell the story?

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.438
COLSON WHITEHEAD: Sure.

00:33:34.438 --> 00:33:37.980
Well, I think, just
as a writer, I'm

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.730
always figuring out how
do things differently.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.500
I think if you stick at
something for awhile,

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.970
hopefully you
become better at it.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.800
So hopefully, I'm
a better writer

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.400
after a few books than
I was at the beginning.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.930
So if I had written this
book maybe 5 or 10 years ago,

00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:00.050
the different islands
would have taken place

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.460
with the fantastic effects
really sort of cranked up.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.330
And I think, initially,
the South Carolina chapter

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.960
took place in the future.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:14.310
The Tennessee chapter, which
has been ravaged by yellow fever

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:18.600
and wildfires, was
even taking place

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.600
in a more fantastic
wasteland, a sort

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.150
of post-apocalyptic wasteland.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.380
And so instead of having
in rooted in 1850,

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.989
each time she got
in the train, she

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:32.210
was transported to a
different era as well.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:37.600
And it just seemed that kind
of broad, fabulist gesture

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.639
didn't serve the story.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:45.909
So by keeping it in
the idiom of 1850

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:50.340
and keeping it wedded
to Cora's point of view

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:59.000
and not deforming reality as
much as I initially planned,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.570
worked out.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.111
And that was the
value of waiting, so

00:35:01.111 --> 00:35:06.610
waiting until I was capable
skill wise to pull it off.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.640
And then I was 30 when
I had the idea, a sort

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.020
of jerky, Gen-X-y, douche bag.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.770
I hung out late every night.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.340
And I don't think I
had the sort of empathy

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.660
to animate a story like this.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.440
It's one thing to contemplate
the horror of slavery

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.930
and think about what it's
like to see your parent stolen

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.380
from you, whipped
in front of you,

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.180
assaulted, seeing
your brother sold off,

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.640
your little brother sold
off to another plantation.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.320
I think being a
parent allowed me

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.630
to access the
complexities of slavery

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:50.710
in a way I couldn't when I
was a callow 30-something.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:59.120
So I couldn't imagine seeing
my kids assaulted and sold off.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.807
I can appreciate the magnitude
of the horror now in a way

00:36:02.807 --> 00:36:03.890
that I couldn't back then.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:11.770
So I think I knew when I
was ready, and I did it.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:17.140
And it took a bunch
years for me to have

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.180
a different perspective
on life and work

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.320
in order to pull it off.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.420
SPEAKER 1: So the
"LA review of Books,"

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.320
in their latest review of
"The Underground Railroad,"

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.720
they called your perspective
"fundamentally ironic."

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.350
One, do you agree,
and how would you

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.075
balance that with the
historical traumas of the time?

00:36:36.075 --> 00:36:37.450
COLSON WHITEHEAD:
No, but I mean,

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:43.480
definitely irony and satire
are big forces in my work.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.100
So I think like everybody,
I have different parts

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.080
of my personality.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.120
Sometimes I'm optimistic,
and sometimes I'm

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.600
more pessimistic or realistic.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.310
And definitely in
the last couple books

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.990
I've been toggling between
those two different parts

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:59.070
of my personality.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.182
"Sag Harbor" is a
very optimistic book

00:37:02.182 --> 00:37:03.640
about a kid growing
up in the '80s,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:08.290
and I followed up with a
book called "Zone One."

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.890
That was about 99% of
the population dying off.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.800
And I think they
address different parts

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.660
of my personality
in different ways.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.870
"The Noble Hustle," my previous
book before this one was,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.690
was a jokey book about poker
and just a lot of jokes

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.610
and stupid humor in it.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.922
And that's one part of me.

00:37:25.922 --> 00:37:27.880
And then this book, "The
Underground Railroad,"

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:34.170
has no jokes in it.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.280
It's quite bleak.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.490
And so I think
like everyone else,

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:43.230
I have these different
trajectories in my personality.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:48.710
I guess I'm developing a theory
about irony-- white irony

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.070
versus black irony.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:55.730
I think white irony--
so much protesting this.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.130
But white irony
is about realizing

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:02.530
that society's systems don't
work and are broken down,

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.810
and you're addressing that.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.860
And I think black irony
is about realizing

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:12.800
the world systems don't
work, and they were never

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.130
meant to work for you anyway.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:19.290
So there's an additional
sort of facet to it.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:25.870
So definitely, in my
more satirical work,

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:30.352
I am sort of mining black
irony to animate the stories.

00:38:30.352 --> 00:38:31.810
And I think that's
definitely there

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:35.000
in "Zone One" and "The
Intuitionist" and "John Henry

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.659
Days."

00:38:35.659 --> 00:38:36.450
Is it in this book?

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:37.510
I'm not really sure.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.570
And I think it's
pretty straight faced.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.050
AUDIENCE: What's next?

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:45.080
COLSON WHITEHEAD: What's next?

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:50.840
I think it's going to be a
novel set in 1960s Harlem.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.430
I'm always trying to write about
New York in a contemporary way,

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:58.020
but I keep failing.
"The Intuitionist"

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.530
takes place in an
alternative New York,

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:02.310
an alternative 20th century.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:05.819
"Zone One" takes place
in a Utopian New York.

00:39:05.819 --> 00:39:07.860
Everyone is dead, except
for the main characters.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.110
They don't have to worry
about lines at Whole Foods

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.190
or waiting for a cab.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.070
And then I was trying
to write this story

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.736
about a broken writer
that I was talking

00:39:15.736 --> 00:39:18.159
about at the top of the hour.

00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:18.950
But it didn't work.

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:20.880
I ended up abandoning
it for this.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.250
So this book seems safe.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:26.390
It takes place in the '60s,
not contemporary New York.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:30.910
And when I'm done promoting
in the next spring,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.200
I'll sit down and
figure out if it's

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.230
the one I should be working on.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.320
So thanks a lot.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.460
Thanks for listening,
and happy trails.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.010
