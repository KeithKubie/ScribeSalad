[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.480
JELYNN MALONE: I
am Jelynn Malone.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.260
BEVERLY MAGTANONG:
I'm Bev Magtanong.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.490
SPEAKER: Oh, wait.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.070
BEVERLY MAGTANONG:
Oh, is this not on?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.570
Hi.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.700
I'm Bev Magtanong.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.450
MIKE ARQUINES: Hi.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.370
I'm Mike Arquines.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.120
SAM MAGTANONG: Hi.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.449
I'm Sam Magtanong.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.490
JELYNN MALONE: All right.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.887
Well, welcome.

00:00:24.887 --> 00:00:26.970
Thank you guys so much for
spending your afternoon

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.050
with us.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.940
We are Mostra Coffee.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.640
And I wanted to first
off say, thank you to you

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.660
guys for having us.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450
Moses, thank you for
coming into Mostra

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.080
and bringing us out here.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.880
We're so honored to
be a part of Google.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.710
You guys are Google.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.790
I mean, there's nothing
cooler than Google, right?

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.370
But yeah, so I just want to
introduce my partners again.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.660
So Bev Magtanong.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.440
She and I started the
company, brought on Mike,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
and then brought on Sam.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
So we've had such a crazy
journey up to this point.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.040
We are actually celebrating
our fifth year in business

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.030
this year.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.040
And it's been an eventful year.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.660
We opened two retail
locations this year,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.309
which is a lot for anybody.

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:08.850
So we opened up two
retail locations.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.354
We've done a number of
beer collaborations.

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:13.020
Mike, how many beer
collaborations would

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.700
you say we've done
up to this point?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.720
MIKE ARQUINES:
We're at about 420

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.320
in the last maybe
four years actually.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.070
JELYNN MALONE: OK.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.420
Yeah.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.930
SAM MAGTANONG: So pretty close.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.620
JELYNN MALONE: And then so
our biggest collaboration

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.130
is with Stone Brewing Company.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.000
Everyone knows Stone
Brewing Company, right?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.416
So one of their
most popular beers

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:32.820
is the Xocoveza Mocha Stout.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.740
And we collaborated with them.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.240
And we do that every
year with them.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.140
And it's nationally distributed.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.780
And it's probably
our biggest account.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.950
But we've done that.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.550
And one of the biggest,
most blowing ones

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.270
is that this year we were named
one of the top three finalists

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.570
for Micro Roaster
of the Year 2019.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.170
And that was quite
humbling for us.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.290
And now we're at Google.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.340
So I mean, this is definitely
on the list of the cool things

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.010
that we've had an
opportunity to do.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.840
I wanted to go over
just kind of the things

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.200
we're going to be
talking about today.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.540
We're going to be
talking about coffee.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.581
We're going to be talking
about specialty coffee,

00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.790
and what that is, coffee
roasting, the innovation

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.890
of coffee, and how
that is involved

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.190
with craft beer, and food
and many other things,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.440
as well as community.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.020
It's kind of a weird
situation how we all got here.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.770
My partners and I were doing
things so far from coffee.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.080
I have a background
in entertainment

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.380
as a TV host and a
film and TV actress.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.180
Nothing to do with coffee.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.180
Bev is a graduate of
the Boston Conservatory

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.980
and a professional opera singer,
and owns her own vocal studio.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.680
And so if you need
voice lessons, call Bev.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.740
And then there's Mike, which he
still is Chef Mike in my phone.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.430
He's a fine dining chef,
and owns his own company

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.410
called the Lab Dining Sessions.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.750
And Sam is a veteran.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.640
Actually, he's a
captain in the army.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.590
He was a captain in the
army, fought in Iraq.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.720
Happy Veterans Day, Sam.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.260
And he has transitioned
into becoming a health care

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.530
executive.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.690
So how we all ended
up doing coffee

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.400
is probably the most
interesting thing.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.200
And it's probably the most
synchronicity part of it, too.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.340
Bev and I have been
friends, best friends,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.880
for over 20 years.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.120
We went to middle school
and high school together.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.150
And in high school, we were
dreaming up these businesses

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.320
that we could own together.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.490
And then after high school,
we left San Diego, pursued

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.490
careers in entertainment,
and college, and all that,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.050
and about 10 years after that,
we came back to San Diego.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.920
And when we came
back, we started

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.810
working with a
charity organization

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.850
to help aid the poor
in the Philippines.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.570
And we got the opportunity to
travel out to the Philippines.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.180
We fell in love with the
culture, which our families are

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.230
all from the Philippines.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.080
But we got to go there as adults
and experience the Philippines.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.980
And we recognized not
only the beautiful people

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.860
and the culture, but also
the gravity of the poverty

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.550
out there.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.010
And we learned that the only
way that you could really

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.710
help eradicate
poverty is to provide

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.000
job opportunities instead of
just like giving them money.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.250
So anyway, we came home,
and we were like, OK,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.750
that was extremely inspiring.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.820
How are we going to
eradicate poverty?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.240
We don't know.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.940
But that was that.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.640
So a few years later, she and
I started a pastry company.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.230
We don't bake at all.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.520
We don't bake at all.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.920
But we hired a pastry chef.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.290
And we started a pastry company.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.430
And Sam, being an executive
in the health care industry,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.590
he had a facility
that needed a cafe.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.570
So he gave us the opportunity
to open up a cafe.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.460
So we went to go do that.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.420
But if you're going to have
pastries, you need coffee.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.910
But we didn't drink
coffee at all.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.790
We were like the Starbucks
drinker girls that are like,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.040
let's get the most sugar
with extra whipped cream,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.550
and we don't want to
taste any coffee at all.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.360
But we needed
coffee for our shop.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.050
So the only person
we knew really

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.480
that drank coffee was Mike.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.157
And we had met Mike when we
were doing all of our charity

00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:08.490
events, because he was like
a chef at one of the events.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.234
So I was like stalking
him on social media.

00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:12.900
And he always posted
stuff about coffee.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.800
So I called him,
and I'm like, hey,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.530
could you show us
around and maybe

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.530
introduce us to some
coffee roasters in town?

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.482
He did that.

00:05:20.482 --> 00:05:21.940
Bev and I not being
coffee drinkers

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.400
were not that into this.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.830
But we got there, and we
tried specialty coffee

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.640
for the first time.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.920
And it was a
mind-blowing experience.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.500
The wide range of
flavors and the kinds

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.860
of products that come
from specialty coffee

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.850
were so interesting.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.300
So we left that
trip and came home.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.570
And this light bulb
basically went off.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.360
And we realized-- we
were like, wait a minute.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.980
Let's not do the pastry company.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.276
Let's be coffee roasters.

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:50.650
We don't know
think about coffee,

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.000
but we're going to
do that instead.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.020
So we started Mostra Coffee.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.440
And we called Mike to see if
he could help us learn more

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.760
about coffee.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.740
And he so happened
to have always

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.020
had a dream to roast coffee.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.480
We're like, great, you
could be our roaster.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.510
But none of us, again,
knew what we were doing.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.900
So we just were winging it.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.920
We were totally winging it.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.870
So we started roasting.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.790
We bought a roaster.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.950
And we started roasting out of
Bev and Sam's garage in Forest

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.450
Ranch.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.408
Sorry to all the neighbors
in Forest Ranch that

00:06:24.408 --> 00:06:27.700
were smelling all the coffee,
because it actually doesn't

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.900
smell like brewed coffee.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.030
Roasted coffee
smells like popcorn.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.070
And anyway, it's not the same.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.880
So anyway, we started
roasting coffee.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.950
And the company actually
started to grow.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.870
We started closing
wholesale accounts.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.170
We were closing accounts with
Tender Greens and companies

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.680
like that.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.554
And breweries started
calling us for coffee.

00:06:50.554 --> 00:06:52.720
And so then we ended up
bringing on another partner.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.050
And then Sam to bring more
of a corporate structure

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.540
and their expertise to
actually growing this business,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.420
because again, Hollywood, opera
singer, chef, we're like, OK,

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.960
here we are.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.720
So fast forward.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.740
Here we are five
years later with being

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.310
named one of the top three micro
roasters in the United States.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.710
I still don't know
how that has happened.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.180
But we're so extremely
humbled and grateful.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.160
And why we decided
coffee and not coconut--

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.410
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Or bamboo.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.340
JELYNN MALONE: Or bamboo,
which were other things that

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.610
are grown in the Philippines.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.050
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Right.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.450
So I mean, we could have
done different things.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.027
Bamboo, coconut,
these are other things

00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:38.860
that are really abundant
in the Philippines,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.420
but we chose coffee.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.430
And we chose specialty coffee.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.380
And why specialty coffee, right?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.430
So terms like specialty
coffee or craft coffee

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.110
are terms that more
and more people

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.030
are starting to use these days.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.480
And I mean, it makes sense,
because specialty coffee

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.230
is growing.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.070
It's grown by about 2% every
single year for the last 16

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.490
years or so to the point
where Starbucks has actually

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.220
created their own line
of reserve coffees

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.350
and their own chain of
reserve coffee shops.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.950
So if you haven't been inside
a Starbucks Reserve coffee

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.370
shop, what you'll find in
there are various bags, really

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.820
nice bags, of single origin
coffees, fancy espresso

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.970
machines, manual
pour over methods.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.360
And it's really
Starbucks's way of creating

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.990
a space for the specialty
coffee consumer.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.461
So this is happening.

00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:32.169
And people are like,
OK, what's going on?

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.400
Why specialty coffee?

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.890
What is specialty coffee, right?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.030
How does specialty coffee
differ from regular coffee?

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.770
And most importantly
to some people,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.870
why is my cup of
specialty coffee

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.480
more expensive than
the cup of coffee

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.810
that I can get at
like the gas station?

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.320
So every single day
here in the States,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.620
400 million cups of
coffee are consumed.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.610
About 59% of those
coffee cups are

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.320
brewed with specialty coffee.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.920
So that's 236 million
cups of coffee

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.860
that are brewed with
specialty coffee.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.010
How many people are actually
looking inside their cup

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.000
and thinking I know how that
coffee got inside my cup

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.750
or even questioning how
it got into their cup?

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.630
Jelynn mentioned that I
am a classical singer.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.170
I was trained as a classical
singer since I was 12.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:31.000
And people always ask me, how
do you go from classical singing

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.204
to coffee?

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:34.870
It's random, and it's completely
different, which it totally is.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.670
They're two totally
different industries.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.850
Yet at the same time,
they're so similar,

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.110
in that the complexities
and the nuances and the work

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.590
and the detail that goes into
becoming a classical musician,

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.260
like learning vocal
technique, and the time

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.120
that it takes to
learn vocal technique,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.660
or learning foreign languages,
and observing foreign languages

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.900
in conjunction with
a composer's work,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.480
those kind of
complexities and details

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.710
I was able to find so
similarly in specialty coffee.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.470
And I'm going to tell you
how they're so similar,

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.450
and how those kinds of details
are present in this industry.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.290
Mike is going to
do that, too, as he

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.510
gets into his roasting portion.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.350
But the coffee bean
starts at the farm.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:25.330
It starts in a farm outside
of the states in countries

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.590
like Costa Rica, or Guatemala,
or Brazil, or Indonesia,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.910
or Papua New Guinea.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.800
And the arabica
coffee bean, which

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.260
is the type of coffee that
can be considered a specialty

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.830
coffee, is grown in the highland
mountains of these countries.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.650
So it's grown at about 3,000
to 6,500 feet in elevation.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.260
And these farms are tilled,
and they're maintained

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.960
by sometimes single families.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.470
They don't have access to
advanced farming equipment

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.910
or technology.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.330
And their way of farming
is really by sight or feel

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.030
or partnering with outside
coffee partners that

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.380
come into the mountains.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.630
And they help them
make sure that they're

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.290
adhering to best farming
practices and processes.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.230
Now, these arabica coffee
trees take a long time to grow.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.730
They take about
three to five years

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.200
to get to maturity to be able
to harvest coffee from them,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.950
as opposed to some of
these other coffees,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.937
like robusta or liberica.

00:11:19.937 --> 00:11:21.520
So those types of
coffees are actually

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.770
grown in the lowlands
of the mountains.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.920
They grow aggressively.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.040
You can grow a lot of it,
and you can grow it often.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.100
So these are coffees
that you will

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.410
find in your instant coffee.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.340
They don't have as delicate
a flavor as arabica coffee.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.270
They're bitter,
and they're harsh.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.280
And they're considered
commercial coffee.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.710
So like I said, arabica coffee
takes a long time to grow.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.777
They are really
susceptible to disease.

00:11:44.777 --> 00:11:46.360
Just because they're
in the highlands,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.443
so there's a lot of rains.

00:11:47.443 --> 00:11:48.680
There's a lot of moisture.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.870
So mold ends up
becoming an issue.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.000
So these trees really
take careful cultivating.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.920
The trees produce a cherry.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.040
So a lot of people don't
know that coffee actually

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.770
starts inside a cherry.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.790
Those trees bear fruit.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:09.100
And one arabica coffee
tree makes enough cherries

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.340
for 1 to 2 pounds
of roasted coffee.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.530
So let's put that
in perspective.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.440
It takes 2,000
cherries to produce

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.810
1 pound of roasted coffee.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.180
That means that the
average two cup a day

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:29.560
coffee drinker annually is
going to have consumed 18 trees.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.590
It's a lot of cherries.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.620
And remember, these cherries
aren't picked by some machine.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.336
They're hand-picked
by these farmers.

00:12:37.336 --> 00:12:38.710
They're going out
into the field,

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.330
and they're hand
picking these cherries.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.240
Now, once they actually
pick the cherries,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.930
it has to go through
a whole process.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.580
Mike is going to go into more
detail about these processes.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.650
But they have to actually
sort out ripe cherries

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.840
from unripe cherries.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.040
So sometimes this
is done by hand.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.040
Sometimes they actually
put them in water.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.230
And the cherries that
are floating are unripe,

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.089
and the ones that
are sinking are ripe.

00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:06.880
So that's how they can
tell the difference.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.090
From there I can go through
a deep pulping method.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.200
So they'll take the bean
actually outside of the cherry.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.760
Then it gets fermented.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.810
Then it gets dried.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.820
And it has to dry
so that the moisture

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.300
content inside the bean actually
gets to a certain percentage.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.680
And then it gets milled.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.300
And then it gets bagged.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.950
And then it comes
down the mountain

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.430
by a horse or a
donkey, because there's

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.310
no helicopter that's
going up there and getting

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.090
these coffees.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.690
And then it's exported.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.540
But before it gets
exported, we've

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.600
got third party
green coffee buyers

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.290
that actually come on site.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.750
These people are
typically queue graders.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.890
So queue graders are
the official people that

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.510
can actually grade this coffee.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.370
They've gone through
a lot of training.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.980
They've tasted a lot of coffee,
and actually are certified

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.630
people that come and taste
and grade these coffees.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.070
So they'll take a green
sample of the raw coffee.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.060
And they'll look at it.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.080
And they're able to identify
what kind of defects

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.300
the coffee may have.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.610
Now, defects could be
discoloration of the coffee.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.260
It could be insect damage.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.810
It could be broken or
chipped coffee beans.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.080
And if there are enough
defects in that sample,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.760
that coffee may not even
move onto the next level,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.490
which is the roasting.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:25.990
So once the coffee gets moved
on, if it does get moved on,

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.390
they'll roast that
sample of coffee,

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.060
and then they'll actually
cup it, or they'll taste it.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.760
And what they're looking for
is sweetness in the coffee.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.730
They're looking for how
clean the coffee tastes,

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.300
meaning how many off flavors
are present or not present

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.100
inside the coffee.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.230
They're looking for any defects.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.340
And they'll grade
it, essentially.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.510
And so if it gets graded
as an 80 or higher--

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.910
the specialty coffee grade
scale is out of 100--

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.740
if it gets graded
an 80 or higher,

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.300
then it's considered specialty.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.980
If it's below that, it's not.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.920
So if it's specialty, they'll
consider it in their inventory

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.410
to push out to the roasters.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.990
Another situation that happens
is that roasters actually

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.547
go to the farm themselves.

00:15:06.547 --> 00:15:08.380
Now, this is a great
situation, because it's

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.970
called direct trade.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.800
So the farmers will go and
sell directly to the roasters.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.480
And the roasters will
do the same thing.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.440
They'll cup the coffee.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.540
They'll decide if they
want to bring it in.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.830
And then what's great is that
the farmer gets typically

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.950
more money per pound of
coffee, because you get rid

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.810
of the middleman
in that situation.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.670
And you're working
directly with the farmer.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.650
So once the
roasters, once we get

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.690
that coffee, what
we have to do is

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.960
we actually have to roast that
coffee at different levels.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.120
And then we have to
cup it, and taste

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.240
all of those different levels
of coffee, roasted coffee.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.570
And then to decide
which coffee we want

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.730
to push out into the market.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.510
Once that happens, it gets
brought to the baristas.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.210
And then the baristas have
to actually figure out

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.450
what coffee to
water ratio is going

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:02.850
to make the best cup of coffee
and be the best representation

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.171
of that origin or that blend.

00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:07.170
And then it gets brewed.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.790
And it gets sold
to the consumer.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:13.440
So as you can see, the journey
from seed at the farm to cup

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.690
is a crazy one.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:20.370
And there's a lot of hands that
are involved in that process,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.370
and a lot of people that have
to uphold a certain quality

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.440
and standard throughout
that whole process.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.090
So the next time that you
see a latte for $4 or $4.50,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.960
and you might be wondering
why it costs that much,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.840
you'll know that that's
why, because the process is

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.810
so laborious.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.600
At Mostra, we take
pride in being

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.667
really innovative and
creative with our coffees.

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:48.000
I think it's one of the things
that really sets us apart

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.830
from other roasters.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.980
And Mike here is a
great asset to us,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.870
because he's actually
a fine dining chef,

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.040
like Lynn mentioned.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.890
He actually graduated
from the Art Institute

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.150
here in San Diego.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.600
And he has worked in really
prestigious restaurants,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.839
like Charlie Trotter's in
Chicago and Le Bernardin

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:07.560
in New York.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.130
And he is really able
to approach the coffee

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.810
with a culinary mindset.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.390
And it's really
been so fun to be

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.190
able to see him
work with the coffee

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.240
and be able to do
amazing things with it.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.169
So Mike is going
to take it away.

00:17:23.169 --> 00:17:24.210
MIKE ARQUINES: Thank you.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:24.569
Thank you.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.740
How's everybody doing today?

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.640
AUDIENCE: Good!

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.440
MIKE ARQUINES: Fantastic.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.110
A little brief, quick
blurb about myself.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.360
I was supposed to be a nurse.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.350
I'm Filipino.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.870
I'm either in the
military or I'm a nurse.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.410
My mother, so pretty much,
I broke my mom's heart

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.590
at the end of the day.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.680
She's a nurse, amazing nurse.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.850
She worked long hours in
Oakland emergency room,

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.607
night shift, yay high.

00:17:49.607 --> 00:17:50.940
They called her little Napoleon.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.250
She ruled with an iron fist.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.370
And she is my inspiration.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.240
But I did break her heart.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.960
I decided to pursue a career
in the culinary field.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.070
And to her it was not
the ideal situation,

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.200
because for her coming
from the Philippines,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.800
it was all about
stability, and money,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.870
and being able to
provide for your family.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.330
And she felt that at the time
that route just wasn't ideal.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.570
So I broke her heart.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.120
Nurse.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.150
Educated myself.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.930
Culinary arts management
at San Diego Art Institute.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.740
I traveled to New York, did
a stint at Le Bernardin,

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.430
came back, worked in
and around San Diego,

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.560
went to Charlie Trotter's
Chicago for a while,

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.940
at which I spent
most of my time.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.190
A very intense kitchen.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.870
If you could
imagine kind of like

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.400
Gordon Ramsay like times five.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.000
It was insane.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.070
So anyways, I came back
here, and here we are.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.620
Lab Dining Sessions
stands for collaboration.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.040
I opened that in 2009.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.640
And we provide unique
dinner experiences,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.940
multi-course experiences that
I felt that was happening,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.010
and was hot in New
York and in Chicago.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.260
And to bring that
here was definitely

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.610
something new for San Diego.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.950
So yeah.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.100
So we started in a garage.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.800
We're "garagepreneurs," pretty
much, I would like to say.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.890
Almost burnt the house
down, as everyone asked.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.100
I mean, we sprung
for this roaster.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.570
And so I'm a flavor nerd.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.400
I love flavor.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.230
I love the process of
manipulation of flavors

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.520
and taste, and just techniques.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.350
So as I'm just--

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.400
we pretty much just
googled a lot of things.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:41.970
Yeah.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.102
We googled techniques
and forums.

00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:46.560
And that's pretty
much how I learn.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.230
I ask a lot of questions,
take a lot of good notes.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.440
And then at the end of the
day, what does it taste like?

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.630
You could go through so
many different variations

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.284
of variables throughout
the roasting process.

00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:00.200
But at the end of the
day, does it taste good?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.060
So that's what we relied
on a lot in the beginning

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.830
and up to this point
is, does it taste good?

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:12.190
So why innovation?

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.710
Because why not?

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:20.800
Coffee is a part of daily life
for all of us, or most of us,

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.340
I would say.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.048
And it was for me
working in the kitchen,

00:20:23.048 --> 00:20:24.984
or whether you're a
nurse, or you're a doctor,

00:20:24.984 --> 00:20:27.400
or you're in the military, or
you're working in an office,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.430
or you're working at
Google, it doesn't matter.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.950
Coffee definitely gets
you through the day.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.010
But we wanted to provide
it in such a way that

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.200
made it exciting, not
just providing you

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.090
with a good cup of coffee,
but also the experience

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.200
to that cup of coffee.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.550
And that's why we
at Mostra focus on

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.010
not only the sourcing
and the responsibility

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.650
and the community, but also
the experience, customer

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.200
experience, for a
premium product.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.450
And that's a new and exciting.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.580
So I always like
to think about when

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.080
I'm roasting coffee
and the approach

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.640
to coffee or the approach to
cold brews and other products,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.190
it runs parallels to
the culinary world,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.670
because its flavor first, right?

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.210
So for example, when we're
creating a blend of coffee,

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.790
it's just like--

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.680
in my mind, I'm
like, OK, so you're

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.500
taking three or four
different kinds of coffees,

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.090
and you're layering flavors
that each one provides, just

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.770
like stock.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.120
You guys make stock at home.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.100
Chicken stock, they call
it bone broth nowadays.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.650
But that's like the buzz word.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.440
But chicken stock, beef stock,
vegetable stock, fish stock.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.960
It's all the same concept.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.000
If you start with a great base,
and then you go into deglazing,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.484
and you add another layer of
flavor that's your acidity,

00:21:56.484 --> 00:21:57.900
and then you add
another, then you

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.640
add your broth,
which can be your--

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.260
or if you do glazing
with red wine,

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.784
you have your tannic qualities.

00:22:02.784 --> 00:22:04.200
And then you have
the broth, which

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.420
is the richness and the body.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.150
That sounds like a blend
to me, an espresso blend.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:14.940
So again, that's how I draw
inspiration and parallels

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.350
to what I do or what
we do here at Mostra.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:24.430
So my number one thing is
to always think as a kid

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.320
when I'm trying to
think of a product,

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.660
because kids are always curious.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.930
They're always wondering
why, asking themselves why,

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.070
asking a lot of questions.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.100
And I still do the
same thing to this day,

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.230
because that just
keeps me on my toes.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.180
And again, keep it fresh.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.861
Keep it awesome.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:52.840
So community collaboration
is one big thing we do.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.270
Some of the biggest things
we do here at Mostra

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.100
is we were known--

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.350
people know us as a
cold brew company.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.310
They found us through cold brew.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.890
At one point it was like,
whoa, like it's just cold brew,

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:07.390
right?

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:13.080
We felt like, why aren't
more people doing this?

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.400
It's 70% less acidic.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.710
It's easier on the
stomach for people.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.600
This was back like
five years ago.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.380
And people were literally
buying bottles of cold brew

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.000
at their house, where
we would brew it.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.282
And it was like, OK, we were
probably onto something.

00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:30.490
Other roasters at the time
were kind of not on board.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.820
They're like, no, that's
not what we're about.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.280
Which is OK, but why not?

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.610
Why not?

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:43.480
And then in conjunction with
that, being in San Diego,

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.010
we have a big craft beer
presence, big craft beer

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.390
community.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:53.660
We have some of the best
craft beers in the world.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.990
I am a craft beer nerd as well.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.450
And I derive a lot
of my inspiration

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.960
from those breweries as well.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.542
They create a base stout
for a lot of beers.

00:24:06.542 --> 00:24:08.000
And then from there,
they throw in,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.660
whether it's hazelnuts
and marshmallows or coffee

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.010
or so on and so forth.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.400
I was like, why don't we
try that with our cold brew?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.100
So we started dabbling
with different ingredients

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.930
that we felt would complement
and contrast our coffee.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.140
So our first one was our
One-Brazilian Coconuts,

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.080
which we use fresh coconut
and fresh vanilla bean.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.855
And until this day, it's
one of our best sellers.

00:24:32.855 --> 00:24:35.710
It literally tastes like an
Almond Joy or a Mounds bar.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.860
It's fantastic.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.220
But sourcing great
product, using it

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.120
with respect, and finesse,
and not messing it up,

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.120
and sourcing great coffee
and not messing it up,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.890
that's the key to our products.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.850
And then so with that, those are
how our collaborations really

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:56.420
started.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.280
We started with one, and
then it turned to three,

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.363
and then it turned to
eight, and then turned-- now

00:25:00.363 --> 00:25:02.540
we're at 400 plus right now.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.890
Why?

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.130
Because we wanted to not
only build community through

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:11.450
our products and also work
with like-minded crafty people

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.630
and talented people, but
we wanted to provide--

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.530
we felt the need to provide a
service now to these breweries.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.670
And how do we do that?

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.740
Breweries typically
would go to a store

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.730
or go to a fellow roaster and be
like, hey, I'm making a stout.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.860
OK, cool, here you go.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.970
I hope this tastes good.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.590
Normally, that's what happens.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.700
But in my head, I'm
like, OK, so if they

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.480
spend so much time in hop
selection in New Zealand

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.216
and they travel and they do
all this to make a beer, well,

00:25:41.216 --> 00:25:42.590
if they're making
a coffee stout,

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.214
they probably want
to select the coffee

00:25:44.214 --> 00:25:46.070
and work with the
right roaster properly

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.440
just as much as they
would attention to detail

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.480
in hops selection, for example.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.680
So we felt there was that need.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.900
So we like to say we like
to custom tailor the beers

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.430
like a suit.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.370
The coffee like a
suit to this beer.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.180
So now if they're brewing a
stout, we'll have a meeting.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.550
I'll say, hey,
what's your process?

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.530
What's your mineral?

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.000
What's your water quality like?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.062
What's your infusion?

00:26:15.062 --> 00:26:16.020
Where are you infusing?

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.177
What side of the brew
side are you infusing?

00:26:18.177 --> 00:26:19.260
Are going to barrel agent?

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.780
What's the finishing ABV?

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.740
Stuff like that.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.970
Because all that
plays into flavor.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.880
So when I have all
that information,

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.450
maybe after two meetings, then
we'll talk coffee after that.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:35.480
So with all the success
with the breweries

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.700
and the collaborations,
and with all the products

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.670
that all these breweries were
pumping out with our name

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:47.150
on it, I was like, man, this
is definitely something that--

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.500
what else can we do with it?

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.600
Because why not, right?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.760
A lot of our beers are barely
barrel-aged beers, big, hefty,

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.494
12%-plus beers.

00:26:57.494 --> 00:26:58.910
And what do they
do with the beers

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.209
after they're
dumped and bottled?

00:27:01.209 --> 00:27:03.000
They just have these
barrels that they turn

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.570
into furniture or for plants.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.240
And what do you call those?

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.480
Pottery, whatever, anyways.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.350
So I was like, why don't we
take those barrels and age

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.060
green coffee in it?

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.270
Because green coffee is
porous, meaning like an egg.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.034
An egg is porous.

00:27:22.034 --> 00:27:22.950
You put in the fridge.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.700
You put it next to
something very pungent.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.170
It'll absorb those flavors.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.200
Now you make scrambled
eggs in the morning.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.080
Now you have that flavored
scrambled eggs in the morning.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:37.500
So we took green beans, aged
them in a barrel, for example.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.540
It absorbs the flavors that
were in the barrel, big stout.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.640
Plus it used to be
a bourbon barrel.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.580
So 12 years, 10, 12 years of
bourbon whiskey from Kentucky.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.830
All that push and pull in
the wood in the flavors.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.950
It's like a time
machine of flavor.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.790
And that gets absorbed
into the green coffee.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.820
We roast it.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.830
We check moisture content
on it constantly, agitating,

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.330
rotating, the barrel.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.920
And then we'll sample roast.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.160
Like Bev said, we sample roast
coffee to taste for defects

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.460
or flavor qualities we like or
we do not like, and we adjust,

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.290
take notes.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.680
And then we have our
finished product.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.201
Now, you're tying community.

00:28:20.201 --> 00:28:20.700
Why?

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.460
Because you're taking two
brands that normally don't work

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.460
together in this way and
providing this product that's

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.200
exciting, where
when I say exciting,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.610
people are lining up for it.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.989
And these lines are insane.

00:28:31.989 --> 00:28:33.030
Beer releases are insane.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.550
Sometimes people camp out
for two days for a beer.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.150
We've had people camp out
for coffee at like 1:00 AM.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.740
It's pretty awesome.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.040
And that's the
power of community,

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.020
and obviously marketing.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.780
But if the product is
great, people will come.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.070
So that's also a big part
of innovation, in my mind,

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.790
and in our mind.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.730
So on top of the
400-plus beers that we've

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.920
done, on top of the
cold brews we've done,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:12.020
the barrel aging,
all that, we like

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.450
to think that we are
great at bridging

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.870
gaps between different crafts.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:26.230
And bridging these crafts
together is huge for us,

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.980
because now you're taking
people who normally either

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.390
don't drink coffee at that
level, or they do drink coffee.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:38.500
And now, whether you're in a
kitchen or you're a distiller

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.310
or you're a brewer, we're
actually tying all these crafts

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.790
together with our products.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.224
Yeah, so.

00:29:48.224 --> 00:29:50.140
SAM MAGTANONG: That was
my cue, bridging gaps.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:50.950
MIKE ARQUINES: Yes.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:51.590
SAM MAGTANONG: It was my cue.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.810
So my name is Sam.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.620
And I get a chance to
tie it all together,

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:01.300
and to close this segment.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.940
We didn't get a chance to really
highlight Jelynn's background.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:12.010
So Jelynn is a working TV film
actor in Hollywood for TV shows

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.460
like "General Hospital,"
"Las Vegas" on NBC,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.390
and a number of films.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.950
She's hosted her own shows on
VH1, TV Guide Channel, Nike,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.570
ABC's backstage host for
the Emmys, to name a few.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:33.330
They brought the non-performer
on a team of performers

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.340
to Google Talks.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.610
I'm also deathly afraid
of public speaking.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.100
And I don't memorize
lines very well.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.600
So I'm the only one
with a notebook.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.190
And I wrote every single
word that I was going

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:51.420
to say in case I forget it.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.600
Lynn was an actress in
Hollywood for a number of years.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.230
Beverly was a classically
trained opera singer.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:00.810
Mike is a fine dining chef.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:01.601
I'm an immigrant.

00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:02.850
I was born in the Philippines.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.070
I came here when I
was four years old.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.210
I'm also a veteran.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:10.740
I felt it was my calling.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:14.260
And it was an honor for
me to serve my country.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.530
I'm also the grandson
of a rice former.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:23.460
Farming culture and the
love for the land, I think,

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.420
is definitely in my blood.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:32.480
My grandfather planted
rice for over 60 years

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.510
in the same plot of land
before he passed away

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.560
a couple of years ago.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.185
When we went to the Philippines,
when I went to the Philippines

00:31:38.185 --> 00:31:40.384
in 2015, and I spoke
to my grandfather

00:31:40.384 --> 00:31:42.550
in the southern part of the
Philippines in Mindanao,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:47.062
and I asked him, Lola, where
are the coffee farmers?

00:31:47.062 --> 00:31:48.520
He pointed to the
mountains, and he

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.510
said, go climb up the
mountains, and go start speaking

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.580
to the coffee farmers.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.020
And I did.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:00.730
The Philippines is the perfect
setting for growing coffee.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.720
It's got climate.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.680
It's got elevation.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.060
It's got the soil.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.050
It's got the manpower.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.060
It's got the farm, and
the farming culture.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.300
Across the world in the coffee
belt, as Beverly mentioned,

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.880
Guatemala, the countries
in South America,

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.790
Papua New Guinea.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.460
You've got other African
countries, like Ethiopia.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.870
You've got Indonesia.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:24.280
Coffee and growing coffee has
been the mechanism for wealth

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.350
generation for these
farmers, but unfortunately

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.080
in the Philippines,
due to the politics

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.510
and to the current
economic situation there,

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.010
the Filipino farmers
are impoverished.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:38.650
There's not enough coffee
production in the Philippines

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.070
to meet local
consumption of coffee.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.520
They're importing from
outside the country

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.950
over 50% of the
coffee consumption,

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.800
much less exporting to
other parts of the world

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.230
or bringing their specialty
coffee to you all here.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:58.210
But the coffee bean still
provides the best promise

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.544
and the means for
inclusion to these farmers

00:33:00.544 --> 00:33:01.960
and to the indigenous
peoples that

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.770
are growing these
coffees in the mountain

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:08.080
regions of southern
Mindanao, in northern Luzon

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.680
in the Philippines, that have
historically been excluded

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.700
from their communities.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:19.450
So as a Filipino and American,
and as Filipino-Americans here,

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.530
the passion behind
our project has

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:28.390
been to elevate the plights
of the Philippine farmer

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:31.720
to honor our past
and our history,

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.450
to provide economic
opportunity, and to elevate

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:38.550
the Philippine bean to
the global world market.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:43.600
When we applied for the Roaster
of the Year competition,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.390
sponsored by "Roast"
magazine this past year,

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:52.750
our coffee submission was
the humble Philippine bean.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.560
And as others submitted some
of the world's top coffees,

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.590
we were compelled to submit
that as part of our legacy

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.880
and as part of our story.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.640
We have a barista
here who you'll

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.429
meet outside who's helping
us with the roasting

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:10.090
demonstration.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.850
He'll be competing in the
preliminaries of the US Coffee

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.000
Championships in Denver
on December 1 and 2.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.530
And his bean of choice is going
to be the Philippine bean.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.370
As we continue to tell the
story of the bean in general

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.830
and the Philippine
bean in particular,

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:33.250
we hope to be able to honor our
past that allows us to explain

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:37.690
how I got here, how we all got
here, and allows us to wonder

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:41.320
what the future could bring.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:47.260
So five years ago, we started
Mostra Coffee in my garage.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.400
I turned to my wife.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.650
Beverly is my better half.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.550
And she said to me, we're going
to start a roasting company.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.810
And we're going to pull all
of our money, our savings,

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.550
along with the savings
of all of our partners,

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.532
and we're going to start
a roasting company.

00:35:04.532 --> 00:35:05.240
I turned to them.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.310
You don't know
anything about coffee.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:07.570
You don't know anything
about business.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.040
And you're an opera singer.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.442
How are we going
to make this work?

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:12.400
But that's what we did.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.200
We started roasting in our
garage 1 pound of coffee

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.910
at a time.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.560
We took all of our
money and savings,

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.100
and we bought a 1-pound
profile roaster,

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.430
and we named her,
affectionately, Francesca,

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:28.580
or Franny for short.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.580
You'll meet her outside.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:37.510
What inspired us then to go
for broke and to take a risk

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:42.340
is what continues to
fuel our vision today,

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.920
that through a
simple cup of coffee,

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.690
and the very powerful spirit
of community and collaboration,

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.430
that we can inspire
one another to be

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.830
the best versions of ourselves.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:58.330
So Mostra in Italian
means to perform,

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.040
performance, exhibition, show.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.640
And all the owners
really want to do

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.380
is just through their
own inspired performance

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.700
to be better people.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.070
And through our own performance,
can we inspire others?

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:13.570
Can we inspire you to perform
to the best of your ability?

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.910
We can build and
connect and inspire

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:19.930
local and global communities
to create opportunities,

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:24.850
real opportunities, that impact
people's lives and families.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.090
We can create impactful
and meaningful experiences

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:32.470
and connection that we, us
four, can be the reason,

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:37.090
and all of us out here listening
can be the reason that people

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:41.620
see the goodness in humanity.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:45.940
As we observe Veterans Day
today and as we commemorate

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.570
the 100th anniversary
of the armistice that

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.870
went into effect on the
11th hour of the 11th day

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.720
of the 11th month
in the year 1918

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.550
that ended the war
to end all wars,

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.560
Mostra's vision is
even more clear to me.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.160
As we are being reminded that
the old demons are rising

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.150
again, ready to complete
their task of chaos

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.510
and death that was spoken
by the French president

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:16.090
over the weekend's
commemorations

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.480
during Armistice Day, that the
old demons are rising again

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.710
ready to destroy and to
wreak havoc and chaos,

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.610
our mission is very, very clear.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.170
It's through a simple
cup of coffee--

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.950
however you drink your
coffee, with cream, or sugar,

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.630
or simple black, or a nice cold
brew, or a shot of espresso,

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:38.470
or a fancy latte--

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:42.910
that we can come together, and
that we can find common ground,

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:47.440
and that there are more that
unites us than what divides us.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.510
And the last sentence
of our mission statement

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.010
is a real symbol.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:54.240
We are one.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.300
That's all I have.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.210
Thank you for inviting us.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.860
MIKE ARQUINES: Thank
you, everybody.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.860
SAM MAGTANONG: To speak.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.530
And I know we have a few
more things for you in store.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.360
JELYNN MALONE: I think we
have to open up for questions,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.375
right?

00:38:07.375 --> 00:38:08.710
Anyone have any questions?

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.126
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Anyone have
any questions for us today?

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.350
Yes.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.850
AUDIENCE: So just one.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:18.100
I don't know very much
about coffee at all.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.650
But one thing I do know
is about the roast cycle.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:23.300
You can have different
types of roasts.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.480
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Right.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.687
AUDIENCE: Do you typically take
a single batch of green beans

00:38:27.687 --> 00:38:29.770
and say, we're going to
do a medium roast for this

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.353
or we're going to
dark roast for this?

00:38:31.353 --> 00:38:33.780
Or do you kind of say, OK,
let's try the gamut here

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.300
with this particular
batch of green beans?

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.470
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: So Mike,
do you want to take this one?

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.390
MIKE ARQUINES: Am I on?

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.890
OK.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:45.550
Yeah, so we try to source
as seasonal as possible.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.710
And with that being
said, we get notes

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.440
on these coffees that we--

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.160
for example, if it's a Costa
Rica, before we bring it in,

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.410
we'll already know
what we're looking for,

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.060
and how we should
probably approach it

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:03.880
based on whether it's elevation
and how it's processed.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.790
So that we're kind of ahead
of the game once it comes in.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:12.310
And as we're building
this library of origins,

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.470
we could bring in
any type of African

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.200
and kind of roast it similar,
and then adjust at that time,

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.070
because it's going to vary
from crop to crop, regardless.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:27.820
So we kind of have a
premeditated approach to it

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.340
before we get it, and
then, say, if it's

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:35.380
that Costa Rica, we feel that
at a medium roast spectrum,

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.930
we're going to be able to
bring out more of what we want

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.130
from it, the chocolate, the
cocoa, the molasses coming out

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.280
of it.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:48.449
So that, to me, sounds
like a medium dark roast.

00:39:48.449 --> 00:39:49.990
But then when you
go on the other end

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:53.020
of the spectrum, which is like
we bring in our Ethiopians,

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.710
which are, for
example, a wash process

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.090
versus a natural process.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:03.382
You're talking wash, which is
more lemony and lively acidity.

00:40:03.382 --> 00:40:05.590
And then you have a natural
process, which is fruity.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.082
So just by knowing
those keywords,

00:40:09.082 --> 00:40:11.540
we're like, OK, this is how we
should probably approach it.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.414
AUDIENCE: For a given
batch, you'll typically

00:40:13.414 --> 00:40:14.974
choose one approach for it.

00:40:14.974 --> 00:40:16.270
Is that what you're saying?

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.530
MIKE ARQUINES: Well,
when we sample roast,

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:18.790
there's a predetermined--

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:22.390
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Range.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.370
MIKE ARQUINES: Range
of steps that we

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.780
need to hit according to the
Specialty Coffee Association.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.760
And then from there, we'll
taste it, and we're like, OK.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.860
You'll learn like maybe
60% of what that coffee is.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.100
And then the other 40%
if we really like it,

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.890
we'll bring in a bigger
batch, or a full bag of it.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.630
And then we'll profile
roast it, meaning

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.546
we'll roast it at different
temperatures, drop

00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:49.600
temps, charge temps,
and development times.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.117
And then we'll cup it.

00:40:51.117 --> 00:40:51.700
We'll rest it.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.560
We'll cup it.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.220
And at different-- through
the process of elimination,

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.870
we'll choose one or two cups.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.102
And then from there, we'll
cup it blind, and do it.

00:41:01.102 --> 00:41:02.810
And then that's how
we choose our coffee.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.400
So it's a process.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.930
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: So not any--

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.140
we don't take an
origin of coffee

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.069
and say, OK, we're going to
do this as a medium roast.

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:13.360
We bring it in, and we'll
roast it at different levels.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.340
And we'll cup it.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:20.960
Nothing that we do at Mostra
is really dark at all, or even

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.210
really light, for that matter.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.541
We kind of tend to stick
in that medium range.

00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:27.040
We feel that most of the time
we can highlight a lot of what

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.150
that coffee has to bring.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.000
So it's really
just a process of,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.290
at the end of the
day, what tastes good?

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.370
Yes.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:41.680
AUDIENCE: So how do you
scale through one taster?

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.830
Assuming coffee is
grown naturally,

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.245
so different batches will have
different characteristics.

00:41:47.245 --> 00:41:48.140
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Correct.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.765
AUDIENCE: How do you
make sure that you

00:41:49.765 --> 00:41:53.455
get the same [INAUDIBLE]
at the end of it?

00:41:53.455 --> 00:41:55.330
MIKE ARQUINES: I think
knowing your source is

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:57.040
the most important
thing and having

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.706
that relationship
with the farm, knowing

00:41:58.706 --> 00:42:00.250
that their processes
are locked in.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:03.280
And then you know what you're
getting year in, year out.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.430
I mean, mother nature
dictates a lot of that, too,

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.020
because one coffee
that's grown on one

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.436
side of the mountain that had
more rain than the other one

00:42:10.436 --> 00:42:13.190
on the other side is definitely
going to taste a lot different.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:17.560
It's our job as roasters to
not only vet out those farmers

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.960
and then create
that relationship,

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.880
and then trusting our farmers.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.220
And then from there,
they send us the coffee.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.246
And we don't mess it up.

00:42:25.246 --> 00:42:26.620
So we just try
not to mess it up.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.300
If you source good
coffee, the key

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:32.200
is, what I've learned throughout
the years, is to just source

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.490
good coffee.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:34.750
Don't mess it up.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.225
That's it.

00:42:36.225 --> 00:42:38.760
AUDIENCE: Do you
get consistently--

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.122
the bean is consistent enough
from a particular farmer

00:42:41.122 --> 00:42:42.666
or a particular region?

00:42:42.666 --> 00:42:44.290
MIKE ARQUINES: Yeah,
for the most part.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.040
For the most part.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.827
Yeah, I mean, you'll get
these really crazy micro lots

00:42:47.827 --> 00:42:49.660
that you probably have
never seen or tasted.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.470
But at the end of the day,
some of the coffees we source,

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.377
we have a relationship and we
can know what we're getting.

00:42:57.377 --> 00:42:59.210
This is going to
constantly taste like this.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:03.890
But again, that's why
quality control is paramount.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.820
We're tasting every day.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.030
We're cupping every day.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:08.850
Even the stuff that
we're always pouring,

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:12.610
we'll take random samples of
roasts from the previous day

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.520
and just cup it just to
ensure that our customers are

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.267
getting a similar and
consistent experience.

00:43:18.267 --> 00:43:20.350
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: And I
think that a lot of that,

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:21.560
too, is education.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.650
So a lot of consumers don't
realize that coffee is a crop.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:30.580
And that it's going to change
as you get new crops in.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.410
So a lot of that on
our part is being

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.860
able to educate the consumer,
like, hey, it is a crop.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.290
We have a new lot
of Costa Rica in.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:42.160
You'll find that maybe this
lot is a little bit more sweet

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.420
compared to the last lot.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.000
Do you know what I mean?

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.170
And it's not good or bad.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.740
It's just a different
crop of coffee.

00:43:50.616 --> 00:43:52.891
Yes.

00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:55.140
AUDIENCE: When you talk about
the different properties

00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:00.340
of coffee, like flavor,
fruitiness, bitter, sweet,

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.448
is there some measurement
that you guys do?

00:44:03.448 --> 00:44:04.864
Or is it just based
on tasting it?

00:44:04.864 --> 00:44:08.304
I decided this is
sweet, so I label it.

00:44:08.304 --> 00:44:09.470
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: There is.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:13.070
I mean, a Q Grader is actually--

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:17.811
there's a grading--
what is it called?

00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:19.310
MIKE ARQUINES: It's
a tasting sheet.

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:23.247
It's like a-- yeah, like scales
of acidity and a bitterness.

00:44:23.247 --> 00:44:25.205
BEVERLY MAGTANONG:
Sweetness, bitterness, body.

00:44:25.205 --> 00:44:26.217
MIKE ARQUINES: Body.

00:44:26.217 --> 00:44:28.550
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: And so if
you're actually a Q Grader,

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:33.200
you're tasting these coffees,
and you're able to grade them.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.360
And if you get a bunch
of Q Graders together,

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.470
those people should be able
to taste that one coffee

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:43.160
and be able to grade them
pretty similarly to each other.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.510
For us on our roaster
level, for us, it's just,

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:48.690
does it taste sweet to us?

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:49.689
Do you know what I mean?

00:44:49.689 --> 00:44:51.530
Does it taste good?

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:56.250
We're not necessarily going
into that detail of grading.

00:44:59.117 --> 00:44:59.950
Any other questions?

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.170
AUDIENCE: Do you all host
like coffee tasting events?

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:03.211
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: We do.

00:45:03.211 --> 00:45:04.450
We do.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.182
When we first started, we
were doing coffee cuppings--

00:45:07.182 --> 00:45:08.390
JELYNN MALONE: Every weekend.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.930
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Every weekend
at Abnormal Wine Company,

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:14.620
which is now the Cork and Craft
and Abnormal Beer Company.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.690
But we used to do
coffee cuppings

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.910
every week there as a way
to just get our name out

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.201
into the community, because
we were still operating out

00:45:21.201 --> 00:45:22.430
of the garage.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.670
And so now we will
do coffee cuppings.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:27.420
If you were to email
us and say, hey, I've

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.752
got a group of
eight people, then

00:45:29.752 --> 00:45:31.960
we could definitely accommodate
that and find a time.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.800
So if you guys ever want
to do that here at Google

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.240
and come up to Mostra and
have a coffee cupping,

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:41.890
we would be more than happy
to host that for you guys.

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:45.400
AUDIENCE: I see a lot of
similar things in the language

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.220
that you are using with wine.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.510
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Yes.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.320
AUDIENCE: Have you
ever considered

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:56.530
aging as a way to prove or
change the nature of the coffee

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.900
tasting?

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.132
MIKE ARQUINES: Sam.

00:46:00.132 --> 00:46:01.124
I'm just kidding.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.870
He's like, yes.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.800
Absolutely.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.540
Wine is a great example.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:14.960
But what's that
fact that you could

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.440
taste that there's more
flavors, detectable flavors?

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.120
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Yeah, there's
like over 1,000 more flavor

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.550
profiles to coffee than
there is wine, which

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.850
is really surprising to people.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.900
MIKE ARQUINES: Yeah, very, very.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.520
Yeah, we've aged wine--

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.240
or I'm sorry.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.920
We've aged-- whoa, no.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:36.140
We've aged coffee in wine
barrels, reds, whites, mead,

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.360
which is a honey wine.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.540
We actually won
"Draft" magazine top

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:48.610
25 liquids of, I think, it was
2016, and with our good friends

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.150
at Superstition Meadery
in Prescott, Arizona.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.080
So to be a coffee company
and to be able to have that

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.310
is pretty cool.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:56.610
But yeah, I agree.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.970
I think we're kind
of experimenting.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.030
We have an urban winery right
next to us called Koi Zen.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:04.010
And we saw them one day.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:07.512
And they pressed their
own grapes in house.

00:47:07.512 --> 00:47:08.720
And then they have the skins.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.430
And I'm looking at it.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.013
I'm like, man, they
look like raisins.

00:47:11.013 --> 00:47:15.050
They kind of look like cascara,
the skins from coffee cherries.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.930
So we're going to take
those and kind of experiment

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:20.405
with rehydrating
those into our coffee,

00:47:20.405 --> 00:47:22.280
and then trying to brew
a cold brew maybe out

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.289
of that, or maybe semi
heat extraction with it,

00:47:26.289 --> 00:47:27.080
and try to take it.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.920
Not trying to get the
volatiles out from the skins,

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.090
like the bitterness and
those acrid flavors.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:33.620
But yeah, definitely.

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.120
I mean, we take a
lot of inspiration

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.390
from wine, not just
spirits and beer.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.890
Yes.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.040
AUDIENCE: Maybe a
follow onto that.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.330
People appreciate wine.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.930
They're willing to
drop 30 or 300 or more

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:48.950
on a a bottle of wine.

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:49.460
MIKE ARQUINES: Right.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.690
AUDIENCE: Has your
experience been

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:52.310
that here, at least
in the US market,

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:54.800
maybe internationally
as well, people are

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.460
becoming more sophisticated?

00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:00.100
They understand that a
pourover of a small batch

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.944
is going to cost more than your
example earlier of gas station

00:48:02.944 --> 00:48:05.204
coffee.

00:48:05.204 --> 00:48:07.970
MIKE ARQUINES: I have this weird
infatuation with like diner

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.080
and gas station coffee.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.486
I'm just letting you know.

00:48:11.486 --> 00:48:12.860
I'm not saying it
tastes amazing.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.350
I'm just saying like I'm
not knocking it at all.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.060
But anyways, so I think
it's just what Bev said.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:23.530
I think it's educating
the public, and awareness

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.150
for these products, and the type
of micro lots that are offered.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.747
So why are you charging
$15 for a Panama Geisha?

00:48:29.747 --> 00:48:30.830
Well, let me tell you why.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:31.480
This is why.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.770
So again, awareness, education,
and that in turn turns into--

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.410
it's great for us, because
now it is an easier sell.

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:43.610
I'm not saying there's going
to be $8 cups of coffee.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:44.600
Maybe.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.290
I mean, maybe.

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:47.079
But yeah, I mean--

00:48:47.079 --> 00:48:49.620
JELYNN MALONE: Well, I was going
to say something that we do.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.900
So if you go to our shop,
education and experience

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.190
is a huge thing that we do.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:59.330
So our bar, so usually when
you go to a coffee bar,

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:01.340
the baristas are hiding
behind the big espresso

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.510
machines in the bar.

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:04.310
And you don't really
see what's going on.

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:07.670
But at Mostra, we
intentionally designed our bars

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.320
to be really low.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.120
Everything's low and open,
so you see the entire thing.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.050
We're actually-- I think
we're still the only coffee

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.930
shop in San Diego that has the
Mavam Espresso Machine, which

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:19.490
is a bar top espresso machine.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.324
There's no big machine
in front of you.

00:49:21.324 --> 00:49:22.240
So everything's below.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.990
So you get to see
the whole process.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.840
And I think part of
that is our attempt

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.100
to continue to educate the
consumer as to why they're

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.530
paying so much money, what
the process really is,

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.357
and all the details
that we as baristas,

00:49:36.357 --> 00:49:37.940
and coffee companies,
and us at Mostra

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.820
really put into every
single cup of coffee.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:45.860
So I think that's helping
it gain its value as well.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.242
MIKE ARQUINES: Absolutely.

00:49:48.242 --> 00:49:49.700
JELYNN MALONE: Any
other questions?

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.350
Yes.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.850
AUDIENCE: Since you're coming
from unrelated backgrounds,

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:57.410
I have an unrelated question.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:00.779
Could you improvise
and sing something?

00:50:00.779 --> 00:50:01.820
MIKE ARQUINES: Thank you.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:02.300
Thank you.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.675
JELYNN MALONE: Oh, my gosh,
I almost put her on the spot.

00:50:04.675 --> 00:50:07.850
SAM MAGTANONG: So I
fell in love with her

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.810
as a 16-year-old in the
choir in high school.

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.880
And it was her voice that
made me fall in love.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.140
And when I went to Iraq in
'06 and '07 and I came back

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:23.450
a little hurt from the
experience, it was music,

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:27.140
and it was her music
that restored my soul.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.790
So I would absolutely
love it if you

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:32.247
can sing a few bars in
front of this audience

00:50:32.247 --> 00:50:33.580
and in front of a live audience.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.413
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: I'll
give you a line, OK?

00:50:35.413 --> 00:50:36.105
A line.

00:50:36.105 --> 00:50:39.905
[SINGING OPERA]

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:48.500
And that's it.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.680
That's what everyone's getting.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.590
It's true.

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:57.761
I am a classical singer.

00:50:57.761 --> 00:50:58.260
Yes.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.218
AUDIENCE: I liked that.

00:50:59.218 --> 00:51:00.800
Well, first of all,
congratulations.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.490
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Thank you.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:03.073
AUDIENCE: We loved
hearing your story.

00:51:03.073 --> 00:51:05.540
Thank you for like adding
your personal touches.

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.125
And I was going to ask about
Mostra Coffee as a brand

00:51:08.125 --> 00:51:10.125
and what it meant to you
guys, but you mentioned

00:51:10.125 --> 00:51:11.270
where the name came about.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.790
I'd love to hear what's
next for you guys.

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:15.530
You guys have opened two shops.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:18.920
What do you guys see in the
next couple of years at Mostra

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.240
in San Diego or beyond?

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.320
JELYNN MALONE: OK.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.290
Where do I begin?

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:24.110
Uh, no.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:27.380
Definitely expanding
into more locations.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.390
It's so crazy, because
we're in Carmel Mountain

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.450
Ranch in San Diego.

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:34.220
So that's like north,
inland San Diego.

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:39.650
And people drive from LA,
Orange County, Riverside County,

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.350
East Lake, I mean,
all over San Diego

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:45.620
to come to our shop in little
old Carmel Mountain Ranch.

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.297
And it's crazy, because
we, the three of us,

00:51:48.297 --> 00:51:50.630
Sam, Bev, and I, all went to
Ranch Bernardo High School.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:53.260
So anyway, it's a trip.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.240
So we want to become more
accessible to the community

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.010
and open up more
locations around town.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:04.870
So by next year, next
year, we should have--

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:05.870
my husband's back there.

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:06.920
Three more locations.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.050
OK.

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:11.690
So yeah, definitely
expanding that way.

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:16.100
We are celebrating our fifth
anniversary party in January,

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:22.520
and featuring like 7,
8, 30, 40, 50 beers.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.760
I can't even keep track.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.300
But we're having a
massive, massive event.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:30.050
And we actually sold tickets
to our anniversary party

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:30.890
yesterday online.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.098
And I'm not even kidding you.

00:52:32.098 --> 00:52:34.820
We sold 600 tickets
in under one minute.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:36.890
And the tickets were not cheap.

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:37.580
Thank you.

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.040
MIKE ARQUINES: How
much were there?

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:38.831
How much were they?

00:52:38.831 --> 00:52:43.840
JELYNN MALONE: They
were $187 a ticket.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.880
Anyway, it's insane.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.390
But it's just a lot of
that collaboration energy.

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:53.230
We are featuring a ton
of beers that we've

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.230
done over the last year.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.119
So a lot of craft
beer people are

00:52:56.119 --> 00:52:57.410
coming from all over the place.

00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:00.750
And they camped out in front
of our shop on Friday night.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:04.441
We did like a small in-store
sale in our shop on Saturday

00:53:04.441 --> 00:53:04.940
morning.

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:08.480
And I drove by at 9:30 the night
before, and there were people.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.700
They were like, oh, I
drove in from Arizona

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:12.440
to buy a ticket to your
anniversary party in January.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.640
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: They
were camping out there.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.120
JELYNN MALONE: What's that?

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.200
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: They
were camping out there

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.190
at 9:00 PM on a Friday night.

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:20.060
JELYNN MALONE: So
anyway, so we just--

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.099
expanding is definitely
number one right

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:24.140
now, which is to do that.

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.723
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Our hope is
20 stores in the next 10 years,

00:53:26.723 --> 00:53:28.470
is what we would love to do.

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:29.630
So that's our goal.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:31.890
JELYNN MALONE: And as Mike
was mentioning cold brew,

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:34.010
like we were known as
a cold brew company.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.570
People knew because we infused--

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:39.410
we do sell like regular
single origin cold brew,

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:41.180
but we also do a lot
of innovative stuff

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.590
where we infuse our
cold brews with all

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:43.589
these different flavors.

00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:45.350
We'll do stuff that
tastes like vanilla.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:48.260
We'll do stuff that tastes
like vanilla and strawberry,

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:52.610
chocolate-covered strawberries,
Ferrero Rocher flavored.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.840
I mean, it's just
all over the place.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.980
And so I think something
that would take things

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.230
to the next level is to
actually can our cold brews

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.304
and make them accessible
to just people

00:54:02.304 --> 00:54:04.970
nationally, because I can't even
tell you how many emails we get

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:07.099
from people on the
East Coast like,

00:54:07.099 --> 00:54:08.390
we want some of your cold brew.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:11.120
And we're like, uh,
we don't ship that.

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:15.800
But definitely expanding our
cold brew line is a big one.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.920
Continuing our efforts
in the Philippines

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.260
to just bring that
Philippine bean here

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:24.470
and to grow the market for it,
so roasters all over the world

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:28.487
start sourcing coffee from
the Philippines as well.

00:54:28.487 --> 00:54:31.070
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Just building
our coffee program even more,

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:34.760
and our direct trade
relationships even more.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.090
JELYNN MALONE: And then as Mike
said, we do barrel-aged coffee,

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:40.850
so just really expanding on
the barrel-aged coffee program,

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:43.280
which is just us continuing
to push the envelope

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:47.250
and be innovative with
everything that we do.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.250
BEVERLY MAGTANONG:
So a lot of things.

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:52.580
JELYNN MALONE: Oh,
Sam has something.

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:57.350
SAM MAGTANONG: And then just, I
think, lastly, for four years,

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.115
it was us.

00:54:58.115 --> 00:55:00.920
We did everything, and we had
the opportunity to expand.

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.500
We've got 25 employees
now on payroll.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.760
I've got four children.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.843
We're trying to create a
sustainable business that

00:55:06.843 --> 00:55:10.780
feeds families, and is able to
support a sustainable career.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:15.950
So we'll keep working hard, and
keep staying true to our story.

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:18.500
And if you all are
in Carmel Mountain

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.525
Ranch in Rancho Bernardo,
please come by and say hi to us.

00:55:21.525 --> 00:55:22.900
BEVERLY MAGTANONG:
Stop by, yeah.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:23.733
MIKE ARQUINES: Yeah.

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:29.450
JELYNN MALONE: So after this
talk and you head outside,

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:32.960
we actually have a bunch of
coffee samples for you guys

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.890
to try.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:37.370
We have-- do you know which
ones that they brewed today?

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:39.890
MIKE ARQUINES: We have
the Ethiopia hambela,

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:41.727
which is a natural
press process coffee.

00:55:41.727 --> 00:55:44.060
And then we have a yirgacheffe,
which is a wash process.

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.393
So it's going to be interesting.

00:55:45.393 --> 00:55:48.230
We wanted to bring two
different Ethiopians,

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.120
but different processes
so you could kind of

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.250
see the differences in those.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:54.904
JELYNN MALONE: Do you guys
know what processing means?

00:55:54.904 --> 00:55:56.695
I thought Bev was going
to talk about that.

00:55:56.695 --> 00:55:58.310
BEVERLY MAGTANONG:
So processing is

00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:03.230
what happens after the cherry
gets picked from the tree.

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:05.450
So there's natural
processing, which

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:10.970
is when they actually sometimes
leave the cherry on the seed.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:12.770
And a lot of times
what can happen

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:15.680
is that the cherry
or this coffee

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:19.620
will retain a
berry flavor to it.

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.980
And then there's also washed,
where they take-- they depulp

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.920
the cherry off of the seed.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.890
It goes through fermentation
and drying and all of that,

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:30.042
and then you'll get more
of what Mike was saying,

00:56:30.042 --> 00:56:32.000
a lot of lemony flavors,
a lot of tart flavors.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.890
So you're going to
be able to taste

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.860
those differences
between this Ethiopia

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.860
hambela and an
Ethiopia yirgacheffe,

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.140
because the hambela is a
natural process coffee,

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.929
and the yirgacheffe is a
washed processed coffee.

00:56:44.929 --> 00:56:46.720
JELYNN MALONE: How
about the other coffees?

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.469
We have one Brazilian today.

00:56:48.469 --> 00:56:50.760
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Yeah, we
have One-Brazilian Coconut.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.580
It's a cold brew.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:56.300
And then we've got some beer.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.970
JELYNN MALONE: And we actually
have a short roasting demo

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:00.780
right outside when
you guys walk out.

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.060
So we actually brought
our one-pound roaster.

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.410
And you can actually
see the green beans.

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.060
If you've never
seen green beans,

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.320
it's right there for
you to see as well.

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.880
So is that it, guys?

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.380
Yeah?

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:10.060
BEVERLY MAGTANONG: Yeah.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:10.610
I think so.

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:13.910
JELYNN MALONE: Thank you so
much for having us, you guys.
