1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,060
I can't.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,740
This is an expression that is vilified
in our minds beginning at a young age.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,400
Every time a young child announces
this decision, they are corrected.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,290
The first adult that hears it, ask them
whether or not they have even tried.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,550
Generally this confrontation will result
in the child giving their task another

6
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,790
attempt until they're attention
span moves on to something else.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,140
The adult will see this and chocolate to
themselves with knowledge that this is

8
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:30,910
just a child who is yet to learn the
art of art and virtue of perseverance.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,610
By the time this child
comes of age, however,

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,450
they will have been told by adults more
times than they could count that there

11
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,580
is no such thing as can't.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,980
It is interesting then to think about
how many adults seem to proclaim this

13
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:48,040
expression in their lives. It is because,

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,790
is it because like many things
that adults tell children,

15
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,630
they are simply telling the
child a general rule that
the child must follow but

16
00:00:55,631 --> 00:01:00,631
can be broken once one is grown or
has it because these adults are simply

17
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:05,140
repeating what they were told as children
without thoroughly examining what the

18
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:08,530
phrase I can't truly suggests.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,900
If you confronted an adult that claims
they can't do something with the same

20
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,910
question about whether
or not they have tried,

21
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,100
the answer will almost always be yes.

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,380
Adults have learned enough to know that
it is unreasonable to say they can't

23
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,990
until they have at least
tried once. Therefore,

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,710
the real question that we
should be asking and responses,

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,780
have you tried everything?

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,430
Have you exhausted every possible
option, scenario, combination,

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,230
tool and approach?

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,030
I do not simply refer to the ones that
you knew of at the time you decided to

29
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,200
undertake your task.

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,310
I mean have you re also researched
possibilities that you had known about?

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,410
Have you determined whether or not there
is another person out there that has

32
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:59,280
performed the exact same task you are
attempting or at least something similar?

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,280
Have you exhausted this research? Have
you read every book, blog, Journal,

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,460
magazine, bathroom stall and website?

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,980
If the answer to any of these questions
is no, then go back and try again.

36
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,090
Because if you don't,

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,480
because you don't truly know if you
can do something until you've tried

38
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,920
absolutely everything.

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,690
The fact of the matter
is that rarely if ever,

40
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,990
is the answer to all of
these questions. Yes.

41
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,610
Therefore, what is it that people
actually mean when they say,

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,640
I can't a more accurate but more
verbose way of saying it would be,

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,090
I don't care about or want enough this
task or the resultant benefits of it in

44
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:49,920
order to do all that is
necessary to achieve it.

45
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,790
Okay.

46
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,990
I was told countless numbers of times
by people during my month of marathons

47
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,740
that they couldn't run one
marathon, let alone 30 straight.

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,450
Every now and then when I had time
I would discuss what they'd said.

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,090
We would jointly conclude
that if something they
cared about and dependent on

50
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,730
them doing so, it would be possible.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,340
The most common example I used was if
someone had a gun to your child's head,

52
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,930
do you think you could
do it? Then therefore,

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,520
the phrase I can't denotes a lack of
investment as opposed to a lack of

54
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,080
potential or ability.

55
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,690
I do not mean to say that every person
I had this conversation with should have

56
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,710
had the motivation to run marathons.
It was something that I decided to do,

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,720
not them. I merely wanted to express
to them what I am expressing here.

58
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,930
Given the right purpose
and enough time you can.

59
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,670
What happens if someone
has said they can't?

60
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,660
We have asked them if they've
done everything and the
rare cases happen and they

61
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:07,680
honestly say yes. Do we concede
that then they can't? Nope.

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,760
If everything in existence
has been attempted enough
to determine that it won't

63
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,590
work, then congratulations.

64
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,710
You've been awarded the honor of being
the person who must invent the method or

65
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:23,160
the tool or determine the right
combination, whether or not you will.

66
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,910
Once again boils down to
how much you care and time.

67
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,650
It may end up being that a person
ends up trying for their entire life,

68
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,310
but I suggest removing the phrase I
can't from your lexicon and replacing it

69
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:40,500
with, I can't yet.

70
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,250
Okay,

71
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,780
do this so that you don't risk
being on your death bed saying,

72
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,940
I didn't.
