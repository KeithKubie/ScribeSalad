00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.050
This is migration mark in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.919
And I've just ordered what I think is maybe
one of my favorite meals in the entire world,

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.989
it's called nasi camper and ikan bakar which
is a grilled fish, just grab some of the vegetables,

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.700
dip in with your hand.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.350
Flavored with coconut milk, aww, it's so good.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.180
Some of this eggplant.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:03.199
And then this giant block of tofu in chili
sauce.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.097
Malaysian food is one of the finest foods
on earth for sure.

00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:12.539
The grilled mackerel fish, called ikan bakar.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:22.120
I'm going to grab a piece first, which sauce,
I'm going to try this sauce first, chillies,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.950
grab a piece of that.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.150
Oh, that is, that is insane.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.909
Even though I just had a fish, I couldn't
resist eating another ikan bakar.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:48.659
This is Malaysian style, grilled Malaysian
style fish.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.490
It's just, the aroma, will force you to stop.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.901
I'm going to try to get in here and get a
seat.

00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:59.770
First dip it in the sauce provided, put that
on the rice.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:16.769
Oh, it's killer, it's marinated in some orange
red sauce that's unbelievable.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:32.269
I just got a snack, little dumpling things,
almost like empanadas, they're filled with

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:40.250
beans and spices, some kind of daal or gobi
spice.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.380
Oh, it's like an Indian Malaysian empanada.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.290
It started down pouring outside so dipped
into this restaurant called Restoran Yusoof

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.310
Masakan Kari and I'm going to drink one of
the most popular beverages in Malaysia which

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:14.450
is called teh tarik, and it's a milk, sweet
milk tea.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.820
I have arrived at the pinnacle destination.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:25.380
Hameed's fish head curry, we're going to go
get some nasi kandar which is Indian food,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.280
Malaysian style.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.850
Get a piece of chicken, let me grab one.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.580
As you can see, I couldn't control my excitement,
ended up ordering a lot more food than I should

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.580
have, but I'm quite happy about it.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:47.420
This Hameed's mutton curry is some of the
best stuff I've ever had actually.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.169
So tender, vegetables, this is the nasi kandar.

00:03:53.169 --> 00:04:01.000
We've got daal which is wonderful, it's almost
a soup daal.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.040
And Hameed's is also famous for their tandoori
chicken, looks at that, it's just red and

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040
beautiful.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:27.870
Got a bone in here but, it's so smokey, it
came straight out of the clay oven.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.900
Throw some daal on it too, why not.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.660
It's awesome.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.510
The heap of food has now been reduced to a
few chicken bones and some sauce on my fingers.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.360
I've reached almost the end on this twelve
our munch fest in Kuala Lumpur, the final

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.070
dish is going to be something called nasi
lemak, it's right before me, and it's a real

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.210
Malaysian classic comfort food.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.110
Rice, an egg, dried fish with peanuts, and
dried fish in a red sauce.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.770
That red sauce is just killer.
