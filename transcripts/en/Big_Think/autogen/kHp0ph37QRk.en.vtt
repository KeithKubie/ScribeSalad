00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.500
hi Jase so your question is how

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510
hi Jase so your question is how
 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.720
hi Jase so your question is how
widespread is it within NASA that

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730
widespread is it within NASA that
 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.279
widespread is it within NASA that
scientists are convinced that human

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289
scientists are convinced that human
 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.019
scientists are convinced that human
activity is responsible for climate

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029
activity is responsible for climate
 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.279
activity is responsible for climate
change and this is something that it's

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289
change and this is something that it's
 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.080
change and this is something that it's
important to say very very clearly I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090
important to say very very clearly I
 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.359
important to say very very clearly I
have known and worked with hundreds of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369
have known and worked with hundreds of
 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.740
have known and worked with hundreds of
earth scientists at many different

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750
earth scientists at many different
 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.460
earth scientists at many different
locations in NASA all of them all of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470
locations in NASA all of them all of
 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.470
locations in NASA all of them all of
them believe that human activity is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480
them believe that human activity is
 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.389
them believe that human activity is
responsible for the current climate

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399
responsible for the current climate
 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.400
responsible for the current climate
change that we see going so fast it's

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410
change that we see going so fast it's
 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.440
change that we see going so fast it's
almost unprecedented I want you to think

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450
almost unprecedented I want you to think
 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.720
almost unprecedented I want you to think
about that one thing that I take really

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730
about that one thing that I take really
 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.700
about that one thing that I take really
seriously and I'm very proud of is that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710
seriously and I'm very proud of is that
 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.580
seriously and I'm very proud of is that
NASA is not a political organization we

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590
NASA is not a political organization we
 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.319
NASA is not a political organization we
are scientists I work for the American

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329
are scientists I work for the American
 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.180
are scientists I work for the American
people we're funded by taxpayer money

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190
people we're funded by taxpayer money
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.430
people we're funded by taxpayer money
and what we do is we make measurements

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440
and what we do is we make measurements
 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.799
and what we do is we make measurements
we have many many different satellites

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809
we have many many different satellites
 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.240
we have many many different satellites
that are orbiting the Earth right now

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250
that are orbiting the Earth right now
 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.340
that are orbiting the Earth right now
they're looking at things like ice on

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350
they're looking at things like ice on
 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.200
they're looking at things like ice on
the oceans and at the poles they're

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210
the oceans and at the poles they're
 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.400
the oceans and at the poles they're
looking for things like vegetation

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410
looking for things like vegetation
 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.619
looking for things like vegetation
growth and the change of that ocean

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629
growth and the change of that ocean
 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.479
growth and the change of that ocean
level is the ocean level rising yeah it

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489
level is the ocean level rising yeah it
 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.880
level is the ocean level rising yeah it
turns out that it is so we have many

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890
turns out that it is so we have many
 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.069
turns out that it is so we have many
scientists all over the planet studying

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079
scientists all over the planet studying
 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.660
scientists all over the planet studying
all of the different ramifications of

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670
all of the different ramifications of
 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.300
all of the different ramifications of
climate change we understand the causes

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310
climate change we understand the causes
 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.340
climate change we understand the causes
there actually is no scientific

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350
there actually is no scientific
 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.649
there actually is no scientific
controversy about that humans are

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659
controversy about that humans are
 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.899
controversy about that humans are
releasing greenhouse gases into the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909
releasing greenhouse gases into the
 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.550
releasing greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere and this is warming our

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560
atmosphere and this is warming our
 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.120
atmosphere and this is warming our
planet

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130
planet
 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.679
planet
now what scientists are researching

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689
now what scientists are researching
 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.809
now what scientists are researching
currently and they don't all agree about

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819
currently and they don't all agree about
 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.639
currently and they don't all agree about
is what are the most important

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649
is what are the most important
 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.529
is what are the most important
components of driving climate change is

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539
components of driving climate change is
 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.660
components of driving climate change is
it carbon dioxide could it be something

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670
it carbon dioxide could it be something
 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.219
it carbon dioxide could it be something
else like methane when methane gets

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229
else like methane when methane gets
 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.629
else like methane when methane gets
released that's an even more powerful

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:33.639
released that's an even more powerful
 

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:36.359
released that's an even more powerful
greenhouse gas we don't agree on how

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369
greenhouse gas we don't agree on how
 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.339
greenhouse gas we don't agree on how
quickly things like the ocean level will

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349
quickly things like the ocean level will
 

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.559
quickly things like the ocean level will
rise people have different estimates for

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569
rise people have different estimates for
 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.809
rise people have different estimates for
how quickly that will happen so there

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819
how quickly that will happen so there
 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.029
how quickly that will happen so there
still is scientific controversy about

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039
still is scientific controversy about
 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.859
still is scientific controversy about
what the most important aspects of

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869
what the most important aspects of
 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.899
what the most important aspects of
climate change are and how quickly it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909
climate change are and how quickly it
 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.209
climate change are and how quickly it
will go in the future but there is no

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219
will go in the future but there is no
 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.519
will go in the future but there is no
scientific disagreement within NASA that

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:53.529
scientific disagreement within NASA that
 

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:55.889
scientific disagreement within NASA that
humans are causing climate change now I

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899
humans are causing climate change now I
 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.449
humans are causing climate change now I
started this off by saying that one of

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459
started this off by saying that one of
 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:58.739
started this off by saying that one of
the things I'm very proud of is that

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749
the things I'm very proud of is that
 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.989
the things I'm very proud of is that
NASA is not political and what that

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999
NASA is not political and what that
 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.629
NASA is not political and what that
means for me is that I cannot advocate

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639
means for me is that I cannot advocate
 

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:05.159
means for me is that I cannot advocate
for any specific solution to climate

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.169
for any specific solution to climate
 

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:07.649
for any specific solution to climate
change that's not my job that's up to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659
change that's not my job that's up to
 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.570
change that's not my job that's up to
policy makers people might suggest

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580
policy makers people might suggest
 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.520
policy makers people might suggest
things like having more solar energy or

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530
things like having more solar energy or
 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.140
things like having more solar energy or
cutting carbon emissions or things like

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150
cutting carbon emissions or things like
 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.440
cutting carbon emissions or things like
that but at NASA we really understand

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450
that but at NASA we really understand
 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.780
that but at NASA we really understand
that's not us that's up to the American
