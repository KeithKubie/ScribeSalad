so imagine that a drunk driver hits you

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069
so imagine that a drunk driver hits you
 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.500
so imagine that a drunk driver hits you
and you'reyou're it crushes crushes your

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510
and you'reyou're it crushes crushes your
 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.140
and you'reyou're it crushes crushes your
leg and you're completely traumatized by

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150
leg and you're completely traumatized by
 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.230
leg and you're completely traumatized by
the events and they take you to the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240
the events and they take you to the
 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.750
the events and they take you to the
hospital and just before your operation

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
hospital and just before your operation
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.609
hospital and just before your operation
they give you a pill to erase your

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619
they give you a pill to erase your
 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.070
they give you a pill to erase your
memory of this traumatic event or

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080
memory of this traumatic event or
 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.540
memory of this traumatic event or
imagine that you're a fellow soldier and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550
imagine that you're a fellow soldier and
 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.980
imagine that you're a fellow soldier and
your soldier and your fellow soldier

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990
your soldier and your fellow soldier
 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.200
your soldier and your fellow soldier
gets blown up next to you and you're

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210
gets blown up next to you and you're
 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.090
gets blown up next to you and you're
very traumatized and again they give you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100
very traumatized and again they give you
 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.299
very traumatized and again they give you
a pill to reduce the trauma of this

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309
a pill to reduce the trauma of this
 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.849
a pill to reduce the trauma of this
particular event or imagine that your

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859
particular event or imagine that your
 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.469
particular event or imagine that your
heroin addict and you are they give you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479
heroin addict and you are they give you
 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.869
heroin addict and you are they give you
a drug so that so that you can forget

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879
a drug so that so that you can forget
 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.000
a drug so that so that you can forget
about your addiction in order to help

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010
about your addiction in order to help
 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.059
about your addiction in order to help
you with your addiction cells sounds

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069
you with your addiction cells sounds
 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:52.709
you with your addiction cells sounds
like something from a movie well

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719
like something from a movie well
 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.289
like something from a movie well
actually we're getting to be getting

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299
actually we're getting to be getting
 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.959
actually we're getting to be getting
pretty close to be able to do some of

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969
pretty close to be able to do some of
 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.939
pretty close to be able to do some of
these things so this is what we know now

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949
these things so this is what we know now
 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.279
these things so this is what we know now
and what we can do now basically

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289
and what we can do now basically
 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.350
and what we can do now basically
memories a system for storing and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360
memories a system for storing and
 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.140
memories a system for storing and
recalling experiences our best account

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150
recalling experiences our best account
 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.030
recalling experiences our best account
of memory right now is as follows

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040
of memory right now is as follows
 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.190
of memory right now is as follows
basically we experience certain events

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200
basically we experience certain events
 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.820
basically we experience certain events
and a set of a network of neurons get

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830
and a set of a network of neurons get
 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.090
and a set of a network of neurons get
activated the the more significant the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100
activated the the more significant the
 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.900
activated the the more significant the
event the more the stronger the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910
event the more the stronger the
 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.270
event the more the stronger the
connections between the neurons when we

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280
connections between the neurons when we
 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.750
connections between the neurons when we
recall that particular event these

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760
recall that particular event these
 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.450
recall that particular event these
neurons get that network that particular

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460
neurons get that network that particular
 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.580
neurons get that network that particular
network gets reacted they get

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590
network gets reacted they get
 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.910
network gets reacted they get
reactivated again and so this is what we

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920
reactivated again and so this is what we
 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.550
reactivated again and so this is what we
can do to affect to modify our memories

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560
can do to affect to modify our memories
 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.490
can do to affect to modify our memories
one is we can affect it at the store the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500
one is we can affect it at the store the
 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.290
one is we can affect it at the store the
storage level when it's about the gift

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300
storage level when it's about the gift
 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.790
storage level when it's about the gift
store when it's about to get transferred

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800
store when it's about to get transferred
 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.080
store when it's about to get transferred
from short-term memory to long-term

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090
from short-term memory to long-term
 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.440
from short-term memory to long-term
memory and the way to do that is to

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450
memory and the way to do that is to
 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.020
memory and the way to do that is to
affect the emotional strength of the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030
affect the emotional strength of the
 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.080
affect the emotional strength of the
store the storing process so for example

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090
store the storing process so for example
 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.600
store the storing process so for example
propranolol the drug that's how it works

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610
propranolol the drug that's how it works
 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.290
propranolol the drug that's how it works
it works by weakening that that storage

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300
it works by weakening that that storage
 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.360
it works by weakening that that storage
a process that weak weakening the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370
a process that weak weakening the
 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.180
a process that weak weakening the
emotional strength so that the the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190
emotional strength so that the the
 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.219
emotional strength so that the the
memory doesn't get stored into the

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229
memory doesn't get stored into the
 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.250
memory doesn't get stored into the
long-term memory the other process is

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260
long-term memory the other process is
 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.410
long-term memory the other process is
through is by affecting the recall

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
through is by affecting the recall
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.010
through is by affecting the recall
of the memory basically each time when

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020
of the memory basically each time when
 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.860
of the memory basically each time when
each time you recall a memory the memory

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870
each time you recall a memory the memory
 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.950
each time you recall a memory the memory
has to reconsolidate itself again and

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960
has to reconsolidate itself again and
 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.710
has to reconsolidate itself again and
they meats proteins to do that and

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
they meats proteins to do that and
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.870
they meats proteins to do that and
there's it's been found that if there's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880
there's it's been found that if there's
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.030
there's it's been found that if there's
excess protein that can disrupt the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040
excess protein that can disrupt the
 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.340
excess protein that can disrupt the
reconsolidation process thereby

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350
reconsolidation process thereby
 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.030
reconsolidation process thereby
weakening the memory the biggest

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
weakening the memory the biggest
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.190
weakening the memory the biggest
limitation to memory modification right

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200
limitation to memory modification right
 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.040
limitation to memory modification right
now is that basically as we have seen

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050
now is that basically as we have seen
 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.740
now is that basically as we have seen
that memories a network of neurons so

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
that memories a network of neurons so
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.260
that memories a network of neurons so
that means that basically it's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270
that means that basically it's
 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.300
that means that basically it's
interconnected and it overlaps with one

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310
interconnected and it overlaps with one
 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.490
interconnected and it overlaps with one
another so that there's a danger that if

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500
another so that there's a danger that if
 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.180
another so that there's a danger that if
you delete one its you can delete other

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190
you delete one its you can delete other
 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.340
you delete one its you can delete other
memories so that's one of the biggest

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350
memories so that's one of the biggest
 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.980
memories so that's one of the biggest
limitations right now so suppose you can

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990
limitations right now so suppose you can
 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.230
limitations right now so suppose you can
perfect this technology what are some of

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240
perfect this technology what are some of
 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.160
perfect this technology what are some of
the ethical issues

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170
the ethical issues
 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.230
the ethical issues
well basically memory is a piece of

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240
well basically memory is a piece of
 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.810
well basically memory is a piece of
evidence so if you change your memory

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820
evidence so if you change your memory
 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.400
evidence so if you change your memory
you can change what you believe to be

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410
you can change what you believe to be
 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.950
you can change what you believe to be
true about the world and about yourself

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960
true about the world and about yourself
 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.280
true about the world and about yourself
so for example a soldier who takes

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290
so for example a soldier who takes
 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.290
so for example a soldier who takes
propranolol this may keep you may think

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300
propranolol this may keep you may think
 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.980
propranolol this may keep you may think
that he's not he really doesn't want to

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990
that he's not he really doesn't want to
 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.890
that he's not he really doesn't want to
be in the war when in fact he lasts

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900
be in the war when in fact he lasts
 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.990
be in the war when in fact he lasts
after the killing or you may believe

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000
after the killing or you may believe
 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.670
after the killing or you may believe
something about yourself you may think

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
something about yourself you may think
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.010
something about yourself you may think
that you're really brave or cowardly or

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020
that you're really brave or cowardly or
 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.180
that you're really brave or cowardly or
you may think that you're really

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190
you may think that you're really
 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.510
you may think that you're really
altruistic or selfish but if you take

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520
altruistic or selfish but if you take
 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.650
altruistic or selfish but if you take
some memory modification drugs you may

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
some memory modification drugs you may
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.830
some memory modification drugs you may
change what you believe to be true about

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840
change what you believe to be true about
 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.000
change what you believe to be true about
yourself but these problems are not so

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010
yourself but these problems are not so
 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.040
yourself but these problems are not so
worrying because one thing to remember

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050
worrying because one thing to remember
 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.080
worrying because one thing to remember
is that a bit of falsehood might not be

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090
is that a bit of falsehood might not be
 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.960
is that a bit of falsehood might not be
so problematic so if you wanted to

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970
so problematic so if you wanted to
 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.240
so problematic so if you wanted to
believe that you had a nice holiday so

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250
believe that you had a nice holiday so
 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.400
believe that you had a nice holiday so
that you can feel more relaxed that may

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410
that you can feel more relaxed that may
 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.210
that you can feel more relaxed that may
be ok as long as you don't harm anybody

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220
be ok as long as you don't harm anybody
 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.660
be ok as long as you don't harm anybody
another thing to remember is that if the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670
another thing to remember is that if the
 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.150
another thing to remember is that if the
event is so important it's not really

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160
event is so important it's not really
 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.900

people will remember it so even if it

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480
people will remember it so even if it
 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.390
people will remember it so even if it
affects a bit of falsehood in you it

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400
affects a bit of falsehood in you it
 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.880
affects a bit of falsehood in you it
might not affect other people as well

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890
might not affect other people as well
 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.709
might not affect other people as well
okay so all

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719
okay so all
 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.769
okay so all

we the point of using these drugs is to
 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.359
we the point of using these drugs is to
increase our personal well-being now

constraint is of it is to sort of harm

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:41.049
constraint is of it is to sort of harm
 

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:43.289
constraint is of it is to sort of harm
to others if you want to take these

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:43.299
to others if you want to take these
 

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:46.079

drugs so that you you can feel less

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:46.089
drugs so that you you can feel less

this would constitute a harm to others

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:50.489
this would constitute a harm to others
 

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:54.239
this would constitute a harm to others
and there another constraint is harm to

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:54.249
and there another constraint is harm to
 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.719
and there another constraint is harm to
self an obvious example of that is if

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729
self an obvious example of that is if
 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.999

you just wipe all of your memories that

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009
you just wipe all of your memories that
 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.069
you just wipe all of your memories that
would be in most many cases that would

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:02.079
would be in most many cases that would
 

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:05.309
would be in most many cases that would
be obvious harm to self but there are

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319
be obvious harm to self but there are
 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.309
be obvious harm to self but there are
also subtler forms of harm to self self

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319
also subtler forms of harm to self self
 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.889
also subtler forms of harm to self self
harm such as living in falsehood

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:12.899
harm such as living in falsehood
 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:16.169

ultimately the it seems that as long as

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419
ultimately the it seems that as long as
 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.069
ultimately the it seems that as long as
as long as you don't harm other people

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:31.079
as long as you don't harm other people
 

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:34.489
as long as you don't harm other people
you should be allowed to use these

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:34.499
you should be allowed to use these
 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.059
you should be allowed to use these
memory modification drugs to in order to

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069
memory modification drugs to in order to
 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:46.080
memory modification drugs to in order to
improve your personal well-being

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090
 
 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.390
 
it's it's well you saw how they zapped

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400
it's it's well you saw how they zapped
 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.340
it's it's well you saw how they zapped
it right so basically the whole network

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350
it right so basically the whole network
 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.250
it right so basically the whole network
I think you're zapping the whole network

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260
I think you're zapping the whole network
 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.610
I think you're zapping the whole network
and that's going to be pretty difficult

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620
and that's going to be pretty difficult
 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.430
and that's going to be pretty difficult
without zapping other memories but the

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440
without zapping other memories but the
 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.379
without zapping other memories but the
way to do it I think it's basically if

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389
way to do it I think it's basically if
 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.280
way to do it I think it's basically if
you can get the right cues because

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290
you can get the right cues because
 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.560
you can get the right cues because
basically you cue the memory so if you

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570
basically you cue the memory so if you
 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.780
basically you cue the memory so if you
can cue it right then only those

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790
can cue it right then only those
 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.490
can cue it right then only those
networks come up and then use that that

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500
networks come up and then use that that
 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.159
networks come up and then use that that
then I think you can do it and actually

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169
then I think you can do it and actually
 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.840
then I think you can do it and actually
there's some evidence I'm doing that if

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850
there's some evidence I'm doing that if
 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.270
there's some evidence I'm doing that if
you look at fmi machines it's kind of it

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280
you look at fmi machines it's kind of it
 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.969
you look at fmi machines it's kind of it
seems like through correlations they can

seems like through correlations they can
 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.129
seems like through correlations they can
begin to figure out which part is you

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139
begin to figure out which part is you
 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.960
begin to figure out which part is you
know what people are thinking or what

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970

up and it seems like if you can get

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320
up and it seems like if you can get
 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.620
up and it seems like if you can get
enough consistency enough of a

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630
enough consistency enough of a
 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.440
enough consistency enough of a

memory then maybe you can begin to do

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820
memory then maybe you can begin to do
 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.850
memory then maybe you can begin to do
that but you'd have to do that many

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860
that but you'd have to do that many
 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.210
that but you'd have to do that many
times and get you know sort of a lot of

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220
times and get you know sort of a lot of
 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.909
times and get you know sort of a lot of
correlation and stuff like that I think

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919
correlation and stuff like that I think
 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.330
correlation and stuff like that I think
that would be the way to go
