00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.920
- [Instructor] We're told that some boxes

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.910
of a certain brand of breakfast
cereal include a voucher

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.850
for a free video rental inside the box.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.990
The company that makes the cereal claims

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.220
that a voucher can be
found in 20% of boxes,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.460
however, based on their experiences

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.160
eating the cereal at home,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.680
a group of students
believes that the proportion

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.420
of boxes with vouchers is less than 20%.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.270
This group of students
purchased 65 boxes of the cereal

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.620
to investigate the company's claim.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.100
The student found a total of 11 vouchers

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.050
for free video rentals in the 65 boxes.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.150
Suppose it is reasonable to assume

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.940
that the 65 boxes purchased

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.540
by the students are a random sample

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.670
of all boxes of this cereal.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.230
Based on this sample, is there support

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.530
for the students' belief
that the proportion

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.690
of boxes with vouchers is less than 20%?

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.710
Provide statistical evidence
to support your answer.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.730
And so, like always, pause this video

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.750
and see if you can answer it by yourself,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.160
and this actually is a question
from an AP statistics exam.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.610
Alright, now let's work
through this together

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.160
and I'm going to try to model some

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.060
of what you might wanna do
if you were actually trying

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.400
to answer this on an exam.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.900
So, the first thing
you might wanna say is,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.680
well, what's our null and
our alternative hypothesis?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.330
Well, our null hypothesis would be,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.080
well, the reality is what
the breakfast brand claims,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.450
that 20% of the boxes contain a voucher,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.360
so that would be our null hypothesis,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.870
and our alternative hypothesis
would be what we suspect,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.500
that the true proportion of boxes

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.060
that contain a voucher is
actually less than 20%.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.040
Now, if you're going to
do a significance test,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.870
it's good practice to set
up your significance level

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.890
that you're going to
eventually compare your p-value

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.430
to ahead of time.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.270
And so, let's say we would want to assume,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.120
assume significance level,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.130
so let me write this, significance,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.580
significance level

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.690
alpha,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.450
let's just go with 0.05,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.570
and then we'll wanna
think about the sample.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.530
And we're going to figure out,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.130
if we assume that the
null hypothesis is true,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.770
what's the probability that we get

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:21.820
the sample proportion that we do?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.750
And if that is below
this significance level,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.210
then we would reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.260
And so, what we know about the sample,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.137
we know that we took 65 boxes of cereal,

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:37.480
n is equal to 65, they tell
us that right over there,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.540
and from that, we can calculate

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.270
what the sample proportion is.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.330
It's going to be 11 out of 65

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.220
and we can get our calculator out,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.890
calculators are allowed
on this part of the exam.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.060
And so, what is 11

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.200
divided by 65?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.490
It gives us, and I'll just round

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.400
to the nearest thousandth, 169.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.100
0.169.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.740
0.169,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.110
I'll say approximately
'cause I rounded it there.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.450
Now, the next thing we wanna do

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.670
before we make an
inference is to make sure

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.000
we're meeting the
conditions for inference,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.250
so I'll write this down over here.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.280
Conditions,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.550
conditions for inference,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.720
conditions for inference,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.040
and this is to feel good

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.110
that we have properly
sampling the population,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.970
that our sampling distribution is going

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.380
to be roughly normal.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.230
So, the first one is random sample

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.220
that is truly a random sample

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.830
and here they tell us.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.460
It is reasonable to assume
that the 65 boxes purchased

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.410
by the students are a random sample,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.700
so that checks that off.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.520
So, I will just point that
to that right over there,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.100
so that checks that off.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.310
The next one is the normal condition,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.690
that the shape is roughly normal

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.650
and it isn't skewed dramatically
one way or the other

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.540
and in order to meet that condition,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.800
the sample size times the
true assumed proportion,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.420
and we're going to assume that
the null hypothesis is true,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.310
and so, we could say that,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.890
and we could even say that
this is the proportion

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.230
assumed in the null hypothesis.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.680
That's what that notation would imply,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.400
and if you're doing
this on the actual test,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.720
you should explain your use
of notation a little bit more

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.270
than I might do for the sake of time.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.960
But this needs to be
greater than or equal to 10

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.030
and n times one minus the
assumed proportion needs

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.200
to be greater than or equal to 10.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.390
Well, let's see, n is 65,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.390
so 65 times the assumed proportion is 0.2.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.560
That is going to be equal to 13.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.440
13 is indeed greater than or equal to 10,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.540
so that checks off.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.210
And then we would take n 65

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.800
times one minus the
assumed proportion, so 0.8,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.920
and that is going to
be equal to, let's see,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.370
that would just be 65 minus 13,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.480
which is going to be equal to 52,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.950
and that indeed is also
greater than or equal to 10.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.220
So, we met that condition right over there

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.790
and then the last one is the independence.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.490
Independence.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.310
We aren't sampling these
boxes with replacement,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.080
so we need to feel good
that they are less than 10%

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.960
of the population of boxes,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.790
and they don't tell us that explicitly,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.480
but it would be good practice to say going

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.810
to assume,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.800
assume

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.240
more

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.800
than,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.210
let's see, 10 times that,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.410
650 boxes in the population.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.580
Boxes in population,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.250
population,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.250
which would imply that n is less than 10%

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.550
or less than or equal
to 10% of population,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.250
of population, which would allow us

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.630
to check off the independence condition.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.880
And so, given that we've met
our conditions for inference,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.450
now let's think about the
sampling distribution.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.660
So, the sampling distribution

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.590
of the sample proportions

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.760
because that's what we're going to use

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.790
to calculate a p-value.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.050
So, we know a few things about
the sampling distribution

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.670
of the sample proportions.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.840
We know that the mean of
the sampling distribution

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.260
of the sample proportions is just going

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.770
to be the assumed true proportion,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.180
so that's the proportion
from the null hypothesis,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.730
and we know that the standard deviation

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.140
of the sampling distribution

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.650
of the sample proportions.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.750
This is going to be equal to,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.820
and we've seen this in
multiple videos already,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.280
this is the assumed
proportion times one minus

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.980
the assumed proportion
from our null hypothesis,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.070
divided by n, which in this case is going

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.710
to be equal to

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.120
0.2

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.100
times 0.8,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.430
all of that over at 65.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.780
Once again, let's get our calculator out.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.380
So, we're gonna have the square root

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.430
of 0.2

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.470
times 0.8

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.070
divided by 65

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.210
and then close my parentheses.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.360
I get,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.070
so 0.0496.

00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:10.710
So, this is approximately 0.0496.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.560
Now, the next step is to
figure out the p-value

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.550
which we can then compare
to our significance level

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.740
to decide whether or not to
reject the null hypothesis.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.210
And in order to calculate the p-value,

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.890
let's figure out our z statistic,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.600
which is, how many
standard deviations above

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.040
or below the mean of the
sampling distribution

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.710
is the sample statistic that we happen

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.310
to get for this sample of 65?

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.890
And we have seen this in previous videos.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.670
This would be equal to
our sample proportion

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.960
minus the assumed proportion

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.260
for the population in the null hypothesis,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.800
so the difference between those,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.170
and then divided by the standard deviation

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.380
of the sampling distribution
of the sample proportions.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.680
This would tell us how many
standard deviations are we above

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.020
or below the mean of the
sampling distribution.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.460
So, in this particular situation,

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.460
this is going to be 0.169

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.070
minus

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.903
0.2,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.300
all of that over this
value right over here,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.670
which is approximately 0.0496.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.270
I can get the calculator out again.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.100
And so, we have 0.169

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.080
minus 0.2,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.500
so that's how far below
our sample proportion is

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.590
than the mean of the
sampling distribution,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.100
which is the assumed proportion
from the null hypothesis,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.900
assumed population proportion,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.130
and then we divide that.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.050
We're gonna divide that
by the standard deviation

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.130
of the sampling distribution

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.260
of the sample proportions,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.000
so divide that by 0.0496

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.890
and we get a z-value of approximately,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.150
'cause remember, this is using a bunch

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.910
of approximations right over here,

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.300
about negative 0.625.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.170
So, z is approximately

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.510
negative 0.625

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.030
and so now we can think
about the actual p-value.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.020
Our p-value,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.000
which is equal to the probability

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.820
of getting a sample proportion

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.530
that is at least as low
as the one that we got,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.710
so a sample proportion that is less than

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.590
or equal to the one that we got, 0.169.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.800
Assuming the null hypothesis is true,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.130
so we could say assuming
the null hypothesis is true,

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.670
which is equal to the probability

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.800
of getting a z statistic that is less than

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.690
or equal to this value right
over here, negative 0.625.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.350
And now we can use our calculator

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.120
to actually calculate this.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.430
So, what we can do is,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.000
we can go to second distribution.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.990
We wanna do normative, normalcdf,

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.950
so go to normalcdf,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.040
and then our lower bound
is actually going to be,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.300
we could say negative infinity.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.670
Our upper bound is going to be negative,

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.220
so negative 0.625,

00:10:33.581 --> 00:10:36.010
625.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.500
This is, you could say a normalized

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.580
normal distribution here,

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.950
so we'll just go with all of this

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:43.790
'cause we're just thinking about

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.160
the Z statistic right over here,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.400
click enter,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.330
and then click enter.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.750
And then we get, this is going to be,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.300
lets say, 0.266.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.580
So, this is approximately 0.266,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.370
and so let's just make
sure what we just did.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.370
If this right over here is the
assumed sampling distribution

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.000
of the sample proportions

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.670
where we are assuming that
our null hypothesis is true,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.820
so the mean of our sampling
distribution is going

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.640
to be our assumed proportion,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.660
what we're saying is, look,
we got a result over here.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.030
This is where our p-hat
happened to be right over here.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.050
What's the probability of getting a result

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.560
that far below the true
proportion or further?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.580
So, this is what we calculated just now.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.600
Now when you look at this, this
is almost a 27% probability.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.660
When you compare our p-value,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.910
we're gonna compare our p-value

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.410
to our significance level

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.950
and we see that our p-value
is clearly greater than

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.630
our significance level,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.990
0.266

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.440
is clearly greater

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.870
than our significance level of 0.05.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.250
What we were saying is,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.310
if there was less than a 5% chance

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.240
of getting the sample
proportion that we got,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.460
then we would reject the null hypothesis,

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.160
which would suggest the alternative,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.040
but here the probability

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.480
of getting the sample
proportion that we got,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.040
if we assume that the
null hypothesis is true,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.490
is almost 27%,

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.230
and so that's well above
our significance level,

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.000
so we will fail.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.850
So, because of this,

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.460
because of this, we fail

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.810
to reject,

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.310
reject our null hypothesis,

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.690
and from that, we can
say not enough evidence

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.870
to suggest

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.700
our alternative hypothesis.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.550
And if you have time you might wanna say,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.420
there's not enough evidence to suggest

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.690
that less than 20% of the boxes

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.440
have the free video rental voucher

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.970
that they talked about in the
original problem description.
