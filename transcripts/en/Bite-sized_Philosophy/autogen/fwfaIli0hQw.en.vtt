00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.300
 All right. The question is why young people follow ideals that do not lead to resonance? 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.080
 They have no value system. 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.200
 The island of temptation is a good example. 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.620
 The children brought to the island are lost. 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.600
 There is nowhere to go. They have no identity. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.500
 That is why they turn to local pleasures. 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.200
 And that's better than nothing. But, the problem of local pleasure, 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.020
 at least according to the fairy tale, well, be careful if you are impulsive. 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.860
 Because otherwise it will hit you hard. 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.020
 And the reason is, 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.280
 that you are looking only for a period of time. 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.380
 And the problem is that things multiply between all the times. 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.160
 Just because something works well at this point, 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 cocaine, for example ... 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.460
 It does not mean that it is a suitable solution for the section of all problems. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.120
 That's why people often follow 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.300
 local pleasure, because this is their best idea, because they are taught. 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.220
 They see no other alternative. 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.880
 They may be ignorant or simply do not want to take responsibility. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880
 Because part of the problem with 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.900
 work at all levels of the hierarchy simultaneously, 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.480
 is like dancing a very complicated waltz. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.120
 You have to pay attention to many things at once and do everything right. 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 That is why responsibility is required. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320
 And that's it... 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.060
 pain. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.800
 Weight is one of the reasons people drink alcohol is to withdraw from their responsibilities. 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.560
 You hear people say they drink because they have problems. 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.500
 "It is so." Is not. 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.840
 Some people drink because they worry 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.680
 and alcoholics drink because they are in abstinence. 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.900
 But young people drink because they are shaken by their responsibility. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.240
 Because it's annoying. I'm going to get drunk and I will not care about the close and not so close consequences, 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.820
 because that's what makes alcohol. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.160
 Do not blind you to these close and not so close consequences, 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.040
 but it makes you do not care. 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.680
 And partly because it reduces anxiety. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.060
 So it reduces anxiety and keeps the emotional center intact, 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.000
 so you can go out and do stupid and fun things. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.420
 This is the party real. Let's do stupid and fun things. 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.440
 This is a party. 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.540
 But ... 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.120
 The near and less immediate consequences are ... 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.660
 It's scared. 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.360
 It does not mean you do not have to do it, but it is risky. 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.060
 They do not know a better alternative. 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.060
 That's what I would say is my answer.
