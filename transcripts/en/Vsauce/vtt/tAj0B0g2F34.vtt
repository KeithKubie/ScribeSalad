Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.890
And this video is to tell you that I released
a brand new Vsauce leanback - a playlist of

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.740
some of my favourite videos from all over
YouTube, with me hosting in between.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.730
You can only really watch it on a computer,
so if you're on a mobile device or something

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.419
else weird wait until you're in a better position
to lean back.

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:29.570
To make it worth your while, in this video
I've got news, a fact and math.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.810
Three things.
First of all, the news item.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.200
Hazel.
Vsauce t-shirts.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.720
Let's try to act a little bit more mature.
Vsauce t-shirts.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.660
We've got the logo,
we've got brains and here's the fact.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.280
Are you ready?
For this one drop some knowledge and hear

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.480
some order happen.
You're not using this take, are you?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.680
Baby... Baby carrots are made out of adult carrots.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.850
No!
Weird adult carrots, they shave them into

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.710
the little baby carrots that we know.
But they just, it just stops growing and it's

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.600
a baby carrot.
No.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.090
They take adults, especially ugly adult carrots
that look weird and they shave them into good shapes.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.330
I don't know, dog food or something.
But wait a second.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.780
Baby corn really is baby corn.
It's normal corn and they don't let it grow

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.800
to adulthood, they kill it when it's a kid
and then they serve it to you and you eat

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.760
it when it's still a baby.
That makes me feel better.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:30.080
Now it's time for some mathematics.
Okay, first of all, it does not matter at

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.940
all what order the cards are in.
This is completely a mathematical trick.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.109
So anyone can do it and there's no slide of
hand involved.

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.009
I'll shuffle it, so I can just prove that
to you.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.189
All we need are 9 cards.
One, two, three.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.429
One, two, three.
One, two, three?

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.299
Three, very good.
Now, pick a pile that you fancy.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.709
Alright, now choose a card out of that pile.
You can look at them all, yeah.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.159
Okay.
Okay, now you can totally show me what it

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.579
is, 'cause it's a math trick.
So put it right on top.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.380
Three of diamonds, good choice.
Now, what I'm gonna do is take the rest of

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.879
our 9 cards and stick them right on top.
The rest of the deck, all this whole mess

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.439
thing here, doesn't matter.
Get it out of the way.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.060
Now, because of the range of numbers of letters
in every single card's name and because your

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.989
card is the third from the bottom, three of
diamonds, this will always work.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.929
Let's spell out your card's name.
Three of diamonds.

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:32.520
T. H. R. E. E.
Rest on top.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.019
What's the next word?
Of.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.239
O. F.
Rest on top.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.000
Diamonds.
Spell it out for me.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.530
D. I. A. M. O. N. D. S.
Rest on top.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.740
Okay.
Now.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.480
Okay, are you ready for this?
Yes.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.189
Alright, now what I want you to do is say
the phrase "Hazel is really super awesome."

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.420
Okay.
Okay?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.239
Uhm.
As I drop a card you say a word.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.599
Okay.
Hazel is really super awesome.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.100
There's your card.
No way!

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.680
That'll work every single time.
Try it at home.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.060
I learned it from mismag, a magician I've
included in the leanback before.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.659
I put an interactive trick of his in this
leanback, it's a long one, you're gonna learn

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.569
a lot of different stuff that goes all over
the place, it's gonna pack your brain with

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.219
knowledge.
Alright?

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.439
It's gonna all covered in Vsauce when we're done.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.879
So start than leanback.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.940
And as always,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.180
thanks for watching.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.340
Bye.
