00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.324
(energetic music)

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.558
- Now, trust me, alright?

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.161
I was in Orlando, ran
into Tiger Woods, okay?

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.362
He said, see, like,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.296 align:start size:84% position:16%
you guys are going
wide with your stance,

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.798
you wanna bring it in a bit.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.466
Bring it in a bit, that way
you know where you rotate.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.968 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Okay.
- Bring that rotation around.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.069
(exhales)

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.103
- Mmhmm.
- Wow.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.271
You know, and that was before

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.639 align:start size:84% position:16%
he got himself
involved in this mess.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:40.940 line:0%
- Yeah, I haven't been able to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.242 line:0%
make it out to the
links in a while.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.643
My little cousin's going to this

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.512
AND1 Mixtape Tour camp

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.348
and he got crossed the
fuck up by the Professor.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.417 line:0%
Knees bent, ass up, head way up.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.418
- Nice.
- Mmhmm.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.652
- There it is!

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.154 align:start size:88% position:13%
- That looks good, dude!
- That looks great.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.422
- That was awesome stuff!
- That looked so good.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.357
- That's where it is.
- It looked so good.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:58.591 line:0%
- Yes.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.193
Hole-in-one.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.261
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.262 line:0%
- Head down.
- Pick it up.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.530 line:0%
- See this?

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.165
This is bad, that
I can touch you.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.666 line:0%
- What you wanna
do is, you wanna

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.935 line:0%
keep your head all the way up
to the last fucking second.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.804
(speaking over each other)
- You drop your head too far,

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.173 align:start size:84% position:16%
your head'll fall
off, you drop too far.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.175 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know, you had a
couple too many Tequizas.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.444
(laughing)

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.446
Tell you what, I've been

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.814
screened three times at airports

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.316 align:start size:88% position:13%
for bringing box cutters
on, but it's because

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.751
I can't get into
my damn luggage.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start size:97% position:3%
My wife puts too many
locks on the freaking shit.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.089
- Ah, yeah.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.825 align:start size:97% position:3%
What a beautiful day to
hit the old freaking links,

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.259
you know what I'm talking about?

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.360
- Absolutely.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.164
- See you on the
green, ass boys.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:52.779
(lighthearted music)

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.581
Fuck my ass up!

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.650 align:start size:88% position:13%
(applause)
What the hell was that?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.918
(obnoxious grunts)

00:01:58.918 --> 00:01:59.686
- Hey, would you
mind shutting up?

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:00.620
- Encino Man.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.955
Oh my God!

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.090 align:start size:84% position:16%
(pained coughing)
You pull your kidney?

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.692
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.327 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is for all my
buddies that got shot.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:08.595
- Let's go, Scott Baio.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:09.796
- Let's go, Frankie Muniz.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.564
- Everybody's on my shit, chill!

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:15.135 align:start size:97% position:3%
Everybody's putting pressure
on me for no reason!

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.402 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Get back up off me!
(applause)

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.037 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I've been watching
too many YouTube videos.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.974
(crowd cheering)

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.477
(talking over each other)

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.481 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You stepped on my foot!
- Let's go!

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.251 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Apologize to me!
- Let's go!

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.585 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's you.
- No, I think that's--

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.720
- Stop, you're being childish.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.221 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're being
ridiculous right now.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.557
- You're being immature.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:38.892 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Really?
- That was mature.

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.426
- In high school, I had a car!

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.628
- Kobe, right?

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:42.829
- Yeah.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.630 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, where you
wanna go to school?

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.964
- Let's go, bags.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.367
Fuck!
- Fuck!

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.701
- Move, tree!
- Move, tree!

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.669
- I'm gonna call the mayor.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.637
- I'm gonna call the mayor.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:51.738
- Meet the mayor on the phone.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.705
- Meet the mayor on the phone.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:53.940
- I don't care what mayor,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.376 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got a fucking
tree in my shit ass.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.544

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:58.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, pound on this!
- Pound this.

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:03.049 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And the golf carts?
(speaks spanish)

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:03.883
Okay?

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.818
(speaks spanish)

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:06.653
- You wanna get into Dartmouth?

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:07.954
I'll make a call today,

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.389
you run this up to the green.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.823
- (chuckles) You mean cheat?

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:13.560
- Look, I love you so much,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.628
but why I got three
putters in my bag?

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.965
- Oh my god, there's
so much dirt on this.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:22.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
- (Laughs) That's a
funny, hilarious voice!

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.504
- Adults don't buy
these kinds of bags.

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.239
Adults buy bags with a strap.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.540 align:start size:81% position:19%
I have to carry
this under my arm,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.474
it's heavy, it sucks.

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.309
- I bought it with a strap,

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.910
but it's a Gucci strap,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.413
and I don't trust you with it.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.983
(cartoon noise)

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:40.019
- Ooh, I'm pissed off now.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.721
You done pissed me off now.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.356 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hey, can I still get
into Dartmouth, you think?

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.390
- Stay behind me.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.125
He's self-destructive.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.493
You need to watch that sand.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:48.661
- This morning, I found my kid

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.763
eating a whole box of Bisquick.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:55.101 align:start size:97% position:3%
No milk or nothing, just
went to town on the Bisquick.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:56.636 align:start size:72% position:28%
(grunts)
(phone rings)

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.037
- Hold up, hold up!

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:58.871
Hello?

00:03:58.871 --> 00:03:59.706
Holy shit.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:00.773
- What?

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.742
- We got Osama!

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:03.676 align:start size:72% position:28%
We got Osama!
(cheers)

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.179
(Star-Spangled Banner on guitar)

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.947
- So, you go to school, or?

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.616
- Yeah, high school.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.851 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Nice, yeah, my daughter
goes to high school.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.653
Maybe I'll stop
by, see what's up

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.154
next time I'm there.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:15.989
- [Gary] That was four!

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.624
- I counted 27 strokes.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.926 align:start size:81% position:19%
Man, you are so
full of sandpaper.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.127
- What is going on?

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.128
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:25.331
- There's bugs in there!

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.400 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's bugs, I was trying
to get the bugs out.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.702
Looks like it's clean now.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:30.970
I was trying to
get the bugs out!

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.772
- You tried to put your
little pecker in there!

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.440
- What's going on?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.142
- I'm going through
a divorce, dude!

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.377
- No, you're not!

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:39.746
- Oh, crap, I think I
have gum in my hair.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:40.747 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Hey, pal.
- Come on, buddy.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:41.581
Come on, come on.

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:42.882
- Actually, leave him.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:46.386
Okay, let's look at the
final scores, fellas.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:49.455
Gary, 197!

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.923
(happy scream)

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:51.858
- Yes!

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:53.760
Love my boys, I love my boys.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.595
- What a score, baby!

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:56.963
- I'm okay with me, today.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.631
(laughs)

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.266
- I'm also fine with
me, today, though.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.401
- That's great.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:04.203 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Cheers to that shit!
- Absolutely.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.471
- [Carmen] Love you, dudes.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.406
- Love you, dudes.
- Love you, dudes.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.242
(heartfelt music)

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:25.124
(whimsical music)
