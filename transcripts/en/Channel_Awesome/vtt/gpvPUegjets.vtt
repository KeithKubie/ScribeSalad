00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.580
Yeah. Because out of all the Disney properties that people seem to love the most...

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.740
...it was Pocahontas.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.040
Clearly we needed a sequel to that!

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.680
Truth be told I don't know what's more shocking: the fact that they actually made a sequel

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.500
to this film that was so historically inaccurate, and... the majority of audiences didn't like

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.180
and even many said was the beginning of the downfall of hand drawn Disney animation...

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.760
...Or the fact that - I can't believe I'm saying this -

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.940
I actually enjoy this one a little bit more than the original.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.080
But, if you know what I think of the original, that's not saying much.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.620
It's still not good. In fact, there are scenes that are downright cringe-worthy to sit through.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.180
But again, as I'm finding out with some of these Disney sequels, there was a legitimate talent going in, that...

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.380
...I have to admire on some levels.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.060
...Sorta.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.420
The film opens up as stupid as you'd think a movie called 'Pocahontas II' would open up.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.040
John Smith is apparently killed by the villain from the last film, Ratcliffe.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.480
Somehow, through some very confusing exposition, especially for a kids' film,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.540
This means that the white man can go and invade Pocahontas' tribe.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.800
But one man named John Rolfe, played by Billy Zane, believes this is unfair.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.600
So he pleads with the king to talk to the chief and see if they can work out something between the two.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.720
The chief is resistant though, especially seeing how the settlers on their land are not always the best...

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.980
-Heheh, just wait until what happens in the future...-

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.000
But Pocahontas, his daughter, offers to go in his place.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.700
Rolfe begrudgingly agrees, but thinks there's still some way to turn this into something positive,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.500
...even if he's not getting the chief himself.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.400
Pocahontas is thus introduced to a new world and finds out that if she's gonna make any progress, she has to adapt.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.840
Thus, she learns their etiquette, their way of doing things, and of course...

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.320
...puts on a pretty dress that they can market to all the Disney princess lines.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.700
(let's see, where is it...) There she is!

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.240
It's borderline a 'My Fair Lady'-story, but keeps just interesting enough that it doesn't become too clichÃ©d.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.480
And she does a good job winning the people over,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.480
showing that they're not all just savages, and that they can in fact be very intelligent and very peaceful.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.200
But when Ratcliffe brings in a bear to torture, as apparently this was some sort of entertainment in the day...

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.720
...I'm not sure if that's true, but if we allowed bullfighting I guess anything's possible...

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.860
Pocahontas stands up for the poor creature, thus driving the king insane for some reason,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.100
(he) orders her to be thrown in jail and the attack on her people to begin.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.560
...And we go right back into stupid territory again.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.800
With swordfights, John Smith returning, a romance blooming... even though

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.840
apparently the person she fell in love with before doesn't count anymore,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.600
even though he was kinda still interested, but not...

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.260
But it's okay, because her as the capable strong hero is... suddenly seen doing very little in terms of saving the day all of a sudden...

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.140
It gets so stupid.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.500
There's an immense tragedy with this film, because, unlike the first one,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.560
I didn't always know where it was going,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.020
and the way it was written and the way it was animated and the way it was paced...

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.300
...it was surprisingly kind of engaging.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.940
With the first film, I knew every second, every line, every character, what was going to happen, it was so predictable.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.180
You knew the exact message, plot, when things were gonna happen... it was just ridiculous.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.940
The only thing it really had going for it was a good color scheme and some nice music.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.900
Here, the color scheme and the music aren't quite as good, obviously with the budget cut,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.300
but there is still a lot of artistic merit.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.360
Not only is some of the scenery really nice, and BY GOD, I forgot what a good singer the voice actress of Pocahontas is,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.080
but I felt the expressions in this were much stronger than the last one.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.460
In fact, a lot of scenes of pointless dialogue are taken out, just replaced by how they look!

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.620
Look at this scene where Pocahontas is saying goodbye to her best friend:

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.320
they barely say a thing, but look at that! Look at the emotion in their faces! It's remarkable!

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.560
There's another great scene where she first sees the king, and she freezes.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.220
They never explain why, they never talk about it, but... you just feel the moment.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.460
And it's a quiet scene, there's not a lot of in-your-face music, it can actually be very subtle!

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.040
There's a real conflict between how much of Pocahontas' culture does she give up to adapt,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.440
and how much does she hold on to.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.880
What does she sacrifice for the greater good?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.000
That's ten times more interesting than what we got in the last film,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.440
where you knew from beginning to end what was gonna happen!

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.540
I really hated how at the end of the last film she didn't go to the new world, she just stayed with her people,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.600
and I thought: Why? Why are you closing those possibilities, why are you keeping things seperate?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.220
But in this one, you do see the lands explored, you see how she reacts to things,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.640
and it's interesting, and it's charming, and the romance is nice,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.180
and this whole side character that's following her around trying to protect her: he's cool!

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.080
I like how all the people don't know how to accept her but they don't immediately shun her,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.720
they're just curious, they're unsure, and... I don't know, it just felt more relatable, it felt more interesting.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.800
Which is both surprising, but also a shame that it started off so terrible and it ends so terrible.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.340
I've never seen a movie where the middle was the best part!

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.340
Again, for what these people had to make, and what could have so easily be a phoned-in project,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.560
I really felt they were trying!

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.520
It just... didn't work!

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.460
...Whether it be because of notes from Disney, or they just made the wrong choices,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.560
or they didn't think the thing all the way through...

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.440
But... yeah! To its credit, there were much more moments where I was sucked in with Pocahontas II,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.060
than I was with the first one.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.880
So, I guess if you're really interested in checking out, I would probably say...

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.360
...just fast-forward to where she's going to the new world, and then stop at where they're torturing the bear.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.100
...Because anything outside of that is garbage.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.120
But, for some strange reason, the middle part of this movie is actually pretty strong.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.680
...Okay, it's not perfect, but... it's Pocahontas II! I was thoroughly impressed I got anything interesting at all!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.320
So I... guess I'm glad some parts of it worked - Hell, actually a good chunk of it worked.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.980
But it still doesn't work as a complete whole, and that does really damage it.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.420
The bad scenes aren't just bad, they're embarrassingly bad.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.360
If you're curious, it's not creatively bankrupt. Actually, I am glad I saw this movie... or at least, the middle, anyway.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.180
But the rest of the colors of the wind, sadly, aren't blowing me away.
