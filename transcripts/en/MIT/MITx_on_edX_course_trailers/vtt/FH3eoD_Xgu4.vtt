00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.490
EUGENE FITZGERALD: What do
you think innovation is?

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.140
ANDREAS WANKERL: Innovation is the
process of putting ideas into useful

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.640
form and bringing them to market.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.320
EUGENE FITZGERALD: When you think about
innovation you might be thinking

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.270
of the smartphone, or Facebook, or
eBay, or iTunes, or Pandora.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.740
ANDREAS WANKERL: However, these are
incremental innovations, built upon

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.580
earlier, more fundamental innovations.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.680
EUGENE FITZGERALD: Like transistors,
[? sub-ejector ?]

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.810
lasers, or integrated circuits.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.730
In the past, pipelines existed
to help innovators.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.690
Innovation took years to development,
and created growth for decades.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.970
However, these pipelines
no longer exist.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.890
ANDREAS WANKERL: We are in a worldwide
innovation crisis.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
This crisis has impacted everyone
and everything.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.580
And it has stunted worldwide
economic growth.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.450
Something needs to be done.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.390
EUGENE FITZGERALD: A new paradigm
shift is necessary.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.550
We'll teach you how to think about
innovation, about the processes and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.370
the language involved.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.490
ANDREAS WANKERL: It's time to get back
to business, the business of

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.150
innovating.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.550
So roll up your sleeves
and jump into 3.086x.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.235
EUGENE FITZGERALD: Become
part of the solution.
