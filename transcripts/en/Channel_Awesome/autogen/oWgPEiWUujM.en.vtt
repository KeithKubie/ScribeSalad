the alien to be based on what he was

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
the alien to be based on what he was
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.590

just gonna grab some wood and we're
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.950
just gonna grab some wood and we're
gonna plot out you know the design and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960
gonna plot out you know the design and
 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.810
gonna plot out you know the design and
stuff like that and cut it and start

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820
stuff like that and cut it and start
 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.060
stuff like that and cut it and start
sanding it and assembling all the pieces

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070
sanding it and assembling all the pieces
 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.680
sanding it and assembling all the pieces
and stuff like that so that should be

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690

so I'm going to test it out a little bit

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
so I'm going to test it out a little bit
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.530
so I'm going to test it out a little bit
it looks like it's pretty comparable to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540
it looks like it's pretty comparable to
 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.780
it looks like it's pretty comparable to
the plastic well which I really used to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790
the plastic well which I really used to
 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.790

like that they don't make that product
 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.540
like that they don't make that product
anymore though unfortunately I have some

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550
anymore though unfortunately I have some
 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.550
anymore though unfortunately I have some
packs of sculpt but that takes a little

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560
packs of sculpt but that takes a little
 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.190
packs of sculpt but that takes a little
bit of time to cure and I want to just

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200
bit of time to cure and I want to just
 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.699
bit of time to cure and I want to just
kind of knock this out as quick as

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709
kind of knock this out as quick as
 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.000

just uh cut the ears off or cut into
 

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.830
just uh cut the ears off or cut into
them and kind of Reese Culp them a

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:39.840
them and kind of Reese Culp them a
 

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.850
them and kind of Reese Culp them a
little bit and then we sculpt the eye

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860
little bit and then we sculpt the eye
 

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.210
little bit and then we sculpt the eye
area and stuff and add some latex on the

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220
area and stuff and add some latex on the
 

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.490

I think it'll be a good skeleton for the

00:13:59.780 --> 00:13:59.790
I think it'll be a good skeleton for the
 

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.350
I think it'll be a good skeleton for the
alien design and I'm gonna use some of

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360
alien design and I'm gonna use some of
 

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.360
alien design and I'm gonna use some of
this free form sculpt is a two-part

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:07.370
this free form sculpt is a two-part
 

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.910
this free form sculpt is a two-part
epoxy sculpting epoxy it's pretty much

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920
epoxy sculpting epoxy it's pretty much
 

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.330
epoxy sculpting epoxy it's pretty much
like plastic sculpt and I've got a

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:14.340
like plastic sculpt and I've got a
 

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.100
like plastic sculpt and I've got a
little bit longer working time on it and

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.110
little bit longer working time on it and
 

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.820
little bit longer working time on it and
so then I'm gonna apply it and sculpt a

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:19.830
so then I'm gonna apply it and sculpt a
 

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.910
so then I'm gonna apply it and sculpt a
little bit and it'll harden on there and

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920
little bit and it'll harden on there and
 

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.610
little bit and it'll harden on there and

and then when I add the rods and I can

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360
and then when I add the rods and I can
 

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.870
and then when I add the rods and I can
manipulate it it'll have a bit more of

manipulate it it'll have a bit more of
 

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.680
manipulate it it'll have a bit more of
an organic kind of motion and stuff like

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:18.690
an organic kind of motion and stuff like
 

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.450
