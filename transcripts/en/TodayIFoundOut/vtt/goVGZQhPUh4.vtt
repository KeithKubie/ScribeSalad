00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:13.540
The 
holiday of Easter is celebrated by over two

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.919
billion Christians globally.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.740
Marking the day that Jesus rose from the dead,
it’s always commemorated on a Sunday in

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.000
the spring.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.130
Despite this, the exact date has consistently
changed throughout the many centuries the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.070
holiday has been recognized.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.050
Additionally, various sects of Christianity
(most prominently the Greek Orthodox Church)

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.680
often celebrate Easter on a totally different
date than their peers.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.740
Why is that?

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.190
Why is there no set date for Easter and how
do they ultimately decide the date of Easter

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.430
each year?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.580
The rather complex answer has a lot to do
with the differences in the solar and lunar

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.580
calendars.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.809
Easter’s roots could date back to before
Jesus’s birth, perhaps even having pagan

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:53.809
origins.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.859
Some scholars believe that the English word
“Easter” comes from the Anglo-Saxon goddess

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.789
Eostre, who represented spring, plantings,
new beginnings and fertility.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.900
Much like how Christmas matches up with the
winter solstice, there’s thought that Easter

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.140
was intentionally lined up with the spring
equinox to encourage those more comfortable

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.200
with pagan traditions to join Christianity.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.090
While many scholars and Christian historians
deny this connection, there’s compelling

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.040
evidence that Christianity adopted other religion’s
traditions in order to make their religion

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.410
more accepted.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.380
Influenced by paganism, Greco-Roman religions,
Judaism, Islam and even Buddhism, Christianity

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.960
(like all other religions) did not exist in
a vacuum and many of the elements that are

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.620
practiced today were a product of the ancient
world’s intermingling of cultures.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.780
For example, in some parts of the world lamb
is traditionally eaten on Easter, with the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.630
roots of this tradition in Jewish Passover
feasts.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.570
In fact, the Greek/Latin variant of the word
“Easter” is “pascha,” which is loosely

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.020
translated to “Passover” in English.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.270
The Jewish religion adheres to the lunar calendar,
meaning it's based on the moon phases.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.460
As explained by Judaism 101, the lunar calendar
is based on three astronomical phenomena:

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.240
the rotation of Earth on its axis, the moon’s
revolution around the Earth and the Earth’s

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.010
revolution around the sun to determine the
day, month and year (respectively).

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.880
But a calendar based on the moon is not conducive
to an agricultural society, which needs an

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.000
accurate way of knowing when to plant and
harvest.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.140
So, about 4,800 years ago, civilizations started
shifting over to a solar calendar with the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.160
Egyptians leading the way.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.180
Now, the lunar and the solar calendars don’t
quite mesh.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.720
On average, the moon revolves around Earth
in 29.5 days and the Earth around the sun

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.460
every 12.4 lunar months.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.700
This means that a lunar year is about 11 days
shorter than a solar year, which wreaks havoc

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.140
on the calendar even over just a decade.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.150
For example, planting season in ancient Egypt
was between November and March, but with the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.200
calendar shifting every year by 11 days, it
caused the seasons to not appropriately line

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.750
up and created very serious problems for farmers.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.400
Even when Jewish leaders added a 13th month
(Nissan) to try to balance out the drift,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.670
it didn’t work (even if every three years,
the month shifts back by 30 days) and added

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.510
an extra 19 days onto the solar calendar.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.490
In 45 BCE, Roman Emperor Julius Caesar tried
to restart the calendar.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.830
With the help of astronomer Sosigenes, the
“Julian calendar” was instituted on January

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.890
1st, 45 BCE.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.950
With the belief that the solar year was 365
days and 6 hours long, an extra day was added

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.190
to February every four years - what we now
know as the leap year.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.320
This calendar soon spread across Europe and
was accepted by Christianity.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.910
About four hundred years later, the Roman
Emperor Constantine convened the First Council

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.590
of Nicaea to set a few ground rules around
this calendar.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.840
They determined that the spring (vernal) equinox
will occur every year on March 21st.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.450
They also determined that Easter will fall
on the first Sunday following the ecclesiastical

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.220
full moon (which falls on the 14th day of
the lunar calendar) and after the spring equinox.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.420
In other words, Easter must take place between
March 22nd and April 25th.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.680
To help a rather complex and difficult task
of determining Easter's exact date, the Council

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.170
constructed tables to determine Easter’s
date projected hundreds of years into the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.170
future.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.500
(One compilation of these Easter tables ultimately
inspired the individual doing the calculations

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.440
to create the BC/AD system of dating.)

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.400
For the next 1200 years, this worked, but
there was a glitch.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.980
The glitch was that the solar year wasn’t
365 days and 6 hours, but 365 days, 5 hours,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.560
48 minutes and 46 seconds.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.160
While minor, this meant that the calendar
will be about a day short of a solar year

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.140
every 130 years.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.790
In 1586, this was seemingly rectified by the
adaptation of the Gregorian calendar instituted

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.070
by Pope Gregory XIII (once again, naming the
calendar after himself).

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.510
With help from the astronomer Christopher
Clavius, the new calendar dropped the leap

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.890
year on the century years that were not divisible
by 400.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.390
This meant three leap years were to be eradicated
every three centuries, leaving 1600 and 2000

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.510
as leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 as
not.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.960
This also had an effect on Easter, forcing
the chart that the Council created to be revised

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.240
slightly.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.850
Despite the enormous efforts put into trying
to maintain a calendar and a formula for Easter,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.720
not everyone agreed.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.760
Several sects of Christianity stuck with the
original Julian calendar despite it being

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.410
abandoned in the 16th century by majority
of the world.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.800
In fact, European Protestants in Germany and
England didn’t adopt the Gregorian calendar

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.930
until the 18th century thinking it was a plot
to silence them and control Christianity.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.160
Additionally, in 1923, there was a movement
to set the date of Easter to align with the

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.100
astronomical full moon in Jerusalem, the location
of Jesus when he arose from the dead.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.970
To further this point, the Greek Orthodox
Church continue to follow one of the decrees

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.040
made by Constantine’s First Council that
Easter must fall after Jewish Passover and

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.850
be in “biblical sequence.”

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.210
This is due to the fact that Jesus’s last
supper was, in fact, a Passover seder and

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.660
he rose from the dead several days later.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.150
Many people believe that figuring out Easter's
date shouldn't be this confusing, including

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.150
the Pope.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.930
In 2014, he and the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew
(the spiritual leader of some 300 million

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.830
Orthodox Christians) were in talks to try
to make everyone's Easter all one date.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.160
This has yet to happen, but if it does, we
may never again have to consult a four hundred

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.250
year chart to determine when a holiday that
two billion people around the world celebrates

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:56.419
will actually take place.
