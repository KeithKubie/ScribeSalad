1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,690
Okay. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

2
00:00:01,691 --> 00:00:06,691
I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio lab
and today we still desperately looking,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,800
seeking symmetry as you say, oh, not
well yet. We have looked at love, failed,

4
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:15,940
looked at brain veiled mirrors, failed
chemistry of light, so we thought,

5
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:18,220
well for the last stop on this trip,

6
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:22,270
if we were to go anywhere to
find or look for deep unity,

7
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:26,620
a deep oneness and symmetry, maybe the
beginning of everything moment zero,

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,680
we found ourselves a physicist.
I get, it's Neil degrasse Tyson.

9
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:33,220
I began with a very, very basic question.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,400
If you look at me and I look at you and
you seem to be made of stuff and I seem

11
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:41,860
to be made of stuff and here we
are on here are tables and chairs.

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,950
Is it surprised you in some deep way
that we are all here made of stuff?

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,510
Yes. It's, it's not so much surprise
understates it. It's shocking.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,110
Really Shocking, Huh? What is,

15
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:59,980
what is shocking that there's any
matter in the universe at all?

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,060
Meaning that this conversation
shouldn't be happening deeper mouth

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,440
deeper than just whether or not
we'd be having this conversation.

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,260
It's whether or not any of this would
exist. Earth, the galaxy and the like.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,360
Whew.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Okay. So, um, if you go
back 13.7 billion years ago,

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,650
that's my shoulder Gliser again,
the physicist and he says,

22
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,760
if you rolled back the history
of the universe, no more stars,

23
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,480
no molecules, no atoms can
play the movie backwards. Now,

24
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:36,020
all the way to the beginning,
just after you know,

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,610
[inaudible]

26
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,670
Bang, you have what we
call a primeval soup.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,890
This soup was actually, it was
made of light, universal of white,

28
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,930
very high energy. And out of this
energy does heat these interactions,

29
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:53,764
you suddenly get

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,110
that these are belches, Jad belts,

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,030
belches of matter. The
light is doing this. Yes,

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,030
this is the one that equals MC squared
is all about cause energy is just a form

33
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:13,600
of matter and vice versa. I feel like I
should know what you're talking about,

34
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:17,320
but I don't. Okay, let's, let's
start. Let's start a little simpler.

35
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,710
There's light all around us. We're
in a studio. It's visible light.

36
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,900
So this light has no mass has energy.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,020
Even o m [inaudible] crank up the
energy of the light. Go to ultra violet

38
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,523
x-rays,

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,930
and there's a point in x-rays where
you have a high enough x-ray photon,

40
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,880
it will spontaneously

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,650
turn into a particle
electrons. In fact. Oh,

42
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,190
so you're saying if you crank up the
e the energy of the light high enough,

43
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,790
it'll suddenly just turn into mass.
That's correct. So just picture the soup

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,630
really intensely hot,

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,520
and it's belching out now to do
electrons Zumi around [inaudible]

46
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,990
forks, neutrinos continuously churning,

47
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,070
churning, churning. Over time,

48
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,550
all that matter clumps together in more
and more complex forms until you finally

49
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:17,010
get us. Sounds. Maybe
simple, doesn't it? Chat?

50
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,850
Yes, but there's a but coming, I can
smell it. But, and here's the big knew.

51
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,110
Back in 1928 1929 there
was this physicist,

52
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,030
young guy called IRAC.

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,480
He's doing some math and he's thinking
about this whole business of turning

54
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:34,870
light into matter. Okay? Now
he's puzzled by something.

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,130
But there is a law in physics called
the law of conservation of charge,

56
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:43,210
which simply means this, my unit rolls
off your tongue quite nicely, doesn't it?

57
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,680
It does. So here's what it means.

58
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,150
Whenever you create something,
if it you beginning,

59
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:52,260
you have zero electric charge at the end
you have to have zero electric charge

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,460
to that is you cannot create electric
charge. You have to keep the balance,

61
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,080
make something in the universe that has
a positive charge or a neck like make an

62
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:05,270
electron. Okay, just
make one right now. Yeah,

63
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,050
gone. That electron has a, you remember,
remember this from eighth grade,

64
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,750
a negative negative one bay
make, make two electrons.

65
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,890
Now make three electrons negative three.

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,340
Now if the universe is to stay in balance,

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,550
you need to have something
that has a positive charge.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,600
You've got three minuses on one side
and you have nothing else. Second,

69
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:32,120
if this is true, how would
you even make an electron?

70
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,010
The sheer fact of creating an electron
puts it out of balance. Well here,

71
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,500
here's the middle story here. Well, no,
Paul, Dereck, that well, how about this?

72
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,720
What if every time you
created an electron,

73
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,810
you created an entire electron?

74
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,480
What every particle could have an
equal but opposite in tight particle.

75
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,020
That is a particle that
looks very much the same,

76
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,960
but essentially it's
electric charge is reversed.

77
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,110
It would look the same.
Like really look, yes.

78
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,870
You'd have to measure their properties
to know that they were different.

79
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,630
Is it a mirror image or am I
think of it as a mirror image.

80
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:06,870
There's a thing called quantum spin and
it would just be spinning the opposite

81
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:10,860
way, but charge as the most
obvious difference. For example,

82
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,090
the anti-matter cousin of the electron
because the electron is a negative

83
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:18,840
charge. This little guy should
have a positive charge. Exactly.

84
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,010
But in every other way it'd be the
same. Right. And no one ever seen one.

85
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:26,160
He just thought that there
probably would be one. Yes.

86
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,190
And why did he think
this? Math, math, math.

87
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,530
It was a solution to the his equations.

88
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,480
And that's the beauty of theoretical
physics. I solve equations.

89
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,010
You can sometimes find out about the
world. And then yes, a few years later

90
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,250
bought a bing, they found the positron,
the anti-matter version of the electron.

91
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,040
Oh yeah. No, it's deep. It's
deep. How did they do that?

92
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,330
Like [inaudible] see it?

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,670
Well particles. Um, you know,
they're very tiny, right?

94
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:54,960
You can't really see them.
So all you do is uh, you,

95
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,860
you create little systems in the,

96
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,710
you get like a vapor and you put
the vapor in a tank, he says,

97
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:04,400
and when the electron or the Ante
Electron shoots through the vapor,

98
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,720
the particle destabilizes the vapor
and makes little bubbles. Okay.

99
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,610
You can see these little bubbles
appearing out of [inaudible] series.

100
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,290
Really an amazing thing. So you
can't see the particle itself,

101
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,460
but you can see its shadow. It's
road trip. It's road trip. Yeah.

102
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,360
So then he says, okay,

103
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:27,110
imagine you get this little piece of
light and heat it up really hot so that it

104
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,840
spawns all as we've learned, not one
particle but two matter anti-matter pair,

105
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,680
but them in the a vapor tank
and you put a magnet in there,

106
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,820
you can tell if it's going to the left
or to the right if it's a positive or

107
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:45,530
negative charge. [inaudible]
cooler. It is cool.

108
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,160
You see two particle tracks that each
curl opposite directions and if they have

109
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,640
the same rate of curl, yeah, that
means they have the same mass

110
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,120
[inaudible].

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,180
So if we go back to our picture of
the early universe of the soup, which,

112
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,830
and you named all of those particles,

113
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:02,410
does that mean that for every
particle that you named there is,

114
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,220
it's opposite floating around there as
well. Exactly. Do you have electrons?

115
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,360
Anti electrons.

116
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,590
You try and answer a neutron Proton
Anti-proton this is all very beautiful.

117
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,680
And you'd say, great, I have a
very democratic universe, you know,

118
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,710
has many particles and
antiparticles and everybody's happy.

119
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,640
All your problem is the following.
When an electron and a positron meet,

120
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,920
they will find each other and uh oh

121
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,343
quite a bit.

122
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,710
And they will annihilate you winning.

123
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:32,080
They'll find it because they'll find
their original other hand. No, no.

124
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,680
They wouldn't need to know. Just find
another kind like that's correct.

125
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,670
That's correct. So Chad, now imagine
that we're in the very early universe.

126
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,250
I am a teeny bit of matter. And you
may be opposite. I'm an anti cro,

127
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,540
which anti-coal anticoag.
And so the program,

128
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:49,200
which is sitting here and I see you
across the, he's now I'm positive.

129
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:52,290
Charge your name. We
charge charges together.

130
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,333
[inaudible]

131
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,680
[inaudible]

132
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,560
you see, it doesn't work out too well
for us. But you know, hey, wait, wait.

133
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,650
This is actually a rather profound puzzle
because if Paul Dirac was right and

134
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:09,030
half the universe is matter,

135
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,840
the other half of the university's Andy
mattered and we all bumped into each

136
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:16,260
other, the less we just did. Well
eventually I guess we would just not,

137
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,830
we would just become, I don't what, Oh,

138
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,600
I don't know. Hmm. We would not
be here. Damn. Just blink out.

139
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,460
And there'd be nothing. Exactly.

140
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,570
Really nothing. Nothing on there.

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,780
So it's a field of view,
mostly not mostly just

142
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,310
radiation, radiation,
radiation, radiation, radiation,

143
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,270
radiation, radiation,
radiation, radiation,

144
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,310
radiation, radiation,
radiation, radiation, radiation.

145
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,763
Shocking.

146
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:10,750
[inaudible]

147
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,051
well,

148
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,260
there's something wrong with this theory
because we're talking to each other.

149
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,120
So something, something's
wrong with this notion. Yes.

150
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:24,121
And what's wrong is an imperfection in
the laws of physics that we know of now,

151
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,290
and that, uh, is responsible for this
bias. Which means what day was that?

152
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,540
There was a little more of of matter,

153
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,630
but we call matter than
than anti matter or, yes.

154
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,660
There was to be precise to every
billion particles of anti-matter.

155
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,950
We had 1,000,000,001 ah,
articles of matter. Oh my God.

156
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,110
Really? Yes. Oh, that's tiny.

157
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:52,111
Excess of one in a billion is enough
to create everything that exists.

158
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:53,710
Now, the little guy,

159
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,910
we would call that an asymmetry

160
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:05,990
[inaudible]

161
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,410
so everything we see in the
universe, all the stars,

162
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,140
all the suns and the moons and the graft
and the mountains and us all though

163
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,550
we're the left. We're
the extra stuff. Yes,

164
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,690
we are the result of this asymmetry.

165
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,470
Has Anybody dealt with the real question
that's provoked here? It's like,

166
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,970
why was there more of one stuff kind
of stuff. Then the other kind of stuff,

167
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,880
so there you go. That is
one beautiful question,

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,690
but we don't have any
on any final answer yet.

169
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,790
You don't know because you see, you
don't know. We do not know. That's right.

170
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,610
Which is okay. Not knowing is
a wonderful thing in science.

171
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,930
Otherwise it could just retire.

172
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,540
Can I tell you my favorite lawyer
joke told to me by a lawyer? Yeah.

173
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,700
I have to like spread this
because it's the best one.

174
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,270
98% of lawyers give the
other 2% of bad name.

175
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,450
Well, that's the go music. The go
music meaning go away. Anything else?

176
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,060
Or here's a different
place to go to our website,

177
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,260
radiolab.org where you can read more
about anything you heard in this era.

178
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:18,790
You can see those amazing Lincoln picks
and other things we've got there on

179
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,170
symmetry. And of course you
can subscribe to our podcasts,

180
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,880
which we usually get to hear the
show. You know, whenever you like.

181
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,060
