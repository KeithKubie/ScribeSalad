[music playing]

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:08.842
NARRATOR: Heilongjiang
Province, China, June 1994,

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.761
Red Flag Logging Camp.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.889
Tree farmer Meng
Zhaoguo spots what

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.852
he believes to be a helicopter
crashing into the nearby Dragon

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.353
Mountains.
[explosion]

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:25.525
He sets out to investigate.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.944
And when he reaches
the lip of the valley,

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.947
he is struck on the head
and knocked unconscious.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.120
He wakes up several days
later in his bedroom at home.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.039
Doesn't know how he got there.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.459
But he, also, that
day has a visitation

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.795
by what he describes as a
10-foot-tall extraterrestrial

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.757
female with six fingers.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.093
They're floating in
the air above his bed.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:53.595
Suddenly, she vanishes.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.013
She walks through
the wall in his room,

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:59.267
and he floats back into his bed.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:02.562
NARRATOR: While this account
is certainly fantastical,

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.065
Beijing-based psychologists
and police technicians

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:09.944
subjected Zhaoguo to a
rigorous examination,

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:12.363
including hypnosis
and a lie detector

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:17.619
test, and concluded his
story to be truthful.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.247
Zhaoguo is one of literally
thousands who have come forward

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:25.293
in China in recent years
to say that they have had

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:28.463
extraterrestrial encounters.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:31.925
But his abduction by
this otherworldly giant

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.220
is particularly
significant because

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.722
of an extraordinary
archaeological discovery

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:43.102
in China that dates
back nearly 4,000 years.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:46.689
[wind howling] The
Taklamakan Desert,

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.526
known as the "Sea of Death."

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:53.822
It is a vast, unforgiving
land shrouded in myths

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.741
and lost to time.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.494
The Taklamakan
Desert is located

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.621
in the northwest of China.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.074
NARRATOR: While the
Taklamakan Desert

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:42.412
is one of the least habitable
places on Earth, astoundingly

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:46.541
over the last three decades,
Chinese archaeologists working

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.003
in the Tarim Basin region
have excavated hundreds

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:54.799
of tombs that date back
to as early as 1800 BC.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.426
[music playing]

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:32.003
The well-preserved nature
of the mummified bodies

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.923
allowed archaeologists
to conduct modern DNA

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:39.093
analysis that determined the
ancient travelers were not

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:40.678
Chinese.
