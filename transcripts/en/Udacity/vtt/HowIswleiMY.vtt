00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, for the answers. A theory is the outcome of the scientific method.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A theory is also particularly useful hypothesis

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because we refined the hypothesis until it becomes a theory.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And it also is a framework that explains and predicts observations.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is the official definition of theory.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A theory, however, is not a vague guess

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
when you're talking about the scientific meaning of this theory

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When you have scientist speaking about theory, they're talking about the framework

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that is consistent with all earlier observation and predicts lots and lots of future observations

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and its actually the best framework in most cases

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
When you have layman speaking about theory, it's more like I have this theory

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
on how things could be which does not necessarily have the same strength as scientific theory.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The misunderstanding between theory in the sense of a layman using it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and with the theory as scientist use it is the cause for lots of confusion in political debates.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Think about the theory of evolution.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For scientist, the theory of evolution is exactly exponential

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and prediction of lots and lots of observations.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
A very consistent and form many beautiful framework.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
For others, oh this is just a theory of evolution disseminating this as vague guess.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Be careful when you heard the word theory. Its meaning depends very much on whoever says it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In our context, of course, we're using a theory in order to explain

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
what the cause of a failure is and in our context we're not looking for vague guesses,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
we're looking for something that explains all earlier observations and predicts the future one.
