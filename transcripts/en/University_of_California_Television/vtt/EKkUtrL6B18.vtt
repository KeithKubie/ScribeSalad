00:00:05.368 --> 00:00:08.785
(relaxing piano playing)

00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:13.139
- Hi, my name is Ashley Mason

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.038
and I'm an assistant professor
of psychiatry at UCSF

00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:18.283
and I'm here with Rob Lustig

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:22.365
who is a neuro-endocrinologist
here at UCSF as well.

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:25.115
And today we're talking
about his new book,

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:27.076
called The Hacking of the American Mind.

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:29.997
So, Rob, why don't you start by telling us

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:32.975
what the book is about in a way

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:37.005
that folks without a medical
degree would understand.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.517
- Ashley, I wrote this
book because we've suffered

00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:43.359
a crisis in our culture,
and I believe it comes down

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.359
to a mistake that we've made between

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.487
the interpretation of
two of our most important

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:56.158
and positive emotions,
pleasure and happiness.

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:59.538
Lot of people equate the two.

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:03.385
But I'm here to tell you that
they are completely different.

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:05.152
Lot of people they're exactly the same.

00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:08.190
In fact, on the internet,
you can find definitions

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.405
that actually conflate
and confuse the two.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.927
So what are the differences
between pleasure and happiness?

00:01:13.927 --> 00:01:16.019
And I believe there are seven.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:20.173
Pleasure is short-lived,
happiness is long-lived.

00:01:20.173 --> 00:01:24.520
Pleasure is visceral,
happiness is ethereal.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.223
Pleasure is taking, happiness is giving.

00:01:28.223 --> 00:01:30.618
Pleasure can be achieved with substances,

00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:33.821
happiness cannot be
achieved with substances.

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:36.189
Pleasure is experienced alone,

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.364
happiness is experienced in social groups.

00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:43.145
The extremes of pleasure
all lead to addiction,

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.617
whether they be substances or behaviors.

00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:47.341
Yet there's no such
thing as being addicted

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.806
to too much happiness.

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:51.287
And finally, number seven, most important,

00:01:51.287 --> 00:01:54.644
pleasure is dopamine and
happiness is serotonin.

00:01:54.644 --> 00:01:56.473
Now these are two biochemicals.

00:01:56.473 --> 00:01:58.603
These are two neurotransmitters.

00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:01.947
These are two chemicals
that the brain makes

00:02:01.947 --> 00:02:04.694
and uses to communicate between

00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:07.611
one neuron brain cell and another.

00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:10.409
Now, why do we care?

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.922
So what?

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:16.651
Well, turns out dopamine
excites the next neuron

00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:19.957
and neurons when they're excited

00:02:19.957 --> 00:02:23.703
too much, too frequently, tend to die.

00:02:23.703 --> 00:02:27.147
So the neuron has a defense
mechanism against that.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.889
What it does is it reduces
the number of receptors

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.794
that are available to be stimulated

00:02:32.794 --> 00:02:36.369
in an attempt to try
to mitigate the damage.

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.751
- When you say to be stimulated,

00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:39.159
you mean to be excited?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.765
- To be excited, that's right.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:43.147
And so we have a name for that process,

00:02:43.147 --> 00:02:45.212
it's called down regulation.

00:02:45.212 --> 00:02:48.612
And a lot of different
chemicals in the body do that.

00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:51.529
Now, you get a hit, you get a rush,

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:54.767
the receptors go down.

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:56.707
Next time, you need a bigger hit

00:02:56.707 --> 00:02:57.761
to get the same rush,

00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.924
'cause there are fewer
receptors to occupy.

00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:01.579
And you need a bigger
hit, and a bigger hit,

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.015
and a bigger hit until finally,

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:05.599
taking a huge hit to get nothing.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.512
That's called tolerance and then

00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:11.795
when the neurons start to
die, that's called addiction.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.462
Serotonin however is inhibitory.

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:17.018
It's not excitatory.

00:03:17.018 --> 00:03:21.018
It inhibits its receptor
to provide contentment,

00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:24.723
to zen out if you will.

00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:28.036
So you can't overdose
the serotonin neuron.

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:30.749
- And what does it mean
to inhibit a receptor?

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:35.062
- What it means is it binds,
but it doesn't activate

00:03:35.062 --> 00:03:37.590
the process beyond the receptor.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.015
So, what it does, is it basically
slows down those neurons,

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:44.932
instead of causing them to fire up.

00:03:45.894 --> 00:03:49.668
And in doing so, you end up
with the process of contentment,

00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:53.391
that feeling of one with
the world, if you will.

00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:56.228
That thing we call happiness.

00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:58.971
Now, there's one thing that

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.888
down regulates serotonin, dopamine.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.521
So the more pleasure you seek,
the more unhappy you get.

00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:11.593
And, Las Vegas, Madison
Avenue, Wall Street,

00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:14.769
Silicon Valley, and Washington DC,

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.263
have very specifically and
in a coordinated fashion,

00:04:18.263 --> 00:04:21.680
confused and conflated the term happiness

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.713
with the term pleasure.

00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:28.648
So that you can buy happiness.

00:04:30.076 --> 00:04:33.159
So that they can sell you their junk.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.593
It's called the American economy.

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:38.322
And it's based on hedonic substances,

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:42.619
substances that drive pleasure,
rather than happiness.

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:47.265
And in the process, we have
become most decidedly unhappy.

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:50.417
And the problem is you can't fix a problem

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:53.019
unless you identify what the problem is.

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:55.504
That's the reason for this book.

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:59.220
- In the title of the book
you use the word hacking.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.101
This sounds pretty dark
and conspiratorial.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.376
Do you really think
that there's been a plot

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:06.586
to control our minds?

00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:10.379
- So let's first of all,
I define the word hack.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.629
So hack has a relatively short history.

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:18.576
The very first time
the word hack was used,

00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:21.743
other than in a butchery, was in 1955,

00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:27.427
when it was used at MIT,
the Model Railroad Club,

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:32.183
to talk about a unusual
solution to a complex problem,

00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:34.872
and that's what it
meant for quite a while.

00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:38.789
An example, stealing a
car is a felony offense.

00:05:40.098 --> 00:05:43.033
Stealing a Boston police
car, dissembling it,

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:45.720
carrying each piece up five floors

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.885
to the great dome of MIT, reassembling it,

00:05:48.885 --> 00:05:52.772
and putting a mannequin of
a Boston police officer,

00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:57.543
with a box of donuts in the
front seat, that's a hack.

00:05:57.543 --> 00:06:01.188
Over the course of the
next several decades,

00:06:01.188 --> 00:06:05.795
the word hack became synonymous
with clever approaches

00:06:05.795 --> 00:06:08.026
to complex computer problems,

00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:10.635
which we now call white hat hacking,

00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:13.889
which is very prevalent and
common here in Silicon Valley.

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.115
But in the process, we also
now have black hat hacking,

00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:22.380
as we learned during the
2016 presidential election

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.404
when the Russians hacked
Hilary Clinton's emails.

00:06:26.404 --> 00:06:30.362
- So then, black hat hacking
is, can you define that?

00:06:30.362 --> 00:06:33.779
- So it's a malevolence, in an attempt to

00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:39.671
basically blackmail or to cause
the crashing of a computer.

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:49.170
To wipe out a hard drive, so
clearly not something good.

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:56.816
And the question is, how
can your brain be hacked?

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.586
And the answer is, well
it doesn't get hacked

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.455
with computer code but it gets hacked

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:02.307
with false information.

00:07:02.307 --> 00:07:06.423
And in fact, we've had false information

00:07:06.423 --> 00:07:10.590
since the time of the Romans,
it's called propaganda.

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:14.842
So what's the difference
between marketing,

00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:18.468
which is what companies say
they do, and propaganda?

00:07:18.468 --> 00:07:21.182
And the answer is the truth,
that's the difference.

00:07:21.182 --> 00:07:24.216
When companies express a point of view

00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:28.717
that furthers their goals,
then that point of view

00:07:28.717 --> 00:07:32.494
references true facts,
that's called marketing.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:35.718
When a company expresses a point of view

00:07:35.718 --> 00:07:38.028
and tries to advance its goals based on

00:07:38.028 --> 00:07:41.445
misinformation, that's called propaganda.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.466
So the difference between marketing

00:07:44.466 --> 00:07:46.799
and propaganda is the truth.

00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:52.585
The corporations of
America today have engaged

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:56.752
in a very specific attempt
to market their propaganda

00:08:00.068 --> 00:08:04.037
in order to get us to do different things

00:08:04.037 --> 00:08:06.914
than we might otherwise have done.

00:08:06.914 --> 00:08:10.971
Examples, the easiest
one of course is food

00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:14.209
and the one that I've
written about previously.

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:17.126
The idea that foods can be healthy,

00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:20.974
goes back a long way,
in fact not eating food,

00:08:20.974 --> 00:08:23.629
is not healthy, it's called starvation.

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:26.277
The question is which foods are the ones

00:08:26.277 --> 00:08:29.159
that ultimately lead to health?

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:31.122
And the answer is not the ones

00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:33.930
that the food industry has touted.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.765
In fact, we have the
data that demonstrates

00:08:36.765 --> 00:08:39.278
that they knew what they were doing.

00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:42.111
When we went low-fat in the 1970s,

00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:46.878
The Sugar Association
knew what it was doing.

00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:51.045
In fact, there is a now paper
trail of the communications

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.993
between The Sugar Association

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:58.632
and two Harvard school
public health scientists,

00:08:58.632 --> 00:09:01.965
to specifically exonerate
sugar and finger saturated fat

00:09:01.965 --> 00:09:06.132
as the culprit for our
cardiovascular disease debacle.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.894
Turns out, we now have
the data to show that

00:09:10.894 --> 00:09:12.993
that was completely untrue,

00:09:12.993 --> 00:09:16.030
that we have actually
experienced an increase

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.042
in obesity, cardiovascular disease,

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:20.290
type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, lipid problems,

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.961
cancer and dementia because
of our processed food diet,

00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:28.299
which we were told was healthy.

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:32.466
And they knew, back in the 1970s
that that was not the case.

00:09:34.412 --> 00:09:37.151
That's black hat hacking.

00:09:37.151 --> 00:09:41.241
Our minds have been hacked
to believe certain things

00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:43.467
that are not true.

00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:47.217
And it's been a very
specific corporate plot.

00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:52.135
Now I won't go so far as
to say it was a conspiracy,

00:09:52.135 --> 00:09:54.307
because we do not have data that says,

00:09:54.307 --> 00:09:58.347
that different corporations
colluded with each other

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:01.105
to specifically defraud
the American public,

00:10:01.105 --> 00:10:03.937
and to inflict malice
upon the american public.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.524
But we do have the data to show,

00:10:05.524 --> 00:10:07.540
that individual companies engaged

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.873
in their own plots to do so.

00:10:10.868 --> 00:10:13.770
Another example of course was tobacco.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.784
Tobacco made it very clear for many years

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:21.251
that there was no relation
between nicotine and addiction,

00:10:21.251 --> 00:10:24.913
except that they had the
data that said otherwise

00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:29.129
and they lied to congress,
very specifically.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:32.546
So, tobacco, alcohol, food, guns, energy,

00:10:38.202 --> 00:10:41.531
these are all hedonic
substances and or behaviors.

00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:46.372
And they have costs and
we're paying those costs now.

00:10:46.372 --> 00:10:49.562
We're paying it in terms
of our addiction crisis,

00:10:49.562 --> 00:10:51.994
we're paying it in terms of our opiod,

00:10:51.994 --> 00:10:54.721
our depression crisis,
we're paying it in terms of

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:57.660
lives lost and we're paying it in terms

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.376
of our healthcare debacle.

00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:04.261
And you can't reverse it,
till you understand it.

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:06.824
You can't pull yourself out of the ditch

00:11:06.824 --> 00:11:09.958
until you figure out
how you drove into it.

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.027
- So Rob in your book, you
talk a lot about the difference

00:11:12.027 --> 00:11:15.214
between pleasure and happiness.

00:11:15.214 --> 00:11:16.980
In just a few sentences, can you tell us

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.173
what is the major
distinction between the two?

00:11:20.173 --> 00:11:23.502
- So from a social standpoint,

00:11:23.502 --> 00:11:27.252
pleasure is the feeling
that this feels good.

00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:29.668
I want more.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.503
Happiness or contentment,
is the feeling of

00:11:37.287 --> 00:11:41.120
this feels good, I don't
want or need anymore.

00:11:43.954 --> 00:11:46.261
They're not the same.

00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:49.511
In fact, pleasure begets more pleasure.

00:11:50.638 --> 00:11:54.112
This is what the casinos are counting on.

00:11:54.112 --> 00:11:58.008
On the other hand, I don't
want or need anymore,

00:11:58.008 --> 00:12:01.945
says, if there was something to purchase,

00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:03.357
I don't need to purchase it.

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:05.807
In fact, all of the things that say,

00:12:05.807 --> 00:12:08.377
this feels good I don't
want or need any more,

00:12:08.377 --> 00:12:10.909
are things that you can't buy.

00:12:10.909 --> 00:12:12.659
They're not for sale.

00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:15.273
They are however,

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:20.379
accessible to every single
human being on the planet.

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:23.380
They're all the things
your mother told you,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.630
but you forgot.

00:12:25.818 --> 00:12:27.818
I call them the four Cs.

00:12:29.754 --> 00:12:31.337
First one, connect.

00:12:32.442 --> 00:12:34.577
So, interpersonal connection turns out

00:12:34.577 --> 00:12:37.788
to be extraordinarily
important for happiness

00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:41.203
and the reason is because
face-to-face, eye-to-eye

00:12:41.203 --> 00:12:44.855
connection, generates
something called empathy.

00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:48.086
Empathy activates a
specific set of neurons

00:12:48.086 --> 00:12:51.200
in your brain, which have
been termed mirror neurons.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.367
So that the feelings of the
person you're talking to

00:12:56.513 --> 00:13:00.630
ultimately become adopted by you as well.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.700
And in that process, you
generate contentment.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.480
So, interpersonal connection
is extraordinarily important.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.581
This is one of the reasons
why we have religion,

00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:14.038
is for that interpersonal connection.

00:13:14.038 --> 00:13:17.473
Turns out the faith is not important,

00:13:17.473 --> 00:13:19.744
the interpersonal connection is.

00:13:19.744 --> 00:13:21.428
But then you have to ask the question,

00:13:21.428 --> 00:13:25.883
well, what about
non-interpersonal connection?

00:13:25.883 --> 00:13:28.216
Like for instance, Facebook.

00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:33.151
Turns out Facebook
actually sows unhappiness,

00:13:33.151 --> 00:13:36.123
in part because there is no
interpersonal connection,

00:13:36.123 --> 00:13:38.223
there's no serotonin rise.

00:13:38.223 --> 00:13:41.919
There's a dopamine rise
every time a message

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:46.126
flashes across your screen,
it's called variable reward.

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:50.126
And actually causes you
to increase your actions

00:13:54.128 --> 00:13:58.128
to access more Facebook
and that actually drives

00:13:59.532 --> 00:14:01.446
further depression and the data now,

00:14:01.446 --> 00:14:04.824
show that this is a vicious cycle.

00:14:04.824 --> 00:14:06.741
Second one, contribute.

00:14:08.036 --> 00:14:11.360
And contribute means not to your bankbook,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.637
it means to outside of yourself.

00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:17.248
So you can do it within your work,

00:14:17.248 --> 00:14:20.664
by making the work a better
place for your colleagues,

00:14:20.664 --> 00:14:22.486
or you can do it outside of your work,

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:25.236
by volunteerism, or philanthropy.

00:14:26.827 --> 00:14:28.373
So there are a lot of different ways

00:14:28.373 --> 00:14:30.972
to accomplish, contribute.

00:14:30.972 --> 00:14:34.722
But ultimately it has
to be outside yourself.

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:37.075
Third one, cope.

00:14:38.472 --> 00:14:41.633
So in order to reduce stress,

00:14:41.633 --> 00:14:44.495
thereby improving your serotonin receptors

00:14:44.495 --> 00:14:47.995
to allow for better feelings of happiness.

00:14:49.403 --> 00:14:50.758
There are three things.

00:14:50.758 --> 00:14:54.638
One, sleep, something
we're getting much less of,

00:14:54.638 --> 00:14:57.134
in part because of our screens.

00:14:57.134 --> 00:14:59.182
In fact, my colleague Kristine Madsen

00:14:59.182 --> 00:15:01.028
at UC Berkeley showed that 8th graders

00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:04.174
who slept with their
cellphone in their room,

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:07.664
got 28 minutes less sleep each night,

00:15:07.664 --> 00:15:12.240
then those who charged their
cellphones outside the room.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.832
A recent study showed
that if the cellphone

00:15:14.832 --> 00:15:18.090
is sitting on the desk, even if it's off,

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.442
it takes three times as
long to accomplish the task,

00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:24.497
as if the cellphone is not there.

00:15:24.497 --> 00:15:28.057
By being a distraction
and from the blue light

00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:30.692
emanating from the screen
and actually activating

00:15:30.692 --> 00:15:34.600
that part of your brain
that keeps you awake.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.331
Cellphones and other screens,

00:15:37.331 --> 00:15:39.590
which now have dominated our lives,

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.507
have actually promoted unhappiness.

00:15:43.974 --> 00:15:47.818
Second thing within cope, mindfulness.

00:15:47.818 --> 00:15:50.621
We know a lot about
mindfulness, we study it,

00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:54.564
along with other people at
the Osher Center here at UCSF.

00:15:54.564 --> 00:15:58.841
In fact, multitasking is
probably the single biggest

00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:01.563
destroyer of happiness that we have.

00:16:01.563 --> 00:16:04.352
People pride themselves on
their being able to multitask,

00:16:04.352 --> 00:16:07.745
companies look for the people
who can multitask the best,

00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:10.401
turns out, only about
2.5% of the population

00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:12.721
can actually do two things at once.

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:14.652
Everybody else, it's smoke and mirrors,

00:16:14.652 --> 00:16:16.637
and the most things you take on,

00:16:16.637 --> 00:16:18.606
the quicker you get unhappy

00:16:18.606 --> 00:16:21.463
and the lower your serotonin goes.

00:16:21.463 --> 00:16:24.944
And finally, within cope,
the last one is exercise.

00:16:24.944 --> 00:16:27.078
It turns out exercise
will tamp down dopamine

00:16:27.078 --> 00:16:29.633
and increase serotonin on its own.

00:16:29.633 --> 00:16:32.992
And when you use exercise
as a mitigator of stress,

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.159
you can clearly advance your serotonin

00:16:37.744 --> 00:16:40.411
in a very positive way.

00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:44.494
And then lastly, the fourth
C, cook for yourself.

00:16:46.374 --> 00:16:48.397
When you go out to a fast food restaurant,

00:16:48.397 --> 00:16:49.860
you don't know what you're eating.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.709
It turns there are
three items in your diet

00:16:52.709 --> 00:16:57.164
that matter in terms of the
serotonin, dopamine connection.

00:16:57.164 --> 00:16:58.825
First one, tryptophan.

00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:02.621
Tryptophan is the amino acid
that is the building block

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:04.023
to make serotonin.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:08.023
Happens to be the rarest
amino acid in our diet.

00:17:09.733 --> 00:17:12.650
It's mostly found in fish and flax.

00:17:15.331 --> 00:17:18.581
We don't eat a lot of fish, in general.

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:22.196
It's probably low on our list.

00:17:22.196 --> 00:17:25.028
In part because of shipping processes,

00:17:25.028 --> 00:17:26.994
farmed fish versus wild fish, et cetera.

00:17:26.994 --> 00:17:28.529
But the bottom line is,

00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:32.029
fish have a very high level of tryptophan.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.033
Omega-3 fatty acids.

00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:38.786
Those are found also in fish

00:17:38.786 --> 00:17:42.203
and they are found in certain food stuffs

00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:48.305
that are grown, mostly
algae, things that eat algae

00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:51.026
ultimately increase your omega-3s.

00:17:51.026 --> 00:17:52.942
So fish eat algae, we eat the fish.

00:17:52.942 --> 00:17:54.607
Why are omega-3s important?

00:17:54.607 --> 00:17:58.562
Because they provide stability
to neuronal membranes.

00:17:58.562 --> 00:18:01.506
So it's less likely that neurons will die.

00:18:01.506 --> 00:18:03.566
And they can be compressed easier,

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:06.919
they allow for neurons
to come back to shape,

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.853
so that you don't kill off the neurons

00:18:09.853 --> 00:18:12.760
that ultimately drive happiness.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.512
And then lastly, the negative
one, fructose, sugar,

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:19.517
the one that actually drives dopamine up,

00:18:19.517 --> 00:18:22.128
also drives serotonin down.

00:18:22.128 --> 00:18:26.267
So high tryptophan, high
omega-3 fatty acids,

00:18:26.267 --> 00:18:29.431
low fructose, that's called real food.

00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:32.705
When you cook for yourself,
that's what your making,

00:18:32.705 --> 00:18:34.714
that's what you're eating.

00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:37.338
And, you're cooking for
yourself and your family,

00:18:37.338 --> 00:18:39.182
you get the interpersonal connection,

00:18:39.182 --> 00:18:42.456
you get the contribution to
something outside yourself.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:45.076
It's basically a win-win-win.

00:18:45.076 --> 00:18:49.495
On the other hand, in fast
food, you're eating alone.

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:51.687
You're eating things, you
don't know what's in it.

00:18:51.687 --> 00:18:53.129
And you're eating a
hell of a lot of sugar,

00:18:53.129 --> 00:18:55.822
because every item at
the fast food restaurant

00:18:55.822 --> 00:18:57.415
has been spiked with added sugar,

00:18:57.415 --> 00:19:02.081
specifically for their
purposes, not for yours.

00:19:02.081 --> 00:19:06.248
So we have moved on to a fast
food consumption society,

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.204
and in the process,

00:19:09.204 --> 00:19:13.371
we have actually impeded
our ability to get happy.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.141
And we have to understand these problems,

00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:18.486
in order to unravel them.

00:19:18.486 --> 00:19:21.294
- A lot of the substances
that you're talking about

00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:22.949
are everywhere, they're ubiquitous.

00:19:22.949 --> 00:19:23.782
- [Robert] Indeed.

00:19:23.782 --> 00:19:27.549
- How do we become aware
of our addictions to them?

00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:29.892
- Well, it can be hard.

00:19:29.892 --> 00:19:34.590
I can tell you, I know what
I'm addicted to, caffeine.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.890
My wife and I, two
codependents with a crux.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.449
The fact is, that a lot of people

00:19:41.449 --> 00:19:44.320
don't necessarily understand
that they are addicted.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.914
They know they need something,

00:19:46.914 --> 00:19:50.638
when want becomes need, that's
usually a sign of addiction.

00:19:50.638 --> 00:19:53.074
And I will tell you, I
need my two cups of coffee

00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:55.356
in the morning just to function

00:19:55.356 --> 00:19:57.557
and I'm not proud of it.

00:19:57.557 --> 00:19:59.717
On the other hand, if you take
my Starbucks away from me,

00:19:59.717 --> 00:20:01.050
I will kill you.

00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:05.226
A lot of people say
they have a sweet tooth,

00:20:05.226 --> 00:20:08.988
that's usually a sign of sugar
addiction, if they say that.

00:20:08.988 --> 00:20:13.003
If they find themselves, not
being able to concentrate

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:16.214
on their job, or on their family,

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:19.464
because this craving is calling to them

00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:25.981
and it's interfering with their
daily life in some fashion,

00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:29.620
or in their work, that's
usually a sign of addiction.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.370
And that can happen from
shopping, from porn,

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:38.201
from video games and cellphones,

00:20:38.201 --> 00:20:42.215
that of course has been the
most recent addition to this.

00:20:42.215 --> 00:20:45.139
If you find yourself
checking your cellphone

00:20:45.139 --> 00:20:49.288
every two minutes waiting for a new email,

00:20:49.288 --> 00:20:52.269
that's usually a sign
of cellphone addiction.

00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:55.874
And it works in the same way
in terms of the dopamine.

00:20:55.874 --> 00:21:00.041
There's a paradigm that
companies use to get us addicted.

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:06.752
It was outlined in a book
by Nir Eyal called Hooked.

00:21:06.752 --> 00:21:10.585
It starts with a trigger,
an itch if you will,

00:21:11.584 --> 00:21:15.081
and then that itch has to be scratched

00:21:15.081 --> 00:21:17.424
and presumably the scratch is something

00:21:17.424 --> 00:21:19.523
that's socially acceptable,

00:21:19.523 --> 00:21:22.649
like for instance,
checking your cellphone.

00:21:22.649 --> 00:21:24.816
And then, variable reward.

00:21:26.288 --> 00:21:28.259
Now if the rewards the same every time,

00:21:28.259 --> 00:21:29.462
it won't become a habit,

00:21:29.462 --> 00:21:31.107
it won't become an addiction.

00:21:31.107 --> 00:21:33.488
But, if it's different each time,

00:21:33.488 --> 00:21:35.738
then there is an impetuous and a pressure

00:21:35.738 --> 00:21:38.905
to keep doing it and keep checking it.

00:21:38.905 --> 00:21:41.796
And ultimately it becomes
part of your daily life.

00:21:41.796 --> 00:21:43.270
That is what cellphones have done

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.456
over the last 10 years.

00:21:45.456 --> 00:21:48.437
They've basically occupied
this primary position

00:21:48.437 --> 00:21:51.747
within our culture, to the point where,

00:21:51.747 --> 00:21:56.160
we almost now can't even
concentrate on our jobs.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.100
And the last part of
the cycle is investment.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.558
That is, you have to be
willing to be plunk down

00:22:02.558 --> 00:22:05.743
another $299 for the next iPhone

00:22:05.743 --> 00:22:08.182
in order to keep the addiction going.

00:22:08.182 --> 00:22:11.049
And indeed, virtually everyone in America

00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:13.693
has opted for that addiction,

00:22:13.693 --> 00:22:16.388
virtually over everything else.

00:22:16.388 --> 00:22:20.529
So this has been a slow but nonetheless,

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:24.196
steady drumbeat that
has preoccupied America

00:22:26.906 --> 00:22:30.015
and not just America but the entire world

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.938
and it's one of the reasons why

00:22:31.938 --> 00:22:35.656
Apple and Samsung duke
it out for market share,

00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:39.823
because basically, it's
about who's going to supply

00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:45.155
the rest of the world
with their addiction.

00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:48.642
- So then, craving is big component of it,

00:22:48.642 --> 00:22:52.397
being willing to forgo these
components of happiness

00:22:52.397 --> 00:22:55.231
is another component and then,

00:22:55.231 --> 00:22:56.782
being willing to invest.

00:22:56.782 --> 00:23:00.796
- Well, not necessarily
forgo feelings of happiness.

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:03.646
The problem is, that you have
to know what happiness is

00:23:03.646 --> 00:23:05.579
in order to be able to--

00:23:05.579 --> 00:23:07.808
- Forgo in the connection
and the contribution,

00:23:07.808 --> 00:23:08.987
and all of these things.

00:23:08.987 --> 00:23:09.820
- Right.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.673
So the question is, why is it that

00:23:12.673 --> 00:23:16.340
pleasure and happiness
have become confused.

00:23:17.297 --> 00:23:19.411
Did industry start that?

00:23:19.411 --> 00:23:21.772
It actually started early than that.

00:23:21.772 --> 00:23:25.695
It started with the
declaration of independence.

00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:28.903
Remember life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness?

00:23:28.903 --> 00:23:32.147
Well, turns out life is
going in the wrong direction.

00:23:32.147 --> 00:23:35.126
We now know that
lifespan, average lifespan

00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:39.293
in the United States is going
down for the first time.

00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:44.663
Liberty, turns out depending
on where you were born

00:23:44.663 --> 00:23:47.898
that determines your final salary.

00:23:47.898 --> 00:23:52.065
If you were born in Palm
Springs or in Los Angeles,

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.353
you make more money than if you

00:23:55.353 --> 00:23:59.520
were born in Baltimore or
Detroit, for the exact same job.

00:24:01.736 --> 00:24:05.170
We've constructed ghettos
of our own volition,

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.319
whether they be inner-city ghettos,

00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:10.736
or walled ghettos in fancy parts of town.

00:24:11.893 --> 00:24:15.800
They're still prisons,
gilded ones sometimes,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.919
but prisons nonetheless.

00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:20.385
And finally, happiness.

00:24:20.385 --> 00:24:24.034
Remember that clause the
pursuit of happiness?

00:24:24.034 --> 00:24:26.029
It was said twice.

00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:30.507
Once in The Virginia
Declaration of Rights in 1776

00:24:30.507 --> 00:24:33.306
and then re-appropriated
by Thomas Jefferson

00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:35.545
for The Declaration of Independence.

00:24:35.545 --> 00:24:38.294
- One of the substances that
you've written and talked about

00:24:38.294 --> 00:24:41.946
the most, has been food, processed food.

00:24:41.946 --> 00:24:44.693
And of course, how this
contributes to metabolic disease.

00:24:44.693 --> 00:24:47.590
It seems like our healthcare system

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.757
is setup, albeit not the best,
to treat metabolic problems,

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:54.845
more than to prevent them.

00:24:54.845 --> 00:24:55.858
Is it hopeless?

00:24:55.858 --> 00:24:58.191
Where do you see this going?

00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:02.959
- Right now, we have more money going out

00:25:05.918 --> 00:25:09.882
for chronic metabolic disease,
then for everything else.

00:25:09.882 --> 00:25:14.256
In fact, 75% of our
healthcare expenditures

00:25:14.256 --> 00:25:18.392
are for the diseases that
constitute metabolic syndrome,

00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:21.269
that is type 2 diabetes, hypertension,

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:24.348
lipid problems, cardiovascular
disease, cancer and dementia.

00:25:24.348 --> 00:25:29.170
You add that up, that's
75% of expenditures.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.503
Here's the math.

00:25:31.677 --> 00:25:35.844
The food industry grosses
1.46 trillion dollars a year,

00:25:39.392 --> 00:25:43.142
of which 657 billion
dollars is gross profit.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.827
They're making a huge profit.

00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:51.051
However, healthcare expenditures

00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:55.400
are 3.2 trillion dollars, of which 75%

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.309
is chronic metabolic disease,

00:25:57.309 --> 00:26:01.753
of which 75% of that could be prevented

00:26:01.753 --> 00:26:04.503
if we could fix the food problem.

00:26:05.635 --> 00:26:06.970
Bottom line.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.655
You can't have healthcare reform,

00:26:09.655 --> 00:26:11.823
unless you have health reform.

00:26:11.823 --> 00:26:13.899
And you can't have health reform,

00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:16.482
unless you have diet reform.

00:26:16.482 --> 00:26:19.899
Now, Obamacare promised that we could put

00:26:21.605 --> 00:26:25.331
32 million sick people onto the rolls.

00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:26.986
And that we would pay for it,

00:26:26.986 --> 00:26:28.619
with preventative services,

00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:31.067
by being able to go to your doctor,

00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:33.480
you wouldn't have to
have the emergency room,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.228
which costs 50 times as much.

00:26:35.228 --> 00:26:38.938
And that's how we would be able
to pay for all these people.

00:26:38.938 --> 00:26:41.107
Turns out, that with Obamacare,

00:26:41.107 --> 00:26:44.408
emergency room visits went up, not down

00:26:44.408 --> 00:26:46.891
and costs went so high that

00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:50.058
three of the major insurers opted out.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:53.835
And that was one of the reasons

00:26:53.835 --> 00:26:57.835
for the election of 2016
focusing on healthcare.

00:26:58.757 --> 00:27:01.065
Here's the problem.

00:27:01.065 --> 00:27:03.648
Obamacare did not address diet.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.546
But neither does
Trumpcare and neither does

00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:10.336
the current senate and house bills

00:27:10.336 --> 00:27:13.388
that are trying to repeal and replace.

00:27:13.388 --> 00:27:18.222
The bottom line is, until we
address the problem of diet,

00:27:18.222 --> 00:27:21.662
which will also of course
address the question

00:27:21.662 --> 00:27:25.425
of pleasure and happiness
at the same time.

00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:28.297
We will not see an improvement

00:27:28.297 --> 00:27:31.229
in our healthcare system anytime soon.

00:27:31.229 --> 00:27:33.764
This has to be front and center.

00:27:33.764 --> 00:27:37.431
In addition, food is 20% of investment,

00:27:40.244 --> 00:27:43.004
but it is 40% of climate change.

00:27:43.004 --> 00:27:47.166
Agriculture contributes
40% of climate change.

00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:50.565
So if people are worried
about this problem,

00:27:50.565 --> 00:27:52.065
as they should be,

00:27:53.024 --> 00:27:57.583
then fixing America's diet
has to be front and center

00:27:57.583 --> 00:28:00.654
for the two biggest
problems that we have today,

00:28:00.654 --> 00:28:03.860
climate change and healthcare.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:08.313
This is at the center of
both of these phenomena

00:28:08.313 --> 00:28:09.992
and we will not be able to solve it,

00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:12.300
until we start to address it.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.782
- Can you tell us a little
bit about what lead you

00:28:14.782 --> 00:28:18.081
to write this book in the first place?

00:28:18.081 --> 00:28:19.650
- I've known about the dopamine,

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.499
serotonin connection for 30 years.

00:28:22.499 --> 00:28:23.356
I knew about this when

00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:26.748
I was a post-doctoral fellow
at Rockefeller University,

00:28:26.748 --> 00:28:28.452
cutting up rat brains

00:28:28.452 --> 00:28:32.035
and studying how hormones
effected neurons.

00:28:34.808 --> 00:28:36.891
But it wasn't until 2014,

00:28:39.466 --> 00:28:42.287
when I was giving psychiatry grand rounds

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:45.374
at a major medical school
here in the United States,

00:28:45.374 --> 00:28:48.749
and I talked to the outpatient coordinator

00:28:48.749 --> 00:28:50.681
of their recovery program,

00:28:50.681 --> 00:28:54.210
who herself was a reformed heroin addict.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.210
And, she told me something,
that was so jarring.

00:29:00.304 --> 00:29:02.404
What she said to me was, she said,

00:29:02.404 --> 00:29:05.487
"When I was shooting up, I was happy.

00:29:06.803 --> 00:29:10.720
"What my new life has
brought me, is pleasure."

00:29:11.999 --> 00:29:13.440
and I thought to myself, wait a second,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.523
this is exactly opposite.

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:17.724
When she was shooting up,

00:29:17.724 --> 00:29:19.034
that's what brought her pleasure,

00:29:19.034 --> 00:29:21.228
because it was heroin.

00:29:21.228 --> 00:29:25.998
And her new life has provided
her with a more steady,

00:29:25.998 --> 00:29:28.748
long-term feeling of contentment.

00:29:30.219 --> 00:29:32.992
So I thought to myself,
how often does this happen?

00:29:32.992 --> 00:29:36.513
And is this potentially at the bottom

00:29:36.513 --> 00:29:40.798
of why we have an opiod
and an addiction crisis?

00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:42.506
And I've talked with many psychiatrists

00:29:42.506 --> 00:29:45.069
who have had the same experiences

00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:47.984
told to them by their patients.

00:29:47.984 --> 00:29:50.328
About a week and a half after I got

00:29:50.328 --> 00:29:53.453
back from that trip, I was
talking to my sister-in-law.

00:29:53.453 --> 00:29:56.891
And she used to work the
help desk at Pillsbury,

00:29:56.891 --> 00:30:00.301
before they were taken
over by General Mills.

00:30:00.301 --> 00:30:01.134
People would call in,

00:30:01.134 --> 00:30:05.985
why they have icicles in
their Poppin' Fresh dough.

00:30:05.985 --> 00:30:10.555
Why the carton would, the
microwave carton would melt

00:30:10.555 --> 00:30:13.869
in the microwave, things like that.

00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:17.207
And she stayed friends with
the people she worked with

00:30:17.207 --> 00:30:20.096
and they had a gourmet club every year

00:30:20.096 --> 00:30:21.075
and they would all bring things.

00:30:21.075 --> 00:30:24.249
And one of the members of her gourmet club

00:30:24.249 --> 00:30:27.025
said to my sister-in-law, "You always stay

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:29.907
"so nice and thin, how do you do it?"

00:30:29.907 --> 00:30:31.045
And this woman had just

00:30:31.045 --> 00:30:34.211
undergone bariatric surgery for obesity.

00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:37.481
And my sister-in-law said, "Well, really,

00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:40.246
"I just only eat when I'm hungry."

00:30:40.246 --> 00:30:43.039
And the woman said to her,

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:45.299
"Eating for hunger?

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:47.466
"Eating is for happiness."

00:30:48.456 --> 00:30:50.578
and I thought to myself, a-ha.

00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:52.793
I take care of obese kids for a living

00:30:52.793 --> 00:30:54.207
and I've heard that story,

00:30:54.207 --> 00:30:56.112
but it was never so jarring

00:30:56.112 --> 00:30:57.862
as when I heard this,

00:31:01.084 --> 00:31:03.919
this discussion and I
put the two together,

00:31:03.919 --> 00:31:07.743
and I said, "We don't
know the difference."

00:31:07.743 --> 00:31:10.747
and indeed, there is an entire paper trail

00:31:10.747 --> 00:31:13.160
of not knowing the difference.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.587
And you can see it on
television, on YouTube,

00:31:15.587 --> 00:31:17.172
virtually every day.

00:31:17.172 --> 00:31:20.271
Coca-Cola's Open Happiness campaign.

00:31:20.271 --> 00:31:21.188
Happy hour.

00:31:23.144 --> 00:31:25.311
Cialis, will you be ready?

00:31:26.723 --> 00:31:29.369
Add a little stress thrown in.

00:31:29.369 --> 00:31:31.786
Bottom line, we have mistaken

00:31:33.877 --> 00:31:36.025
the experience of pleasure

00:31:36.025 --> 00:31:38.706
for the experience of happiness.

00:31:38.706 --> 00:31:42.131
And so we continue to drive our interest

00:31:42.131 --> 00:31:45.798
in pleasure at the
expense of our happiness.

00:31:47.611 --> 00:31:51.778
And you can't undo the paradigm
unless you understand it.

00:31:53.692 --> 00:31:58.492
And the four Cs, are the
way to fix the problem.

00:31:58.492 --> 00:32:01.276
- Thank you for talking with
us today about your new book.

00:32:01.276 --> 00:32:03.419
You can buy Rob Lustig's new book,

00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:05.219
The Hacking of the American Mind,

00:32:05.219 --> 00:32:08.846
at amazon.com or a bookstore near you.

00:32:08.846 --> 00:32:12.013
(upbeat piano music)
