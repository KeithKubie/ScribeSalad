[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey, everybody
and welcome to Talks at Google

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.240
at the Cambridge office.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.620
Today we are very fortunate
to have Dan Lyons here

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.270
to talk about his book,
"Disrupted-- My Misadventure

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.427
in the Startup Bubble."

00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:20.260
Dan's had a ton of jobs
throughout his life,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.310
including technology
editor at "Newsweek,"

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.990
creator of the blog "The Secret
Life of Steve Jobs," which

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.500
many of you have read, and
the co-producer and writer

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.700
for HBO's "Silicon Valley."

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.990
This book, actually, focuses
on his most recent misadventure

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.790
as a marketing fellow at
HubSpot, a Boston startup.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.896
Please join me in
welcoming Dan Lyons.

00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:39.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.752
Thank you.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.970
Thank you for having me.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.840
I'm amazed that
you all are here.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.906
But thank you.

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:52.280
I want to tell
you, first of all,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.827
that I'm a huge Android fan.

00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:55.910
I want to thank anybody
here who works on Android.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.240
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.110
I love Android.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.500
I think despite all the BS
we hear about people changing

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.010
the world, I actually
think Android

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.537
is a product that
changed the world

00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:07.870
and is still changing the world.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.244
And I really
believe in it, and I

00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:11.202
know that sounds stupid
and kooky like a drank

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:12.910
the Kool-Aid, and I
don't even work here.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.650
I think it's a
remarkable product,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.695
and I thank you all
for it every day.

00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:22.820
And also everything else--
I've built my whole life

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.861
around Google products,
I realized at some point.

00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:26.564
I have Gmail, Google Docs.

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:28.480
I mean, I think the last
10 years of my life--

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.370
I don't know how many
years of my life--

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.328
are all in Google Docs.

00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:32.080
I mean, everything--
I use your calendar.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.580
Basically my whole life is built
around stuff you guys make,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.160
and I really appreciate it.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.389
And I know also
that it's not easy,

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:41.930
not that I would have any clue
how to make anything you make.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.100
But I'm sure it involves
lots and lots of hard work

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.730
to make even a small thing
work for so many people.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.400
And what?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.290
AUDIENCE: And the
first one's free.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.789
DAN LYONS: And the
first one's free.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.210
[LAUGHS] I don't really
have prepared remarks.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.490
I can tell you a
little about myself

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.280
and answer any questions
you have about the book.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.600
But in short, I was a technology
journalist for a long time.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.660
I still kind of am.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.260
I still once in a
while write a story.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.690
And I loved being a
journalist, and I still do.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.660
I just loved, loved
being a journalist.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.790
It was, for me, probably what
your jobs feel like to you,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.420
just I get up
every day and I get

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.910
to meet fascinating,
interesting, amazing people

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.030
and ask them questions.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.350
And they actually answer them.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.830
So I met Andy Rubin
once, which is

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.910
how I became a big Android fan.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.520
I did a cover story in
"Newsweek" about Android.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.280
And I was like, I can't believe
I get to meet Andy Rubin.

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:42.415
It blew my mind.

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:45.040
I went out to Mountain View and
all the other guys on his team.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:50.310
And it was like
that all the time,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.780
meeting fascinating, interesting
people from across all fields.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.700
I ended up at "Newsweek."

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.180
I was the-- they called
it technology editor

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.270
but I was really just a writer.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.880
"Newsweek" went through a
few changes, and as you know,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.340
the media business was
stressed and under trouble.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.830
So I ended up getting
laid off in 2012.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.615
And I suddenly looked around
and realized I was 50 years old

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:19.150
or 51 and not only
was out of a job

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.760
and working in a company
that was downsizing.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.350
I looked around and the
entire industry I was in

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.006
was blowing up.

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.130
And I did the thing you do.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.780
You call all your friends.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.410
And a bunch of guys
from "Newsweek"

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.490
had bailed out to "Time."

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.350
And I thought, oh, I'll
just call and go to "Time."

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.151
And they were like, no.

00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:36.900
We've got nothing.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.410
And then Forbes where I
had worked for 10 years

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.700
before "Newsweek" had
been trying to poach me

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.130
while I was at "Newsweek."

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.546
And I kept saying, naw, I don't
want to go back to Forbes.

00:03:45.546 --> 00:03:48.230
So now, of course, I'd
love to go back to Forbes.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.886
I called them up, and they said,
oh, yeah, man, dude, oh yeah.

00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:52.260
We love it when
people come back.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.524
Come on down.

00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:55.190
And when I got there,
it was like, well,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.010
we don't-- we don't
have any jobs.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.020
But we can give you
like a contract,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.860
and you can do eight
stories a year for us.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.454
And was like, OK.

00:04:02.454 --> 00:04:05.250
And it'll pay $32,000
with no benefits.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.390
And I was like, oh shit.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.610
Like this is way
worse than I thought.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.570
This is much more
dire than I thought.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.820
So suddenly I was
kind of scrambling.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.079
I ended up going to run
a little tech blog in San

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.149
Francisco called "ReadWrite."

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.234
And I was commuting back
and forth from Boston.

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:23.400
I've always lived in Boston.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.470
And that was a grind.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.140
And it kind of for me like
the last straw for me.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.036
Because I thought if this is
what media jobs have become,

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:33.457
I don't think I can do this.

00:04:33.457 --> 00:04:35.790
And it's because it's really
about spinning that hamster

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.750
wheel and traffic
and catchy headlines.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.200
And you don't ever have time
to really do a good story

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.890
or meet people.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.500
It wasn't really what I
got into journalism to do,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.050
what appealed to
me about journalism

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.500
in the beginning in college.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.500
So I ended up
starting to think I'll

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.844
go try to work in the tech
industry and get in a startup.

00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:01.760
And that'll be fun, and
I'll go for that ride.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.490
And when you're a tech
journalist covering

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.270
these places like
Google, you always

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.212
feel like a kid with your nose
pressed against the glass,

00:05:11.212 --> 00:05:12.420
looking into the candy store.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.740
And it looks so cool.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.474
I've never done
a scientific poll

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:18.890
so I have no data
to back this up,

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.450
but I think everybody
I know-- all my friends

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.366
who are tech journalists--
I think all of them

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:25.090
at one point or another
have thought about it

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.710
or interviewed or tried to
get a job or at least wondered

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.200
what it would be like.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.590
It's sort of like if
you're a sportswriter

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.340
and you're covering
baseball, and you really

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.899
wonder what it would be like
to play on a sports team.

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:42.190
And it seems like it would
be more fulfilling than just

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.330
writing about it, the difference
being that you don't have

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.060
any chance of playing baseball.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.880
You'll never be able
to play at that level.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.170
But in tech companies,
there are still

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.880
roles that like a
journalist, in theory,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.515
is sort of semi-qualified
for like PR or blogging.

00:05:59.515 --> 00:06:01.640
I mean, we're not really
well-trained for anything,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.840
and we're not
really house-broken.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.157
I literally had a
recruiter talking to me

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.990
at one point when I was
trying to cross over

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.960
to corporate jobs.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.376
And she said, well, nobody's
going to want to talk to you.

00:06:11.376 --> 00:06:12.960
And I did that fake
Steve Jobs blog,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.210
which was like really
a bullet in the head.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.324
And she's like, well,
you're not house-broken.

00:06:20.324 --> 00:06:21.740
That was really
the word she used.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.440
I was like, really?

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.720
She's like, yeah, nobody
wants a journalist.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.844
You guys are all obnoxious.

00:06:24.844 --> 00:06:26.350
You're rude.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.180
You don't have any manners.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.637
So no, it's going
to be really tough.

00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:34.534
But long story short,
I ended up going

00:06:34.534 --> 00:06:36.950
to work at HubSpot, which is
here in Cambridge so I didn't

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.590
have to move out to the Valley.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.590
And I kind of didn't want
to move to the Valley.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.600
And it didn't go well.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.730
The long story short,
save yourself the time,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.410
the recruiter was right--

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.395
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:53.880
--like totally right.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.181
It didn't go well and
it was largely my fault.

00:06:57.181 --> 00:06:58.680
And it was essentially
the inability

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.390
to keep my mouth shut-- very
predictable consequences.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.690
And there were other issues
that came up while I was there.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.370
I was twice the age of the
average employee and not

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.890
by accident.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.600
It turns out the
company really wanted

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.650
to build a culture
around very young people

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.360
and had set up a
culture specifically

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.910
to appeal to young workers.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.520
I was there about six
months, nine months,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.770
and wondering what's wrong?

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.240
This just isn't working out.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.320
And one day the CEO
gave an interview

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.486
in "The Times," which for
a little company like that

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:36.250
is a big deal.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.640
And in it he said,
well, we're trying

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.780
to build a culture specifically
to attract and retain

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.680
Gen Y-ers.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.390
Because in tech,
things move so fast.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.890
And gray hair and experience,
they're really overrated.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.960
Really, you know,
no value there.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.660
And I kind of gasped,
seriously, because I first

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.960
thought like, A, do people
really believe that?

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.900
And then the second beat
was, even if you believe it,

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.430
would you be stupid enough
to say it in the paper?

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.267
I mean, I wrote a piece
in LinkedIn this week,

00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:07.642
and I said it's akin to saying
like, well, we really like

00:08:07.642 --> 00:08:11.697
to hire heterosexuals
or white people

00:08:11.697 --> 00:08:13.280
because white people
are good at tech.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.509
We like those white people.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:16.550
Even if you think it, you
wouldn't say it, right?

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.600
And the lesson I learned
was age bias was different.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.864
You can't say that about race,
gender, sexual orientation,

00:08:25.864 --> 00:08:28.030
but with age, in the Valley,
everybody's like, yeah,

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.590
that's totally true.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.680
Yeah, it's totally true.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.180
Yeah.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.910
Old people suck.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.600
And I was like-- I
was flabbergasted

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.950
by this, that it was just open.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.659
And that sort of was the
beginning of the end for me

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.950
because I mouthed off
about it on Facebook

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.559
and got in all sorts
of trouble about that.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.040
The other thing that
occurred to me about age

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.409
was that I don't know--
well, two things.

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:57.200
I don't know if there's
any other industry,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.750
other than professional
sports, where people just

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.550
accept that at 35 or 40 you
should expect then-- you're

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.230
winding down.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.400
You're 40.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.670
I think that's insane.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.580
I'm 55 now.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.424
I think I'm better
at what I do slightly

00:09:11.424 --> 00:09:12.465
than I was when I was 35.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.400
My sister-in-law is a
surgeon at Stanford.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.390
She's a colorectal surgeon.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.760
She's 40 years old,
and she basically

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.320
just started her
career because she

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.590
did med school, a
residency, a fellowship,

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.080
spent years and years
having to learn first

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.870
all the basics of
colorectal surgery.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.450
And now she uses robotic surgery
from, I think, it's Da Vinci.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.130
And they're very
complicated machines,

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.616
and it's very important work.

00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:40.240
And it's very
intellectually demanding.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.322
And it's also very
physically demanding.

00:09:42.322 --> 00:09:44.530
You're on your feet, and it
requires a certain amount

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.060
of dexterity and skill.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.075
And you just can't do this
without years of training--

00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:51.950
I was talking to her.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.780
I visited her a
couple weeks ago--

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.266
and years of really
arduous training where

00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:57.890
you make mistakes,
and the mistakes you

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.381
make sometimes kill people
or cause them to suffer.

00:10:02.381 --> 00:10:04.130
And the only way we
can train new surgeons

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.210
is to put people
through this ringer.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.222
And they're talking a lot in
that industry-- among surgeons

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:12.680
they talk about
grit and resilience

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.520
being now the key
markers of success,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.660
not really necessarily
huge intellect.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.840
Although, there's certainly
a lot of intellect required.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.510
So it struck me.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.800
Imagine if you told
surgeons, well, OK, 45.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.536
You really just can't
operate anymore.

00:10:28.536 --> 00:10:30.910
And I don't buy this idea that
they say in tech that tech

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.420
is somehow unique and
different and so special

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.860
and moves so fast that older
people just can't keep up.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.526
Because older people
keep up in the law.

00:10:37.526 --> 00:10:38.680
They keep up in medicine.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.340
There are surgeons
who are operating.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.840
I know airline
pilots they make them

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.730
stop flying at a certain point.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.455
Anyway, so I found that
idea kind of flabbergasting

00:10:47.455 --> 00:10:49.860
and I wanted to write about.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.590
The other idea that
I found astounding

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.600
was that I really love
the tech industry.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.320
I've spent my whole
life covering it.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.860
And I don't think you could
cover something that you hated.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.630
You could, but it would
be a miserable life.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.870
I genuinely as a journalist
get excited and got

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.000
excited going on stories.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.330
I went to Lawrence
Livermore and met

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.871
the guys who were trying to do
fusion energy which may or may

00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:12.900
not ever work, but to me,
it's like you guys are insane.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.730
It's so amazing.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.340
You would take on
something so big.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.740
Or what to CERN to the collider.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.300
And again, it's
like you can't leave

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.210
human beings will
harness themselves

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.810
to these enormous endeavors
and try to make it work.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.135
Or the supercomputing
people at Livermore I

00:11:27.135 --> 00:11:28.210
did another story on.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:33.880
And so you end up having this
deep love and appreciation

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.600
for this industry and
all the good things

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.550
it gives to the world.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.680
And then it occurred to me
that this industry that's

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.520
so great in so many ways is
also probably the least diverse

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.960
industry on earth and is
kind of like a little bit

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.989
apologetic for it but is
also sort of proud of it.

00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:54.030
And I found that strange.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.982
And I found that was something
worth wrestling with in a book.

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:59.190
This makes it sound like my
book is really depressing

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.150
and serious where it isn't.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.160
It's really a comedy.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.942
So the original
idea for my book was

00:12:02.942 --> 00:12:04.150
I worked in this environment.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.260
It was a very kooky start out
where they want to be Google

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.230
but they can't
quite get it right,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.090
so it's all Google but off.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.510
But they're HubSpotty
instead of Googley.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.180
And what's it mean
to be HubSpotty?

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.160
And this and that, and there's
a way of looking at the world.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.368
And we're on this big mission
but we sell email spam.

00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:21.212
But it was like, we're
changing the world,

00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:22.420
and we don't sell email spam.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.430
We sell anti-spam.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.060
And it's lovable
marketing content.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.190
And there's a lot of
euphemisms, a lot of jargon.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.000
So I originally set out to write
a modern-day "Office Space,"

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.340
like the Mike Judge movie only
set in 2016 at this startup.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.700
And the eyes in character
is the old guy who comes in.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.810
He's just failing
and struggling.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.000
And people look at you
like you're a ghost.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.800
There was the one
guy older than me

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.636
at the company and
then everybody else

00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:48.760
way, way, way, way younger.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.384
Like I would hang
out with 35-year-olds

00:12:50.384 --> 00:12:52.000
because those were
the old people.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.830
It was the closest I could get.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.497
So I thought that
would be a funny book.

00:12:56.497 --> 00:12:58.080
And as I started
writing it, though, I

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.910
started wrestling with this idea
of well why is it like that?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.310
Why are these
companies playgrounds?

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.890
And why do they have all
this bread and circus

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.632
and ping-pong
tables and parties?

00:13:08.632 --> 00:13:10.090
It was more of a
frat house culture

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.410
than I think what
you guys have here,

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.100
but a lot of the
new startups I think

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.390
are very frat, bro culture.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.590
And why does that exist?

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.610
And how did that happen?

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.443
And I started trying
to unravel that and get

00:13:19.443 --> 00:13:22.169
at business models.

00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:24.210
So the middle part of the
book is the boring part

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:24.840
you should just skip.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.798
Those are the chapters
where all this comes up.

00:13:26.798 --> 00:13:28.480
You can read the
beginning and the end.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.530
But no.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.580
A book that started off trying
to be funny and just a comedy

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:39.800
ended up becoming having a
little insight in the middle.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.220
So that said, I would
be happy to talk

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:50.037
to you about those issues in
the book or about Fake Steve.

00:13:50.037 --> 00:13:52.370
I think there's still some
people who remember the "Fake

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.140
Steve Jobs" thing.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.020
And that was kind of a funny--
I had to go to give a talk.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.395
My last book was a Fake Steve
book, and when it came out,

00:13:58.395 --> 00:13:59.460
I went to Google Mountain View.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.160
And it was an
interesting conversation

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.390
because I had done a lot
of jokes about Eric Schmidt

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.930
and Larry and Sergey and stuff.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.720
Or I can talk a little bit
about "Silicon Valley."

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.490
I'm a very, very minor guy.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.990
Oh, I forgot that
part of the story.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.460
While I was at HubSpot, and
really, really not going well,

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.440
I thought, OK,
I'll stay one year.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.572
I'd started in April.

00:14:19.572 --> 00:14:20.655
I'll stay till next April.

00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:24.430
Then I'll kind of find a
way to kind of ease out.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.660
Like I knew by about the
holidays this isn't working,

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.160
but nobody's hiring
in the holidays.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.480
So I'll just get through
Christmas and New Year's.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.230
And I'll do some skiing.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.520
And then about April,
it'll be about a year.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.880
And I can go away
and no one will know.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.300
Or they call it graduation,
if you graduate.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.860
Sometimes it's a
forcible graduation.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.080
Sometimes it's your own choice.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.807
But there's always
a celebratory email.

00:14:48.807 --> 00:14:50.390
Some guy gets fired
and it'll be like,

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.440
Derek just graduated,
and we all wish him

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.836
best of luck with
his superpowers

00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:54.960
on his new super adventure.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.793
And it's like great.

00:14:55.793 --> 00:14:58.140
You just fired that guy.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:58.950
It's OK.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.491
You can just say we hated him.

00:15:00.491 --> 00:15:00.990
He sucks.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.680
He's out.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.971
But one woman got fired after
four and a half years of doing

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:06.970
a lot of different jobs.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.390
And she was an accomplished one.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.140
She was 35.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.590
She had done a lot
of good things.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.640
And they just told her--
her boss just said, well,

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.210
your job doesn't exist anymore.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.080
At "Newsweek" I could
see that, right?

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.590
OK.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.900
That was bullshit
there too, by the way.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.270
In the same conversation, the
"Newsweek" woman said to me,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.315
they just want to
take your salary

00:15:22.315 --> 00:15:23.770
and hire five kids
out of college.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.720
And I was like, OK, that's real.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.500
I get that.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.865
But this place was growing.

00:15:26.865 --> 00:15:28.240
But for some
reason, I don't know

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.656
if she pissed somebody off,
did something wrong, whatever.

00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:33.140
Just four and a half years
in you have two weeks.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.706
You can interview for other
jobs inside or just get out.

00:15:35.706 --> 00:15:37.122
And of course no
one else is going

00:15:37.122 --> 00:15:39.380
to hire her inside because
now she's pariah, right?

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.210
She's got the Mark
of the Beast on her.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.230
So she leaves.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.797
But on her last day, they
had a graduation party.

00:15:45.797 --> 00:15:47.380
And she was like
having panic attacks.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.420
She was in her car crying,
like I don't get this.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.610
Why are they fucking with me?

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.560
Why are they doing this to me?

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.820
I was like, I don't know.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.400
This is like a serious
like mind screw.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.210
Total rant.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.200
So in the middle
of this-- sorry.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.240
So I'm waiting until April.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.370
They send me to a conference
in Salt Lake City.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.630
It was like the Adobe
Digital Marketing Summit.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.550
And if you want to ever
be in a ring of hell,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.258
go to the Adobe Digital
Marketing Summit.

00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:16.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.210
Some of you probably work
in digital marketing, right?

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:22.871
It's OK.

00:16:22.871 --> 00:16:23.370
I'm sorry.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.390
It was crazy.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.470
And I'm walking around.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.550
It's in the Salt Lake
City Convention Center.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.134
It's like a two-level place
with this big sort of atrium

00:16:35.134 --> 00:16:36.050
with a ring around it.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.180
And I was walking around,
looking down thinking,

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.730
if I throw myself off
this, would I die?

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.540
Or would I just be
turned into a vegetable?

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.936
Would I be paralyzed for life?

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.560
Because I don't want
to be a vegetable.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.720
But if I knew I
was going to die,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.803
I probably would just throw
myself off this bridge

00:16:48.803 --> 00:16:49.700
right now.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.580
And literally I'm walking
around, and I get this call.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:59.220
And it's an agent in
Hollywood at the agency where

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.120
I signed back when I was--
"Fake Steve Jobs" got developed

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.200
into a TV show.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.710
I sold a cable
show based on that

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.740
and I wrote a bunch of scripts
and sold it to a cable network.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.979
And then it never got made.

00:17:07.979 --> 00:17:09.520
But the scripts were
floating around,

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.500
and I had met a lot
of people out there.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.730
And then a few years
later, "Silicon Valley" got

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.692
picked up by HBO.

00:17:14.692 --> 00:17:16.900
And literally this guy says,
"Silicon Valley's" about

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.400
to start airing.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.294
And if they get renewed,
they don't know.

00:17:20.294 --> 00:17:21.710
But if they get
renewed, would you

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.170
want to come out to Hollywood
and work on a TV show?

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.290
And I was like, if you
knew where I was right now.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.740
I'm in the Salt Lake
City Convention Center.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.199
I'm watching like two rows of
schmucks going up and getting

00:17:33.199 --> 00:17:34.948
food out of, you know,
those steamer trays

00:17:34.948 --> 00:17:37.370
or like the meat you don't
know what it is and the gravy.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.662
I was like, dude, yes, yes.

00:17:38.662 --> 00:17:40.870
I don't care how much money
it is-- free, I'll do it.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.430
I'm done.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.290
I'll pay you.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.250
Really, seriously, I'll pay you.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:51.030
So they did get renewed,
and I thought great.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.720
There's my way out.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.460
I'll just give my notice.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.260
It's only 14 weeks,
but I'll find

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.710
something else on the back
end, and that'll be great.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.680
And then the company
said, no, no, we'd

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.380
like to give you
leave of absence

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.910
so we can say that one of our
guys is working on the show.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.122
Like, they saw some
publicity opportunity in it.

00:18:08.122 --> 00:18:09.580
Like, we really
had to have meeting

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.560
so we can talk about
how we can drive value

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.780
from your job at HBO.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.230
I was like, what?

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.500
And really you can't.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.669
You know, can our
CEO have a cameo?

00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:20.210
Can you plug our
product on the show?

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.760
It was like, no,
we can't do that.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.950
And me of all people.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.420
Like, I'm like the
peon of the peons.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.507
So I went on a leave of
absence, and I should never

00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:30.590
have come back, but I did.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.730
And then it got
really unpleasant.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.330
And I lasted just
a couple months.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.670
And I left.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.350
And then I did go
back last season

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.020
for another summer of
writing on the show.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.332
And I don't know if
I'll ever go back again.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.790
I don't know if
I'll be asked back.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.310
It's like every
year you don't know.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.790
But one other
interesting thing is

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.134
last year Dick
Costolo left Twitter,

00:18:52.134 --> 00:18:53.550
and I don't know
if you know this,

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.300
but he did comedy before
he was a business guy.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.380
He was a stand-up guy.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.370
He was in a pair
with another guy

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.220
and they did some comedy act.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.851
So he happened to
meet them, I guess,

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.600
and said I would love
to work on the show.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.664
So one day I went
into work on a Monday,

00:19:07.664 --> 00:19:09.830
and there was only one chair
left at this big table.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.530
So I sat down.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.550
And I looked and I'm
like, that's Dick Costolo.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.124
Like, I'd never met him before.

00:19:15.124 --> 00:19:16.040
He's talking, talking.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.244
And at lunch, he got lunch.

00:19:17.244 --> 00:19:19.660
And I said, oh, are you sticking
around for the whole day?

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.201
Because usually guests just come
in for a half day and leave.

00:19:22.201 --> 00:19:24.370
He's like, no, I'm
working here now.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.200
I'm like, whoa, OK.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.449
I'm working with Dick Costolo.

00:19:26.449 --> 00:19:27.510
This is awesome, right?

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.310
And he was really, really funny
and really smart and clever,

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.400
like a really nice guy.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.110
It was just the weirdest
experience ever.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.870
So that is sort of
the end of, I guess,

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.580
what I could tell you about my
little bio or my little story.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.060
But if you have any questions.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.450
I'm supposed to talk a
little more, but it's 2:30.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.370
We can just have questions, if
you want to ask about the show

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:57.050
or about Fake Steve or
about god forbid the book.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:02.180
I'm happy to talk,
have a conversation.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.476
Yeah?

00:20:03.476 --> 00:20:04.340
AUDIENCE: So.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.006
I haven't read the
book yet, but I think

00:20:06.006 --> 00:20:07.550
I have a relevant question.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:12.540
So in order to get
people motivated,

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.590
you like to give them these big
goals, like a Hadron Collider

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.960
and so on, so forth.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.005
And you talk to them
about the big goals,

00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:20.880
and you present them.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.520
We have our weekly
meetings, our TGIFs

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.290
where we see the great
stuff that Google's doing.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.510
On the other hand, 60,000
people, some of them

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:33.080
are doing really
repetitive, boring tasks.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.050
And so the question
is, to what extent

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.320
is it a good thing to be
creating the illusion, if you

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.049
like, or the view that
everyone's important,

00:20:43.049 --> 00:20:44.590
everyone's doing
something important,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.210
we're all doing great stuff?

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.720
It's an illusion.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.730
But the opposite is
a sort of cynicism

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.620
that you don't want
to get into either.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.830
So it reminds the
anecdote of the guy who

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.580
visits the Kennedy Spacecraft
Center, whatever it's called,

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.700
Cape Canaveral, and asks
the janitor what his job is.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.010
And he says, we're
sending a man to the moon.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.690
The janitor's saying this.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.310
So how do you balance
this illusion building

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.790
and euphemisms?

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.360
You talk about digital
marketing and email

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.990
spam-- I'm sure they didn't
call it email spam internally.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.700
DAN LYONS: No lovable
marketing content.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.980
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.790
So what's the right balance?

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.004
How do you deal with that?

00:21:27.004 --> 00:21:27.670
DAN LYONS: Yeah.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.010
It's a very good question.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.610
And I'm sure that's what
companies wrestle with,

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.630
and I'm sure that's why
a lot of the rhetoric

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.710
and those euphemisms exist
because nobody wants to call it

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.840
what it is, in some cases.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.430
I don't know.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.860
I think there was a time
when you could just say

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.290
I have a job, and I go to work.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.920
And I do my job, and I get paid.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.790
And I go home.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.620
I mean, for most
people, it wasn't

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.840
required that their
life have a big mission.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.600
But somehow that's
become a thing now,

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.339
that everybody has to feel
that they're on a mission.

00:21:58.339 --> 00:21:58.880
I don't know.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.120
Maybe you just do what
companies do and say that.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.170
I have a question.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:09.194
When you do the TGI Fridays,
does everybody in the satellite

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:09.860
offices tune in?

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.692
Does everybody go to
a room and watch it?

00:22:11.692 --> 00:22:12.900
Or you watch it at your desk?

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.760
AUDIENCE: Next day.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.680
DAN LYONS: Oh, it's taped and
you just watch it the next day.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.380
AUDIENCE: There is a livestream.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.713
DAN LYONS: Because it's late
in the day West Coast time.

00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:19.870
What time is it at?

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.480
AUDIENCE: 7:30 here.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.290
DAN LYONS: Oh, OK.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:26.390
And you guys aren't here
at 7:30 on a Friday?

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.330
Do they know that?

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.062
So I always wondered that.

00:22:31.062 --> 00:22:33.270
And they shifted it at one
point to a different time.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.276
It's on Thursday.

00:22:35.276 --> 00:22:37.400
DAN LYONS: Oh, it's on
Thursday nights now at 4:30.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:37.832
Oh, OK.

00:22:37.832 --> 00:22:39.130
AUDIENCE: So we
get it [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.340
DAN LYONS: So you
watch it on Friday

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.590
when you come into the office.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.400
But do people get
together in this office

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.290
and watch it as a group?

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.020
AUDIENCE: A lot of people do.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.978
DAN LYONS: Oh, they do.

00:22:45.978 --> 00:22:46.870
AUDIENCE: Here, yeah.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.870
DAN LYONS: Here, oh,
it's in this room.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's--

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.981
DAN LYONS: So about this many
people would be watching?

00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:51.996
AUDIENCE: No--

00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:53.495
DAN LYONS: No, all
right, all right.

00:22:53.495 --> 00:22:54.650
OK.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.512
I've just always wondered that.

00:22:57.512 --> 00:22:58.470
You know, I don't know.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:06.040
I don't know how you get people
motivated to work like that.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.760
I just think there's
a certain amount

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.120
of dishonesty or foolishness
that I found to it.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.780
Again, I'm super naive.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.140
I sort of think of
Google as a place

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.791
that legitimately
is doing big things

00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:21.290
or at least trying
to do big things.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:25.610
I still love the balloon
with the Wi-Fi thing.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.550
Is that floating
around anywhere?

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.120
It is, right?

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.124
I mean that's--

00:23:29.124 --> 00:23:30.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.498
DAN LYONS: They're
using it, right?

00:23:31.498 --> 00:23:33.630
I mean, it's cool.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.630
So I always felt like
if you were at a place

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.880
where like-- if you were at
NASA and the ultimate goal

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.296
was to put a guy on the moon,
even if your role was small,

00:23:40.296 --> 00:23:42.620
then you could still
be proud of that.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:48.312
My dad spent his whole
life at divisions of AT&amp;T.

00:23:48.312 --> 00:23:50.270
And there's a big factor
in Massachusetts where

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.340
I grew up, in North Andover.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.720
And he for a while was running
one of the shop floors.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.030
And the job, literally,
was-- I think they

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.200
were before circuit boards.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.940
And they would actually
hand wire boards.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.345
They would like-- you know.

00:24:03.345 --> 00:24:05.160
And I remember thinking that's
got to be the worst work.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.470
And it was basically
assembly line work.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.070
And I don't think
anybody dressed it

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.390
up as like we're changing
the way people communicate.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.780
It's like, no, you're
making phone crap.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.530
But it paid well, and
there was over time,

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.977
and people were happy to do
that work for the paycheck.

00:24:17.977 --> 00:24:20.560
It was considered, where I grew
up, a really good place to get

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.060
a job.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.920
It was a secure job,
and it paid well.

00:24:25.142 --> 00:24:26.850
That's a long way of
saying I don't know.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.610
Sorry.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.732
When in doubt, just bullshit.

00:24:31.732 --> 00:24:33.440
No, I think companies
struggle with that.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.450
I'm taken aback by it.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.602
I think it started with
Facebook, where they

00:24:36.602 --> 00:24:37.810
were like changing the world.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.340
And I guess, in a way, like
now I sort of think they have.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.881
I used to think they
were ridiculous,

00:24:41.881 --> 00:24:43.520
that it was just
like the biggest time

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.770
waster in the world, Facebook.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.090
And now I find I
spend all day on it.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.960
But yeah, I think
everybody saw that,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.460
and it's maybe almost
something that investors expect

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.080
a startup to be able to say
we're disrupting xyz industry,

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.270
and it's a trillion
dollar industry.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.770
We're going to have
this much of it.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.187
And we're changing the world.

00:25:03.187 --> 00:25:05.520
And that phrase, we used that
a lot on "Silicon Valley."

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.603
We make fun of that a lot.

00:25:06.603 --> 00:25:10.760
But, you know, some
companies really are.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.560
I think Tesla's really
changing the world.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.620
I would probably love
to be a peon at Tesla.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.745
I think that would
be pretty cool.

00:25:17.745 --> 00:25:19.860
I'd love to be a
peon at Google too,

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.470
if you-- no one will
ever hire me again.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.990
But no, I mean, I think to have
a small role at a big place

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.567
doing important
work would be cool.

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:27.400
It'd be interesting.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.180
Like the old Bell Labs, I
visited those guys a few times.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.950
And I thought, like, man, to
be even a tiny part of this

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.390
must be very, very cool.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.820
It must be meaningful.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.850
But I don't know.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.020
Maybe day-to-day it isn't.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.487
Sorry.

00:25:40.487 --> 00:25:42.320
AUDIENCE: I think your
comments on the youth

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.689
culture in technology
are interesting and true.

00:25:44.689 --> 00:25:45.730
DAN LYONS: Oh, thank you.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.771
AUDIENCE: One of things
I've wondered about that,

00:25:47.771 --> 00:25:50.150
though, is if things
go well, young people

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.980
turn into old people.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.270
And I'm wondering--

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.440
DAN LYONS: Yeah, right,
exactly, exactly.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.250
If things go well.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.499
I like that you prefaced that.

00:25:58.499 --> 00:26:00.470
Yeah, yeah.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.600
AUDIENCE: And I
really wonder what

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.700
the people who are
enforcing youth culture

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.912
think they're going to
do when they're 45 or 50.

00:26:08.912 --> 00:26:09.620
DAN LYONS: Right.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.074
AUDIENCE: 35 [INAUDIBLE] maybe.

00:26:11.074 --> 00:26:13.490
DAN LYONS: I wrote this think
in LinkedIn this week that's

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:14.140
gone crazy.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.930
I've had like more than
1,000 comments about age.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.140
And it really struck a nerve.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.980
But I got a an email from
a guy in San Francisco.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.120
Now he's not technical
but he works in tech

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.860
as a writer/blogger kind of guy.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.147
He's 32.

00:26:28.147 --> 00:26:29.730
And he said, I'm
already freaking out,

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.380
like I'm too old because the
people right out of college

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.380
are way younger than me.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.240
And I feel like I'm getting
aged out-- at 32, right?

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.740
The other thing I
always think about

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.180
is, you know the
famous Mark Zuckerberg

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.270
quote when he was like 20?

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.710
He got up on stage and said
young people are just smarter.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.710
And I wonder if he's going
to feel that way when

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.560
he's 40 and 50, right?

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.060
Maybe.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.230
It may be that they want
to hire young people

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.250
for certain reasons
other than the fact

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.730
that they themselves are young.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.430
But I do wonder if
that attitude will

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.250
change as these companies
grow up and mature.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.970
I have the same fear.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.350
Then you feel like--
because a lot of people

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.490
don't like this book.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.906
There was an excerpt
in "Fortune,"

00:27:08.906 --> 00:27:11.050
and it's kind of making
fun of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:12.340
It was a pretty funny excerpt.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.740
But a lot of people
didn't like it.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.599
And one guy said, here's
my review of the book.

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:19.140
And it's a picture
of Grandpa Simpson

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.110
and it says, "Old
man yells at cloud."

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.900
And again, you feel like you're
the old guy ranting around

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.220
like, (OLD MAN VOICE)
these kids these days.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:26.970
And it's like, no.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.450
I mean, I think
people of all ages

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.840
are cable doing great things.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.550
It's the reverse that I think.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.950
After 40 somehow you're useless.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.783
And I wonder, yeah,
when they get to be 40--

00:27:37.783 --> 00:27:40.875
are they all buying into a world
view that says, you know, yeah.

00:27:40.875 --> 00:27:43.000
Your career's only going
to-- don't worry about it.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.791
When you turn 30, you'll
deal with it then.

00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:46.060
But how?

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.180
I don't know.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.050
That is one of the big problems.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.069
You're a millennial.

00:27:54.069 --> 00:27:55.360
AUDIENCE: Not quite, thank you.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.276
DAN LYONS: Oh, really?

00:27:56.276 --> 00:27:58.910
OK, thank you.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:27:59.971
Sir, go ahead.

00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:01.970
AUDIENCE: So I haven't
read the book yet either.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.682
Maybe this is-- I'm just
asking you to talk about what's

00:28:05.682 --> 00:28:06.640
in the middle chapters.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.840
But you kind of
implied, I think,

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:15.090
that the sort of frat
culture of a lot of startups

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.610
contribute to and reinforces
the lack of diversity.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:23.522
And how do you unpack
and reverse that?

00:28:23.522 --> 00:28:25.540
DAN LYONS: Yeah.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.500
That's a really good question.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.290
And I do think
those are related,

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.269
that the frat, bro culture is--
and this idea of culture fit.

00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:37.060
When I interviewed at
HubSpot, that was one

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.770
of the first things they said.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:38.800
Like, we like
culture fits, someone

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.950
we want to go have a beer with.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:40.910
That's who I want
to hire, people

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.451
who I want to have
a beer with, which

00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:44.900
is sort of the euphemism for
people who are just like me.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.600
So it actually creates
a lack of diversity.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.920
It's the opposite of diversity.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.930
It's a uniformity.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:50.940
It's a filter bubble.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.639
I think the only way
it gets reversed--

00:28:56.639 --> 00:28:58.180
because right now
Silicon Valley will

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.220
pay lip service to
diversity, at least when

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.292
it comes to race and gender.

00:29:02.292 --> 00:29:03.750
They don't really
do much about it.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.397
But every year the
reports come out.

00:29:06.397 --> 00:29:08.730
Apple, Google, Facebook put
out their diversity numbers.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.646
I did a search for this,
and the headlines all

00:29:10.646 --> 00:29:12.777
show-- new report
shows little progress.

00:29:12.777 --> 00:29:14.610
Next year, new report
shows little progress.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:19.790
So I think this is
incredibly cynical.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.970
And I don't think it
applies to Google,

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.150
but I think maybe a lot
of these startups that

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.590
are very bro-like cultures.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:32.370
I think if you gave the
bros a shot of truth serum,

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.370
and they said what they really
thought, they would say,

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.910
yeah, we have to say that stuff.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:43.090
But they believe in their minds
that the optimal arrangement

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.277
is a bunch of bros working in a
company who think the same way.

00:29:46.277 --> 00:29:47.610
And then that gives them energy.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.666
And I think they
actually think this

00:29:49.666 --> 00:29:50.790
is the optimal arrangement.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.420
We're going to get the
best financial payoff

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.295
if we do it this way.

00:29:53.295 --> 00:29:55.510
Anything we do about
diversity will slow us down,

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.061
will make us less nimble.

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:58.060
It's just an impediment.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.670
And yeah, we'll do as little
of it as we can to get by.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:05.850
But we won't really do it.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:07.740
We don't really
believe it'll work.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.617
And I think the only
way for change to come

00:30:09.617 --> 00:30:11.950
is for these guys to become
convinced that it's actually

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.410
in their economic interest,
that it actually makes company

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.540
better and stronger, that
it's smart business, not

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.220
just a nice thing to do.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.637
Because I think the ultimate
cynical response from Silicon

00:30:20.637 --> 00:30:23.011
Valley is, like, we're not in
the business of being nice.

00:30:23.011 --> 00:30:24.470
I'm not in the
business of trying

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.780
to help you or help
women or help-- no.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.220
You take care of yourself.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.560
It's a meritocracy out here.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.880
And I'm in the business to
make as much money as I can.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.427
And I'm going to
do whatever I can

00:30:33.427 --> 00:30:35.510
to make the most money in
the least possible time.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.060
I actually think
that's the problem.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.850
And I think they have
the wrongheaded idea

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:45.070
that lack of diversity
equals success financially.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.470
Sorry.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.400
AUDIENCE: So not to
distract from the book,

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.090
in your experience as
a technology writer,

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.380
in the things you've
covered, is there

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.150
anything that
stands out as being

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.860
particularly bizarre or
foolhardy or brilliant and

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.279
successful?

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:07.820
DAN LYONS: You mean of things
that I covered and wrote about?

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.590
DAN LYONS: Well, I wrote about
the first dot com bubble.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.900
I was at Forbes at the time.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.400
And I remember it
lasted so long,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.944
or it seemed to at the time,
that I started to doubt myself.

00:31:17.944 --> 00:31:19.860
I started thinking maybe
these guys are right.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.449
Maybe the laws of gravity
don't apply anymore.

00:31:22.449 --> 00:31:23.740
Maybe the markets have changed.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.080
Economics have changed.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.300
Trees grow to the sky.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.924
I remember this moment
where I thought,

00:31:27.924 --> 00:31:29.850
like, I'm the wrong
one, again, all

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.970
of us who are cynical
on the outside saying

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.990
this is ridiculous.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:38.040
But that was a fun period.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.150
Ironically looking back
on that period now,

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:41.820
it was a great
time for magazines

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.800
because all those companies
raised lots and lots of money.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:50.770
And they bought, what, Sun
computers, Oracle database,

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.270
routers from Cisco,
and EMC storage.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.936
That's where they
spent all their money.

00:31:53.936 --> 00:31:55.540
And then they
bought ads for hype.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.820
So we got all the ad money.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.470
And so we all thought in the
media business this is great.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:00.610
Boy, business is booming.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.860
So I think we were all
very foolish in those days.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.460
And it's hard not to be
foolish when you're benefiting

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.500
from the foolishness.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.310
You're having a great time.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.130
But no, I wrote about a lot of
things and met a lot of people

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.260
that I thought were
really interesting

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.049
and doing amazing,
amazing things.

00:32:19.049 --> 00:32:20.590
I always felt, for
example, Microsoft

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.506
was a much better company
than they got credit for.

00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:26.130
I think Ballmer made
a lot of mistakes,

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.380
and he missed a lot of things.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.080
But, boy, they've built
this enterprise business

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.290
that really phenomenal.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.270
And just the people I met
at Microsoft over the years

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:40.077
were always really, really
nice, smart, dedicated people.

00:32:40.077 --> 00:32:41.910
Engineers, especially,
were always the best.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.910
You very rarely get
to meet real engineers

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:44.560
when you're a journalist.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.101
You're very much
kept on the outside,

00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:48.331
and you get brought in
and given a canned thing.

00:32:48.331 --> 00:32:49.830
And the person's
been media trained.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.150
So you realize you're always
kind of working from a script

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.230
that the company has written.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.560
But when you can meet real
engineers, they're the best.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.140
They're always like great
people, very cynical.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.817
You know what I mean?

00:33:00.817 --> 00:33:02.650
They're a lot like
journalists in some ways.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.150
They're really wise asses
and great sense of humor.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.750
And I always loved
that Microsoft

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.240
had this engineering culture,
especially in the early days.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.816
And the same thing at
Google, I mean the best thing

00:33:12.816 --> 00:33:15.190
about being a tech journalist--
and probably a lot of you

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.220
have worked at different places.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.803
You work in the tech
industry, there's

00:33:17.803 --> 00:33:20.540
a lot of amazing, really
cool, really nice people

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.110
who are just fantastic to meet.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.934
So that was the
best thing about it.

00:33:25.934 --> 00:33:28.100
I mean, I have friends that
I've been in touch with,

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.030
like a PR guy that
I met on a story,

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.680
and we became friends
for-- I was just

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.467
trading email today with a
woman who did PR at Dell in '99.

00:33:35.467 --> 00:33:37.550
And we got to be friends,
and we're still friends.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:41.730
And she doesn't work in tech
anymore-- just really, really

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.880
fantastic people.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.926
Do you have a question?

00:33:46.926 --> 00:33:48.300
AUDIENCE: Don't
mean to stop you.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.415
I love the Fake Steve Jobs.

00:33:50.415 --> 00:33:51.790
I was wondering
if there's things

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.720
that happened since that
ended that you really

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.501
wanted to write about or
talk about in that voice?

00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:58.000
DAN LYONS: Yeah,
not so much lately,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
but there was a time
when I really missed it.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.420
It was very addictive
for me doing that blog.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.117
There were, in fact, a
lot of times along the way

00:34:05.117 --> 00:34:07.700
early on when I really thought
I should stop because I thought

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.900
this is disastrous.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.449
And I would find I couldn't.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.400
Then something would happen
and it'd be like, ohh.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.420
And there was a time when
I thought-- I stopped

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.230
when Steve got really sick.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.570
I was actually big Apple fan.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.370
I find the cultiness and
the weird mind control stuff

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.130
hilarious.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.159
Same thing at HubSpot-- I
find it hilariously funny.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.900
But I loved the products,
and I admired him.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.120
So after he died, though,
there was a time when I really

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.489
thought about bringing him
back as Dead Steve Jobs,

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.150
which is terrible, right?

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.880
I mean, it's so wrong.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.750
And he either gets a laugh or
people like-- like that woman

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:50.500
covering her face.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.820
It's like oh shit.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.210
Like there's a couple people
really not looking happy now.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.897
I'm sorry.

00:34:56.897 --> 00:34:58.730
And I didn't mean it
in a disrespectful way.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:59.705
But I had this idea.

00:34:59.705 --> 00:35:01.080
In the "Fake Steve
Jobs" blog, he

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.270
was sitting in
the Lotus position

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.830
with the bong and a MacBook.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.630
And I actually had an artist
do a version of that only he

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.130
had wings and he was
on a cloud and he had

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.610
a harp and a MacBook, right?

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:20.430
And the idea was
he's gone to heaven.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.460
And he's in the afterlife.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.540
And he's really pissed because
he got taken too early.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.990
And he's also really pissed
because he hates all the stuff

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.140
Tim Cook is doing.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.000
And I thought it could be
really cool to have him

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.250
up there going, no,
no, no, not the watch!

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.390
Not the watch!

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:41.170
Or, that's never going to work!

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.650
No one's going to buy it!

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.520
Or whatever.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.184
I just thought Apple in some
ways has changed without him.

00:35:47.184 --> 00:35:48.600
And I thought that
could be funny.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.270
I even thought there could be
a TV show not about Steve Jobs

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.420
but about that idea.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.875
Like have you even
seen the movie,

00:35:55.875 --> 00:35:58.357
it's with Albert Brooks and
Meryl Streep, where they--

00:35:58.357 --> 00:35:59.690
AUDIENCE: "Defending Your Life."

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:00.880
DAN LYONS: What is it?
"Defending Your Life."

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.697
Yeah.

00:36:01.697 --> 00:36:03.530
And it's set in the
afterlife, and they die.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.010
And they go to a place
that's a lot like Google.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.310
It's really beautiful
and perfect.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.610
And everything's calm,
and there's food.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.401
And it's wonderful.

00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:10.480
They land in the Googleplex.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.480
And before you
can get to heaven,

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.222
you have to go in
like in a courtroom

00:36:16.222 --> 00:36:18.430
and defend all the shitty
things you did in your life

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:20.846
that you thought no one saw
but they saw because they have

00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:23.287
video of everything, right?

00:36:23.287 --> 00:36:24.870
But there's never
been a TV show where

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.040
the guy is in the afterlife.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.290
I thought that could be
half-- you could do a TV show.

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.561
It's a CEO, gets hit
by a bus one day.

00:36:31.561 --> 00:36:35.110
Or maybe make it more like
Ari Gold in Entourage,

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.610
like kind of an
intense character.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.190
And he gets whacked,
hit by a bus.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.554
And bam, he's dead.

00:36:41.554 --> 00:36:42.470
He's in the afterlife.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.290
And his company that
he loves-- and he

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.020
wasn't ready to leave it.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.120
He has to watch someone
else screw it up.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.794
And I thought that could
be a fun show-- half

00:36:51.794 --> 00:36:52.960
of it set in the afterworld.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.210
He's meeting other famous dead
people who turn out to be jerks

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:57.480
or whatever.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.050
Gandhi turns out to be
a real prick, whatever.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.460
You can have stuff like that.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.480
And then he could even appeared
to Tim Cook like in dreams

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.450
or in his room.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.240
I had one idea where Bill Gates
is in like Dubai in a room.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.030
He's got security.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.863
He thinks he's safe.

00:37:13.863 --> 00:37:15.780
And he wakes up in the
morning, and dead Steve

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.196
is sitting in the corner in
the chair just looking at him.

00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:19.420
He's like, whoa, Jesus!

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.290
And then Steve is there to have
a reckoning with Bill Gates.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.770
Anyway.

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:27.510
I literally pitched this and
got exactly this response.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.960
Like, no!

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.800
We're not making a
show about a dead guy

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.735
who appears to people, like no.

00:37:32.735 --> 00:37:38.150
[LAUGHS] And yet, even
now as I pitch it to you,

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.680
I still believe in it.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.330
I still want to make that show.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.967
So yeah, I did
have this yearning.

00:37:47.967 --> 00:37:49.050
It was hard to give it up.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:49.710
It really was.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.820
It was very, very hard.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.880
And I don't so much anymore.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.945
Long answer, sorry.

00:37:55.945 --> 00:37:56.692
Sorry, go ahead.

00:37:56.692 --> 00:37:58.400
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about the reporting

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.720
process for this book.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.940
Because when you're a reporter,
people know you're a reporter.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.720
You go to campus.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.310
You're wearing a badge.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.960
At what point in the process
where you're an employee

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.422
did the light bulb go on
like, OK, I'm doing a book.

00:38:10.422 --> 00:38:12.380
And the people around me
maybe don't know that,

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.380
and you're like scribbling
notes from a meeting.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.400
Or [INAUDIBLE] all
done afterwards?

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.060
DAN LYONS: It was
all done afterwards.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.268
I wasn't really taking notes.

00:38:18.268 --> 00:38:19.810
I was paying attention.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.976
And I take notes as a
habit, like in meetings

00:38:21.976 --> 00:38:23.850
because I never remember
what's in a meeting.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.990
So I tend to sit in meetings
and just type and type and type.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.210
Because it's just
by force of habit.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.293
My whole life I've been
sitting across from people

00:38:29.293 --> 00:38:30.620
typing or writing notes.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.760
But it's a good question.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.700
And I don't really
have-- I mean,

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.840
I did do reporting after I left
that wasn't to do with HubSpot,

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.390
that had to do with
calling up people

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.790
in the industry for
perspective on the bubble

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:55.240
or compensation, other CEOs
or venture capitalists.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.680
I think of it more as like
a memoir of my time there,

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.900
and I'm remembering things
that happened when I was there,

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.850
like a crazy meeting.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.520
There was an incident
with Teddy bear.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.731
Yeah, see.

00:39:07.731 --> 00:39:10.230
This is one of the moments where
I knew I don't belong here.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:13.570
So about three months
in, we got a note saying,

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.880
you know, they're very good
like promoting on social.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.142
You get a note saying
the CTO, the founder,

00:39:18.142 --> 00:39:20.100
just published a new
article on LinkedIn Pulse,

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.061
and we've got to all
go online and all spam

00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:24.310
it and all tweet it and get
everybody to drive traffic

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.260
to that blog, that post,

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.110
And my feeling is like if a post
is good it will get traffic.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:33.690
And you can't tweet a
turd to your success.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:34.840
You can't.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.979
I don't believe in it.

00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:37.020
I don't think that works.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.478
And I think if it's
a great post it

00:39:38.478 --> 00:39:41.394
finds-- a great piece
of content, let's say,

00:39:41.394 --> 00:39:42.310
will find an audience.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.540
And so I kind of find that
whole thing ridiculous.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.761
But I say, OK, I'll do it.

00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.510
And I went and looked
at the post, though.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.630
And the post said,
we really believe

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.102
in solving for the customer.

00:39:51.102 --> 00:39:52.310
The customer is so important.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.630
We want the customer
present at every meeting.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.210
So we have an empty chair.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.960
We put the empty chair-- every
management team meeting I have,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.876
I have an empty chair.

00:39:59.876 --> 00:40:02.550
And the empty chair
is the customer.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.330
I don't know if they
talked to the chair.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:05.922
But we consult the empty chair.

00:40:05.922 --> 00:40:06.880
But that wasn't enough.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.530
So I got a Teddy bear.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.255
Now I bring the Teddy
bear to meetings.

00:40:11.255 --> 00:40:12.130
And he had a picture.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:12.790
This was on LinkedIn.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.753
He was really proud of it,
like with the CMO sitting next

00:40:14.753 --> 00:40:15.420
to a Teddy bear.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.100
And the Teddy bear has a Red
Bull, looking all pissed off.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.202
And he's like, this is
Molly the Teddy bear.

00:40:20.202 --> 00:40:21.910
And she comes to all
of our meetings now.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.458
And I'm like, this is nuts.

00:40:24.458 --> 00:40:26.210
This is crazy.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.730
But everybody else around
me thinks it's cool.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.040
And literally the guy-- we sat
screen to screen like this,

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.069
was a former Googler.

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:34.860
He had been here for
like just three years,

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.220
like an entry level ad sale guy.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.347
And he was kind of cool.

00:40:38.347 --> 00:40:40.680
So I leaned over to him and
I was like, dude, dude, hey.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.660
What?

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.286
He's like what?

00:40:42.286 --> 00:40:43.785
I'm like, did you
read that article?

00:40:43.785 --> 00:40:44.500
He's like, yeah.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.325
And there's like people all
around, so you had to be quiet.

00:40:46.325 --> 00:40:47.960
And I was like, the
Teddy bear thing.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.710
Did you read that?

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:49.690
He's like, yeah, yeah.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:50.898
I thought it was really good.

00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:53.027
I'm like, you thought
that was good?

00:40:53.027 --> 00:40:53.860
And he's like, yeah.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.120
I was like, that's crazy.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.900
He's like, no, no,
no, well, you know,

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.426
startups are really-- they're
really eccentric and kooky.

00:40:59.426 --> 00:41:00.550
And that's how we are, man.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.970
And I was like, wait a minute,
when you were at Google,

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.469
if Larry Page came out and said
that he was bringing a Teddy

00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:08.000
bear to meetings, you're telling
me that everybody at Google

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:08.810
would just be like, hey, great.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:09.500
That's awesome.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.700
Let's just all have Teddy bears.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.366
He's like, well, no,
Google's different.

00:41:12.366 --> 00:41:14.874
I was like, no,
because that's insane.

00:41:14.874 --> 00:41:16.790
No matter where you are,
carrying a Teddy bear

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.130
to meetings is crazy.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.020
So what amazed me was
not just the Teddy bear

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.394
but the fact that
no one else had

00:41:22.394 --> 00:41:23.684
a problem with the Teddy bear.

00:41:23.684 --> 00:41:25.350
And it wasn't like
we all think it sucks

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:26.790
but we don't dare say anything.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.373
It was like they had
really bought in,

00:41:28.373 --> 00:41:29.719
like this is awesome.

00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:31.510
All I know is in any
news room I worked in,

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.381
if the managing editor-- and
there are managing editors

00:41:34.381 --> 00:41:36.630
out there who probably would
bring a Teddy bear to sit

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:37.900
in as, this is the reader.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.880
Think about what
the reader wants.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.010
That person would
be mocked forever.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.340
They would be just mocked
mercilessly forever.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.879
Everybody would get Teddy bears.

00:41:45.879 --> 00:41:47.420
We'd leave Teddy
bears in his office.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.336
We'd stab Teddy bears.

00:41:48.336 --> 00:41:49.959
I mean, it's terrible.

00:41:49.959 --> 00:41:52.000
You'd do horrible things
to the guy's Teddy bear.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.541
You'd put him a
noose like, [GROANS].

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.982
But nobody did that.

00:41:56.982 --> 00:41:58.440
It was just the
most amazing thing.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.380
Anyway.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.296
[INAUDIBLE] questions.

00:42:03.296 --> 00:42:04.850
Yes, sorry.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.994
My point is I was just
observing stuff like that,

00:42:06.994 --> 00:42:08.410
and I remembered
that, going like,

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:09.530
oh, I remember the
Teddy bear thing.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.696
So how do you describe that
and make it like a scene

00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:12.710
so it's funny?

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.779
Yes?

00:42:13.779 --> 00:42:15.070
AUDIENCE: Kind of seguing back.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.050
Thank you for writing
the Fake Steve Blog.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:18.091
DAN LYONS: Oh, thank you.

00:42:18.091 --> 00:42:20.560
AUDIENCE: It was a joy.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.690
I was surprised to hear
that somebody reacted

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.430
as if you weren't house trained
for writing that, I think

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.310
is what you said.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:28.990
DAN LYONS: Well, and she
meant journalists in general.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.660
She just meant companies
don't like to hire journalists

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.230
because you're--

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.063
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:42:32.063 --> 00:42:33.520
DAN LYONS: --kind of, yeah.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.145
AUDIENCE: For those
who don't remember,

00:42:35.145 --> 00:42:36.330
you were kind of unmasked.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:39.180
You wrote in secret
for quite awhile.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.370
And when you were unmasked,
I didn't have the impression

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.760
that you were doing
anything really wrong.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.010
It seemed like a subversive
kind of journalism, actually.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:49.630
DAN LYONS: It had
become that, yeah.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.280
AUDIENCE: Because I remember
certain entries that you had,

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.654
like talking about meeting
with music executives

00:42:54.654 --> 00:42:56.320
to create iTunes and
that kind of stuff,

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.400
it seems like you
couldn't have written

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.102
the same way if you had just
written an article yourself.

00:43:01.102 --> 00:43:01.810
DAN LYONS: Right.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.440
You needed the shift
of the character.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.380
Yeah.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.640
And it became journalism
because I originally started

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.620
just writing little jokes.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.620
I originally started
writing it because I wanted

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.010
to learn how to use Blogger.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.940
It didn't have anything
to do with content.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.280
But I needed something.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.500
And I tried WordPress.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.240
I tried TypePad.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.650
And then I wanted
to use Blogger.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.239
And so, I'll just do a fake CEO.

00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:22.780
Because like Robert
Scoble was always

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.360
writing about how all
CEOs should have blogs.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.109
Remember the guy at
Sun, Jonathan Schwartz

00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:29.090
had a CEO blog, which I
thought was like the worst idea

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.790
ever, like the CEO
should have a blog.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.400
But you could only go so far
with like jokes about yoga

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.500
and stuff with Steve Jobs.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.810
And then finally I had
to have something for him

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:38.580
to write about.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.082
And I thought, oh, what if
he's covering technology?

00:43:41.082 --> 00:43:42.040
He's like a journalist.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.570
He's like pontificating
on stuff that's happening,

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.847
not even in his own place.

00:43:45.847 --> 00:43:47.430
Like he used to rail
about open source

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.130
because I used to
cover open source.

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.970
And I was obsessed with it.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.160
And so he would be making
fun of those guys, which

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.710
was not in character for
Steve Jobs at all, really.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:59.500
I mean, although he
probably had his opinions.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.402
But yeah, it was a
kind of journalism.

00:44:01.402 --> 00:44:03.610
In fact, toward the end,
there was a really good one.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:07.650
I'm still kind of semi-proud
of this where the CEO of AT&amp;T

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:11.880
came out and said
something about all these--

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.434
the iPhone was
fairly new, and he

00:44:13.434 --> 00:44:15.850
was saying that these iPhone
users are using too much data

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:17.350
and they're clogging
up our network.

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:20.270
We've got to find a
way to choke them back.

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.860
They're taxing the network.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.120
And so I had Steve Jobs go
on this rant like, look.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.190
Like we created this great phone
that everybody wants to use.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:33.030
This is like you're the record
label, the pressing plant,

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.330
and someone just gave
you "Meet the Beatles."

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.914
And there's so
much demand for it.

00:44:36.914 --> 00:44:38.580
And you're like
goddammit, these people.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.120
I wish they would stop
listening to this music,

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.050
like I can't keep making
these stupid records.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.600
He's like, build
out your network.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.210
And then I went
on this long rant,

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.293
and it kind of went viral.

00:44:46.293 --> 00:44:48.580
And then as a joke--
that was on a Friday.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:49.872
It went crazy over the weekend.

00:44:49.872 --> 00:44:51.330
I thought, oh, I've
struck a nerve.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:52.190
Time to hit again.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.390
And so on Monday I get up
and said Steve Jobs says,

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:55.320
well, I'll tell you what.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.710
All the engineers
here are so pissed

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.120
because like we worked
so hard on the iPhone,

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.536
and then they're trying to
choke it back and make it worse

00:45:00.536 --> 00:45:01.206
experience.

00:45:01.206 --> 00:45:02.330
We've come up with an idea.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:06.320
This Friday at 12 o'clock,
12:00 noon Pacific time,

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.590
everybody get on your
iPhone at the same time.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:09.990
Do something really
data intense,

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.450
and let's just take
down the whole network,

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:13.150
like we're going to call
it Operation Choke Hold,

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.490
and we're going to destroy
the AT&amp;T network, right?

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:16.720
Ha, ha, ha.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:19.405 --> 00:45:23.420
So this is a true story, right?

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.170
And I'm working at
"Newsweek" at the time,

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.405
and AT&amp;T, it turns out,
is our largest advertiser.

00:45:27.405 --> 00:45:29.090
But I don't know this, right?

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.330
I don't know this at all.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:33.580
So I put this thing out there.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.370
They're going to
think it's a joke.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.286
I forgot all about it.

00:45:35.286 --> 00:45:37.520
But then someone starts
a thing, and they're

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.040
going to actually do this.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.915
And next thing I know,
people are writing about it,

00:45:42.915 --> 00:45:44.894
like Operation Choke
Hold Friday at noon.

00:45:44.894 --> 00:45:45.560
This is a thing.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.879
And like AT&amp;T, I think they
issued a statement about it.

00:45:49.879 --> 00:45:51.670
And next thing I know,
I swear to God, it's

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.285
on Wolf Blitzer-- Wolf Blitzer.

00:45:53.285 --> 00:45:55.160
I have a clip of him
like, they're calling it

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.074
Operation Choke Hold.

00:45:56.074 --> 00:45:57.990
Techies are threatening
about taking down-- it

00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:59.570
all started on this
satirical blog.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:00.950
And I'm like, oh shit.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:02.830
Like, I'm in such
trouble, right?

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:05.440
And I remember saying to people,
I don't think it'll work.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.150
I don't think you can take
down the network if everybody

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.191
gets on at the same time.

00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:09.456
But I don't know.

00:46:09.456 --> 00:46:10.330
I mean, I don't know.

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:10.992
Maybe it will.

00:46:10.992 --> 00:46:12.325
Of course it didn't do anything.

00:46:14.952 --> 00:46:16.160
Then I started doing stories.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.341
Because I'm like, OK.

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:17.840
Fine.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.060
Let's be pissed about this.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.530
So I started looking at how
much money they were taking in

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:22.840
in data revenue.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.650
And it was huge, like this.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:26.600
And how much were they
spending on Capex?

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.346
Like this.

00:46:27.346 --> 00:46:29.470
So I start writing these
articles saying, you SOBs.

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:30.670
Like, you're making
all this money on us,

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:33.086
charging us for data, but you
won't build out your network

00:46:33.086 --> 00:46:34.660
to support what we want to do.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.100
And then I felt like I hope
we do take down the network.

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.610
So it didn't go down.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.230
And Friday in the afternoon I
get this call from my editor

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.870
at "Newsweek."

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:43.276
She's like, hey.

00:46:43.276 --> 00:46:44.400
I'm like, hey, how are you?

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.240
I haven't talked
to you all week.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:45.906
What's going on?

00:46:45.906 --> 00:46:47.736
She's like, nothing
much, how are you?

00:46:47.736 --> 00:46:49.870
I'm like, ah, not bad.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.210
And I said, have you heard
about this Operation Choke Hold

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.080
thing?

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.977
She's like, oh yes.

00:46:56.977 --> 00:46:59.560
So apparently AT&amp;T was lighting
them up all week, telling them

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.807
you've got to fire this guy.

00:47:00.807 --> 00:47:02.140
We're going to pull all our ads.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.300
But they said it's not our blog.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.824
It's his crazy
thing on the side.

00:47:05.824 --> 00:47:07.990
But that was one where I
actually thought-- and then

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.637
AT&amp;T starts putting
out press releases.

00:47:09.637 --> 00:47:10.970
We're building out network here.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:11.880
We're building out network here.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.130
We're adding this in Cincinnati.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.900
We're building out this.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.275
And I was like, OK, so there
was a little bit of activism

00:47:16.275 --> 00:47:18.690
there that maybe did
a little tiny bit.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.650
Anyway.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.957
Thank you.

00:47:21.957 --> 00:47:22.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:24.559
What does disruption
mean to you?

00:47:24.559 --> 00:47:26.100
You use it in the
title of your book,

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.150
and you apply to yourself.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:31.650
We hear this word today in
every context of society,

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.340
and especially
technology and society.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.381
What does it mean to you?

00:47:34.381 --> 00:47:38.100
And also relatedly, in your
long life in Massachusetts,

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.300
in Cambridge, perhaps, have
you seen how the dynamics

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.020
within the companies
that you're describing

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.610
actually affecting or
possibly disrupting

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:51.814
the community's regular
day-to-day life in Cambridge?

00:47:51.814 --> 00:47:53.480
DAN LYONS: I haven't
seen that, and I've

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:59.070
lived in and around Boston
for on and off since the 80s.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:02.240
Well, I grew up
in Massachusetts.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.470
I haven't really seen
disruption in the community,

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.390
but I think people who
are closer to Cambridge

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:08.030
would say that they have.

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.190
I don't know.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:11.520
But yeah, I thank
you for that question

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.214
because that was the sort of
pun of the title was that we

00:48:14.214 --> 00:48:15.380
talk a lot about disruption.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.520
When you're a tech
journalist, it's

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.630
one of those words you use so
much you try to stop using it

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.005
because it's so easy to just
say they're disrupting this.

00:48:21.005 --> 00:48:22.890
They're disrupting that.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.350
And we all talk
about disruption.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:26.690
I'm not sure.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:28.290
Did it come from
Clayton Christensen?

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:30.420
Does anybody know?

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.070
Is it from "The
Innovator's Dilemma"?

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:33.922
Is that where it comes from?

00:48:33.922 --> 00:48:35.380
But in my case, it
was that my life

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.730
got disrupted by, oddly enough,
in a way, by the internet.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:41.870
"Newsweek" got destroyed
by the internet.

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:43.710
I mean, the media
business got upended

00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:47.420
or disrupt-- classic disruption,
right-- of a monopoly business,

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.650
disrupted by this change.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:58.840
So I wanted it just to be a
pun or a double meaning thing.

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.124
And then I thought, I'm
leaving the disrupted side

00:49:01.124 --> 00:49:03.540
of the world, and I'm going
to go work for the disrupters.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.770
We're going to be
the change agents.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:06.130
And in many ways, they were.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.850
There were a lot of
really smart, cool people

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:11.310
who had new ideas
about media there.

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:16.200
So mainly for me it was just
about my life being disrupted.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:21.220
There's is slightly larger
aspect of it, which is that--

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.520
and I write about this
in the book, --in 2011,

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.311
while I was at "Newsweek,"
they had a story

00:49:25.311 --> 00:49:27.690
called "Beached White Males."

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:30.280
It had a picture of a guy
in a suit, a business guy

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.780
in a suit with gray
hair, faced down

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:33.050
on the beach with the waves.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:34.300
He's like dead, right?

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.270
And if he's not dead,
like almost dead.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:39.900
And it was this whole story
about how in the 2008 and 2009

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.630
crash and that whole thing,
that the people hit hardest

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:47.540
were men my age like in
the 40s then, 40s, 50s, who

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.130
were getting knocked out.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:50.680
They had risen to
a certain level.

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.250
They're getting
paid pretty well.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:53.952
And they were all
getting wiped out.

00:49:53.952 --> 00:49:55.660
That's who companies
were getting rid of.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.370
And they were also finding it
impossible to find new jobs.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.270
There was this
generational thing.

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.720
And I remembered at
the time because I

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.400
was working in "Newsweek,"
and I remember reading it.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.869
And there was a sense of glee
inside there at "Newsweek."

00:50:08.869 --> 00:50:10.410
The people running
"Newsweek" thought

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.500
this was really kind of funny.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.820
And I remember
thinking, in a way,

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.900
well, maybe I'm immune to this.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.233
But then two years later, I
became a beached white male.

00:50:16.233 --> 00:50:19.760
There I am like 51 years old.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.770
The other meaning
of disrupted to me

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:27.480
was that I think there's a
generation of people who began

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.440
our careers still thinking
that the social contract

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.948
between employers
and employees was

00:50:31.948 --> 00:50:33.406
the one that our
parents had, where

00:50:33.406 --> 00:50:35.840
it's like my dad went to AT&amp;T
and worked his whole career,

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.300
retired with a pension.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.200
When I began my career, we
sort of had those expectations.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.310
And people coming out and
people coming into the workforce

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:46.080
now don't have
those expectations.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.580
They have bought into a
whole new view of work.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.038
But my generation
got caught in the

00:50:49.038 --> 00:50:51.110
middle with the
old expectations--

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.540
20th century expectation but
we're in the 21st century.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.685
So I think there's a
generational disruption

00:50:55.685 --> 00:50:57.810
happening too that's caused
by the internet, caused

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:01.799
by changes in-- well,
the internet has

00:51:01.799 --> 00:51:02.840
changed everything we do.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.840
So I think that has disrupted
industries all over the place

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.740
and caused a whole generation
of people to be sort of lost.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.935
And I'm part of that
lost generation.

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.310
AUDIENCE: So I
want to invite you

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.750
to talk about
venture capitalists

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:20.120
a little bit in the
remaining one minute.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.140
To get that started,
my sense is that a lot

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.880
of the people in venture capital
are guys in their 40s or 50s

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.460
who made it in high
tech and think that they

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.710
did that for a reason.

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:34.020
But do you think it's
a functional thing

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.950
that we had these venture
capitalists backing

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:36.420
all these startups?

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.760
Do you think it's dysfunctional?

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.384
Do you think it's
[INAUDIBLE] problems?

00:51:39.384 --> 00:51:41.950
Helping things?

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:45.060
DAN LYONS: I think there's
a bubble in venture capital.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.339
I don't have numbers.

00:51:46.339 --> 00:51:48.130
I should have looked
these up for the book,

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:49.140
and I should have included this.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.540
It would be good data to have.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.873
Just the number of people who
consider themselves either

00:51:52.873 --> 00:51:55.420
venture capitalists
or angel investors now

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:57.990
compared to 10 years ago,
but I guess the number

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.407
is way, way bigger today.

00:52:00.407 --> 00:52:02.740
There's just a lot of people
who now consider themselves

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.220
investors.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.790
What I do touch
on in the book is

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:11.140
that there was this change
that came in the last 2012,

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.640
I think, in the
JOBS Act, where they

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.700
made it easier for
mom and pop investors

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.620
to get into syndicates
and invest in startups.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.250
So you had an even
bigger influx of money.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.249
The government loosened up rules
so that more regular people

00:52:22.249 --> 00:52:22.790
could invest.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:25.800
So I do think there are
a lot of people playing

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.020
at being venture capitalists.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.890
And I'm not sure if that's
necessarily a good thing.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.440
There was a time when venture
capital was a scarce thing,

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.990
and the funds were fairly small.

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:35.910
And companies were going
into beg for money.

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:38.120
And now you have a situation
where there's so much money

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.710
that the venture
capitalists are competing

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:40.590
to get into the deals.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.798
They're going and begging
at the entrepreneur's door.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.850
That doesn't sound like a
recipe for good things, right?

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:50.090
If you have more money
chasing a few deals,

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.550
that's bound to
drive up valuations.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:55.384
Suddenly the number of
unicorns went from eight to 145

00:52:55.384 --> 00:52:56.300
in a matter of months.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.800
And it's like they
can't really be that.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.700
It's got to just be
there's too much money.

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.780
But I think another
argument people would make,

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.800
and it's probably
sensible, is that that's

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:06.710
how progress is made.

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:09.049
You throw a lot, a lot
of money at something.

00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:11.090
And a lot of it goes flying
away and gets wasted.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:14.580
And then some of it sticks
and makes the next Googles.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.620
So I couldn't pretend
to be an expert on it,

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.840
but I do think there's a
lot more venture capital now

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.720
than there ever has been before.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.919
I'm not so sure
that's a good thing.

00:53:23.919 --> 00:53:25.210
Thank you very much for coming.

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:25.510
I appreciate it.

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:26.010
Thank you.

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.060
[APPLAUSE]
