♪♪

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:07.734
Narrator: THE EXACT ORIGINS
OF THE COTTON PLANT ARE UNKNOWN,

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:10.968
ALTHOUGH ARCHEOLOGISTS HAVE
UNEARTHED PIECES OF COTTON CLOTH

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:13.501
OVER 7,000 YEARS OLD.

00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:14.868
THROUGH THE CENTURIES,

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:17.968
COTTON FIBER WAS TRADITIONALLY
PROCESSED BY HAND

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:20.033
UNTIL THE EARLY 18th CENTURY,

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.100
WHEN THE FIRST AUTOMATED
PROCESSING MACHINE WAS INVENTED.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.767
BEFORE COTTON ARRIVES
AT THE TEXTILE MILL

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.434
TO BE SPUN INTO THREAD
AND WOVEN INTO FABRIC,

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:35.767
IT MAKES THE JOURNEY FROM FIELD
TO BALE.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.968
COTTON TAKES ABOUT FIVE MONTHS
TO GROW FROM A PLANTED SEED

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:40.868
TO A RIPE PLANT.

00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:43.601
THIS HARVESTING MACHINE,
CALLED A COTTON PICKER,

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.601
PLUCKS FLUFFY SEED COTTON
OUT OF THE PLANT'S BOLL,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:50.000
LEAVING A TRAIL OF BURRS
AND STICKS BEHIND.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.100
THE MACHINE EMPTIES
THE PLUCKED COTTON

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.868
INTO A TRACTOR-DRAWN BUGGY.

00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:57.000
THIS MACHINE BUILDS
THE SEED COTTON

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.067
INTO A HUMONGOUS RECTANGULAR
BLOCK CALLED A MODULE.

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:04.667
A TRUCK TRANSPORTS THE MODULE
TO THE PROCESSING PLANT,

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:07.300
KNOWN AS A COTTON GIN.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.234
ONCE THE COTTON ARRIVES
TO THE PROCESSING PLANT,

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:12.267
STICKS AND BURRS ARE REMOVED

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:16.834
AS WELL AS ANY LINGERING DEBRIS
AND SEEDS.

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:19.968
A TRUCK DUMPS THE MODULE
INTO A FEEDER,

00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:23.434
WHICH MOVES THE PACKED
SEED COTTON INTO A DISPENSER.

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:27.200
THE GROUND SEED COTTON FALLS
ONTO A CONVEYOR BELT,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.267
WHICH LEADS TO THE HOT BOX.

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:31.934
THE HOT BOX MIXES
THE SEED COTTON WITH HOT AIR,

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:34.634
WHICH ALLOWS THE MOISTURE
TO EVAPORATE,

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:38.734
MAKING THE SEED COTTON
EASIER TO CLEAN.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.934
A MACHINE CALLED THE WAD BUSTER

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.267
BREAKS UP THE CLUMPS
OF SEED COTTON

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:45.834
BY TOSSING IT AGAINST A SCREEN.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.400
LOOSE DEBRIS FALLS THROUGH
THE SCREEN OPENINGS

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.767
DOWN A NARROW CHUTE.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:52.601
THEN THE SEED COTTON MOVES
THROUGH A MACHINE

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:54.534
CALLED THE STEADY FLOW,

00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:58.400
WHICH DIVIDES IT EQUALLY
BETWEEN TWO PROCESSING LINES.

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:04.200
ON EACH LINE, THE SEED COTTON
ENTERS A BURR MACHINE,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.868
WHICH GRABS THE SEED COTTON
WITH A CIRCULAR SAW

00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:09.701
AND SWINGS IT
AGAINST METAL BARS.

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:13.300
THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE SHAKES OFF
THE HEAVIER DEBRIS.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.501
THE SEED COTTON EXITS
THE MACHINE

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:20.367
THROUGH ONE PIPE
AND THE DEBRIS THROUGH ANOTHER.

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:24.901
A LARGE AUGER TRANSFERS
THE DEBRIS TO A WASTE CHUTE

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:27.000
AND OUT OF THE PLANT.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:34.801
THE SEED COTTON IS READY FOR
THE FINAL STAGE OF PROCESSING.

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:40.601
A NETWORK OF PIPES
FEEDS A ROW OF MACHINES

00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:43.133
CALLED GIN STANDS.

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:46.767
THE GIN STAND SEPARATES THE SEED
FROM THE FLUFFY STUFF,

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.968
CALLED THE LINT.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:53.267
INSIDE EACH STAND
ARE 116 CIRCULAR SAWS,

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:57.901
WHICH ARE ARRANGED HORIZONTALLY,
EACH SEPARATED BY A STEEL RIB.

00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:01.801
THE SAW TEETH GRAB THE
SEED COTTON AND PULL THE LINT

00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:04.834
THROUGH THE NARROW GAP
BETWEEN SAW AND RIB.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:07.334
THE SEEDS ARE TOO LARGE
TO PASS THROUGH,

00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:11.601
SO IT SPINS IN FRONT OF THE RIB,
THEN DROPS INTO A CONVEYOR.

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:15.734
THE LINT GOES INTO A FLUE,
WHICH LEADS TO THE PACKING AREA.

00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:18.667
COTTON SEED IS SOLD
AS LIVESTOCK FEED,

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.334
PARTICULARLY FOR DAIRY COWS.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:27.133
IT CONTAINS 23% PROTEIN,
20% FAT, AND 25% FIBER.

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:30.801
COTTON SEED IS ALSO MILLED
INTO COTTON SEED OIL,

00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:33.000
A COOKING OIL
THAT'S A COMMON INGREDIENT

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.968
IN SALAD DRESSINGS
AND MAYONNAISE.

00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:41.901
THE COTTON LINT IS NOW READY
TO BE FORMED INTO BALES.

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:45.300
PIPES FEED THE LOOSE LINT
TO THE PRESS AREA.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.934
WHEN IT ARRIVES,
A PUSHER MOVES THE LINT

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:50.133
INTO A MACHINE
CALLED THE TRAMPER,

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:53.601
WHICH SHOVES IT DOWN
INTO A BALE-SHAPED BOX.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:59.634
ONCE THE BOX REACHES 500 POUNDS
OF COTTON LINT,

00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:02.501
A PRESS COMPACTS THE LINT...

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:09.234
...AND TIE-WRAPS THE BALE.

00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:25.834
NEXT, A CONVEYOR MOVES THE BALE
TO A BAGGING MACHINE

00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:29.801
AND PAST GRIPPERS, WHICH PULL
A SAMPLE FROM EACH SIDE.

00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:34.300
♪♪

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.567
WHILE THE BALE SLIDES
INTO A PROTECTIVE PLASTIC BAG,

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:42.334
THE GRIPPERS DEPOSIT THE SAMPLE
INTO A BIN.

00:04:42.334 --> 00:04:46.033
TECHNICIANS LABEL THE BALE
WITH AN I.D. NUMBER,

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:50.300
THEN OPEN THE BIN TO RETRIEVE
THE CORRESPONDING SAMPLE.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.667
THEN THE SAMPLE IS BAGGED

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:55.100
AND LABELED
WITH THE BALE I.D. NUMBER.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.534
THE FACTORY SUBMITS THE SAMPLE

00:04:56.534 --> 00:04:59.133
TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE,

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:02.200
WHERE IT'S ANALYZED
FOR FIBER LENGTH, CLEANLINESS,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.400
COLOR, AND OTHER CRITERIA.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.601
ONCE THE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE,

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:10.133
THE BALE IS GIVEN A GRADE
AND PROCESSED ACCORDINGLY.
