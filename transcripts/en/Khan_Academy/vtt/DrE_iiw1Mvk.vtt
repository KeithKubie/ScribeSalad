00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.233
- [Voiceover] Pause the
video and try to add

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:04.601
these two rational expressions.

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.343
Okay, I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:06.343 --> 00:00:09.082
Now we can work through this together.

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:10.777
So the first thing that you might have hit

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.101
when you tried to do it,

00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:14.493
is you realized that they
have different denominators

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:15.932
and it's hard to add fractions

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.766
when they have different denominators.

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.695
You need to rewrite them

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:21.017
so that you have a common denominator.

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:23.269
And the easiest way to
get a common denominator

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.336
is you can just multiply
the two denominators,

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:26.474
especially in case like this

00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:28.958
where they don't seem
to share any factors.

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.257
Both of these are about
as factor as you can get

00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:33.486
and they don't share anything in common.

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:36.667
And so let's set up a common denominator.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:39.222
So this is going to be equal to

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:42.682
it's going to be equal to something

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:44.261
let's see, it's going
to be equal to something

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:46.118
over our common denominator.

00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:47.574
Let's make it

00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:49.454
let's make it 2x,

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:50.987
I'm going to do this in another color.

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:54.903
So we're going to make it 2x-3

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:57.666
times 3x+1

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.961
times 3x+1

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.771
and then plus

00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:07.315
plus something else

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:10.240
over 2x-3

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.096
2x-3

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:14.872
times 3x+1.

00:01:14.872 --> 00:01:19.202
Times 3x+1.

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:21.287
And so to go from 2x,

00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:24.328
to go from just a 2x-3
here the denominator

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:27.416
to a (2x-3)(3x+1)

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.844
we multiply the denominator by 3x+1.

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:31.082
So if we do that to the denominator,

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:32.455
we don't want to change the value

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:33.593
of the rational expression.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.216
We'd also have to do
that to the numerator.

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:39.849
So the original numerator was 5x.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.683
I'll do that in blue color.

00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:45.119
So the original numerator was 5x

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.952
and now we're going to
multiply it by the 3x+1,

00:01:47.952 --> 00:01:50.831
so times 3x+1.

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:53.525
Notice I didn't change the
value of this expression.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:57.512
I multiplied it by 3x+1 over 3x+1,

00:01:57.512 --> 00:02:02.232
which is 1 as long as
3x+1 does not equal zero.

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:04.438
So let's do the same thing over here.

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:08.640
Over here I have a denominator of 3x+1,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.962
I multiplied it by 2x-3,

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:12.286
so I would take my numerator,

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:15.652
which is -4x²

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:19.321
and I would also multiply it by 2x-3.

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:22.270
2x-3.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.081
Let me put parentheses around this

00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:27.726
so it doesn't look like
I'm subtracting 4x².

00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:30.094
And so then I can rewrite
all of this business

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:33.042
as being equal to,

00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:35.118
well, in the numerator,

00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:38.647
in the numerator I'm
going to have 5x times 3x

00:02:38.647 --> 00:02:42.269
which is 15x²

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.215
5x times 1, which is + 5x,

00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:49.412
and then over here,

00:02:49.412 --> 00:02:51.107
let me do this in green,

00:02:51.107 --> 00:02:55.727
let's see, I could do -4x times 2x

00:02:55.727 --> 00:02:59.860
which would be -8x²

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.542
and then -4x times -3

00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:05.592
which is +12x².

00:03:05.592 --> 00:03:06.924
Did I do that right?

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:08.224
Negative...

00:03:08.224 --> 00:03:09.547
Oh, let me be very careful.

00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:12.984
- 4, my spider sense could tell
that I did something shady.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.934
In fact, if you want to pause
the video you could see,

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:17.395
try to figure out what
I just did that's wrong.

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:20.792
So -4x² times 2x

00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:23.722
is -8x to the third power.

00:03:23.722 --> 00:03:28.534
- 8x³

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:32.720
and then -4x² times -3 is 12x²

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.064
and then our entire denominator

00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:37.201
our entire denominator

00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:38.548
we have a common denominator now

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:40.777
so we were able to just add everything

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:43.426
is 2x-3

00:03:43.426 --> 00:03:46.064
2x-3

00:03:46.064 --> 00:03:49.004
times 3x+1

00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:51.871
times 3x+1

00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:54.123
and let's see, how can we simplify this?

00:03:54.123 --> 00:03:57.350
So this is all going to be equal to,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.022
let me draw,

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:01.762
make sure we recognize
it's a rational expression,

00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:05.291
and so let's see, we can look at, we can,

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.796
our highest degree term here is the -8x³

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:11.894
so it's -8

00:04:11.894 --> 00:04:15.404
- 8x³

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:18.688
and then we have a 15x²

00:04:18.688 --> 00:04:21.057
and we also have a 12x².

00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:23.143
We could add those two together

00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:26.853
to get a 27x²

00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:30.631
so we've already taken care of this,

00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:32.999
we've taken care, let me
do it in that green color,

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.901
so we've taken of this,

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:38.850
we've taken care of those two
and we're just left with a 5x,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.890
so + 5x

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.677
and then all of that is over

00:04:45.677 --> 00:04:50.677
2x-3 times 3x+1

00:04:51.984 --> 00:04:53.981
3x+1

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:55.630
and we are

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.161
and we are all done.

00:04:58.161 --> 00:05:00.065
It doesn't seem like there's any easy way

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:01.806
to simplify this further.

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:03.617
You could factor out an
x out of the numerator

00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:05.057
but that's not going to cancel out

00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:06.357
with anything in the denominator

00:05:06.357 --> 00:05:09.115
and it looks like we are all done.
