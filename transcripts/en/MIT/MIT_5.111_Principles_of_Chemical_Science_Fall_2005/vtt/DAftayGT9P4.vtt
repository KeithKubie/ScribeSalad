00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.744
Last time, we were talking
about the energies of the

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:18.558
various states in the
multi-electron atom.

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:21.906
Now, the question is,
experimentally,

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:25.441
how do we know what these
energies are?

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:30.000
How do we know these energy
levels exist?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.580
And the primary technique that
we have to know that is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.814
something called X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy.

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:43.049
And X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy uses the same

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:47.888
principle that we talked about
when we talked about photo

00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:52.641
emission or the photoelectric
effect really explained by

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.802
Einstein.
And, by the way,

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:59.296
I put on the website a very
comprehensible article on

00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:05.000
Einstein's contribution to the
photoelectric effect.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.606
This is something that just
came out in a journal just very

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:15.343
recently and I saw it.
And so I urge you to take a

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:21.336
look at it because it really is
very understandable and kind of

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:27.523
fills in some of the gaps that I
left in talking about the actual

00:01:27.523 --> 00:01:34.000
problems, some of the kind of
sociological effects or gaps.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.141
All right.
So same idea,

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:41.633
photoelectron spectroscopy and
that we come in with a photon

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:45.543
and that induced an electron to
be emitted.

00:01:45.543 --> 00:01:50.384
But unlike the photoelectron
spectroscopy on a solid,

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:54.666
where we essentially had just
one energy level,

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:59.972
in photoelectron spectroscopy
on atoms we're going to have

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:05.000
many energy levels,
as we've already seen.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.967
And the photon that we're going
to use, that photon is going to

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:14.535
have an energy so that in
principle it can pull out of the

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:17.500
atom the most strongly-bound
electron.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.185
And if we want that,
well, then that means that

00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:25.673
we're going to have to use a
pretty energetic photon and,

00:02:25.673 --> 00:02:30.000
that is, we're going to use an
X-ray photon.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.782
So it works in the following
way.

00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:36.086
Let's take this unsuspecting
neon atom.

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:39.304
We bring in a photon,
an X-ray photon.

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:42.869
[LAUGHTER] I'll turn it down a
little bit.

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.739
Not too much.
And that, of course,

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.956
one of those electrons can be
emitted.

00:02:48.956 --> 00:02:54.173
And one of the electrons that
can come off is this p electron

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:59.391
here so that the resulting ion
configuration of the neon atom

00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:04.000
is 1s 2 2s 2 2p 5..

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.757
But also, this photon can pluck
off this s electron so that the

00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:14.957
resulting ion configuration is
1s 2 2s 1 2p 6.

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:17.000
And, of course,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.385
that photon can come in and
pluck off an s electron so that

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:27.957
the resulting ion configuration
here is 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.570
So that one photon,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.041
in principle,
has enough energy to pull off

00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:38.099
even the most strongly bound
electron.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.975
And then what we do in this
technique is that we measure the

00:03:42.975 --> 00:03:47.272
kinetic energies of these
electrons that are emitted,

00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:51.239
and then we plot,
simply, the number of electrons

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.033
emitted at a particular energy.
We scan the kinetic energy.

00:03:56.033 --> 00:04:00.000
And a typical plot looks like
this.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.841
This is just the number of
electrons coming off with the

00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:09.242
particular kinetic energy.
And you see we see three

00:04:09.242 --> 00:04:13.995
different kinetic energies.
We see electrons coming off

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:17.779
with 383 eVs,
electrons coming off with 1205

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.036
and electrons coming off with
1232 eV.

00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:25.701
Well, of course it's going to
turn out here that those

00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:31.246
electrons that come off with the
lowest kinetic energy are those

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:36.000
electrons that were most
strongly bound.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.725
There are those electrons that
were in that 1s state.

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:42.161
Why?
Well, look at the energy level

00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.098
diagram here.
Here are those 1s electrons.

00:04:45.098 --> 00:04:49.540
Here is the incident energy of
the photon that we came in with.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.408
If these electrons are most
strongly bound then they're

00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:56.489
going to have the highest
ionization energy,

00:04:56.489 --> 00:05:00.000
the highest energy to pluck
them off.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.021
And, therefore,
in order to conserve energy,

00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:06.604
the incident energy,
the ionization energy plus that

00:05:06.604 --> 00:05:09.976
kinetic energy has to equal that
incident energy.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.716
And if this is the largest
energy, well,

00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:16.510
then those are the electrons
that are going to have the

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.531
lowest kinetic energy.
So those are those 1s

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:22.271
electrons.
That's how we identify those.

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:26.346
And then there are electrons
coming off at 1205 where those

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:30.000
are the electrons from the 2s
state.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.379
That's a little bit higher
energy.

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.057
And so if this is the energy of
the incident photon,

00:05:36.057 --> 00:05:39.086
it's a photon coming in as the
same energy.

00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:42.187
If that's the energy of the
incident photon,

00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:46.225
this is then the ionization
energy for those electrons in

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:49.110
that 2s state.
Well, that leftover energy

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.581
then, that's the kinetic energy.
And it is a little bit greater

00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:57.764
than it was for 1s because,
again, those electrons are less

00:05:57.764 --> 00:06:02.185
strongly bound.
And then finally we have this

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:03.768
feature here,
1232 eV.

00:06:03.768 --> 00:06:07.688
Those are the 2p electrons.
These electrons are least

00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:11.080
strongly bound.
So here is the incident energy

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.321
of the photon.
Here is the ionization energy

00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:16.884
of those electrons in the 2p
state.

00:06:16.884 --> 00:06:21.331
The resulting or the leftover
energy here is the energy that

00:06:21.331 --> 00:06:24.874
goes into the kinetic energy of
those electrons,

00:06:24.874 --> 00:06:30.000
and that is going to be the
largest kinetic energy --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.286
Because those electrons are
least strongly bound.

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:36.435
So in this neon atom,
we've got three different

00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:38.899
states with three different
energies.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:42.596
That is reflected in the fact
that we're going to have,

00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:46.361
in the photoelectron spectrum,
we're going to have three

00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:50.127
different kinetic energies for
the electrons coming off.

00:06:50.127 --> 00:06:53.550
So by looking at the
photoelectron spectrum you can

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.000
immediately tell how many energy
levels you've got.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.819
And, of course,
as the kinetic energy goes up,

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.893
well, that means that the
binding energy goes up,

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:10.816
the binding energy gets more
positive meaning the electrons

00:07:10.816 --> 00:07:15.061
are less strongly bound.
Or, another way to put it,

00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:20.323
as this kinetic energy goes up
this way the binding energy gets

00:07:20.323 --> 00:07:24.907
more negative this way.
The electrons are more strongly

00:07:24.907 --> 00:07:30.000
bound as that binding energy
gets more negative.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.085
But from this kind of
experiment here we can extract

00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:39.052
what these ionization energies
are and we can extract then what

00:07:39.052 --> 00:07:43.138
the binding energies are.
Because of conservation of

00:07:43.138 --> 00:07:47.784
energy, incident energy of the
photon equals the ionization

00:07:47.784 --> 00:07:52.110
energy plus the kinetic energy.
I can rearrange this to

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.837
calculate the ionization energy.
I did that for all of these

00:07:56.837 --> 00:08:01.769
three features.
Here is the incident energy of

00:08:01.769 --> 00:08:06.015
that X-ray photon.
Here is the measured kinetic

00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:09.430
energy.
The difference between the two

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.861
is the ionization energy.
I solve for that there.

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:19.307
And then that ionization energy
we know is minus the binding

00:08:19.307 --> 00:08:22.723
energy.
So if the ionization energy is

00:08:22.723 --> 00:08:28.353
21.6 eV, the binding energy here
for that 2p electron is minus

00:08:28.353 --> 00:08:31.492
21.6 eV, and for 2s,
minus 48.4 eV,

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:37.767
and 1s, minus 870.2 eV.
I want you to notice how much

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:43.206
more strongly bound that 1s
electron is than the electrons

00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:46.736
in the n equals 2 shell,
look at that.

00:08:46.736 --> 00:08:51.698
That 1s electron is bound by
870 eV binding energies,

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:55.610
minus 870.
Binding energy for the n equals

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.000
2 electrons is minus 48 and
minus 21.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.609
Why is that more strongly
bound?

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:06.482
Well, that electron is in the n
equals 1 shell,

00:09:06.482 --> 00:09:11.112
which is much closer to the
nucleus where the attractive

00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:15.658
interaction between that
positive charge on the nucleus

00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:18.352
and the electron is much
greater.

00:09:18.352 --> 00:09:21.214
So this is basically the
technique.

00:09:21.214 --> 00:09:25.170
This is how we calculate those
binding energies,

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.632
or observe those binding
energies for the electrons in

00:09:29.632 --> 00:09:35.818
the multi-electron atom.
What I want to do now is I want

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:41.090
to start on today's lecture.
And you don't have the lecture

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:46.272
notes for today's lecture.
And there is a reason for that.

00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:51.636
Oh, and I forgot to tell you to
do something very important.

00:09:51.636 --> 00:09:55.000
I'm going to start on today's
lecture.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.090
And through this lecture I am
going to be asking you some

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.985
questions.
And you're going to have the

00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:07.460
opportunity to answer,
but the way you're going to

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.787
have the opportunity to answer
is that you're going to have to

00:10:11.787 --> 00:10:15.758
make some paper airplanes.
I will ask a question and then

00:10:15.758 --> 00:10:19.163
I will say launch.
And what you have to do is you

00:10:19.163 --> 00:10:22.354
have to throw the paper airplane
to the board.

00:10:22.354 --> 00:10:26.397
And the first paper airplane
that hits the board from that

00:10:26.397 --> 00:10:29.446
section, well,
that section gets a chance to

00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:35.360
answer that question.
And we're going to keep score.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.847
And we've got some treats for
the winning section.

00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:47.456
The TAs have some scrap paper
and they're going to pass that

00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:51.152
out.
And so you can be making some

00:10:51.152 --> 00:10:55.631
paper airplanes.
Write the number of your

00:10:55.631 --> 00:11:03.024
section on the paper airplane.
Also, some of you are not

00:11:03.024 --> 00:11:08.225
strategically located to hit the
blackboard.

00:11:08.225 --> 00:11:14.153
If that is the case,
why don't you select somebody

00:11:14.153 --> 00:11:18.870
from your recitation to be the
launcher.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:26.129
They can come down as close as
these few stairs and aim at it

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:30.000
for your section.
Okay?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.063
Okay.
So I am going to start talking.

00:11:55.063 --> 00:12:00.255
We're going to talk about the
Periodic Table and the trends in

00:12:00.255 --> 00:12:04.000
the properties along the
Periodic Table.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.352
And, of course,
it's the electron

00:12:12.352 --> 00:12:16.911
configurations that allow us to
understand the structure of the

00:12:16.911 --> 00:12:20.220
Periodic Table.
But it is important to realize

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.558
that the Periodic Table was
first assembled by Mendeleev and

00:12:24.558 --> 00:12:27.647
other people,
not on the basis of knowledge

00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:32.058
of the electron configurations,
but on the basis of knowledge

00:12:32.058 --> 00:12:37.521
of the similar properties --
Similar chemical and physical

00:12:37.521 --> 00:12:41.260
properties of the elements.
So, for example,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.956
lithium, sodium,
potassium here,

00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:48.826
they were all grouped in one
column because they were all

00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:54.217
found to be very soft malleable
metals that were very reactive.

00:12:54.217 --> 00:12:58.043
Helium, neon,
argon, they were all grouped in

00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:02.478
one column because they were
found to be very inert,

00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:06.190
very unreactive.
And, of course,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.761
now we understand the electron
configurations,

00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.412
why these elements have the
similar properties.

00:13:13.412 --> 00:13:16.666
In the case of the alkali
metals, lithium,

00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:19.841
sodium, potassium,
we've got that extra s

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:24.603
electron, that unpaired electron
that makes those metals very

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:26.666
reactive.
And helium, neon,

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:31.349
argon, we've got an inner gas
shell configuration that makes

00:13:31.349 --> 00:13:38.070
those elements very unreactive.
But by the late 1800s and the

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:43.894
early 1900s, the similar
chemical properties of atoms in

00:13:43.894 --> 00:13:49.505
a column of a Periodic Table,
that really was strongly

00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:53.847
believed, strongly believed to
an extreme.

00:13:53.847 --> 00:13:58.717
So, for example,
it was known that human beings

00:13:58.717 --> 00:14:02.000
consumed sodium,
salt.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.174
It was known that human beings,
our bodies contained sodium

00:14:08.174 --> 00:14:14.030
ions and potassium ions.
Well, if our body has sodium in

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:19.992
it and potassium in it and we
consume those two elements,

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:23.292
why not a little bit of
lithium?

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:26.912
Okay.
About 1925 or so a soft drink

00:14:26.912 --> 00:14:32.054
came on the market.
And that soft drink,

00:14:32.054 --> 00:14:37.602
they wanted to have a lemony
flavor to that soft drink.

00:14:37.602 --> 00:14:41.506
And so, how do you get a lemony
flavor?

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:47.054
Well, you use citric acid.
But citric acid isn't really

00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:52.089
soluble in water so,
hey, we've got to make a salt

00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:56.095
of the citric acid.
For whatever reason,

00:14:56.095 --> 00:15:03.190
a lithium citrate was made.
A lithium salt of citric acid

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.259
was made.
And that soft drink was none

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:10.340
other than 7UP.
And, in fact,

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:16.830
if you look here it tells you
that the lithium was touted to

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:22.220
give healthful benefits,
including an abundance of

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.399
energy, enthusiasm,
a clear complexion,

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:33.000
lustrous eyes or lustrous hair
and lustrous eyes.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.594
Shinning eyes.
[LAUGHTER] And so this was on

00:15:36.594 --> 00:15:41.860
the market until the early 1950s
when finally the anti-psychotic

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:47.126
properties of lithium were being
discovered and the side effects

00:15:47.126 --> 00:15:49.801
of lithium were being
discovered.

00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:54.566
And the 7UP was then taken off
the market, or at least the

00:15:54.566 --> 00:16:00.000
lithium citrate in the 7UP was
removed from the market.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.530
And, of course,
it wasn't until the early 1970s

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:09.553
that lithium was approved as an
anti-psychotic drug,

00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:15.068
because it really is poisonous
to the human body in large

00:16:15.068 --> 00:16:18.810
amounts.
And so I really don't know how

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:24.030
many individuals had side
effects from drinking 7UP at

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.230
that time.
But the moral of the story is

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:32.923
that even though we're about to
talk about some of the general

00:16:32.923 --> 00:16:37.384
trends in the Periodic Table,
don't put any element in your

00:16:37.384 --> 00:16:42.153
mouth just because it's in the
same column as some element that

00:16:42.153 --> 00:16:45.769
you do put in your mouth.
[LAUGHTER] True story.

00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:48.615
All right.
One of the properties we're

00:16:48.615 --> 00:16:52.000
going to talk about is the
ionization energy.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.384
And we've talked about it
already, but we haven't formally

00:16:56.384 --> 00:17:00.000
defined it.
Let me do that here.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.571
Here you see boron with its
electronic structure,

00:17:04.571 --> 00:17:09.714
going to boron plus.
The energy change for this

00:17:09.714 --> 00:17:14.095
reaction is what we call the
ionization energy.

00:17:14.095 --> 00:17:17.523
It's the product minus the
reactants.

00:17:17.523 --> 00:17:21.523
That's the ionization energy.
Equivalently,

00:17:21.523 --> 00:17:27.142
that ionization energy is minus
the binding energy of the 2p

00:17:27.142 --> 00:17:32.238
electron in boron.
This is a process that is

00:17:32.238 --> 00:17:36.000
removing the least strongly
bound electron.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.298
When we remove the least
strongly bound electron,

00:17:40.298 --> 00:17:45.850
the energy that is required to
do that is called the ionization

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.910
energy.
And, more fully,

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.776
it's the first ionization
energy.

00:17:50.776 --> 00:17:55.611
It is the energy to remove the
electron from this HOAO,

00:17:55.611 --> 00:18:00.000
the highest occupied atomic
orbital.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.573
Or, the least strongly bound
electron.

00:18:03.573 --> 00:18:07.242
Same idea.
This is the highest occupied

00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:10.140
atomic orbital.
Now, generally,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:15.644
when we say ionization energy
we mean the first ionization

00:18:15.644 --> 00:18:18.928
energy.
We often leave out the word

00:18:18.928 --> 00:18:22.211
"first".
So whenever you look up an

00:18:22.211 --> 00:18:26.750
ionization energy,
implied in that is that it is

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:33.469
the first ionization energy --
The energy to remove the least

00:18:33.469 --> 00:18:37.832
strongly bound electron.
The second ionization energy,

00:18:37.832 --> 00:18:41.949
well, that is the energy
required to remove another

00:18:41.949 --> 00:18:45.159
electron.
But now we're removing it from

00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:49.276
boron plus to make boron
plus two.

00:18:49.276 --> 00:18:53.803
And, again, we're removing the
next least strongly bound

00:18:53.803 --> 00:18:56.849
electron.
That's the second ionization

00:18:56.849 --> 00:18:58.496
energy.
Equivalently,

00:18:58.496 --> 00:19:03.188
it is minus the binding energy
of the 2s electron in boron

00:19:03.188 --> 00:19:05.718
plus.
Not boron.

00:19:05.718 --> 00:19:08.807
And then there is a third
ionization energy.

00:19:08.807 --> 00:19:13.045
Again, now we're taking boron
plus two, pulling off the next

00:19:13.045 --> 00:19:17.571
least strongly bound electron to
make boron plus three.

00:19:17.571 --> 00:19:20.014
That's the third ionization
energy.

00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:22.816
And we can keep going.
Boron plus three.

00:19:22.816 --> 00:19:26.551
Pull out the next electron.
Boron plus four,

00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:30.000
that's the forth ionization
energy.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.112
And then the fifth ionization
energy, taking the last electron

00:19:34.112 --> 00:19:36.943
off of boron,
boron plus four to make boron

00:19:36.943 --> 00:19:40.044
plus five.
That's the fifth ionization

00:19:40.044 --> 00:19:42.404
energy.
So these are our definitions

00:19:42.404 --> 00:19:46.516
here of the ionization energy.
Now, I'm going to switch to the

00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:48.000
side screen.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.926
All right.
But now, here comes the first

00:20:09.926 --> 00:20:14.221
question.
I'm going to show you two

00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:19.778
reactions here.
The first reaction is a boron

00:20:19.778 --> 00:20:25.463
plus going to boron plus two.
We are removing,

00:20:25.463 --> 00:20:31.324
here, an s electron.
The second reaction here is

00:20:31.324 --> 00:20:35.886
boron going to boron plus.
Again, we are removing a 2s

00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:38.382
electron.
And the question is,

00:20:38.382 --> 00:20:42.083
are these two energies equal.
In both cases,

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:45.956
we're pulling off an s electron
a 2s electron.

00:20:45.956 --> 00:20:50.518
So that's the question.
Now, the way we do this is I'm

00:20:50.518 --> 00:20:55.081
going to move to the side,
I'm going to say launch and

00:20:55.081 --> 00:21:00.503
then Christine and I will try to
determine the first airplane to

00:21:00.503 --> 00:21:06.203
hit the board.
We will pick it up,

00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:14.465
and we will ask that recitation
section to answer.

00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:17.162
All right.
Ready?

00:21:17.162 --> 00:21:20.872
Launch.
Recitation one,

00:21:20.872 --> 00:21:26.267
are those energies equal?
Answer?

00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:32.000
It can be a group effort.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.649
Hey, you've got a fifty-percent
chance here.

00:21:47.649 --> 00:21:49.357
Yes or no?
No.

00:21:49.357 --> 00:21:53.430
They're right.
They get a point.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:58.160
Okay.
You've got to keep score on the

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.895
board.
All right.

00:22:00.895 --> 00:22:04.746
Now why aren't they equal?
Hey, big no here.

00:22:04.746 --> 00:22:08.328
They are not equal because,
in this case,

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:13.611
this is the ionization energy,
the second ionization energy,

00:22:13.611 --> 00:22:18.000
as we just defined it.
Boron plus going to

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.656
boron plus two,
that's a second ionization

00:22:22.656 --> 00:22:25.880
energy.
It's minus the binding energy

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.000
of the 2s electron in boron
plus.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.608
Here, this energy,
what this energy is is the

00:22:33.608 --> 00:22:37.298
ionization energy of the 2s
electron in boron,

00:22:37.298 --> 00:22:41.317
not boron plus.
This is equal to minus the

00:22:41.317 --> 00:22:44.761
binding energy of the 2s
electron in boron.

00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:49.108
This is minus the binding
energy of the 2s electron in

00:22:49.108 --> 00:22:51.486
boron plus.
They're not equal.

00:22:51.486 --> 00:22:54.931
The next question is,
which one is greater?

00:22:54.931 --> 00:22:59.277
And so, wait a minute.
I'm going to get out of the way

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:02.153
here.
Okay.

00:23:02.153 --> 00:23:04.000
Launch.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.371
Recitation nine.
Over there, sorry.

00:23:16.371 --> 00:23:21.900
Which one is greater,
top one or bottom one?

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.857
Top one.
They are right.

00:23:24.857 --> 00:23:30.000
Hey, recitation nine gets a
point.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.976
You can put the score on the
board.

00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:35.514
Great.
The top one is greater.

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:40.854
The top one is greater because
the effective charge of this 2s

00:23:40.854 --> 00:23:46.456
electron in boron plus is larger
than the effective charge of the

00:23:46.456 --> 00:23:50.920
2s electron in boron.
The reason for that is because

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.159
in boron plus we have fewer
electrons.

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:59.673
We've got less shielding of the
nucleus by the electrons because

00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:04.553
we have fewer electrons.
So that's great.

00:24:04.553 --> 00:24:09.798
But this is really very
important for you to understand

00:24:09.798 --> 00:24:12.906
here.
This will be on the lecture

00:24:12.906 --> 00:24:18.053
notes that I will give to you at
the end of the class.

00:24:18.053 --> 00:24:23.492
Because we might run out of
paper, you might want to save

00:24:23.492 --> 00:24:26.989
those.
Now we're going to look at the

00:24:26.989 --> 00:24:30.000
Periodic Table here.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.216
And I'm going to ask this
following question here.

00:24:41.216 --> 00:24:47.391
As we go across the Periodic
Table, what we want to know is

00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:51.330
how does the ionization energy
change.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:57.186
So here is my Periodic Table.
I'm going across this way.

00:24:57.186 --> 00:25:04.000
Does the ionization energy
increase or does it decrease?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.107
Now, here is another chance for
you to answer this for your

00:25:12.107 --> 00:25:15.741
recitation section.
Launch.

00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:21.892
Wads don't count.
[LAUGHTER] Paper airplanes.

00:25:21.892 --> 00:25:24.827
Eight.
Where is eight?

00:25:24.827 --> 00:25:30.000
Back there.
Hey, okay, eight.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.457
What happens to the ionization
energy as you go across the

00:25:36.457 --> 00:25:38.722
Periodic Table?
What?

00:25:38.722 --> 00:25:42.687
Increase.
Is that your final answer?

00:25:42.687 --> 00:25:45.292
You're right.
All right.

00:25:45.292 --> 00:25:48.804
The ionization energy
increases.

00:25:48.804 --> 00:25:53.335
Why does that ionization energy
increase?

00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:59.000
Here is our example.
Here is our plot.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.827
Ionization energy versus Z as
you go across.

00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:07.011
Here is from hydrogen to
helium, that's one row,

00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:10.483
it goes up.
Here's from lithium to neon,

00:26:10.483 --> 00:26:12.531
another row,
it goes up.

00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:17.516
Well, the ionization energy
increases because the nuclear

00:26:17.516 --> 00:26:21.611
charge increases.
As you go across the Periodic

00:26:21.611 --> 00:26:24.727
Table, the nuclear charge
increases.

00:26:24.727 --> 00:26:29.000
The Coulomb interaction
increases.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.960
But there is another part to
the Coulomb interaction.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.778
And, of course,
that other part is the

00:26:35.778 --> 00:26:38.292
distance.
But as you go across the

00:26:38.292 --> 00:26:41.643
Periodic Table,
you're putting electrons into

00:26:41.643 --> 00:26:44.995
the same shell,
to the same principle quantum

00:26:44.995 --> 00:26:47.203
number shell.
And, in general,

00:26:47.203 --> 00:26:51.773
when you put electrons into the
same principle quantum number

00:26:51.773 --> 00:26:54.058
shell, you are,
on the average,

00:26:54.058 --> 00:26:57.029
the same distance away from the
nucleus.

00:26:57.029 --> 00:27:02.348
And so r is the same.
Z is increasing as you go

00:27:02.348 --> 00:27:04.696
across.
And so, therefore,

00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:09.581
that ionization energy
increases as you go across the

00:27:09.581 --> 00:27:12.212
Periodic Table.
Now, however,

00:27:12.212 --> 00:27:15.969
you can see that there are some
glitches.

00:27:15.969 --> 00:27:20.666
There is a glitch here between
beryllium and boron.

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:26.396
Boron is actually a little bit
lower in ionization energy that

00:27:26.396 --> 00:27:31.000
a beryllium.
Can we understand that?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.861
Well, we sure can in terms of
the electronic structure.

00:27:36.861 --> 00:27:42.289
So here is the electron
configuration of beryllium,

00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:46.631
Z equals 4.
And then here is the electron

00:27:46.631 --> 00:27:51.625
configuration of boron,
this is 1s, this is 2p,

00:27:51.625 --> 00:27:55.641
Z equals 5.
The bottom line is that it

00:27:55.641 --> 00:28:02.046
takes more energy to put the
next electron here into this 2p

00:28:02.046 --> 00:28:06.683
state.
And the bottom line is that the

00:28:06.683 --> 00:28:11.877
charge on the nucleus does not
increase sufficiently to fully

00:28:11.877 --> 00:28:16.985
compensate for the energy that
is necessary to put that next

00:28:16.985 --> 00:28:20.101
electron in that higher energy
state.

00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:25.468
So this just doesn't get large
enough fast enough to compensate

00:28:25.468 --> 00:28:30.662
just for the extra energy that
is needed to put that electron

00:28:30.662 --> 00:28:35.599
in the 2p state.
So we have a little glitch

00:28:35.599 --> 00:28:39.599
between beryllium and boron.
In addition,

00:28:39.599 --> 00:28:45.200
we've got a little glitch right
here between nitrogen and

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.000
oxygen.
The oxygen ionization energy is

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.799
not as large as you might expect
from the increase in the Z

00:28:54.799 --> 00:29:00.000
quantum number.
Again, here's the nitrogen.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.440
Z equals 7, the electron
configuration for nitrogen.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.000
Here it is for oxygen.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.752
And what we had to do for
oxygen is that we had to put

00:29:17.752 --> 00:29:21.716
another electron into a 2p
state, a 2p state that already

00:29:21.716 --> 00:29:25.256
had an electron in it.
And there is a great deal of

00:29:25.256 --> 00:29:30.000
repulsion here between these two
electrons in the same state.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.358
And, again, the Z here,
the nuclear charge did not

00:29:34.358 --> 00:29:39.785
increase large enough or greatly
enough to compensate for that

00:29:39.785 --> 00:29:45.033
electron-electron repulsion.
And so the ionization energy is

00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:49.214
just a little bit lower than it
is for nitrogen.

00:29:49.214 --> 00:29:53.128
That same trend,
of course, continues for the

00:29:53.128 --> 00:29:55.975
other rows in the Periodic
Table.

00:29:55.975 --> 00:30:01.769
Here is the third row.
And there is also a glitch

00:30:01.769 --> 00:30:07.841
between magnesium and aluminum.
Magnesium and aluminum are

00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:13.381
right below beryllium and boron.
And a glitch between

00:30:13.381 --> 00:30:18.814
phosphorous and sulfur,
they're right below nitrogen

00:30:18.814 --> 00:30:21.477
and oxygen.
Next question.

00:30:21.477 --> 00:30:26.910
As we go down the Periodic
Table what happens to the

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:32.029
ionization energy?
Wait a minute.

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:36.670
I'm getting out of the way.
Okay.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:37.974
Ready?
Go.

00:30:37.974 --> 00:30:44.500
Recitation one.
What happens to the ionization

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:50.299
energy as you go down the
Periodic Table?

00:30:50.299 --> 00:30:54.359
Decrease.
Yes, they're right.

00:30:54.359 --> 00:31:00.222
Why does it decrease?
It decreases.

00:31:00.222 --> 00:31:04.924
As you go down the Periodic
Table, Z is increasing,

00:31:04.924 --> 00:31:09.062
that is true,
but as you go down the Periodic

00:31:09.062 --> 00:31:13.482
Table you're putting electrons
into shells that,

00:31:13.482 --> 00:31:17.150
on the average,
are farther out from the

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:20.253
nucleus.
And so as you go down the

00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:24.768
Periodic Table it's that
distance dependence that

00:31:24.768 --> 00:31:31.559
dominates the ionization energy.
So across the Periodic Table

00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:35.763
ionization energy increases;
down it decreases,

00:31:35.763 --> 00:31:41.338
Across it's Z dependence that
dominates because r is constant.

00:31:41.338 --> 00:31:45.177
As you go down,
it is the r dependence that

00:31:45.177 --> 00:31:47.645
dominates.
That is changing.

00:31:47.645 --> 00:31:52.215
Even though Z is changing,
r changes faster than Z.

00:31:52.215 --> 00:31:55.322
Great.
Now let's talk about another

00:31:55.322 --> 00:31:58.978
property here.
And that other property is

00:31:58.978 --> 00:32:03.000
called the electron affinity.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.218
If I take a chlorine atom and I
add an electron to it to make Cl

00:32:16.218 --> 00:32:20.266
minus,
the energy change for that

00:32:20.266 --> 00:32:26.090
reaction is minus 349 kilojoules
per mole.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:31.716
That is, the chlorine ion is
more stable than the chlorine

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:36.136
atom.
This is a reaction that

00:32:36.136 --> 00:32:43.227
releases some energy.
Now, the question is there is a

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:47.727
quantity called electron
affinity.

00:32:47.727 --> 00:32:53.181
You need to define the electron
affinity.

00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:57.818
Are you ready to launch?
All right.

00:32:57.818 --> 00:33:00.757
Launch.
Four.

00:33:00.757 --> 00:33:05.606
Recitation four.
You're up there,

00:33:05.606 --> 00:33:10.606
right?
Can you define the electron

00:33:10.606 --> 00:33:16.212
affinity?
What's the electron affinity

00:33:16.212 --> 00:33:21.363
equal to?
I am going to write this.

00:33:21.363 --> 00:33:26.515
Electron affinity is equal to
what?

00:33:26.515 --> 00:33:30.000
Yes?
Answer?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.520
Yes, that's great.
But I want a mathematical

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.858
definition here.
EA equals?

00:33:44.858 --> 00:33:46.783
Negative IE?
No.

00:33:46.783 --> 00:33:51.148
All right.
You've got to do another

00:33:51.148 --> 00:33:52.817
launch.
Ready?

00:33:52.817 --> 00:33:55.000
Launch.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.682
Recitation one.
What is the electron affinity

00:34:07.682 --> 00:34:11.000
equal to?
Answer?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.292
Beep.
What it is?

00:34:23.292 --> 00:34:27.317
No.
Next launch.

00:34:27.317 --> 00:34:32.000
Ready?
Launch.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.077
What is it?
Nine.

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:45.311
What is the answer?
What is the electron affinity

00:34:45.311 --> 00:34:47.000
equal to?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Beep.
What?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.142
Yes.
Keep going.

00:35:02.142 --> 00:35:06.000
Not ionization energy.
Okay.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.714
The electron affinity here is
minus this energy,

00:35:12.714 --> 00:35:17.571
right?
If you add an electron to an

00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:25.428
atom there is an energy change.
The electron affinity is

00:35:25.428 --> 00:35:32.000
defined as minus that energy
change.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.299
Okay.
Great game.

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:41.483
We didn't get very far.
However, from these scores,

00:35:41.483 --> 00:35:45.938
recitation section one does
win.

00:35:45.938 --> 00:35:47.938
Okay.
I will see you on Monday.
