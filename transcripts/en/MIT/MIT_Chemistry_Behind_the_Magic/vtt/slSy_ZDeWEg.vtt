00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.540
JESSICA HARROP: Hi, I'm Jessica.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.914
And today I'm
going to be talking

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:16.280
about a chemical demonstration
I like to call the steaming gun.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.640
So you've probably seen
this before at the drugstore

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.930
or in your house.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.060
It's called hydrogen
peroxide and it's

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.280
the stuff you put on cuts.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.320
But it has many
other uses as well,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.930
from bleaching things
to powering rockets,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.760
depending on its concentration.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.110
The solution that you get at
the drugstore is usually 3%.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.080
So it's called hydrogen peroxide
and it's chemical formula

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.200
is H2O2.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.620
So the atoms are
arranged like this.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.840
It sort of looks like
water, but the extra oxygen

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.720
makes the molecule
more reactive.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.060
Now if you leave it
alone, it decomposes

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.340
into water and oxygen. The
equation looks like this.

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:08.130
I'm going to balance it.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.930
Now, normally, you
can't see this reaction

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.990
happening because at room
temperature, it's very slow.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.940
But there are many
ways to speed it up

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.120
like increasing the temperature
or adding a catalyst.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.210
In this demonstration
MIT's Dr. Dolhun

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.180
uses a catalyst to make
the reaction go thousands

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.070
of times faster than normal.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.300
Let's watch.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.810
JOHN DOLHUN: So we're going
to do this experiment here.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.330
And basically what we've got
is we've got four bottles.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.890
We're each going to do the
experiment in a bottle.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.450
We've got 15 mLs of
hydrogen peroxide here.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.460
And we're going to be
using a man-made catalyst.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.345
We're going to be using
manganese dioxide.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.975
And we're each going to
take a scoop of this.

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.199
And we're going to put it in.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.690
You can set it down on the tray.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.550
And just-- it's
starting to work.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.880
You won't have to
stand up to see this.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.480
You can start to see some
condensed water vapor forming

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.650
inside the flasks.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.060
Oxygen bundles are coming out.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.370
Now we're just going
to lightly hold that.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.870
Whew!

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.170
JESSICA HARROP: OK,
so what happened?

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.950
Dr. Dolhun had hydrogen
peroxide in the plastic bottle.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.990
Then he added a catalyst, some
manganese dioxide or MNO2,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.150
and got a plume of water vapor.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.450
So let's talk about
how a catalyst works.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.070
I'm going to draw
a potential energy

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.114
diagram for this reaction.

00:03:07.114 --> 00:03:20.690
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.260
So here's my potential
energy diagram.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.510
So I've got potential
energy on the y-axis

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.620
and the reaction coordinate,
or time, on the x-axis.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.020
The reactants are starting
at this amount of energy

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.680
and the products
have this amount.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.270
Here, EA, that's the
activation energy.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.450
It's the amount of energy you
need to add to the reactants

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.420
to make the reaction go.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.430
And delta H, that's the amount
of energy that's released

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.870
when the reaction happens.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.460
Now let's see what happens
when I add a catalyst.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.270
With a catalyst, my activation
energy is a lot lower.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.610
And even a small reduction
in activation energy

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.220
can make the reaction go
thousands of times faster

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.460
than it normally would.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.460
But notice that regardless
of whether or not you

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.640
have a catalyst, the delta H,
the amount of energy released

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.870
in the reaction, doesn't change.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.120
So the catalyst only
speeds up the reaction.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.450
It doesn't change the
amount of energy released.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.680
Now, take a look at this.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.750
JOHN DOLHUN: Notice the
size of the bottles.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.870
These are very
exothermic reactions.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.650
The bundles have
basically shrunk down

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.310
to a very, very
tiny size compared

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.474
to the control bundles.

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:34.890
JESSICA HARROP:
So as you can see,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.530
the catalyzed reaction
releases so much heat

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.190
that it actually melts the
bottles and makes them smaller.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.050
Also, the catalyst
itself remains

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.090
unchanged by the reaction.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.980
And designing
catalysts is actually

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.260
a key subfield of chemistry.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.780
MIT's Richard Schrock
won the Nobel Prize

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.590
working in this field.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.770
And remember how we
used H2O2 on our cuts?

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.160
Well, we have an enzyme
in our bodies called

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.790
catalase that does the same
thing as the manganese dioxide

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.530
that Dr. Dolhun used.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.680
That's why when you put
hydrogen peroxide on a cut

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.540
you see fizzing and bundles.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.790
The catalase in your
blood is breaking down

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.410
the hydrogen peroxide.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.560
And according to recent
studies, low levels of catalase

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.190
may play a role in the
graying process of human hair.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.160
If catalase levels are
low, it can't break down

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.800
all of the hydrogen
peroxide in the blood.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.950
And that extra H2O2
starts to bleach your hair

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.880
from the inside out.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.180
So to wrap up,
catalysts don't change

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.090
the products of the
reaction or how much

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.460
heat is released or absorbed.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.340
They only change the time
it takes for the reaction

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.045
to finish.

00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:42.670
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.086
All right, that's
it for me today.

00:05:44.086 --> 00:05:45.980
I'll see you next time.
