00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.189
About every two seconds, someone in the United
States needs blood.

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.100
That is a lot of blood to transfuse from donors
to patients.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.289
But how on Earth did we develop the procedure?

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.410
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.429
Now, the faults and failures of early transfusions
have significantly helped shape how blood

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.180
transfusion procedures work today.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.100
Long before anyone really understood blood,
scientists knew that blood was a life force

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.580
flowing through us all.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.260
To harness the power of blood and infuse it
into another person, usually someone sick

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.510
or dying, patients would usually drink the
blood which of course had no effect.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.430
The idea of a blood transfusion didn’t actually
occur until William Harvey’s 1628 discovery

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.370
that blood circulates through the body in
one direction.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.450
It was then, that scholars and doctors realized
that transfusions were a possible method of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.739
rejuvenating the sick

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.199
By the end of the 17th century, physicians
were using quills as needles and silver pipes

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.440
to transfer blood from a donor to a recipient,
but the donor was usually an animal.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.070
But what no one knew at the time was animal
blood cells are incompatible with human blood.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.290
It wasn’t until obstetrician James Blundell
started using human blood to replace blood

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.380
lost in childbirth in the early 1800s, that
transfusions started working, at least some

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.600
of the time.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.360
Physician Karl Landsteiner set out to figure
out why some blood transfusion patients lived

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.890
and others died, a line of inquiry that led
him to discover the ABO blood type groups

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.390
in 1901.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.700
It was Landsteiner’s groundbreaking work
that helped classify blood into one of four

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.880
categories: A, B, AB, and O.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.420
These are defined by the antigens and antibodies
on the cells.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.200
People with type A blood, for example, have
the A antigen on the surface of their red

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.630
cells and their bodies won’t produce the
anti-A antibodies.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.590
So if any type A blood is introduced into
that person’s body, it won’t recognize

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.759
the new cells as foreign and won’t attack
them.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.810
But if type B blood is injected into a type
A blood person, the anti-B antibodies on the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.140
donated blood will be seen as foreign.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.910
The host’s body will reject the transfusion.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.549
Another factor for rejection comes down to
a protein on the surface of red blood cells

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.920
called the Rhesus or Rh factor.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.250
Blood cells either possess the protein - meaning
that you are Rh positive or not, meaning you

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.250
are negative.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.750
These factors combine to make eight blood
types.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.570
Now all of this is important because your
blood type determines your compatibility with

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.570
a donor.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.740
The red blood cells of people with type O
blood have A or B antigens on their surface,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.600
making them a universal donor.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.970
People with type AB blood don't produce any
antibodies so they are universal recipients.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.140
But everyone else is only compatible with
their specific type.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.440
So knowing what we’ve learned over centuries
of trial and error, blood transfusions have

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440
become simpler.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.360
There’s no need for a living donor.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.830
Instead, donated red blood cells can be stored
for as long as 42 days, meaning a patient

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.300
in need is simply given an IV and a bag of
blood to replenish what they’re missing

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:57.230
or restore blood lost 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:17.920
in an accident.
