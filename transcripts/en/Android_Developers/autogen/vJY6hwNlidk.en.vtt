Android run it in a video of you and

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.050
Android run it in a video of you and
 

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.510
Android run it in a video of you and
then that way

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:15.520
then that way
 

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.940
then that way
how to get control of it there's the

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:17.950
how to get control of it there's the
 

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.170
how to get control of it there's the
media control is enough to do any

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:19.180
media control is enough to do any
 

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.940

get around this yes so how do I skip

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:31.810
get around this yes so how do I skip
 

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.840

this this seek to bar and stuff again so

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:42.280
this this seek to bar and stuff again so

when you create a video you can just

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:44.710
when you create a video you can just
 

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.800
when you create a video you can just
also set a media controller and then

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.810
also set a media controller and then
 

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.330
also set a media controller and then
providing you set that media controller

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:48.340
providing you set that media controller
 

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.580
providing you set that media controller
which again is just a class that it's

look yeah I don't think that's something

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:32.410
look yeah I don't think that's something
 

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.650
look yeah I don't think that's something
we couldn't necessarily do because like

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:34.660
we couldn't necessarily do because like
 

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.700

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:11.570
about why you try and do this if you're
 

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:12.850
about why you try and do this if you're
trying to implement calling yourself

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:12.860
trying to implement calling yourself
 

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.920
trying to implement calling yourself
like if you try and create a VoIP client

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:14.930
like if you try and create a VoIP client
 

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.280

or for something and then yes the valid

or for something and then yes the valid
 

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.330

use case but if you're trying to sort

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340
use case but if you're trying to sort
 

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.750

or whatever I'd worry about that because

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179
or whatever I'd worry about that because
 

00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:28.940
or whatever I'd worry about that because
I'm not sure what you need to do that

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:28.950
I'm not sure what you need to do that
 

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.310
I'm not sure what you need to do that
yeah I think it's a bit of a niche use

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320
yeah I think it's a bit of a niche use
 

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.169
yeah I think it's a bit of a niche use
