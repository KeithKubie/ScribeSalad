00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.010
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.720
And welcome, welcome to the
African Middle East reading room

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.410
and to our division.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.060
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of
the division and I'm delighted

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.060
to see you all her for what is
going to be; I know is going

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.280
to be a great, great program today.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.910
So, I'm going to say a few
things about our division.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
It is a division, which is
responsible for collections

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.240
from 78 different countries.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.470
We're responsible for collections
for the whole continent of Africa,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.530 position:56%
Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.790
The whole Middle East, which
includes the Arab world, Turkey,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.120
Iran and also the whole of
Central Asia and the caucuses.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.170
Now -- and the third section of the
division is the Hebraic section,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.100
and we collect worldwide
for the Hebraic section;

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.020
so that's quite a responsibility.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.170
We are 21 members of this division.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:45.090
And each of us has scholarly
publications, have written,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.860
have presented at conferences.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.190
Many have -- know several
languages and so the materials

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.480
that we collect are not simply
collected and held for safekeeping.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.660
We share them and we share
them with our readers,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.960
our patrons for their
research, for their work.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.640
We are public servants, so we serve
people, we serve those collections.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.000
We make them available and we
help people do their research

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.200
by not only collecting relevant
materials, but also indicating

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.170
to people where those
materials are to be found.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.800
We feel that this is
part of our work.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.930
We feel very responsible for
these materials and we want

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.790 position:56%
to share them in every possible way.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.400
So we have this place, the
exhibits, we have conferences,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.560
we have briefings, we work
with other institutions

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.400
to bring professors
and their students,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.370
state department brings visitors

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.210
from the various countries
for us, brief them.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.810
And then it is in a
way quid pro quo.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.330
We ask these wonderful researchers
who have used our collections,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.640
who are specialists, who are
experts to come and share

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.400
with us their expertise and their
knowledge of the various countries.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.610
And this is what those
talks are all about.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.520 position:56%
They're about bringing experts,
bringing patrons to our reading room

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.630
to share with us and the way
they've done the research,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.100
what they have done,
what they have written.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.180
And in a way we've all done,
we've all become better informed.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.590
When we come out of these lectures

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.720
and certainly today we have an
absolutely wonderful speaker

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.490
who was with us before.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:00.070
And she is a scholar and
also a government official.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.870
She is Dr. Heran-Sereke-Brhan,
originally from Ethiopia.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.540
She's here with her mother
as well, which is wonderful,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:15.420
so I want to welcome her mother
this morning and we are also happy

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.340
to have special events
representative with us today.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.540
She is here for the first time to
see how we organize our programs

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.710
and I want to welcome everyone

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.570
who has taken time off their
lunch period to be with us

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.090
and to hear what we are doing.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:50.410
To introduce this speaker we
have our own Fentahun Tiruneh

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.850
who is here.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.060
And some of you may know
and many of you don't know

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.050
that he has received the highest
order of the Ethiopian Crown

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.940
and we now have to bow to
Fentahun Tiruneh when we see him.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.440
He has a big medal and but it is,
it is an award that he received

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.840
for the work that he has done.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.900
He has been exceptional
in his devoted attention

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.840
to the Ethiopian collections.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.400
Not only has he brought
some wonderful speakers

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.850
as today's speaker but he
has expanded the collection.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.470
He has gone out of his way to bring
these materials to the attention

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.260
of readers and to collect,
and to collect materials.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.460
And so we have an exceptional
collection.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.050
So he's really, we should
be giving him a medal

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.400
for the work he has done.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.510
So Fentahun Tiruneh will be
introducing the speaker now.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.550
&gt;&gt; Fentahun Tiruneh: Good
afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.440
I think you have heard
enough about me.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.630
I don't have to repeat
and introduce myself.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:14.230
But today I'm happy to present Dr.
Heran Sereke-Brhan, Deputy Director

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.930 position:56%
of the Office of the African Affairs
in the Washington D.C. government.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.590
And she's familiar to I think
many of you because she was here

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.200
at this forum and she spoke
once before on Coffee, Culture

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.420
and Intellectual Property.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.170
But today she will be
speaking on Marriage, Politics

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.740
and Social History for 19th
and 20th century to Ethiopia.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.010
Before I proceed with the
program I would like to remind you

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.970
that this event is being
videotaped for future webcasting

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.030
on the Libraries webpage.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.610
By asking questions and making
comments you are consenting

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.120
that your voice may be recorded

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.610
and later broadcast
as part of the event.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.810
And the possible reproduction
and transmission of your remarks.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.990
Now I will introduce
Dr. Heran Sereke-Brhan.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.190
Der. Heran Sereke-Brhan has
been over two decades studying

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.170
and conducting research on
African histories and cultures.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.670
As an academic she has explored
social and political history

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.670
and the role of women in 19th
and 20th century Ethiopia as well

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.610
as topics in art history

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.760
and intellectual property
issues for Africa.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.660
Heran's passion for the arts
presented in her involvement

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.770
in notable exhibitions at the
University of Florida Harn Museum

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.640 position:56%
and the National Museum of the
African Art Smithsonian Institution.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.980
Her contributions to community life
include projects and publications

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.070
in literary and performance
arts, with commitment

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.750
to honor a generation of
Ethiopian artists and preserve

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.470
and transmit their works
for future generations.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.610
In her current role as
deputy director of the Office

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.540
of African Affairs Heran advocates
on behalf of the African community

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.570 position:56%
within the government structure by
addressing a wide range of staffing,

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.910
funding and policy issues that
affect the availability and quality

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.150
of services to the
African community.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:34.650
Heran holds a PhD and Master's
in African History with minors

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:40.450
in African Art History and African
American and Caribbean history.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.510
Please help me to welcome
Dr. Heran Sereke-Brhan.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Heran Sereke-Brhan: Good
afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.030
Give me one second to get settled.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.400
Thank you so much Ms. Mary-Jane
Deeb and Fentahun Tiruneh

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.020
for this repeat invitation
and for the warm

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.470
and gracious kind welcome that's
always extended to me here.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.740
And thank all of you for making
time in your very busy days

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.090
to make your way here to be
a part of this presentation.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.490
I must actually - because
I also need to know,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.380
I need to know the actual name,
title that Fentahun has gotten,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.190
Order of the Star of
Honor of Ethiopia.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.900
I think it translates
into [Inaudible],

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.330
so you can now officially call
him [Inaudible] Fentahun probably.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.630
Thank you so much.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:44.040
My topic for today is
Marriage and Politics in 19th

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.150
and 20th Century Ethiopia.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:52.300
Before I begin, I should say
as mirrors and cars usually say

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.630 position:56%
"Objects in the mirror appear closer
than actually their distance".

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.850
This material is extremely
dense material.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.040
And at one point or another your
eyes are going to glaze over

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.850
and your mind is going to go blank
and I won't take it personally

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.940
because this was my life for 10
years, and it's pretty dense stuff.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.880
But I'll try - what I'll try to
do is go into some details for -

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.930
to show or illustrate examples
and kind of move back out to kind

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.920
of talk about the larger
significance of things.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.820
The universality of the topic
of marriage as a political

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.940
and diplomatic instrument, a
symbolic show of solidarity

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.140
and socially accepted way to
cement relations across kingdoms

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.660
and countries is one that we can
attest to here, anywhere really

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:48.170
around the world at any
time of any time period.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.160
You may remember those of you who
have followed Pan African history

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.120
for example, the marriage
of Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.200 position:56%
to a woman named Helena Ritz Fathia.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.880
The woman was a close relative

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.680
of President Gamal
Abdel Nasser of Egypt.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.020
And they got married in 1958.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.000
And the time Ghanian kente cloth
weavers commemorated the occasion

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.670
by designing patterns such
as Fathia, Fata and Nkrumaha,

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.090
which means it is befitting to
have Fathia as in Nkrumah's wife

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.920
and Oba Kofu Muman, one
person does not rule a nation.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.600
They had three children
together and up

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.960
until recently they
maintained residents in Ghana.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.990
We may also think about Jomo
Kenyatta's marriages, the third

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.730
and fourth marriages were to
daughters of influential chiefs,

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.920
which helped him gain legitimacy
for leadership among the Kikuyu.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.470
In Europe of course,
European history is replete

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.830
with these examples between
11th and 20th century.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:54.110
European royalty from France,
Britain, Spain, Prussia, Denmark,

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.230
Russia and Germany inter-married
very, very extensively

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.470
and there are also examples in the
colonial setting here for example

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.850
that Spanish conquistadors
married Amerindian women

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.660
in the 16th Century, French
commercial entrepreneurs in Senegal

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.710
for example made a point of
marrying powerful trade women,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.460
known as sinaras to gain acceptance
and access to commercial networks.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.010
In the Ethiopian case my study
is limited to the Northern part

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.470
of the country because my sense of
it was I wanted to study marriage,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.520
but in connection to politics, not
just marriage as it was happening.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.110
But in connection to political
history and but it's fair to say

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.900
that a similar study could be
designed for south and west

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.320
of the country, in the area
of Wolayta, Naria and Keffiyeh

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.870 position:56%
where migration and marriage
relations are very important element

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.430
and consolidation from the
17 through the 19th century.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:57.600
By way of background
and introduction a lot

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.110
of my presentation today
draws from research I did

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.110
for my dissertation study.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.570
The dissertation was titled
"Building Bridges Drying Bad Blood.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.930
Elite Marriages, Politics
and Ethnicity in 19th

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.590
and 20th Century Ethiopia".

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.760
So, it came about because at a
very visceral level I grew up,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.750
as most Ethiopians,
grew up understanding

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.780
that Ethiopia was an interconnected
space, we were intermarried,

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.210
was all one big happy family.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.290
And as I got older and read
more and listened more,

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.020
I grew anxious I think at
some subconscious level

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.400
about the polarized way in
which discussions were happening

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.890
around state building and identity,
both in conventional scholarship

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.250
and in public discourse and of
course lately in social media.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.260
My advisor was Harold
Markus at Michigan State.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.360
And he was very worried
that I was going

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.070
to write what he called
a begot dissertation

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.310
in the style of the Old Testament.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.170
So and so, so and so
begot so and so.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.680
And tempting as though that was,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.280
which means I could have had
an Old Testament under my belt.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.760
But as it was the research
took shape and it crystalized

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.440
around three interwoven
threads or themes.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.650
Ethnicity, identity on the one
hand, movement of political power

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.530
and state building and
then gender and women.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.590
I drew the theoretical frame
and methodology from readings

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.600 position:56%
on ethnicity, theoretical
readings, gender and state building.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.470
I relied a lot on the
work of Anthropologists,

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:40.510
the anthropologist couple John and
Jean Comaroff who defined ethnicity

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.020
as a set of contextual relations
and therefore a more kind of fluid

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.000 position:56%
and complex product of human agency.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.410
To examine gender and
the place of women,

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.110
and this was extremely
difficult in the case of Ethiopia

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.540
because they don't show up
in written records much.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.140
So I had to read widely to
come to the questions even.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.060
And I considered writings
by scholars

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.310
who had explored the subject of
state building through kinship

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.830
or marriage relations in places
like the Kingdom of Dowmy

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.740
in Western West Central Africa.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.500
And the 19th century
Zulu and Boganda states.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.680
And from these readings I
eventually designed an inquiry

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.260 position:56%
that would combine
methodological and thematic concerns

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.420
and examine issues
of power, identity,

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.510
gender and state formation.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.850
By documenting and studying
Ethiopian elite inter-marriages

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.910
and family histories I set

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.000
out to map what I call a
social history of power.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.560
This meant focusing on elite family
histories and inter-relations

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.050
and also reading this against the
narrative of political history.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.360
So it wasn't just genealogical
trees and family histories,

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.740
but how that related to shifts of
power that I was interested in.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.760
My study evolves against
the backdrop of 19th

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.690
and 20th century Ethiopia, a period

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.900
of intense intermittent
power struggles, unification,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.540
territorial expansion
and later consolidation.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.950
Not surprisingly the pattern

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.740 position:56%
of elite inter-marriage followed the
movement of power from [Inaudible],

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.550
laterally including [Inaudible].

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:14.970
The marriages usually occurred as
part of other power negotiations.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:20.270
As a prelude of good will and
attempt to address past wrongs,

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.400
[Inaudible] is what it's called,
marriages to dry bad blood

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.800
between families, or as marking
measure of close relations

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.970
between regional nobility.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.340
Tenuous and fragile

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.230
as they sometimes were these
alliances provided a critical

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.290
continuum across geographical,
cultural,

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.150
linguistic and political divides.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.270
Studying Ethiopian elite
inter-marriage also presented a

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.330
novel opportunity to
explore the place of women.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.010
Although they're not visible in
public records as wives, daughters

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.560
and mothers of royalty, Ethiopian
women were social, cultural

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.330
and political actors
of some influence.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.300
By re-examining new and old
sources in this light I intended

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.410
to find a place or configure
a place of prominence

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.990
for the lives of elite women.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.260
And in the process takes steps
towards engendering Ethiopian

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.700
political and social history.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.570
Now there are previous works
that have been published

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.320
and that are fairly
good, they're out there.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:25.870
Works by [Inaudible] and the late
Richard Pankurst and Chris Prouty.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.510
They've considered the subject of
marriage and politics in some form.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.770
But I was proposing looking at
these family inter-relations

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.520
across different regions of
the country and over 100 years.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.710
So in terms of scale and complexity

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.580
and time period considered this was
going to prove super challenging.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:48.980
So the first question is what are
the sources that are out there

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.790
in terms of documenting
marriage relations?

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.330
These are some of the sources,
believe it or not this image

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.270
on the left is a family
tree and it's dense.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.570
It's full of names.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.260
All of these things are names in
between and it's huge and framed

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.760
in a friend of mine's living room.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:12.340
As you can imagine you can't find
full names of spouses, of husbands

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.340
and wives to even be able to
trace the family connections.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.580
Paternal and maternal sides
were not all documented.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.950
Biographical material
is really missing.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:29.240
So, I did ask and go after family
trees when they were available.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.040
I went through scrapbooks.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.390
I went through newspapers,
old newspapers.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:41.650 position:56%
The image that you see on the right
was called centric circles is a very

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:45.770
interesting book that was done by
[Inaudible] and it was published

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.240
in 1965 Ethiopian calendar.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.030
What those circles, those are
names that you see in the circles

00:18:54.030 --> 00:19:00.440
and what it does is it traces King
Silas Lacy Shoa's descendants.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.550
So it's a total of 2,442
people that are detailed here.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.000
The book is very well done.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.490
It's indexed in the back.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.670
It's alphabetized and so on,
so it's a really good resource

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.970
but this is only one family.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.920
We're talking about
one family in Shoa.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.620
I lucked out in a weird
way, there was a scrapbook

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.380
of wedding announcements at the
Institute of Ethiopian studies.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.910
I also went to great lengths
to walk through cemeteries

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.580
and read gravestones
to be able to date some

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.380
of the biographical information.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:43.080 position:56%
And then of course I did archival
research here and in London as well.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.470
Oral history was where a lot
of my information came from.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:52.930
I was able to do field work in
1995, but officially 97 and 98

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.670
with funding from the Social
Science Research Council.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.800
In my presentation
today I think I'll -

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.490
I'd like to discuss three
aspects of - that illustrate kind

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:09.270
of the complexity of the
social history of power.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.440
The first area is marriage and
politics in the 19th century

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.390
and this is important because
it's when empire is being formed.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.740
It's sort of the first kind of
wave of marriages that happens

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:27.650
at a central political kind
of way in a central way.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:32.510
I'll speak also about the
inclusion and extensions of power

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.980
that we'll see with one
particular family in [Inaudible]

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:41.200
and then I'll touch a little on
elite women and their predicament

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:48.040
and what their fate
was in these scenarios.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.640
So when we look at
the interconnections

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.010
at the imperial center,
one of the first things

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.550
and most obvious things
you'll see is

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.010
that the regional powers
start becoming interconnected

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.780
through marriage relations.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.800
Another thing that you'll
notice when you read it

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.330
against the political
history is that the shifts

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:09.620
in marriage patterns closely
mirror shifts in power.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.430
Marriages were not full proof.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.140
Sometimes they worked,
sometimes they didn't.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.090
And that left mostly
women, not always,

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.870
but mostly elite women
in certain predicament.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:28.200
As Ethiopian state moved toward
centralization the latter half

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.370
of the 19th century, the struggle

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.340
for ascendency dominated
the political stage vacated

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.260
by the suicide death of
Emperor Tewodros in 1868.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.920
And the decades that followed
internal relations were

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:45.120 position:56%
characterized by shifting
allegiances and opportune alliances.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.030
When [Inaudible] crowned
himself Emperor [Inaudible]

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:53.910
in 1868 he was faced with the same
difficulties of regional unrest

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.180
and religious disagreements
as Tewodros.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.950
Three contenders to
the throne emerged.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.120
Pictured here Adal Tessema,
later Negus Takla Haimanot

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.390
from the Central region
of Gojam in the middle.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.130
Kasa Mercha, later Emperor
Yohannes IV from Temben

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.550
in the North pictured on the right.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.870
And Menilek Haile Melekot who was
expanding North into [Inaudible]

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.740
from his base in Shoa
pictured on the left.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.140
Power changed hands three times
from the short lived reign

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.070
of Emperor Takla Giorgis
to Yohannes, then Menilek.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:31.570
Between 1868 and 1889 even
while political maneuverings

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.820
and conflict continued among these
and other figures less visible,

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.990
but equally strategic
negotiations took place in the form

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:44.140
of marriage arrangements
among the families.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.500
As we'll see this charted
out in the next slide,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.770
sometimes it's easier
to see it visually.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:53.290
But families of all three
contenders were intermarried

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.800
with Emperor Takla Giorgis family.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.380
Even before he became
Emperor, Takla Giorgis made use

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.900
of marriage alliances
to garner support.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.030
First with Gojjam and then
with surrounding regions.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:11.210 position:56%
In 1868 Menilek's cousin [Inaudible]
married [Inaudible] a relative

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.700
of Giorgis and this provided a
diplomatic front between Shoa

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.330
and Lasta and their
descendants continued

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.620
to occupy important positions
into the 20th century

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.340
in the families of Rascasa.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.930
So to give you a visual
idea of how this plays

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:33.590
out we see here the three
sort of regional powers

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.550
and Emperor Takla Giorgis family.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:41.670
Takla Giorgis appointed
Adal Ras in 1869,

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:46.360
bestowing him with the governorship
of Gojjam, Damut and ago mandir.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.870
He also gave him his sister
[Inaudible] in marriage.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.870
While Takla Giorgis gamble
with Adal that worked out,

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.430
appeared to be successful.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:24:00.280
He was soon faced with a more
serious threat from Casa,

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.450
Takla Giorgis marriage to
Casa's only sister Dinkinesh,

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.840
did not deter Casa's rebellion.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.570
After winning a decisive battle

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:13.990
in 1871 Casa was crowned Emperor
Yohannes IV the following year

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.370
and we'll say a little bit
more about this particular,

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.710
what happened in this
situation for [Inaudible].

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:24.220
These early marriage
arrangements tied together Lasta,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.920
Gojjam and briefly Tigre.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.920
Soon shifted directions
in the accordance

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.750
to changing politics The final
days of Lasta and revival ended

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.650
as Takla Giorgis was
displaced and Tigres, Shoa,

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.890
Gojjam assumed center stage in the
person of Yohnnaes Menilek Anata.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.440
And here is where the
politics is important.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.800
Yohannes authority was
immediately challenged

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.570
by some chieftains leaving
him initially vulnerable.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.670
Rasada eventually submitted
to Yohannes and was reinstated

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.910
as ruler of Gojjam and Darmut.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.990
He continued to be a loyal vessel

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.150
until the empower dynamic shifted
again with the reckoning presence

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.180
of Menilek Shoa who success

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.730
in [Inaudible] signaled a
potentially powerful rival

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.140
to the throne.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.940
Emperor Yohannes was preoccupied

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.180
with the impending Egyptian
menace immediately continued

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.100
to advance [Inaudible] the base
that he had founded in [Inaudible]

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.100
through [Inaudible]
en route to Ghana.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.570
The clergy intervened to
divert the confrontation

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.020
between Yohannes and Menilek.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.450 position:56%
In 1878 Menilek carried the
traditional Stone of Penitence asked

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.370
for forgiveness and swore his
allegiance to Emperor Yohannes.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.390
Emperor Yohannes effort to
maintain a balance of military

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.500
and political power between
Menilek and [Inaudible] interfered

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.440
with Menilek's thinly
veiled imperial design.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.120
The emperor increasingly favored
Adal, possibly drawing him

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.560
into the family with the
marriage of Yohannes's nephew

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.070 position:56%
to Adal's daughter in November 1879.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.110
Adal was appointed
[Inaudible] of Gojjam and Kafah

00:25:55.110 --> 00:26:00.650
in January 1880 bringing his
status to par with Menilek.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.660
Menilek continued to
challenge [Inaudible] authority

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.320
and territorial holdings
defeating him

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.220
at the Battle of Babu in May 1882.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.840
Angered by the unrest caused

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.380
by these rivalries Yohannes
summoned Menilek and [Inaudible]

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.570
to chide them for their actions

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.150
and redefined their
spheres of influence.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.860
He redistributed their land
holdings taking [Inaudible]

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.960
from Gojjam and Weloa from Shoa.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.060
Menilek was instructed to give
up all the arms he had secured

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.830
from the battle to [Inaudible] the
trusted general of the Emperor.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.230
Yohannes pardoned [Inaudible] and
returned all his confiscated arms.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.840
Both the military and political
terms this agreement dealt a severe

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.270
blow to Menilek.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.310
The administration of [Inaudible]
is divided into two and given

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.830
to [Inaudible] and to the
emperor's young son [Inaudible].

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.370
This is critical to
pay attention to.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.840
At this critical juncture
Yohannes proposed the marriage

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.380
of the same son [Inaudible]
to Menilek's daughter.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.230
Accounts agree that the
proposal may have been initiated

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.170
by Emperor Yohannes with
several factors in mind.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.190 position:56%
Such a marriage would soften the
slight of [Inaudible] made decisions

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.580
on Menilek's pride
indicating his respectability

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.850
as a partner in power.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.840
Secession may also
have been an issue.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.440 position:56%
Menilek did not have a male heir
and Yohannes may have wanted Menilek

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.790
to acknowledge his son
[Inaudible] as heir.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:36.210
Menilek's official chronicler
[Inaudible] writes that Menilek --

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.660
that Yohannes was displeased

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.980
with Menilek's actions
[Inaudible] implying

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.320
that such a connection would have
kept the King in close proximity,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.890
so to keep an eye on Menilek may
have been another speculation.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.320
Each speculation holds
some truth and point

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.850
to Menilek's growing importance

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:56.030
as the impending successor
to imperial authority.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:00.090
And the underlying significance
of the dynastic alliance.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.850
So this marriage takes place.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:07.470
Historians hint that the young
age of Zawditu to Araya Selassie

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.290
around six and 13 years old
respectively and the death

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.200
of Araya Selassie five years
later made their marriage an event

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.610
of symbolic union rather
than a practical one.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.090
Ras Araya Selassie is the one
sitting next to his father

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.290
to the right of his father.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.920 position:56%
Despite his youth Ras Araya Selassie
had been entrusted with the command

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.900
of [Inaudible] with
[Inaudible] as deputy in 1883.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.710
He was later transferred
to [Inaudible] in 1886

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.380
and he remained an
administrator even

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.570
at that young age,
there for two years.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.880
So it's obvious as Ras
Araya Selassie tells us

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.170
that when Menilek heard about
this proposal he responded

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.500
with some appreciation
and appropriate modesty.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.720
So he said to Yohannes "It's
only that the girl is to young

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.030
for marriage or this would
not have displeased me".

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.410
Yohannes was not deterred
reminding Menilek that the children

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.430
of kings had urgent destinies that
called for their participation,

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.480
even from the time that they were
babies held in leather slings

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.780
and carriers [Inaudible].

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.830
The wedding would proceed,
so Menilek returned

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.890
to [Inaudible] to prepare
for ceremony.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.230 position:56%
[Inaudible] now gives us a very kind

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.360
of juicy imaginative
account of what followed.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.710
The Heavens had conspired
to bless the union

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.400
by sending a streaking
star in the sky.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.880
A large canvassed area
was leveled and carpeted

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.380
with a section curtained
off for the throne.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.900
Attendants were trained
to wait on guests.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.050
Adorned and gifts of beautifully
fashioned and embroidered clothes,

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.660
the royal entourage
completed this stage set

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.290
for the ceremony to take place.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:49.490
And the ceremony took
place on 13 February 1883.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.280
Festivities commenced
with a full [Inaudible],

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.760
a royal feast for the armies, Rasa
Araya received gifts of clothes,

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.530
different armaments,
soldiers, tents and golds.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:04.700
Yohannes was unable to attend
the betrothal due to illness

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:11.030
but he granted [Inaudible] lands,
so he gave as a gift the lands

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.400
that she passed through on her trip

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.340
to her husband's family
in [Inaudible].

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.290
The next morning the
celebration continued until noon

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.060
when the bride prepared
to leave for her new home.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.050
There was a 12 gun salute
and the rumbling sound

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.940
of drums signaled the occasion as
[Inaudible] emerged accompanied

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.170
by beautiful attendants
adorned in gold and silver.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.260 position:56%
A basket covered with an intricately
embroidered skirt was carried

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.270
in front of the group
that followed singing

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.890
and showering blessings
upon the newlyweds.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:48.730
The significance here is that this
marriage actually allowed Menilek

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:53.150
to save face by recompensing
him for losing Wellyo,

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.310
this is also a very
significant point.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.160
This region, now that was taken
away from Manlike was going

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.570
to be governed by his
new son in law,

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.350
so it seemed a fair
kind of arrangement.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:08.470
It was not a minor afterthought
added to the agreement,

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.930
but an essential element
of the negotiations

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.820
in terms of understanding.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.950
Menilke's letter to Yohannes
detailed his sentiments

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:19.340
and it illustrates, really
strongly illustrates the political

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.070
implication of this union.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.810
So Menilek writes a letter to
Yohannes and he said "Soon again

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:30.160 position:56%
when you said "I have taken
[Inaudible], I said I would be sorry

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.400
if you were to give
it to [Inaudible].

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.270
While I would be pleased to
hand it to your majesty".

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.130
When later it was given
to rasa Ariyah his new son

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:42.400
in law I told myself that
it had gone into the family.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.530
As the saying goes, when the calf
milks the cow it only returns

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.040
to the stomach.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.340
[Inaudible].

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.120
And was therefore pleased.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.030
So in a roundabout way Menilek
is still kind of in the mix

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:03.480
of governing this area
through his son in law.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.150
The young couple's marriage
ended abruptly in 1888.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:13.250
Soon after the Emperor
returned from the [Inaudible].

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:17.810
[Inaudible] died suddenly from an
infliction with small pox in June.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.080
[Inaudible] stayed a few
more months then returned

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.270
to her father's court in Shoa.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.740
That same year Menilek

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.830
and [Inaudible] secretly
joined forces against Yohannes.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:30.750
The emperors sense of betrayal
at his two vessels was apparent

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.690
in the vengeance his
troops unleashed on Gojjam.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.280 position:56%
Yohannes was angered that his more
lenient policies towards [Inaudible]

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.250
had not guaranteed his loyalty.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.760
[Inaudible] would come

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.700
to [Inaudible] supporting
this revolt was forced

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.660
to submit to Yohannes.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.620
Meanwhile Menilek continued to push

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.820
into Yohannes's territory
involving Italians and appearing

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.050
to mobilize his army to defense
Shoa against the emperor.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.540
[Inaudible] in the meantime is
very traumatized by all this

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.730
and her reaction indicates
her understanding

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.140
of the volatile political
situation and the potential

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.130
that the marriage had
presented as a peace offering.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.340
In grief stricken words
she implored her father not

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.240
to confront the emperor and noted

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.540
that had her husband [Inaudible]
been alive there would have been

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.970
no altercation.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.770
And moved by her plea
Emperor Yohannes was said

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:24.870
to have cried afresh for his son.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.940
Also interesting to note is that
although she returned to Shoa

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.530
at the death of her
husband, [Inaudible] lands

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:37.180
and her many devotees there favored
recognition of Menilek as Emperor,

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.470
so these lands that are given
as gifts, it's another factor.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:44.250
Donald Crummy has done a
lot of work on land rights

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:48.110 position:56%
and women really feature into this
a lot so that's something I'd really

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.970
like to kind of revisit
in the future.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:57.720
We now move to the second section
of this presentation which looks

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.360
at how a family kind of
moves from a local setting

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.410
to closer to the imperial center.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:10.280
And I have here the
example of [Inaudible].

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.710 position:56%
And we'll see what this example both
how the supposedly local family,

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.210
or non-royal family
moves to the center.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:25.370
But also how marriage was used
to heighten the prominence

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:31.770
of one family and play down the
prominence of hereditary claims.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.700
Also we will see with this family,

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.650 position:56%
it's very interesting how continuity
happens with these marriages

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.830
and though this is
a story that happens

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.230
in the 19th century,
the beginning of it.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:47.190
It rolls over to the 1970's.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:55.850
The death of Gojjam [Inaudible] in
1902 marked the end of the reign

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:59.880
of one of the last hereditary
provincial kings of Ethiopia.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.890
Menilek divided the
Kingdom of Gojjam

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:06.120
into three administrative units
effectively consolidating control.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:11.480
Three men were appointed to
govern, [Inaudible] over Gojjam.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.890
Ras Mengesha whose
picture you see here

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.420
over [Inaudible] and
the [Inaudible].

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:22.150
Though permanently weakened as a
regional power Gojjam's importance

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.530
at the center is indicated
by the marriage pattern

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.840
of elite family histories, Ras
Mengesha Atikem's in particular.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.670
Ras Mengesha grew in prominent
during Menilek's reign.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.650
And his descendants entered
elite circles largely

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.870
through intermarriage and
without direct or prior claims

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:42.820
of blood links to the traditional
ruling council of Gojjam,

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.340
that of [Inaudible]
except by marriage.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.440
Ras Mengesha himself was
linked to three different women

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.880
in his lifetime and these
are serial marriages.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.710
They don't marry them
all at the same time,

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.400
that's important to say actually.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.410
And two were of Shoan background,

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.020
two of his wives and
one was from Weilu.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.930
His first marriage was
[Inaudible] a descendant of --

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.830
the Shoa King [Inaudible] and
his second was to [Inaudible].

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:13.280
The third marriage was to
[Inaudible] from Weilu.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.940
While these first marriages
are not particularly noticeable

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:24.510
for political intent.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.440
The children and the
descendants are the ones that kind

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:33.520
of widen the prominence and sort
of the status of the family.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.220
And though it's difficult to find
exact dates, a clear marriage

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:41.290
of pattern relations --
marriage relations emerges

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:44.510
from this particular family

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.180
to show Ras Mengesha's
growing political prominence.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.870
The early marriage, so
the first round he kind

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.540
of marries within Gojjam.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.140
The early marriages

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.830
of his granddaughter
[Inaudible] Mengesha was to that

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.090
of the traditional
ruling house of Gojjam.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.370
She ends up marrying
[Inaudible] later [Inaudible].

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:08.030
By the next generation the
marriage relations had moved

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:12.700
to Weilu and Shoa.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.000
[Inaudible] gave birth
to [Inaudible].

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.200
[Inaudible] went on to
marry Menilek's grandson

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.780
and heir [Inaudible].

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.170 position:56%
This meant that by the second
generation Ras Mengesha's family had

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.970
married into the imperial center
with family networks extending

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:33.220
to both Wello and Shoan
royal families.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.780
On the other hand Ras
Mengesha Atikem's son,

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.470
Ras [Inaudible] was married

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.920
to Emperor [Inaudible] niece
[Inaudible] thus bringing

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.440
into the story the Semen fold.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.280
Ras [Inaudible] second marriage was

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.580
to Emperor Menilek's grand-niece
[Inaudible] or later [Inaudible].

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.640
Ras Mengesha's two daughters
from his second union

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.620
with [Inaudible] extended
the networks further.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:09.380
One daughter [Inaudible]
married [Inaudible] the son

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.000
of Ras [Inaudible], her
father's colleague in [Inaudible]

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.050
and the Emperor's trusted general.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:19.670
Their daughter [Inaudible]
later [Inaudible] was the wife

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:23.220
of [Inaudible] the progressive
intellectual, close confidante

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.840
and cousin of Emperor [Inaudible].

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:31.310
Another daughter and I managed
-- I did see a photograph of her,

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:36.830
she was young and shy looking
[Inaudible] married General

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.470 position:56%
[Inaudible] and had three daughters,

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:44.600
one of whom married the
Crowned Prince [Inaudible].

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.240
Are you glazed over or not yet?

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.680
This is going to get thicker.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.710
[Inaudible] the daughter from
Ras Mengesha's third marriage

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.680
to [Inaudible] was the first wife
of [Inaudible], Prime Minister

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:11.410 position:56%
from 1943 to 57 and highly
recorded courtier [Inaudible] court.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.270
These marriages expanded
to create links

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.640
between Gojjam, Semen,
Wallu and Shoa.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.780
Demonstrating that lateral
connections were equally important

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.400
in preserving social
and political standing.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.820 position:56%
And that marriage networks expanded
in relation to political prominence.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.270
So the significance is
that two descendants

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:40.840
from Ras Mengesa's family
designated heirs to the throne.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.690
[Inaudible] marriage to [Inaudible]

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:46.620
and you see pictured here
[Inaudible] who is married

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.330
to Crowned Prince [Inaudible].

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.490
If Ras Mengesha was once
Menilek's beloved general

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.090
and alternative choice to
gaining control in Gojjam,

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.850
by the third generation
his son in law,

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:03.000 position:56%
his son in law's brother [Inaudible]
had married Emperor [Inaudible]

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.300
daughter [Inaudible]

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.770
and Ras Mengesha's granddaughter
[Inaudible] was positioned

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:10.790
at the side of Crowned
Prince [Inaudible],

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.320
the last heir of the
Ethiopian Monarchy.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:21.360
And I should say what I learned
doing social history and reading it

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.950
against political history is
that there's a certain telling

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:30.330
of politics and political
history that kind of ends

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:33.190
and the social history piece
still continues, the marriage

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.140
and the inter-connections
still continues.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:40.070
So when you read the political
history you understand

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.740 position:56%
in the 20th century the ruling house

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.780
of Gojjam had turbulent
relationships

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.790
with the imperial court.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.260
And conventional scholarship
says you know the house

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:52.030
of Gojjam was distanced
from the imperial court,

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.240
and this is of course true.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.760
But you know [Inaudible] family

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.720
but Ras Mengesha's family history
indicates how alternative power

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.470
relationships were
created and cultivated

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:06.820 position:56%
and sustained through intermarriage.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.800
And the ruling house of Gojjam was
absent, but Gojjam itself continued

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.980
to be represented at
the imperial courts.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:19.630
And women had a big part to
play in these continuities.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:25.480
So I'll transition
over to women now.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.640
Again you know writing about
women was extremely difficult

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.680
because they are pretty much
invisible in the written literature

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.000
or they pop up in a way that
there's no context to understand

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.950
who are these women, are
they important women,

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:41.080
which families do they belong to,
what is their source of power?

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.340
Obviously they're not
in - they're seldom

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.670
in official positions of power.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.160
So, there's a lot of sort of
implicit power that they exercise,

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.920
influence that they
exercise in the courts.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.650
We'll also look at one predicament
of a royal women in these marriages

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:04.610
and of course one has to talk about
Empress Taytu who had immense skill

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:07.970
and vision in running
politics through intermarriage,

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.940
so she would be important
to say a little bit about.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:16.790
So we talked about the sort of the
power struggle that was happening

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:23.240
in the latter half of the 19th
century, and one of the women

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.200
in the story gets caught
in the cross fire.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.530 position:56%
And it wasn't always women, one has
to say that because there were times

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:38.440
that men are also kind of
caught unaware or made victims

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.780
of these marriage arrangements,
it happened to men too.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:48.590
So in the 19th century, in
this example that we looked at,

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:54.880
Emperor [Inaudible] was facing
threats from Casa and from Menilek.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.220
Takla Giorgis marriage to Casa's
sister [Inaudible] did not deter

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.200
Casa's rebellion.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.310
So Casa went ahead
and went into battle

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:08.050
and was crowned Emperor
Yohannes in 1872.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:13.280
So what had happened to [Inaudible]
is that her brother was pitted

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.740
against her husband and
she was still married

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.640
to the future Emperor Yohannes IV.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:27.780
So to kind of bemoan her
situation [Inaudible] was set

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:33.950
to have lamented [Inaudible]
the winner my brother,

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:36.460
my husband is the victim.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:42.010 position:56%
My grief is incomprehensible, all
contained in my house and my family.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.880
So there were certain
cross fires that many

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.560
of the women found themselves.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:54.230
But when we move along to
Empress Taytu time we also begin

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:58.040 position:56%
to understand that the movement of
women in marriage alliances was part

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.340
of a social strategy,
it was not a mistake.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:06.460
It was not happenstance or
kind of happening arbitrarily.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.440
Empress Taytu was an adult
woman when she married Menilek

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.920
who was her fifth husband and
he had married a few women,

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.050
most notably [Inaudible]
before her as well.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:21.010
She had no children but she
married off nieces and cousins

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:24.360
and extended relatives or
become Godmother to those

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.190 position:56%
that she wasn't related to by blood.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:31.480
And the end result of this
was a very formidable network

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.310
of power base that she built.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:41.570
With very, very careful savvy
as to the political balance.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:46.320
Commenting on her success Governor
[Inaudible] attempted to sum

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.900
up this group of [Inaudible]
power in 1900.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:55.680
And he says "[Inaudible], her
brother, controlled to [Inaudible],

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.270
[Inaudible] her nephew
governed [Inaudible].

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:02.930
[Inaudible], her nephew ruled
Kafa and [Inaudible] was presumed

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:06.450 position:56%
to have fallen into her orbit by his
marriage to her niece [Inaudible]".

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:12.780
Early 1908 Menilek's health
showed signs of deterioration.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.930
The year before the
Emperor had taken measures

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:19.140
to safeguard the empire beyond
his death by forming a cabinet.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:24.620
A crowned council of great chiefs
and ministers who also was created

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:28.530
and [Inaudible] was
appointed advisor guardian

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.520
of the young [Inaudible]
Menilek's grandson

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.920
and proclaimed heir to the throne.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.430
Though considerably weakened
physically Menilek's presence

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.370
afforded [Inaudible] the protection
she needed to concentrate power

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:43.070
into her own hands, which
she did with the support

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.120
of well-placed relatives.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.320
And here I rely on the
work of [Inaudible]

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:54.980
who did some really good article
titled "Political Marriage Pattern

00:45:54.980 --> 00:46:00.620
in Ethiopia 1890's to 1916"
and he kind of created columns

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.760
that showed the chronological
power shifts

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.310
and their corresponding
marriage patterns.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:14.010
So Empress Taytu period begins
around 1890 to 1909 [Inaudible]

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:16.200
after that and then [Inaudible].

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.150
And so we see here for example,
[Inaudible] three nieces,

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:28.250
[Inaudible] who were married to Ras
Mengesha Yohannes, Ras [Inaudible]

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:32.230
and [Inaudible] respectively.

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:34.720
[Inaudible] planned on
the neutrality of such men

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.980
as [Inaudible] who was married
to her niece [Inaudible]

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.840
and [Inaudible] whose stand

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:45.010
against the emperor may have
been tempered initially due

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:49.000
to his marriage of [Inaudible],
[Inaudible] Goddaughter.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.270
So when she wasn't blood related,
[Inaudible] would become Godmother

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:57.650
to a lot of these important women.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.980
[Inaudible] cousin [Inaudible] ends

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:07.530
up in this period being
married four times.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:11.860
And your first instinct
- well let me finish.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.820
She was married [Inaudible],
later [Inaudible].

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:22.970 position:56%
And no doubt [Inaudible] hand was in
many of these marriage arrangements.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:29.540 position:56%
So my first instinct when I saw this
was you know this woman is getting

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.890
married four times in a
period of a very short time.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:36.120
So what's going on, is she just
being thrown about in the system

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:40.090
or is she doing this willingly
or what is it you know?

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.300
So your first instinct is to think
they're pawns, they are pawns

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.580
in this political game and
they don't have any say.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:52.290
But as I did my oral history
and interviews and talked

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.530
to the women more,
I began to realize

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:57.680
that if not the woman that's
actually getting married,

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.120
then a woman in the
family up higher,

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.410
an older family exactly knew
what the political situation was,

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:08.400
why the families were
being intermarried.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.790
Women were in the know and
actually part of the negotiation.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:17.100
And in this case also - it also in
a way, in a strange way also points

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.780
to the value of the
women, their birthright

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.630
and their family connections.

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:23.560
They were in demand pretty much.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:33.210
And so this woman got married
four times in a very short period.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:37.240
[Inaudible] started strong
opposition particularly among

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.550
Menilek's officials and followers
whose privileged positions

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:43.020
were threatened.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.320
[Inaudible] hoped

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.150
to have [Inaudible]
Menilek's daughter instead

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.780
of [Inaudible] ascend the throne.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.660
Here's [Inaudible] with
his father [Inaudible].

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:55.730
But she prepared for
both possibilities.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:01.110
[Inaudible] whom you see seated on
the ground the emperor's grandson

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.960
and desired heir was the son

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:07.100
of Menilek's daughter
[Inaudible] and [Inaudible].

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:11.270
Menilek's early rival
turned ally in Wallo.

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:14.250
Menilek's chronicler records
that upon the occasion

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:16.920
of [Inaudible] he was
still Ras at the time,

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.040
proposal around 1884
Ethiopian calendar.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.940
The emperor was said to have
commented that [Inaudible] was

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:26.000
like a son to him and he could
not marry his two children

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.320
to each other.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.040
[Inaudible] response to
this is very interesting.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.560
She says Menilek's
metaphoric ancestors

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.810
in Israel would intermarry cousins

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:39.820 position:56%
and that this marriage would only be
a case of adding water to increase

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.910
and whiten the milk and so
that decided the matter.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:50.230
In 1908 [Inaudible] saw another
important marriage alliance

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.900
between [Inaudible] and
[Inaudible] that was designed

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.230
to solve several problems.

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:58.330
The bride's ancestry as
granddaughter of Emperor Yohannes

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.770
and the daughter of [Inaudible]
niece [Inaudible] served

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.230
as a good pretext to
secure [Inaudible] presence

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:06.580
at the imperial court.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.760
Also whether or not [Inaudible]
inherited the throne [Inaudible]

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.930
princess would continue to
control political outcomes

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:15.900
through this equally
sound family network.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.840
In addition, Menilek's
loyalists would remain appeased

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.600
as [Inaudible] would prevail as
the emperor's intended successor.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.750 position:56%
Both [Inaudible] were under 10 years
old and it's also important to note

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:33.700
that these were not - these
marriages were not made conjugal.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.790
They didn't have - they
weren't married in the sense

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:41.930
that they were adult people and
were having sexual relations

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:43.230
or anything like this.

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:47.820
It was almost a betrothal and
an agreement at this young age

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:54.000
that they would - when they reach
adulthood be married to each other.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.700
[Inaudible] were under 10
years old but the political

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:01.200
and symbolic implication of
their union far surpassed

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.530
its practicality.

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:10.000 position:56%
The second possibility offered
Empress Taytu equally sound channels

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.100
of political control.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.360
Menilek's daughter [Inaudible],
the widowed bride of [Inaudible],

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.530
you'll remember her from
before, [Inaudible] Yohannes,

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:22.810
was at this time married to
[Inaudible] nephew [Inaudible].

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.890
He would act as regent of
the throne and administrator

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.040
of the government the
way she calculated it

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:35.370
and Empress Taytu would
have full access to power.

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:39.340
As we know history had another
ending plan for Empress Taytu,

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.810
she was Eventually removed from
government in 1910 and exiled

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:48.740
from the palace after Emperor
Menilek's death in 1913

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:53.540
until her own death five
years later in 1918.

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.680
So you know the big take
away from me here was

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.280 position:56%
that women were actually conscious
actors in this political chess game.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.750
The unions were sometimes fragile;

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.950
sometimes they completely
did not work.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.810
The women soldiered
on most of the time,

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.240
sometimes they left their husbands.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.690
Actually in the oral
history research

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:13.260
and the interviews
it's very interesting

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.860
to see how women are
extremely liberated.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:19.640
They - you know I am the one kind
of gawking in the background.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.960
"You married who and you left
who and how" and I'm the one

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.260
who is completely indignant.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.480
And they're like "Yeah, I
didn't like him; I moved on.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.450
And I left the kids"
they're very sort of liberal

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:33.750
and you know I felt myself

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.880
to be actually a lot more
worried than they were.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.960
So, but in conclusion I'd
say that the continuity

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.840
of these family histories to
me, points a very essential link

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.100
between their presence,
their collective presence

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.380
and the crafting of empire.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:55.090
And in addition, to pointing
to a more sort of diplomatic

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:56.550
and peaceful mechanism

00:52:56.550 --> 00:53:00.660
of the expanding Ethiopian state
one could raise new questions

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.880
on identity women in power.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.630
And so the social history
of families in proximity

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:10.080
to power was sort of the frame,

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.970
the girdle on which the
entire state apparatus hung.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.350
So I'll stop there
and see if you're -

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:19.810
if you might have questions
or thoughts.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:22.880
There might be folks here that
are actually family members

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.910
of the people I mentioned,
so I'll stop there

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:27.830
and wait to hear from you guys.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:29.630
Thank you very much
for listening to me.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:34.510
[ Applause ]

00:53:34.510 --> 00:54:03.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.980
&gt;&gt; Heran Sereke-Brhan:
So it's a mixed thing.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:10.280
The women I got to interview, I did
most of my research in the 90's,

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.010
mid 90's and they -
most of the women were

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:16.330
in their 80's at the time.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:21.450 position:56%
At least one woman that I remember
very vividly, actually two were kind

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:28.230
of - they were cognizant of what
was going on politically but still

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.780
within that space, they could
make their own decisions.

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.550
They got admonished, the
Emperor's got involved,

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:39.720
Emperor [Inaudible] also, you know
one of the women was a relative

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:42.550
of his was actually
- he was quite upset

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:43.990
that she had left the marriage,

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:46.140
which had political
weight obviously.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:51.440
So he had her - I think he ordered
for her to have her hair shaved

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.250
and you know so there
is repercussion.

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:58.760
But even within that, I think
sometimes the women feel obligated

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.710
to stay and sometimes - so it was
never the same kind of reaction.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.110
But sometimes the women felt

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:08.270
like this is not my
life, so I can move on.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:13.220
So I got both kind of reactions.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:17.310
The alliance may have
collapsed, that's interesting.

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:19.650
I haven't thought about
that, it may have.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.850
It may have or it may have
solidified enough at that point

00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:27.000
where the marriage you know,
was sort of secondary to the -

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.860
it didn't all rely on
the marriages obviously.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.920
But the marriages supported
and cemented what was doing

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.080
on politically, but
that's a good question.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.470
I should look at that more closely.

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.770
Thank you.

00:55:54.510 --> 00:57:24.090
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:25.670
&gt;&gt; Heran Serek-Brhan:
That's actually yes.

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:30.140
I would think that the models
existed before the imperial,

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:35.070 position:56%
building of the - the expansion of
the imperial center absolutely true.

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.930
And [Inaudible] is
another of the women

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.820
and even Menilek's
first wife [Inaudible].

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.980
These are very powerful women
because of their birthright,

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:48.780
because of their connections
and every time

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.990
that you know there was a
threat to the [Inaudible],

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:56.410
in this case the [Inaudible]
imperial center falling apart,

00:57:56.410 --> 00:58:01.280
the women start looking to marriage
to create these continuities

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:06.210 position:56%
so it's just that I picked this time
period [Inaudible] is very important

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:08.280
and the [Inaudible]
family that then comes

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.860
into power is very
important part of the story.

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:16.130
And I think for the women's section
should be very, very important.

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:20.430
There was definitely
precedence before Taytu, yes.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.730
Thank you.

00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:23.880
Good to see you too.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.680
Yes.

00:58:25.680 --> 00:59:20.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.690
&gt;&gt; Heran Serek-Brhan: Okay
so are women still empowered

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.810
and do the political
marriages still continue?

00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:33.110
My sense of it is towards the 1960,
70's the process was complete.

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:35.330
This process of marrying,
intermarrying,

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:38.530
regional areas to the
political center.

00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:44.090
So by the Emperor [Inaudible]
granddaughters pretty much have the

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:46.670
flexibility to marry
whomever, you know?

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:51.730
I think that's because the process
of bringing together the country

00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:53.150
through these intermarriages was

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:58.250
in its own way complete,
that's my sense of it.

00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:59.760
Women - when we talk about women

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.200 position:56%
in political it's very hard still
even now after I've read all of this

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.830 position:56%
and tried to think about it to claim
that women were political actors,

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:11.490 position:56%
here and there they were officially,

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:14.330
publically like Empress
Taytu and [Inaudible].

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:18.810
But it's very hard -
so I think what we need

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:22.220
to do is reverse the
question and look

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:27.400
at different ways we can
see power being exercised.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.260
So it's not are they in official
capacities because they're seldom

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.010
in official capacities, but they
were very important influential

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:40.530
in the courts, the emperors, I
mean even in our recent history.

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:45.720
For example [Inaudible] was very,
very you know kind of important

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.410
in Emperor [Inaudible] court.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.490
It's not something
[Inaudible] she has this office

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:54.590
and she's exercising this you
know, but decisions you know I see

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:58.050
for example now I'm
reading [Inaudible] letters,

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:02.050
[Inaudible] letters like a
big, big book of 600 pages.

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:06.150
And you notice who are the
women that report into Menilek?

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:08.210
I've gone from this
place to this place.

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:09.910
I've arrived in this place.

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:13.680
So that's how you kind of get
to bring them into the story,

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.690
is there were women that were in
very close touch with the emperor

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:21.800
with the powerful men, and
that influence discussions

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.100
that were happening.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.250
So it's a very kind of tenuous
thread, but one has to follow

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:31.170
that to bring them
into relief I think.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:03:07.570
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:09.510
&gt;&gt; Heran Serek-Brhan: So I'll
take the last question first.

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:16.220
It manifested very much among all
Wallo, Gojjam, [Inaudible] a lot

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:20.160 position:56%
of different kinds of ethnic groups.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.360
The challenge I think for me,
and I'm hoping to publish this.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.880
It's been many years and I've
been thinking about this,

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.770
but it feels like now is
the right time to do it.

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:34.620
But at the end of the day
what we can say for sure is

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.940
that the power elite was
a very diverse group.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.640
But so what, how does
one measure that?

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.190
What is the outcome of that?

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:46.460
What does it do the
layering of identity?

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:50.150
What does it do for our sense
of who are the Ethiopian rulers

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:52.650
or even their own sense
of themselves?

01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:54.260
How does one measure

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:58.480
that as something that's
effective is a question.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.720
It's still an outstanding
question for me.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.020 position:56%
So, and then to backtrack the
marriages definitely there were some

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.320
that did not work.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.990
And I think [Inaudible]
daughters marriage

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:13.910
to [Inaudible] was very much
sort of the last act of trying

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:17.880
to create continuity,
that just didn't work.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.180
So there are times when it
fails and it fails miserably.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:26.350
But - and I suspect if we
were to push the story even

01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:30.550
into the current kind of
contemporary Ethiopian history

01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:34.670
that there are stories of
intermarriages of these people

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.530 position:56%
around power, families around power.

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:39.340
I think that still
happens as an exercise.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.640
Possibly elsewhere too.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.300
I mean I don't think it's -
this is just for Ethiopia.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:47.050
But the challenges, definitely
the ethnic groups intermarried

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:51.810
but I know when I questioned in the
interviews when I said something

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:55.980
like for example I would talk

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.640
to [Inaudible] you know
[Inaudible] or somebody.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.150
And I'd say "So did you think
about [Inaudible] roots,

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:07.050
did you think about his ethnic"
that wasn't a consideration.

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:10.640
In honesty none of them said
that was a consideration.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.200
They would say "We would see
that he was from a good family".

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.210
So my sense is its more
class than even ethnicity

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:19.800
that had any bearing at all.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.860
And he was from a good family,

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:27.670
[Inaudible] the values were very
different and anyone seeking

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:30.450
for an ethnic calculation
you wouldn't find the answers

01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:32.410
to it at all, you know.

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:37.520
But there was that layering, it
was important you know in a sense.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.510
Thank you.

01:05:39.510 --> 01:07:06.150
[ Inaudible ]

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:08.240
&gt;&gt; Heran Sereke-Brhan: It's
so hard to find documents

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:12.690
or anything written really, but
you do - at least I can remember

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:18.150
for example one example [Inaudible]
was married to Ras Mengesha

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:23.570
who was very, very active in
pleading for her husband's case

01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:26.120
when her husband was imprisoned.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:30.670
She basically convinced the
emperor in the end to let him go.

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:34.660
So I think the documentation
is hard to find

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:37.460 position:56%
but I think they were very involved.

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.950
Nothing happened that they were -
I mean it was really interesting,

01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:43.670
even interviewing the women was
harder than interviewing the men

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:48.470
because they have a really strong
sense of history and politics

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:51.670 position:56%
in the past, but if there's a man in
the room they'll defer to the man.

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:55.390
They won't agree to being
interviewed, they'll step away.

01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:59.480
If you push past that
and if you get there -

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.550
in official positions and so on.

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:04.090
They have the knowledge,
they have the tact,

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:07.050
they have the configuration
and the balance.

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:11.330
They know all about this but it's
really hard to even in that -

01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:14.950
in the 1990's to get women
to talk about it, you know?

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:16.960
So that's the challenge.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.420
I know they were utilized in
this way, they definitely were

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:25.050
but how do you get to talk about it
and research it is a big challenge.

01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:33.110
