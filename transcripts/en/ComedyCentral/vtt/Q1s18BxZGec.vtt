00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.365

YOU'RE NOT THE DIRECTOR, MAN.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.366
- OKAY, NO, I'M SORRY,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.767
AND I RESPECT YOU
AS A DIRECTOR,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.969
BUT QUITE FRANKLY,
I THINK YOU'RE LOSING CONTROL

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:36.937
A LITTLE BIT,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.739

DUDE, WHAT HAPPENED

YOU GUYS HAD DATED.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.081
- WE WENT ON ONE DATE.
- WE WENT OUT ON ONE DATE.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.684
SEE HOW WE ALMOST FINISHED
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCE THERE?

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:24.785
- MM-HMM.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.320
- WE SHOULD'VE GROWN OLD
TOGETHER AND DIED,

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:29.389
BUT SOMEONE THOUGHT SOMEONE
WAS STRANGE, YOU KNOW.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.291
- OKAY, WELL, DUDE,
YOU'RE DOING AWESOME.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.493
- MM, IT MAY LOOK LIKE THAT,
BUT THIS IS ALL A FACADE,

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:36.163
BECAUSE I'M BROKEN INSIDE
BECAUSE I STILL LOVE SOMEONE.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.132
- OKAY, HE DOES THIS.
LET'S GET ANOTHER DRINK.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.802
- LATER, SANTINO.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, BRO.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.537

HEY, BRO, I'M NOT EVEN MAD.
