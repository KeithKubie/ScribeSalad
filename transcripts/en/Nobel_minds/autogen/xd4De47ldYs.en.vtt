00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.399
well it was you know typical of a really

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:09.409
well it was you know typical of a really
 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.439
well it was you know typical of a really
interesting development in that I was

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:12.449
interesting development in that I was
 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.659
interesting development in that I was
looking for something else and and you

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:14.669
looking for something else and and you
 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.230
looking for something else and and you
know it was it it was a like PCR with

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
know it was it it was a like PCR with
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.570
know it was it it was a like PCR with
the possible outcome of a solution to a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
the possible outcome of a solution to a
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.160
the possible outcome of a solution to a
hypothetical problem that didn't really

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
hypothetical problem that didn't really
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.620
hypothetical problem that didn't really
exist I mean I was working on trying to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
exist I mean I was working on trying to
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.760
exist I mean I was working on trying to
sequence a single base pair you know

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770
sequence a single base pair you know
 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.739
sequence a single base pair you know
think why they call snips today single

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:33.749
think why they call snips today single
 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.680
think why they call snips today single
nucleotide polymorphisms because those

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
nucleotide polymorphisms because those
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.020
nucleotide polymorphisms because those
were medically important and I was

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
were medically important and I was
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.270
were medically important and I was
trying to do it with Oleg and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
trying to do it with Oleg and
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.939
trying to do it with Oleg and
nucleotides because I ran a lab that

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949
nucleotides because I ran a lab that
 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.689
nucleotides because I ran a lab that
made them and we had really improved the

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699
made them and we had really improved the
 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.790
made them and we had really improved the
efficiency with which we made them over

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
efficiency with which we made them over
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.989
efficiency with which we made them over
the three or four years prior so that we

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999
the three or four years prior so that we
 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.389
the three or four years prior so that we
were making we can make him a lot faster

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
were making we can make him a lot faster
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340
were making we can make him a lot faster
than the company see just I worked for

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
than the company see just I worked for
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619
than the company see just I worked for
could use them I had seven people

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
could use them I had seven people
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.799
could use them I had seven people
working for me and I was thinking well

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
working for me and I was thinking well
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.390
working for me and I was thinking well
I'm either gonna have to cut the staff

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
I'm either gonna have to cut the staff
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400
I'm either gonna have to cut the staff
down to like about three because now we

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410
down to like about three because now we
 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.440
down to like about three because now we
got these little automated devices they

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
got these little automated devices they
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300
got these little automated devices they
don't do that or I'm gonna have to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
don't do that or I'm gonna have to
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640
don't do that or I'm gonna have to
increase the demand for all your

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
increase the demand for all your
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.140
increase the demand for all your
nucleotides so I started thinking of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
nucleotides so I started thinking of
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600
nucleotides so I started thinking of
what else can you do with them and I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
what else can you do with them and I
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940
what else can you do with them and I
thought that it's possible that you can

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
thought that it's possible that you can
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.810
thought that it's possible that you can
make a rapid clinical assay for single

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
make a rapid clinical assay for single
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.000
make a rapid clinical assay for single
base polymorphisms

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010
base polymorphisms
 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.980
base polymorphisms
like sickle cell anemia was a good

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
like sickle cell anemia was a good
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.890
like sickle cell anemia was a good
example out people there that took back

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
example out people there that took back
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350
example out people there that took back
then maybe you'd go into a clinic and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
then maybe you'd go into a clinic and
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.570
then maybe you'd go into a clinic and
they take a sample and maybe three weeks

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580
they take a sample and maybe three weeks
 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.790
they take a sample and maybe three weeks
later you know it's just

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800
later you know it's just
 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.610
later you know it's just
lonna veganizing now though you're gonna

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620
lonna veganizing now though you're gonna
 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.830
lonna veganizing now though you're gonna
be nice to have been one shift the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
be nice to have been one shift the
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.140
be nice to have been one shift the
hospital can go in and they'd let you

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150
hospital can go in and they'd let you
 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.900
hospital can go in and they'd let you
know and I I thought oligonucleotides

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910
know and I I thought oligonucleotides
 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.480
know and I I thought oligonucleotides
maybe were the answer there but I was

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
maybe were the answer there but I was
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.100
maybe were the answer there but I was
really I I was I was a chemist I still

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
really I I was I was a chemist I still
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.370
really I I was I was a chemist I still
am a chemist and I really didn't have an

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
am a chemist and I really didn't have an
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.640
am a chemist and I really didn't have an
appreciation for the hugeness of the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650
appreciation for the hugeness of the
 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.860
appreciation for the hugeness of the
human genome compared to say a five

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870
human genome compared to say a five
 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.020
human genome compared to say a five
thousand base pair plasmid that I was

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
thousand base pair plasmid that I was
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.339
thousand base pair plasmid that I was
using as a sort of a model system

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349
using as a sort of a model system
 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.360
using as a sort of a model system
and and I was thinking of this method it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370
and and I was thinking of this method it
 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.369
and and I was thinking of this method it
would require a couple of Olga

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379
would require a couple of Olga
 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.319
would require a couple of Olga
nucleotides and one of them to sort of

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329
nucleotides and one of them to sort of
 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.239
nucleotides and one of them to sort of
be a control but they would be pointed

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:19.249
be a control but they would be pointed
 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.770
be a control but they would be pointed
right toward each other just like in a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780
right toward each other just like in a
 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.369
right toward each other just like in a
PCR reaction and and then I and I was

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379
PCR reaction and and then I and I was
 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.780
PCR reaction and and then I and I was
thinking of how many rid of excess

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790
thinking of how many rid of excess
 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.589
thinking of how many rid of excess
deoxynucleotide triphosphates is

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599
deoxynucleotide triphosphates is
 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.369
deoxynucleotide triphosphates is
something like there was a couple

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379
something like there was a couple
 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.229
something like there was a couple
technical problems I was trying to saw

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239
technical problems I was trying to saw
 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.539
technical problems I was trying to saw
often one of them the way I was gonna

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549
often one of them the way I was gonna
 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.039
often one of them the way I was gonna
decide to solve it was to till I run a

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049
decide to solve it was to till I run a
 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.699
decide to solve it was to till I run a
sort of sham reaction first with the

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709
sort of sham reaction first with the
 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.220
sort of sham reaction first with the
oligonucleotide in place in the sample

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230
oligonucleotide in place in the sample
 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.580
oligonucleotide in place in the sample
and then then then I had my radioactive

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590
and then then then I had my radioactive
 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.849
and then then then I had my radioactive
traces and stuff and run it again and

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859
traces and stuff and run it again and
 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.649
traces and stuff and run it again and
because I was gonna use up though it was

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659
because I was gonna use up though it was
 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.199
because I was gonna use up though it was
just not for monthly I didn't at first

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209
just not for monthly I didn't at first
 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.959
just not for monthly I didn't at first
look like duplicating the signal but

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:58.969
look like duplicating the signal but
 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.330
look like duplicating the signal but
then I realized the side effect of that

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340
then I realized the side effect of that
 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.360
then I realized the side effect of that
was gonna be that I was going to double

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
was gonna be that I was going to double
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.670
was gonna be that I was going to double
the signal if there were enough like

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680
the signal if there were enough like
 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.509
the signal if there were enough like
deoxynucleotides available I was trying

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519
deoxynucleotides available I was trying
 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.619
deoxynucleotides available I was trying
to get rid of those if there were any

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629
to get rid of those if there were any
 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.449
to get rid of those if there were any
coming in with the sample but you were

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459
coming in with the sample but you were
 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.300
coming in with the sample but you were
out driving I mean you had this in your

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310
out driving I mean you had this in your
 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.559
out driving I mean you had this in your
head and you were thinking about it

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569
head and you were thinking about it
 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.210
head and you were thinking about it
constantly and then you'll just realize

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220
constantly and then you'll just realize
 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.580
constantly and then you'll just realize
that there is a way you don't think in

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590
that there is a way you don't think in
 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.009
that there is a way you don't think in
the last as much you know I usually

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019
the last as much you know I usually
 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.159
the last as much you know I usually
usually think I was spending my weekends

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169
usually think I was spending my weekends
 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.580
usually think I was spending my weekends
up in Mendocino at a little cabin and I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590
up in Mendocino at a little cabin and I
 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.020
up in Mendocino at a little cabin and I
would drive up every Friday and I hadn't

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030
would drive up every Friday and I hadn't
 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.520
would drive up every Friday and I hadn't
come back on Sunday night and that's

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530
come back on Sunday night and that's
 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.740
come back on Sunday night and that's
really that was a nice it was about two

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750
really that was a nice it was about two
 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.800
really that was a nice it was about two
and a half hours and it's sort of you're

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810
and a half hours and it's sort of you're
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.819
and a half hours and it's sort of you're
you're just you've got something to do

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829
you're just you've got something to do
 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.589
you're just you've got something to do
with your hands and you can't do

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599
with your hands and you can't do
 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.509
with your hands and you can't do
anything else until you think that's

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519
anything else until you think that's
 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.189
anything else until you think that's
that's when I did most of my thinking

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199
that's when I did most of my thinking
 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.219
that's when I did most of my thinking
actually because the day-to-day life in

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229
actually because the day-to-day life in
 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.300
actually because the day-to-day life in
a laboratory doesn't allow a lot of yeah

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310
a laboratory doesn't allow a lot of yeah
 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.209
a laboratory doesn't allow a lot of yeah

there's your phone ringing and there's
always people that you have to deal with

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979
always people that you have to deal with
 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.949
always people that you have to deal with
and seven you don't have really that

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959
and seven you don't have really that
 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.640
and seven you don't have really that
kind of time

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650
 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.490
you

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500
 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.770
