00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.800
Usually when we think placebos, we think of
sugar pills.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.830
Fake drugs that, when taken, improve people’s
symptoms just because they believe they’re

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.830
taking real pharmaceuticals.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.460
But it turns out surgery can be a placebo
as well…

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.040
When surgeries were first used their sole
purpose was to save lives.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
So, it was pretty obvious when operations
worked as intended and when they didn’t.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.100
But today we’ve developed procedures that
aren’t designed to to save patients, but

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.060
to improve quality of life.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.880
Opening the door to whole new kind of surgeries
that might take advantage of the placebo effect.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.119
The Placebo Effect we’ve talked about a
lot, it’s the idea that you feel better

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.510
because you got some medical attention, even
if that isn’t necessarily medical treatment.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.660
The classic example is the administration
of a sugar pill instead of a drug.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.019
Even though there was no drug involved, patients
will sometimes report that they feel better,

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.449
and can walk away “cured.”

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.789
It may be hard to think of a surgery as just
a placebo, because after all, when you go

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.100
under the knife, you’re going UNDER a KNIFE.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.510
A surgeon is actually doing something; they’re
slicing and dicing, but it turns out, because

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.749
surgery is so serious and there’s all this
prep many have the mindset that ‘if it’s

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:02.749
surgery it’s meaningful.’

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.359
And that is exactly what makes surgery a great
placebo.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:09.970
In fact, studies on the placebo effect found
that invasive surgery has a stronger effect

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.829
than non-invasive, injections are better than
sugar pills.

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.970
Which may help explain why procedures like
acupuncture will sometimes test as no more

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.969
effective than a placebo.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.039
One researcher wrote that injections “seem
to associate with higher placebo effects and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.890
more ‘magic’”
They test this by performing both real and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.420
sham surgeries on test subjects.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.930
A sham surgery is procedure designed to make
the patient think they’re having the real

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.539
operation, but no real treatment is done.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.270
There ARE real surgeries that are actually
done every year, that test as no better than

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.359
a placebo -- One of these is arthroscopic
surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee; 692,000

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.649
were performed in 2010.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.870
Patients who undergo these treatments usually
report feeling better afterwards, even if

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.600
they were only given the “sham” surgery.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.869
And that’s not the only one, a vertebroplasty
where cracked vertebrae are filled in with

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.729
bone cement to alleviate back pain, and percutaneous
myocardial laser revascularization were both

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.010
tested against placebos and found no more
effective than shams!

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.739
The placebo illusion is even more convincing
when patients can watch a live feed of their

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.599
operation and have a little souvenir scar
when it’s all over.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.849
Before the pretend surgeries were shown to
be placebos hundreds of thousands of people

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.540
in the United States had them done each year
at a cost of billions of dollars.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.459
So, now that we have evidence that they might
not work, is it ethical to keep doing them?

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.780
Is it ethical to TRICK people into thinking
they got effective surgery?!

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.189
It’s a tough cookie either way you slice
it.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.629
The kicker: there are even ethical problems
with TESTING surgeries against a placebo in

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.629
the first place.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.700
It’s hard to do a double-blind study on
surgery where both the patient and surgeon

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.409
have no idea if they’re administering the
treatment or a placebo, because a surgeon

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.790
knows if they cut you up or not, right?

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.319
There are examples -- but the ethics are closely
watched.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.959
Drugs have to prove they’re more effective
than a placebo in order to be approved by

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:11.000
the FDA, but a 2014 systematic review of almost
3,000 surgical trials found only 53 were tested

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.739
against sham operations.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.320
Again, because of ethics.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.810
Sham surgeries CAN help determine if a procedure
is actually doing something.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.470
BUT, anytime you slice into someone you’re
introducing a lot more risk than there is

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.890
in a sugar pill, especially if anesthesia
is involved.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.400
On the other hand, if a surgery was widespread
but later proved ineffective, then didn’t

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.190
performing all those operations expose more
people to risk than if a small trial had the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.799
placebo option?

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.579
Placebo surgery is a tough question that the
medical community is still grappling with

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.650
today, and regardless, it looks like you can
chalk up one more big win for the placebo

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.650
effect.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.650
One thing that’s not a placebo, is your
very own website.

Visit Domain dot com today to claim yours.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.719
Fun fact: before arthroscopic knee surgery
was shown to be as effective as a placebo

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.620
it was the most common orthopedic procedure
in the US.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.030
For more on crazy surgeries how about a full
body transplant, what some people call a head

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.030
transplant.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.019
