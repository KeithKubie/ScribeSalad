00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 align:start position:0%
mean that's why it's I would expect it
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.740 align:start position:0%
mean that's why it's I would expect it
from<00:00:44.430><c> something</c><00:00:44.789><c> like</c><00:00:44.910><c> South</c><00:00:45.210><c> Park</c><00:00:45.539><c> who</c>

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 align:start position:0%
from something like South Park who
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 align:start position:0%
from something like South Park who
doesn't<00:00:46.140><c> have</c><00:00:46.320><c> to</c><00:00:46.530><c> give</c><00:00:46.680><c> a</c><00:00:46.710><c> fuck</c><00:00:46.950><c> but</c><00:00:47.309><c> Disney</c>

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to give a fuck but Disney
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to give a fuck but Disney
uh<00:00:48.260><c> the</c><00:00:49.260><c> only</c><00:00:49.469><c> thing</c><00:00:49.590><c> I</c><00:00:49.829><c> can</c><00:00:50.010><c> figure</c><00:00:50.250><c> is</c><00:00:50.489><c> that</c>

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing I can figure is that
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing I can figure is that
they<00:00:51.360><c> were</c><00:00:51.420><c> obviously</c><00:00:51.960><c> more</c><00:00:52.379><c> satirizing</c><00:00:53.070><c> like</c>

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
they were obviously more satirizing like
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
they were obviously more satirizing like
NSYNC<00:00:53.940><c> and</c><00:00:54.329><c> the</c><00:00:54.449><c> Backstreet</c><00:00:55.230><c> Boys</c><00:00:55.260><c> and</c><00:00:55.739><c> stuff</c>

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and stuff
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.229 align:start position:0%
NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and stuff
so<00:00:56.039><c> maybe</c><00:00:56.250><c> they're</c><00:00:56.399><c> just</c><00:00:56.640><c> like</c><00:00:56.789><c> yeah</c><00:00:56.940><c> no</c><00:00:57.090><c> no</c>

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
so maybe they're just like yeah no no
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 align:start position:0%
so maybe they're just like yeah no no
that's<00:00:57.480><c> what</c><00:00:57.719><c> it</c><00:00:57.870><c> is</c><00:00:57.899><c> that's</c><00:00:58.350><c> what</c><00:00:58.590><c> it</c><00:00:58.620><c> is</c><00:00:58.829><c> and</c>
