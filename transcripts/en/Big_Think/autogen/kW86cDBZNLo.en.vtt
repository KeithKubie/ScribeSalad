00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.940
you know the way I think about attention

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
you know the way I think about attention
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.600
you know the way I think about attention
is really as a problem of routing

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
is really as a problem of routing
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.199
is really as a problem of routing
routing signals so actually we know a

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209
routing signals so actually we know a
 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.379
routing signals so actually we know a
lot about how signals come in through

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
lot about how signals come in through
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.900
lot about how signals come in through
your sensory apparatus through your ears

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
your sensory apparatus through your ears
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.990
your sensory apparatus through your ears
and your eyes we know an awful lot about

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
and your eyes we know an awful lot about
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.960
and your eyes we know an awful lot about
how the retina works how the cochlea

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
how the retina works how the cochlea
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.570
how the retina works how the cochlea
works we understand how the signals

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
works we understand how the signals
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.060
works we understand how the signals
travel up and eventually they percolate

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
travel up and eventually they percolate
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640
travel up and eventually they percolate
up to the cortex in the case of sound

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
up to the cortex in the case of sound
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560
up to the cortex in the case of sound
they percolate up to the auditory cortex

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
they percolate up to the auditory cortex
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.540
they percolate up to the auditory cortex
and we know a lot about a fair amount

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
and we know a lot about a fair amount
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850
and we know a lot about a fair amount
about how they look once they get there

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
about how they look once they get there
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.890
about how they look once they get there
and after that we kind of lose track of

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900
and after that we kind of lose track of
 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.480
and after that we kind of lose track of
them and we can't really pick up the

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.490
them and we can't really pick up the
 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.270
them and we can't really pick up the
signal until where they're coming out

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
signal until where they're coming out
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.730
signal until where they're coming out
the other end we know a lot about

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740
the other end we know a lot about
 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.110
the other end we know a lot about
movement we understand awful lot about

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
movement we understand awful lot about
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.780
movement we understand awful lot about
what happens when a nerve impulse gets

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790
what happens when a nerve impulse gets
 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.460
what happens when a nerve impulse gets
to a muscle and how muscles contract

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470
to a muscle and how muscles contract
 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.260
to a muscle and how muscles contract
that's been pretty well understood for

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
that's been pretty well understood for
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.690
that's been pretty well understood for
50 years or something you're more than

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700
50 years or something you're more than
 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.240
50 years or something you're more than
that so where we really lose track of

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
that so where we really lose track of
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.560
that so where we really lose track of
them is when they enter into the early

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
them is when they enter into the early
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.210
them is when they enter into the early
parts of the sensory cortex and when

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
parts of the sensory cortex and when
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.310
parts of the sensory cortex and when
they're we pick them up again sort of on

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
they're we pick them up again sort of on
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.429
they're we pick them up again sort of on
the on the other side and so attention

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
the on the other side and so attention
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.620
the on the other side and so attention
is one of the ways in which signals can

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
is one of the ways in which signals can
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.929
is one of the ways in which signals can
find their destination if you like so

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
find their destination if you like so
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969
find their destination if you like so
think about it in terms of a really

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
think about it in terms of a really
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.120
think about it in terms of a really
specific problem imagine that I ask you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
specific problem imagine that I ask you
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.060
specific problem imagine that I ask you
to raise your right hand when I say go

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
to raise your right hand when I say go
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.730
to raise your right hand when I say go
okay so I say go you raise your right

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
okay so I say go you raise your right
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.209
okay so I say go you raise your right
hand

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219
hand
 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:30.679
hand
go raise your right hand now let's

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
go raise your right hand now let's
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260
go raise your right hand now let's
change it and I say go raise your left

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
change it and I say go raise your left
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.080
change it and I say go raise your left
hand go raise your left hand so somehow

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
hand go raise your left hand so somehow
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510
hand go raise your left hand so somehow
the same signal coming in through your

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520
the same signal coming in through your
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.480
the same signal coming in through your
ear is producing different activity at

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
ear is producing different activity at
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.309
ear is producing different activity at
the other end somehow the signal on the

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319
the other end somehow the signal on the
 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.039
the other end somehow the signal on the
sensory side had to be routed to either

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
sensory side had to be routed to either
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749
sensory side had to be routed to either
the muscles of your right hand or the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
the muscles of your right hand or the
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.809
the muscles of your right hand or the
muscles of your left hand now attention

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819
muscles of your left hand now attention
 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.029
muscles of your left hand now attention
is a special case of that kind of

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039
is a special case of that kind of
 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.039
is a special case of that kind of
general routing problem that the brain

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
general routing problem that the brain
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.730
general routing problem that the brain
faces all the time because when you

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
faces all the time because when you
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.289
faces all the time because when you
attend to let's say your sounds rather

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
attend to let's say your sounds rather
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.139
attend to let's say your sounds rather
than your visual input or when you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
than your visual input or when you
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.050
than your visual input or when you
attend to one particular auditory input

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
attend to one particular auditory input
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.140
attend to one particular auditory input
out of many what you're doing is you're

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
out of many what you're doing is you're
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.540
out of many what you're doing is you're
you're selecting some subset of the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550
you're selecting some subset of the
 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.160
you're selecting some subset of the
inputs in this case coming in

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
inputs in this case coming in
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.010
inputs in this case coming in
to your ears and and subjecting them to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
to your ears and and subjecting them to
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.650
to your ears and and subjecting them to
further processing and you're you're

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
further processing and you're you're
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.780
further processing and you're you're
taking those signals and routing them

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
taking those signals and routing them
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.210
taking those signals and routing them
downstream and doing stuff with them how

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
downstream and doing stuff with them how
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.729
downstream and doing stuff with them how
that routing happens that's the aspect

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739
that routing happens that's the aspect
 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.720
that routing happens that's the aspect
of attention that my lab focuses on so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730
of attention that my lab focuses on so
 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.490
of attention that my lab focuses on so
so the basic setup for the problem that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
so the basic setup for the problem that
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.590
so the basic setup for the problem that
I'm interested in is this imagine that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
I'm interested in is this imagine that
 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.420
I'm interested in is this imagine that
you're at a cocktail party there are a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
you're at a cocktail party there are a
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.390
you're at a cocktail party there are a
bunch of conversations going on and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400
bunch of conversations going on and
 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.890
bunch of conversations going on and
you're talking to someone but there's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
you're talking to someone but there's
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.660
you're talking to someone but there's
all this distracting stuff going on the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
all this distracting stuff going on the
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.729
all this distracting stuff going on the
sidelines you can make a choice you can

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739
sidelines you can make a choice you can
 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.229
sidelines you can make a choice you can
either focus on the person you're

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239
either focus on the person you're
 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.259
either focus on the person you're
talking to and ignore the rest or as

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269
talking to and ignore the rest or as
 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.580
talking to and ignore the rest or as
often happens you find that the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
often happens you find that the
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.350
often happens you find that the
conversation that you're engaged in is

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
conversation that you're engaged in is
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.949
conversation that you're engaged in is
not as interesting and oh really summer

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959
not as interesting and oh really summer
 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.990
not as interesting and oh really summer
okay and you start focusing in on this

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000
okay and you start focusing in on this
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.789
okay and you start focusing in on this
conversation on the right your ability

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799
conversation on the right your ability
 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.100
conversation on the right your ability
to focus in on this conversation while

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
to focus in on this conversation while
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.070
to focus in on this conversation while
ignoring that conversation that is sort

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
ignoring that conversation that is sort
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.080
ignoring that conversation that is sort
of the challenge understanding how we do

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090
of the challenge understanding how we do
 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.539
of the challenge understanding how we do
that is the challenge of my research and

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549
that is the challenge of my research and
 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.090
that is the challenge of my research and
that problem actually has two separate

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100
that problem actually has two separate
 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.580
that problem actually has two separate
aspects so there's one aspect of that

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
aspects so there's one aspect of that
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.979
aspects so there's one aspect of that
problem that is really a problem of

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989
problem that is really a problem of
 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.000
problem that is really a problem of
computation it's it's a problem that is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010
computation it's it's a problem that is
 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.300
computation it's it's a problem that is
a challenge to basically any computer

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
a challenge to basically any computer
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.670
a challenge to basically any computer
namely we have a whole bunch of

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
namely we have a whole bunch of
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.220
namely we have a whole bunch of
different sounds and from a bunch of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230
different sounds and from a bunch of
 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.330
different sounds and from a bunch of
different sources and they're

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340
different sources and they're
 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.610
different sources and they're
superimposed at the level of the ears

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620
superimposed at the level of the ears
 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.460
superimposed at the level of the ears
and somehow they're they're added

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470
and somehow they're they're added
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.610
and somehow they're they're added
together and to us it's typically pretty

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620
together and to us it's typically pretty
 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.860
together and to us it's typically pretty
effortless for us to separate out those

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870
effortless for us to separate out those
 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.590
effortless for us to separate out those
different threads of the conversation

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600
different threads of the conversation
 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.780
different threads of the conversation
but actually that's a surprisingly

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790
but actually that's a surprisingly
 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.910
but actually that's a surprisingly
difficult task so computers maybe 10

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920
difficult task so computers maybe 10
 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.440
difficult task so computers maybe 10
years ago already we're getting pretty

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450
years ago already we're getting pretty
 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.920
years ago already we're getting pretty
good at doing speech recognition and in

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930
good at doing speech recognition and in
 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.780
good at doing speech recognition and in
controlled situations in quiet rooms

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790
controlled situations in quiet rooms
 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.000
controlled situations in quiet rooms
computers were actually pretty good at

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
computers were actually pretty good at
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.500
computers were actually pretty good at
recognizing even random speakers but

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510
recognizing even random speakers but
 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.330
recognizing even random speakers but
when people actually started deploying

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340
when people actually started deploying
 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.670
when people actually started deploying
these in real-world settings where

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680
these in real-world settings where
 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.500
these in real-world settings where
there's traffic noise and whatnot the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510
there's traffic noise and whatnot the
 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.940
there's traffic noise and whatnot the
computer algorithms broke down

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
computer algorithms broke down
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.029
computer algorithms broke down
completely and it was sort of surprising

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039
completely and it was sort of surprising
 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.279
completely and it was sort of surprising
at first because that's the aspect that

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289
at first because that's the aspect that
 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.490
at first because that's the aspect that
we as humans seem to have not much

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500
we as humans seem to have not much
 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.270
we as humans seem to have not much
trouble with at all so the the ability

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280
trouble with at all so the the ability
 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.020
trouble with at all so the the ability
to take

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030
to take
 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.970
to take
apart the different components of an

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980
apart the different components of an
 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.130
apart the different components of an
auditory scene that's what we've evolved

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140
auditory scene that's what we've evolved
 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.440
auditory scene that's what we've evolved
for hundreds of millions of years to do

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450
for hundreds of millions of years to do
 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.230
for hundreds of millions of years to do
really well so that's one aspect of

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240
really well so that's one aspect of
 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.040
really well so that's one aspect of
attention there's almost this sort of

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050
attention there's almost this sort of
 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.570
attention there's almost this sort of
aspect of it that happens before we're

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580
aspect of it that happens before we're
 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.910
aspect of it that happens before we're
even aware of it where the auditory

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920
even aware of it where the auditory
 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.800
even aware of it where the auditory
scene is broken down into the components

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810
scene is broken down into the components
 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.580
scene is broken down into the components
the other aspect which is the one that

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590
the other aspect which is the one that
 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.050
the other aspect which is the one that
we're sort of more consciously aware of

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060
we're sort of more consciously aware of
 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.060
we're sort of more consciously aware of
is the one where out of the many

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070
is the one where out of the many
 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.760
is the one where out of the many
components of this conversation we are

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770
components of this conversation we are
 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.920
components of this conversation we are
of this auditory scene we select one and

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930
of this auditory scene we select one and
 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.710
of this auditory scene we select one and
that's the one we focus in on right so

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720
that's the one we focus in on right so
 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.110
that's the one we focus in on right so
at this hypothetical cocktail party we

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120
at this hypothetical cocktail party we
 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.720
at this hypothetical cocktail party we
have the choice of focusing on either

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730
have the choice of focusing on either
 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.820
have the choice of focusing on either
the conversation we're engaged in or

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830
the conversation we're engaged in or
 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.940
the conversation we're engaged in or
this one or that one
