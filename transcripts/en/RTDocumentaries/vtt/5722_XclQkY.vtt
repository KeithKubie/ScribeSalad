00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.380
There are mental illnesses that can't be fixed ... maybe,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.320
without medicines

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.480
You know the medicine fixes the issue once, or twice ...

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.020
or three times.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.680
And then all of a sudden on the fourth time or the fifth time ...

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.240
 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.360
the ... medicine doesn't work any more

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.320
and the issue just gets worse, because ...

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.720
you know, they never addressed the problems in the first place, and so ...

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.420
They just get put on more medicine until

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.420
they're no longer ...

Denis Mikhailov, a former office clerk from Manhattan

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.760
sets a new Guiness record for continuous running;

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240
having covered 129 kilometres in 12 hours

Observers: "7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1" *Cheers*

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.100
 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.560
We got the record guys!

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.060
Those are all, almost all,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.980
different medications that I've been on

Narrator: This is Chris

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.520
Narrator: This is Josh

Narrator: And this is Debborah

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.860
Narrator: But our story starts with this guy

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.760
I was very lucky when I, 
when I think I barely passed the English test

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.900
So I got accepted into business school

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.040
It was huge for a guy from a small town in Russia

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.800
– I didn't live in Moscow, or any large city at all –

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.980
to come to United States, completely different culture.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.500
And, uh, for me it was eye opening experience

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.280
Because I learned about the world of finance ...

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.220
the way that the world works

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.100
The company that I was working for

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.560
they were doing what was called,
"Healthcare Communications".

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.740
Which in reality was

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.960
advertising for the huge pharmaceutical companies

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.540
Whenever they came up with a new drug, or have existing drug

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.960
they would come up some new ways
to advertise it all around the world

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.240
Ad narrator: "I don't want to live with depression"

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.700
"I want to enjoy life again"

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.200
"I feel this pain constantly"

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.440
"This guilt is always with me"

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.540
"Depression may be a result of a chemical imbalance in your brain

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.620
"Tell your doctor about your problems and ask for a prescription."

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.520
"There's no need for you to feel bad any more."

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.220
It's 10pm now on Friday

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.300
I'm looking at this building, on the 8th floor

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.180
Something tells me that my boss is still there

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.220
because usually Friday night

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.300
before heading home for the weekend

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.300
we have to wrap something up and, you know, another long day at work

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.820
Not really missing that part of it:

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.820
Staying in the office for 10 hours a day

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.120
Denis now has a new view of his former job

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.155
A few years ago his life changed drastically

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.740
And he has his reasons to help us make this film

[more TV news]

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.860
Today he leaves his parents' house to go surfing

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.560
It's his life

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.320
What you gotta do is just go down the hill and make a right.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.100
Cameraman: OK. 
Matt: And then we're right there

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.940
Cameraman: OK, we will catch you like in 10 minutes.
Matt: Yeah, come on

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.440
Matt:You can meet all the crew

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.640
Matt: Come on down

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.600
Matt: When I was, I think, 11 or 12 years old I was

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.280
put on a drug called Acutane

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.740
which ... was

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.840
an acne medicine that ...

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.500
blocked the ... vitamin D

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.900
So that your skin would be ... not as oily. I guess, I dunno

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.420
Unfortunately the by product of that drug ...

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.820
is that it caused, like, severe depression.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.700
People who surrounded me in Russia while I was growing up

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.160
Nobody was taking any kind of drugs,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.180
And here, I was surprised to hear, or see,

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.820
even young people taking some kind of pills

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.480
to improve mood or,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.940
to get more energy. I wasn't sure what was going on.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.740
And then when I got involved in this ... world of pharmaceuticals

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.320
I saw this huge array of different drugs, geared to different people

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.260
to treat different conditions. Most of which I'd never heard of before

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.180
I'll never forget where I'm like in a room

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.620
And it's all mirrors and I'm wearing this like ...

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.200
Red and black checquered hooded coat

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.420
And, you have to take these tests

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.740
sat at the metal desk, with the metal chair in the mirrored room

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.020
So you can't see anything but you in the room

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.320
And then they take the paper away

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.480
And the like observe your behaviour, post.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.200
And like, obviously, if you have nothing to do and you're a 12 year old kid

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.900
you're gonna be like messing around with whatever, and so

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.740
And then they're like, "Yeah ...

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.660
"Well, based on his behavioural pattern ..."

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.960
"He has ADHD or ADD" or whatever

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.740
So they're like, "OK, let's put you on ... Ritalin."

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.160
Denis: I should be fair here,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.780
We were coming up with really engaging and interesting advertising

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.000
so that we would really make you think about taking this product

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.060
Woman: Hello Ecuador from Times Square, we love you!

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.000
In a way it was a very creative work that the agencies were doing

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.980
I was doing only the financial part of it so I wasn't involved in the creative process

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.340
But I could see what was going on and I was, uh ...

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.340
I saw the final, the end product of the work that they were doing

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.380
Olivia: Here's the Vyvanse

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.940
What is that? Antibiotics.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.220
What is this?

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.360
Oh here's the Seroquel

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.860
Concerta literally has the word "Amphetamine" in it

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.940
OK, these were all prescribed at the teenage children's hospital when he left

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.160
Olivia's mother: And it seems like when kids have problems in school, automatically the teacher wants to give them drugs

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.360
You know for years she wouldn't even do it.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.680
You know and when she finally does it, it's like ...
Olivia: All hell breaks loose.
Yeah.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.160
I had a lady today referring to the medication as "homework pills"

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.780
Mother: Homework?
Olivia: Homework "pills".

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.320
She said "We're gonna switch your homework pills to when you get home from school."

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.960
And that's the one he was on for just a week

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.840
because it literally made him into a zombie. It was crazy.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.160
You know they always say that they want to reunify kids with their parents.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.820
It's not their goal to keep the kids from their parents, but ...

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.460
When I worked in the children's system ...

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.700
They did everything they possible to make it hard

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.560
on the parents to get their kids back.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.440
Like tonight, I had to drive an hour and a half just to see my son.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.200
Denis I met somebody who I got  really close to on a personal level

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.740
And, uh, this person shared her story with me

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.020
Which was ... pretty dramatic

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.400
She um, she was taking ...

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.920
pretty hardcore psychotropic drugs, by prescription, since pretty early age

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.560
And she really got me engaged in this, uh, research

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.740
I never took it seriously before, because I didn't have any personal experience

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.220
But being with someone who, um ...

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:54.720
Who depends on those drugs. Who doesn't just know a lot about them, but physically depends on them

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.020
um, got me really involved.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.880
Alright, no luck yet.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.580
The struggle with addiction.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.260
I did it for 40 years

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.160
I actually had to go to a rehab

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.780
I got kicked out after two weeks

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.840
And my wife and I were on the run for 6 months

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.200
We went turned ourselves in and got ourselves straight

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.760
And now we're doing good.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.460
Took years to become an addict. Takes a long time to get rid of them.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.740
So I just think that, like

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.340
that society is no longer trying to push

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.680
children and people to accept the problems

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.760
that they have inside themselves

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.660
That they're pushed to take this pill and it will all go away

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.380
[Wind chimes]

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.820
Amy: Right here he was fine

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.760
This was before; he was sitting with our second in his lap

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.520
This picture, yeah, he was fine

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.640
This is after

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.700
Um, about 2 years after. You can see his wrist is twisted in the picture.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.860
This was last year at my brother's wedding

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.080
He was able to hold our youngest daughter for just a few minutes.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.940
So you've go that picture. His wrists are twisted, that's the dystonia

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.400
And up here in this picture was last father's days, his wrist in that ...

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.000
He was able to hold our baby for a few minutes, for the picture

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.440
So when we watch TV, he paces behind the couch

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.540
Um, for a lot of the time

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.460
[Child protesting]

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.700
Narrator: This is Josh, his wife, Amy and their five children

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.620
So basically what I do on a daily basis is ...

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.820
I just pace. And I pace and I pace and I pace ...

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.260
And I don't ever get

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.660
relief from pacing, but ...

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.240
It's the only thing I can do. If I don't pace

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.320
and I sit

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.700
it makes everything a lot worse. And the pain inside ...

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.920
gets worse

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.395
my movements get worse when I have to

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.600
sit still or even stand still

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280
so

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.260
pacing to me is pretty important. It's the only

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.700
it's the only thing I can do.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.760
I started a new job

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.360
and I was feeling some anxiety, um ...

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.820
a little depressed

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.160
so

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.340
that's when I got on Effexor

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.680
And ...

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.620
a few days after that

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.300
is when I started feeling that inner pain

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.520
feeling that I had to get out of my own skin

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.680

Denis: So, my personal interest in seeing this doctor is that

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.080
A few years ago I fell in love with a person who

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.280
was addicted to psychotropic drugs

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.535
and Dr. Peter Breggin is one of the very few people

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.825
very few specialists who is a licensed psychiatrist

00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:43.180
who has experience of almost 50 years

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.220
He never prescribes the psychotropic drugs to his clients

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.380
He's one of the very few people in the United States,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.100
if not the world, who knows

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.460
how to do it correctly.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.600
Most importantly, how to

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.380
break the addiction

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:06.240
without doing even greater damage to the person.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.080
So I think we are all going to learn something very valuable today.

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.240
After we see this doctor in about 1 hour.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.480
Um, we even got him, like, a hospital bed

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.600
Where he can

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.455
like, raise it up so he can have his legs in the air

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.300
Because that's how he comfortably slept

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.480
My mom didn't know how long you guys were going to be here ...

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.940
Cameraman: Indistinct question

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:48.940
That's ah, his name is Si. He's from a redneck type reality show.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:55.080
Cameraman: [Indistinct]

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.860
Cameraman: Redneck reality show?
Olivia: [laughs] Yeah

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680
 

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.580
Cameraman: Thank you
Olivia: Mm-hmm

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.540
[Crashing surf]

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.380
And so the parent naturally wants to go, like, "I wanna help my kid".

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.140
And then ...

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.060
The doctor's like, "I can help your kid. I can give them a pill." (Or her a pill.)

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.120
"And that pill's gonna make them happier"

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.780
And they're not actually making that kid understand anything

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.580
Other than, "rather than deal with who I am as a human being, and in my soul and in my spirit".

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.660
I'm gonna take this pill so that I don't have to

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.820
learn about myself

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:53.680
Chris: I was a, uh, I was a punk rocker. And, uh ...

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.620
I was a, what do you call it, a gutter punk and

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.760
basically lived on the streets

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.200
just doing whatever I wanted to do

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.400
Narrator: This is Chris. Once a heroin addict

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.700
He's now hooked on medication

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.940
He came to see us with his girlfriend, Irene

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.940
This is his parents house

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.840
The room that he lives in

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.220
and has to deal with his akathisia and everything ...

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.100
was so small that we couldn't fit two more people in ...

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.320
to film in there. That's how small of a place he lives in.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.200
[car radio noise]

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.420
Erm

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:12.420
This pill, I have to take it every 8 hours. So 3 times a day.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.440
Cameraman: And yellow one, what's the name of the yellow one?

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.500
Chris: Gabapentin.
Cameraman: White one?

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.960
Irene: Ativan, 2 milligram and a 0.5.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.720
Feeling depressed? We have something that might help

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.400
Check with your doctor. Go to your doctor and ask for "ba", whatever the drug is...

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.120
One of the things we've become expert at is how they manipulate the results.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.720
To make it so that, it doesn't look like there was much suicidality, for instance

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.840
Um ...

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.180
I always thought that people who killed themselves were weird

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.280
[cries]

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.720
But I can't live another day like this

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.260
And I almost killed myself last week.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.580
[wind chimes]

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:33.640
[squeaky swings and sounds of children]

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.420
I find my self doing things and saying things that I don't mean

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.340
Um, It's almost like there's someone else living inside of me

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.860
like, controlling my body and my thoughts and the things I say

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.940
One of the documents that we got while we were working on some suicidal

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.360
behaviour drugs

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.220
for serotonin re-uptake inhibitors

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.740
One of their internal scientists, Roger Lane, said:

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.260
"It's not so much that they're committing suicide,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.800
"their death is a welcome alternative"

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.180
"to how uncomfortable it is to go through akathisia"

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.120
That document does not get placed in

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.660
the medical journals. Doesn't get placed on TV.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.500
Doesn't get placed in radio ads or ...

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.900
newspaper ads, or magazine ads.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.980
But, that is a documented scientist

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.080
inside one of these major pharmaceutical companies

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.120
Saying that, "We have a problem here"

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.900
Concerta

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.140
Risperdol

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.520
Vyvance

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.860
Adderall

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.600
Hydroxyzine ... for anxiety

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.420
Zoloft

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.940
Reperdol

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.520
He was also given

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.060
Hydrocodone for pain and then Oxycodone for pain

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.420
And, um ...

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.080
Ativan, of course.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.880
I was hoping that you guys came down earlier today

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.340
[Cameraman laughs]

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.360
So when I ...

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.300
got off the drug and ...

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.360
wanted to, like, give blood to ...

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.180
you know help people, or whatever, to not die [indistinct]

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.120
It's like you couldn't give blood

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.940
after taking Accutane for 6 years

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.300
After taking that drug

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.160
So that gives you an indication of how strong that drug is

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.900
6 years you couldn't give blood.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.940
Because of what that does to your blood system

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.960
and like whatever, you know...

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Sucks.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.720
In next room: I'm leaving, you want me to take her?

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.700
Alright I'll leave Gail and I've got Sheri

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.760
A real therapy dog, huh?

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.000
Dr Breggin: I tell stories about my dogs

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.520
And the patients, especially children...

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.900
Dr Breggin: She's 13
Denis: Wow

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.900
She's a sweetheart

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.660
What do you think?
She  doesn't see much,

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.020
Doesn't hear much

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.720
But she smells really good, she'd smell that a mile away

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.520
We know from monkey studies

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.700
just how the amphetamines work, when we give them to children.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.580
Give them to monkeys, the monkeys stop socialising,

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.320
they stop hugging and kissing,

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.860
they stop trying to escape from their cages.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.980
They become good caged animals.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.995
So we're making good caged children in our schools.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.100
But the parents don't get this.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.540
And he said, "I feel like I can't stop shuffling my feet"

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.520
It's hard to explain. It feels like, um ...

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.360
Like there's ...

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.040
Like I'm being persecuted, like, ah ...

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.740
Like I'm being tortured in a torture chamber

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.460
but it's happening inside of my body

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.900
So there's nowhere ... there's nowhere to run

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.120
I was always brought up to trust doctors

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.220
A lot of people say that, "Trust doctors, they know what they're doing"

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.940
Until you find out that they don't

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.800
And from there it's just a snowball effect

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.240
When you're hurt by something, a medication, especially

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.780
Doctors almost become ...

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.000
ah, defensive

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.180
When you're trying to tell them things like this

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.440
And their only answer is to try more drugs

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.620
and try more drugs
and try more drugs

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.640
And it's just, it's scariness

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.180
And it's tiring.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.840
If you don't go to your psychiatrist they get offended.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.080
because they have feet of sand.
They're selling a false product

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.440
So they get very angry as a group

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.300
There are always exceptions, but as a group

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.820
they get angry

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.020
They might even lock you up
 for wanting to come off your psychiatric drugs

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.140
But they do get paid, I mean
they do get paid per kid, per ...

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.380
household, whatever, so ...

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.720
I don't know how that all works, but

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.960
it's a system all in itself.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.760
So who gets paid for it?

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:08.200
So, the poor, the disadvantaged, um ...

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.360
foster children, Medicaid pays for it.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.780
That's a governmental agency 
that pays for medications for

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.260
people who can't, children,
people who can't afford it.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:29.800
Ah, older and people who are 65 and older, 
Medicare pays for it.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.260
Ah, military people, Tricare pays for it

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.380
Prisoners, our tax dollars pay for it.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.960
If there is an avenue for a flow of income,
flow of money

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.540
 

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.580
To pay for the medication,
that's where there will be

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.220
ah, people prescribe these drugs

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.960
in a massive way

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.400
And they make so much money from it
that they are then able to

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.080
use that as part of campaigns with legislators

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.120
and with insurance companies

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.660
to see to it that they get even more
prescriptions done.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.660
It's quite an operation

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.860
We were pregnant with 
our fifth child when this happened

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:44.840
And he couldn't hold our newborn
because his hands are moving so much

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.240
Trying to live this way, um...

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.280
Like what she said, my kids ...

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.760
They on a daily basis, 
my kids will ask me to play with them ...

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.220
Um [sighs]...

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.500
So many times where I have to

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:07.200
I have to say, "I can't play with you" 
and it hurts

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.700
As a father that really hurts

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.040
I just can't believe it

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.320
I just can't believe that my life has taken this turn.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.120
This is not how ... 
 I ever expected my life would be.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.580
I always had plans in my head

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.020
for the kind of husband 
and father I'd be, and ...

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.320
and it just

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.680
I feel like that's all been taken from me,
that's all been stolen from me

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.020
Barbara Ann, that's my wife of 30 years

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.340
and she had 3 strokes, passed away, 
they brought her back

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.300
and now she's been in a rest home,
been there about 5 years

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.440
It's a 2003 powerstroke

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.600
With a 7.3 diesel in it

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.640
Wake up every morning, 
have breakfast with my dad and all them,

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.580
So, you know, can't really ask 
for much more than that

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.060
Just havin' fun and ...

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.740
just livin' the dream

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.500
 

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.900
There's four girls right here

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.280
young horses

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.200
Cameraman chuckles

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.160
Hi girls

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.180
Hi girls

00:30:47.015 --> 00:30:48.865
This one's just a yearling

00:30:49.675 --> 00:30:51.755
This one here is pregnant

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.800
She just arrived from Spain not too long ago

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.320
They're always ready

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.260
 

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.120
Doing the things every day that are kind of

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.520
repetitive but important, 
like washing the dishes and you know.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.660
Taking care of the horses is like that.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.100
It takes a lot of dedication, and ...

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.520
You have to really self, 
motivate yourself, to get up early in the morning

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.840
You know, do what needs to be done

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.240
Cos it's a lot of heavy work and ...

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.220
Moving 'em around, riding, exercise

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.700
You know, healthcare

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.920
But they just return so much, they just 
give their hearts so completely to you

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.060
And I just get so much satisfaction out of it

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.580
OK, go ahead ... this top step is a little tall

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.600
So, you go ahead first, yah.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.520
Sorry it's so small, but [inaudible]

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.620
 

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.020
[jumbled] 
Debborah: My bedroom [laughs]

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.380
I realised she could detect my seizures

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.740
She could predict my seizures

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.060
So I got her certified as my service dog

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.780
And she traveled with me everywhere
for, like, 5 years.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.440
And she would tell me, she would alert me

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.860
before I had a seizure

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.180
and i would have time to get with someone, 
to sit down, you know, be somewhere safe

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.400
And so she's pretty amazing

00:32:25.405 --> 00:32:28.740
But she's upset now because,
for over a year, she doesn't have a job

00:32:29.085 --> 00:32:31.925
It was always more, never less.

00:32:31.925 --> 00:32:34.480
They told me my akathisia was ...

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.600
"agitated depression"

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.500
That my depression was turning into bipolar

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.760
as they said was quite common

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.020
"Oh, just needs more meds, new meds"

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.840
All due to the fact that I was raped as a child

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.760
And never dealt with it. 
It was always pushed back

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.740
And when my parents first put me on drugs

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.995
It was so ... 
They were so relieved

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.100
See she's a problem

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.920
We don't have to do anything, it's not our fault.
She's crazy and all that.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.700
So I finally got so fed up,
I decided myself that I would get off

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.960
Well, I found that it wasn't quite so easy

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.660
Sometimes we were desperate

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.260
Sometimes we just fell in despair because

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.320
we had the feeling that

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.440
maybe she would never feel like a human again
without the drugs

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.540
I mean, she was still developing, her brain was still developing, when she took her first psychtropic drugs.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.155
She was a teenager and ...

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.040
we didn't know if it would be possible
for her to ever live without them

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:14.220
So it was really hard to find a specialist who would 
help to move in that direction

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.100
But we did find some information

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.080
We learned about tapering. We learned about
the correct way of getting off these drugs

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.740
And basically it's the same as 
getting off any kind of

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.760
street drugs, or smoking, or alcohol

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.400
the same idea

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:36.180
And so I basically lived my life
drugged out

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.080
I fought to do anything

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.920
It was either, too up, too down, 
too this, too that ...

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.240
Those drugs are so horribly addictive

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.400
When I tried to get off them myself

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.360
It was an experience that I couldn't relay to anybody

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.280
You have to go slowly,
it's really important

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.565
if you've been on a psychiatric drug

00:34:58.565 --> 00:35:02.120
especially multiple drugs, 
for months or years

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.900
I've written a book about it.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.460
It's called, 
"Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal"

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.020
So, I found Peter Breggin's book

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.880
"Withdrawal from Psychiatric Medications"

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.240
and I followed it to a tee

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.780
I took all my 7 medications

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.120
I just shaved off a little piece of one every day

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.740
and it took me over a year 
and I finally got off of everything

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.960
Cameraman: Is this from Star Wars?

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.140
Both:Yes!

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.760
Cameraman: Nice

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.940
This is a 2 milligram
And this is a half a milligram

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.780
And I take

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.580
So I take both of these 3 times a day

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.780
So, it's seven and a half milligrams

00:36:00.975 --> 00:36:02.775
Um, and, uh...

00:36:04.555 --> 00:36:06.695
By shaving it down

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.940
I've gotten down to about

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.680
[sighs]
Half a milligram

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.420
In ...

00:36:15.925 --> 00:36:19.115
Maybe, 5 months

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.320
So

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.020
[voice cracking]
It's a very very long, slow process

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.140
And, um ...

00:36:27.125 --> 00:36:30.345
And this is only one medication

00:36:30.485 --> 00:36:31.485
I have ...

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.680
I have, uh ...

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.720
I have ...

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.400
Two other medications to ...

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.740
Get off of

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.000
Some of the documents we have, it's like, 
"Why is this important?" Like withdrawal

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.780
Some drugs, when you get on them it's

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.760
very difficult to get off them because
they change the architecture of the brain

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.180
When the drugs are taken away, 
people think that their depression is returning

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.560
When actually, they're going through withdrawal

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.220
Just like you would if you were withdrawing from cocaine

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.120
or withdrawing from heroin

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.360
It's withdrawal

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.460
For,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.560
these companies it was a big deal to not, um ...

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.860
some of these companies

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:24.360
to not have the withdrawal be a feature
in the labelling

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.160
We were really drawn to each other
on some emotional level.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.820
It wasn't because of drugs that, um

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.220
that we were together
it was something

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.580
probably something deeper,
but ...

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.280
As with any addiction

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.780
Street drugs, or alcohol addiction, 
or whatever addiction, gambling ...

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.440
any addiction makes a relationship really hard

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.320
and it took a huge toll on us.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.440
So ...

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.320
We couldn't hold it together because of, uh ...

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.600
because of this, but ...

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.760
We did last for three years

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.800
And we, every single day

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.820
one way or another
this topic was coming out:

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.120
What do we do today 
to make the addiction better?

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.680
To make the side ...

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.880
To make the withdrawal symptoms better.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.640
To make her feel like a human again.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.380
My bike I kind of

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.640
consider to be a

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.420
life saver in a way, um ...

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.860
The one thing I can do,
I'm comfortable doing

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.880
outside is getting on my bike 
and riding it, um ...

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.220
It helps because on my bike I'm constantly pedalling

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.140
So I'm always ... moving.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.480
My legs are always moving,
so it helps

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.620
I'm sitting but I'm moving

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.480
And I enjoy it. I can get out 
and I can move a round

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.960
So, normally everything inside my body feels like

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.000
it's going a million miles an hour.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.340
And I feel like I don't have any control over anything
in my life.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.320
Nothing.
But when I get on my bike

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.160
I have control of my bike

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.140
You know, I feel like I have control of my bike

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.520
of something. The bike definitely helps a lot

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.600
And, I like to go at night, 
because there's not a lot of people outside at night

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:55.000
And I can just be by myself

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.880
and not have to worry about running into people

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.280
That helps a lot too. 
That takes a lot of the worry and the stress off

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.800
This is what horses do for me

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.180
Cameraman: Really nice

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.740
Camerman: Kind of a bodybuilder

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.060
Yeah, and that makes you feel good

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.120
And that kind of happened surprisingly

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.680
One day I'm like, "Oh!" And even in the back

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.400
I'm proud because I'm 61

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.115
And most of the women I know that are 61

00:40:27.115 --> 00:40:30.245
You know, they're like couch potatoes

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.200
Cameraman: So you're looking at the waves yeah?

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.460
Yeah

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.540
[indistinguishable] ... and this is Topanga, right here.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.400
[indistinguishable] ... 
Cameraman: A lot of people

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.540
Obviously, If I wasn't ...

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.820
in the sea and wasn't participating in the ocean

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.060
I think you never get rid of it.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.260
I think that that's the ...

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.600
that's the ...

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.780
thing that the parents ...

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.920
and society ...

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.000
and doctors, and psychologists, and things don't ...

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.240
maybe don't understand.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.780
There are no lifetime studies

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.780
I mean one of the more recent approvals in the FDA

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.720
of a stimulant

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.980
for, so called, ADHD was 3 weeks long

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.555
So then you're gonna say give it for months

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.960
or years, or a lifetime?

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.460
And why are the studies only 3 months long?

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.980
They're all neurotoxins

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.040
So after a few weeks the patients get worse

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.300
So you can't carry the studies beyond a few weeks.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.280
This is such a giant fraud.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.800
I am just in shock that it continues on and on

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.500
All the research,

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.640
all the long term studies

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.180
– which are people like me –

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.000
There were no long term studies in the beginning
 when those drugs were approved.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.860
I'm the long term study

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.880
I was affected horribly by those drugs,
they never helped me

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.020
It was all a mistake.
I should have never been put on drugs

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.280
I should have been nurtured a little bit
by my parents

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.440
and not told

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:18.380
I'm a reject and I deserve what I got

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.900
and it was all my fault

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.400
And I'm just not like everybody else in the family;
defective

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.340
When those parents put those kids on the drugs

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.860
They're teaching those children that
there's something wrong with them

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:31.260
That's something that's instilled in there ...

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.540
and they will likely never get over that:
"They're defective"

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:38.080
They need a pill to fix them

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.600
You know every human being
on the earth has their issues

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.100
And children, when they go through trauma like that,

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.400
Huh, what do they need?

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.180
TLC, understanding, someone to take them by the hand

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.040
and tell them it wasn't their fault

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.740
"This is how you get through it, you be strong"

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.360
You don't just take a pill and forget about it

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.200
It's just ridiculous to me
It's laziness on the parents' part

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.740
And not enough concern to look into the facts

00:43:03.835 --> 00:43:07.165
And see what happens to these kids
 long term – it's not a good outcome

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.620
It's not a good outcome in any way

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.060
It never helps.

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:21.800
Chris' mom: How he was? Well ...

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.040
He was a very happy young, young child

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.760
And when he hit about 4 or 5

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.840
he started to become very rebellious, um ...

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.900
We tried to deal with it 
the best way that we could

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.700
And when he hit about 4 or 5

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.460
And it just kind of

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.040
you know, the kind of ...

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.800
"You can't make me do this"

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.160
And anything we would say, 
he would be argumentative about it.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.320
Um ...

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.600
"You can't make me do this"

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.940
We spent a lot of time with him as a child

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.060
My husband and I worked opposite shifts

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.400
And so one of us was
almost always with him

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.180
Um ...

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.865
My husband and I worked opposite shifts

00:44:06.865 --> 00:44:09.295
You know it just kind of
escalated as he got older

00:44:09.715 --> 00:44:11.045
When he was about ...

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.340
in 4th grade he started having
a lot of trouble in school.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.100
So we started seeing a psychologist

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.940
and ...

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.100
um ...

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.180
He would not talk

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.180
To the doctors

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.380
We tried to do family counselling
and things like that and he just, he wouldn't

00:44:28.815 --> 00:44:30.885
He wouldn't talk

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.580
He said that we didn't love him

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.820
That was what he always told the doctors

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.900
That was his problem, that we didn't love him

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.895
That was his perception

00:44:40.895 --> 00:44:43.785
That he was not loved

00:44:43.785 --> 00:44:46.080
And he never did open up to the doctors

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.360
We did put him on Ritalin in 4th grade

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.540
For 1 year.
And we took him off.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:57.000
And that 1 year he was having a lot of trouble

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.820
It seemed to help from our perspective

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.060
The next year we took him off

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.060
So he took it for, what, not even a year.
Probably 8 or 9 months

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.400
He didn't want to follow our rules, um ...

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.060
He was smoking and drinking
and experimenting with drugs

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.580
He didn't have a lot of friends

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.760
He didn't get good grades and he was
doing drugs and he wasn't responsible

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.780
So we didn't give him a lot of priveleges

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.295
And the other kids got a lot of priveleges

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.240
And that was another thing,
he saw just that and thought it was unfair

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.340
But they were always good students
and well behaved and, um ...

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.840
And like I said, saw what he missed out on
and were determined ...

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.660
not to go down that same road.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:42.400
It was a good education for the other two

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:47.760
Yeah and I don't know. I honestly don't know what ...

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.040
created the issues that we had with him

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.220
No we don't.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:56.520
Obviously we didn't do something

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.200
Cameraman: OK.
You know there's something missing in his life, from us

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.780
But, I can't see that ...

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.980
I can't see what we did

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.960
[Door slams]
There now see he's mad at what I just said. Something I said ...

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.920
set him off, just now

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.680
Where did you go?

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.540
Where are you?

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.180
set him off, just now

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.940
Where did you go?

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.800
I know, but where? 
Which way?

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.560
 

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.100
I said OK

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.520
I know, but where? 
Which way?

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.940
 

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.240
I said OK

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.580
 

00:46:59.355 --> 00:47:02.015
 

00:47:04.205 --> 00:47:06.715
 

00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:10.535
 

00:47:11.875 --> 00:47:12.875
 

00:47:21.555 --> 00:47:22.555
 

00:47:22.915 --> 00:47:23.915
 

00:47:29.585 --> 00:47:30.575
 

00:47:30.575 --> 00:47:32.435
 

00:47:32.855 --> 00:47:33.855
 

00:47:33.965 --> 00:47:35.345
 

00:47:38.925 --> 00:47:39.925
 

00:47:42.555 --> 00:47:43.555
 

00:47:51.075 --> 00:47:52.075
 

00:47:55.545 --> 00:47:56.945
There is hope, there's always hope.

00:47:57.715 --> 00:48:00.655
 

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.700
 

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.280
There is hope, there's always hope.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.320
 

00:48:33.655 --> 00:48:34.655
 

00:48:56.325 --> 00:48:57.325
 

00:49:01.575 --> 00:49:02.575
 

00:49:06.985 --> 00:49:07.985
and that's a relief for me. 
To have control ...

00:49:09.545 --> 00:49:10.545
I don't know, I'd be dead

00:49:12.265 --> 00:49:13.265
Because the drugs don't work
