00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.370
Welcome to the assignments for lesson two. Now the assignments for

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.540
this lesson are probably the most involved and time consuming of

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.860
the entire class. They may take you three to four hours

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.530
to complete if you do them thoroughly. So, if you do

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.350
find yourself getting drained or bored or just running out of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.220
time, don't rush through them. You should do these well if

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.040
you're going to do them at all. But, you should feel

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.860
free to either skip ahead to lesson three, or if you're

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.790
getting bored, just take a break. If you do decide

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.479
to take a break, I would definitely, set a calendar

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.859
invite for yourself to remind you to come back for

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.750
the class. It's pretty easy to forget that. Good luck
