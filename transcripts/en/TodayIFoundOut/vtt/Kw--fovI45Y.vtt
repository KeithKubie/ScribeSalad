00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.640
Hollywood often makes up stories about nigh-unkillable,
enemy-stomping individuals who laugh in the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.681
face of certain death, only to deliver that
death to countless bad guys instead.

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:26.680
In real life, if you put a single individual
up against a large contingent of well armed

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.800
soldiers, the soldiers tend to effortlessly
dispatch said individual, no matter how much

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.440
courage and determination he possesses.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.720
But then, there is the story of 22 year old
Herbert K. Pililaau who for one day might

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.950
as well have been Captain America without
the shield.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.310
Born into a large 14 child family in the Waianae
area of Honolulu in 1928, Herbert K. Pililaau

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.170
was, according to those who knew him best,
a quiet, unassuming child who liked to listen

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.540
to classical music and keep to himself.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.370
In a 1989 interview with his many siblings,
Pililaau was described by his family as a

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.059
“sweet boy” who “couldn’t kill a fly”,
and his brothers noted that he would often

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.700
abstain from joining in with their rough-housing,
preferring his own company to that of others.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.579
In 1951, Pililaau was drafted along with 4,000
other Hawaiians to serve in the Korean war.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.420
Due to his deeply held Christian beliefs,
Pililaau initially toyed with the idea of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.109
declaring himself a conscientious objector.

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:28.170
However, for reasons known only to him, he
decided against this and went ahead and reported

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.170
for duty.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.189
During basic training, Pililaau’s peers
were amazed when, against all expectations,

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.640
he proved to be the most physically strong
and fit member of his entire company.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.130
Despite this, the 6 foot tall Hawaiian man-mountain
remained stoic and humble, “rarely socializing

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.279
with the other men“, spending the majority
of his free time reading the Bible or writing

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.009
letters home to his family.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.359
Just a few months after starting basic training,
in March of 1951, Pililaau was sent to North

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.380
Korea with the rank of Private First Class
to join the 23rd Infantry Regiment.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.849
Upon arriving in Korea, Pililaau formally
volunteered to be his company’s automatic

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.630
rifleman, a risky and dangerous position that
would see Pililaau facing the brunt of the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.310
enemy’s fire-power.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.040
When asked why he was so willing to volunteer
for such a job, Pililaau very matter-of-factly

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.020
explained: “Someone had to do it.“

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.860
As part of the 23rd regiment, Piliaau and
his company played a key role in the now famous

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.830
Battle of Bloody Ridge, in August of the same
year.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.840
However, it was about a month later at the
so-called Battle of Heartbreak Ridge that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.910
Pililaau would go all Hollywood on the enemy
troops.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.310
In the early hours of September 17, 1951,
Pililaau’s position on top of a strategic

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.780
hilltop was ambushed by North Korean soldiers.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.890
After a prolonged skirmish, his unit was forced
to retreat.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.470
They then regrouped and charged the hill,
with Pililaau leading the headlong assault.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.590
By midday, Pililaau’s unit were again forced
to retreat by yet another platoon of North

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.480
Korean soldiers intent on taking the hill,
which is when Pililaau made the decision that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.250
would make him a legend.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.230
A little after midday, Pililaau turned to
his comrades and told them that he would stay

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.930
and cover the retreat.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.340
As the U.S. soldiers retreated, he opened
fire on the advancing enemy with his M1918

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.340
Browning Automatic Rifle.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.970
After safely executing their withdrawal, the
U.S. soldiers watched helplessly from about

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.440
600 feet down the hill as Pililaau expended
his ammunition.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.800
Out of bullets, he began hurling grenades
at the closing troops.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.310
When Piliaau ran out of grenades, he began
throwing rocks.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.510
When the enemy soldiers were nearly on top
of him, he drew his trench knife and charged,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.320
stabbing with one arm and punching with the
other.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.540
As his squad leader noted,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.880
There was Herb standing up, fighting a lot
of the enemy.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.710
It was hand-to-hand and just Herb against
all of them.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.120
We all wanted to go back up to help him, but
the captain said, “No.”

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.810
We tried to help Herb by firing a few shots,
but they didn’t do any good.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.900
All of the sudden, they shot him and when
he went down, they bayonetted him.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.900
That was it.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.390
The next day, U.S. soldiers found Pililaau’s
body… and the bodies of about 40 North Korean

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.380
soldiers he managed to kill before the advancing
army had been able to take him down.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.050
For his heroics, Pililaau was awarded the
congressional Medal of Honor, making him the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.980
first Hawaiian to win that prestigious award.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.630
According to his siblings, Pililaau’s family
initially didn’t believe that he was capable

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.100
of such a ridiculous act of badassery and
they were reportedly stunned upon hearing

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.210
the news that the quiet, unassuming child
they’d known before the war had died in

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.169
ferocious hand-to-hand combat.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.240
What didn’t surprise Pililaau’s mother,
though, was the news of her son’s death.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.430
According to Pililaau’s sister, Mercy, their
mother stated she had a dream the night he

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.069
died, in which Pililaau came to her and explained
that his time had come.

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.360
No doubt every soldier’s loved ones often
have such dreams when they know the soldier

00:04:47.360 --> 00:05:04.740
is off at war; but in this case, unfortunately,
hers came true.
