00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:01.950
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:10.800
think about the difference
between a line segment, a line,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.210
and a ray.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.780
And this is the pure geometrical
versions of these things.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.640
And so, a line segment
is actually probably

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.950
what most of us associate with
a line in our everyday lives.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.210
A line segment is
something just like that.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.560
For lack of a better
word, a straight line.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.330
But why we call it a
segment is that it actually

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.300
has a starting and
a stopping point.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.210
So, most of the lines
that we experience

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.590
in our everyday
reality are actually

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.240
line segments when
we think of it

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.242
from a pure geometrical
point of view.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.200
and I know I drew a little
bit of a curve here,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.570
but this is supposed to
be completely straight,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.950
but this is a line segment.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.870
The segment is based
on the fact that it

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.770
has an ending point
and a starting point,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.630
or a starting point
and an ending point.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.380
A line, if you're
thinking about it

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.370
in the pure geometric sense
of a line, is essentially,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.412
it does not stop.

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:04.620
It doesn't have a starting
point and an ending point.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.230
It keeps going on forever
in both directions.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.735
So a line would look like this.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.110
And to show that it
keeps on going on

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.610
forever in that direction right
over there, we draw this arrow,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.980
and to keep showing
that it goes on forever

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.620
in kind of the down
left direction,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.040
we draw this arrow
right over here.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.090
So obviously, I've never
encountered something

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.530
that just keeps on
going straight forever.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530
But in math-- that's the
neat thing about math--

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.620
we can think about
these abstract notions.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.660
And so the mathematical purest
geometric sense of a line

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.100
is this straight thing
that goes on forever.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, a ray is
something in between.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.070
A ray has a well
defined starting point.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.140
So that's its starting
point, but then

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.580
it just keeps on
going on forever.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.650
So the ray might
start over here,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.760
but then it just keeps on going.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.195
So that right over
there is a ray.

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:04.070
Now, with that out of
the way, let's actually

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.550
try to do the Khan
Academy module

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.570
on recognizing the difference
between line segments, lines,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.160
and rays.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.451
And I think you'll find it
pretty straightforward based

00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.630
on our little classification
right over here.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.625
So, let me get the module going.

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:22.780
Where did I put it?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.780
There you go.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.700
All right.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.860
So what is this thing
right over here?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.680
Well, it has two
arrows on both ends,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320
so it's implying that
it goes on forever.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.122
So this is going to be a line.

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:34.080
Let's check our answer.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.720
Yeah, it's a line.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.509
Now it's taking some time,
oh, correct, next question.

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.050
All right, now what
about this thing?

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.826
Well, once again,
arrows on both sides.

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:43.200
It means that this
thing is going

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.430
to go on forever
in both directions.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.850
So once again, it is a line.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.040
Fair enough.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.510
Let's do another one.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.030
Here we have one arrow,
so it goes on forever

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.120
in this direction, but it has
a well-defined starting point.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.630
So it starts there, and
then goes on forever.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.530
And if you remember,
that's what a ray is.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.026
One starting point,
but goes on forever.

00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:05.900
Or one way to think
about it, goes on forever

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.480
in only one direction.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.750
So that is a ray.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.609
So let's do another question.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.150
This right over here, you have
a starting point and an ending

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.649
point, or you could call this
the start point and the ending

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.260
point, but it doesn't go on
forever in either direction.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.690
So this right over
here is a line segment.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.690
There you go.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.832
So hopefully that gives
you enough to work

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.040
your way through this module.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.370
And you might notice, when I
did this module right here,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.330
there is no video.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.970
And that's exactly
what this video is.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.139
It's the video for this module.
