Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, this is jad. We just wanted to throw in an extra episode into our feed and honor for a movie that we're really excited about. But first

Speaker 2:          00:09          couple weeks ago, I, I stepped in here and I, uh, sort of laid out a challenge grant that we'd gotten from the Tau Foundation. And the deal was, if you remember that if 700 of you guys listening step forward agreed to kick in $7 a month to support the making of radio lab, then the Tau Foundation would give us 70 grand to help make the show. So again, 700 people decided to donate $7 a month. We get 70 grand. That was the deal. All right, so how did we do? How did you do you crushed it. Just crushed it. Okay. We needed 700 people. As of right now, I think we're at somewhere over 3000 you did so well. We did so well. The Tao Foundation just came back to us and upped the ante full on stretch goal. Because here's the thing, 3000 people is amazing, but that is just a tiny percentage of the people who actually listened to this podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:08          So their thinking is let's capitalize on this momentum. Get the other 99.9% involved. So their new stretch goal is that they have agreed to match any donation that comes to radio lab right now up to 10 grand. So if you decide to make the seven bucks a month deal, that becomes $14 a month. If you decide to do a one time donation at 60 bucks, that's now 120 tau, we'll match it. And this, just as a reminder, this is how we're able to do, you know, the year long investigations in the police shooting or the nuclear chain of command, just to name the last three that we've done. This is how we pay for it. And this challenge grant will allow us to go farther. So if you're down, go to radio lab.org/match or you can text the word match to the number four six nine eight six six. Again, text the word matched to the number six nine eight six six a little formal pop up and you can donate in a matter of seconds. And thank you.

Speaker 1:          02:15          All right, so tonight is the premiere of a movie we're really excited about. It's called the mortal life of Henrietta lacks it stars, um, a um, a an up and coming actress. Maybe you heard her, Oprah Winfrey and it is based on the book of a very, very dear friend Rebecca Skloot bestselling book. You'll be able to watch the sh the movie in a couple of days on HBO a but in the meantime we were just so proud of Rebecca thrilled that this movie is getting out to a wider audience because everyone should know the story. So in honor of that, we're going to play for you a documentary produced with Rebecca. We worked on it for a few years with her while she was sort of formulating the book and it includes tape. You won't hear anywhere else.

Speaker 2:          02:59          We can

Speaker 1:          03:00          move me closer to hello. Hello, hello. And the story. Okay. It's about a tumor that expands and never stops. Begins in 1950 a black woman in Baltimore is in her bathroom and she discovers pretty much all on her own. Did she has cancer? Um, it's all, it's a little bit of a mystery how she initially knew this, but she knew it was there.

Speaker 3:          03:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:24          and not, she called it. She had told to her cousins for a while that she thought there was something wrong with her, with her womb, and she climbed into her bathroom and she slid her fingers up inside of herself and found this lump chapter one first. She went into her local doctor [inaudible] I happened to be and attending at that time. The guy she eventually ended up seeing at Johns Hopkins University was this fellow, Dr. Howard Jones. I'm 98 next month. That'll be 99. Wow. So when she came in to see you, can you tell me anything about what she was like? Well, she was a a uh, you didn't remember anything? No, I really don't. But you remember her tumor, right? Well, absolutely. I never saw anything like it before or after

Speaker 3:          04:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:14          and this didn't look like a normal tumor. It was. It was deep purple and about as big as a quarter, I'm sort of shiny or soft. That was another thing about it on examination, slightly raised and new touch that you might think it was a red Jello. There was something very strange about the way it looks

Speaker 3:          04:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:33          so doctors took a sample? Yeah. So they would cut off these little teeny tiny pieces and see Haley's small, tiny bite or two, they would take a piece, put it in a tube, and one would go into the lab for diagnosis. And in this case, since it was Hopkins, they would take an extra piece and give it to man name guy too. So George Guy was a researcher who worked at Hopkins. He had a deal with the clinic that anytime they got a patient with cervical cancer, they'd give him a tiny piece of the tumor. What he really wanted to do, his main mission, actually, not just his scientists everywhere, we're trying to do this. They wanted to find a way to grow human cells outside of a human being in a dish, in a dish. George Guy had been trying to do this, working on this for decades.

Speaker 1:          05:16          And why? Exactly. Um, it's sort of like, it's sort of like having a little tiny bit of a person in a, in a lab that's detached from them so that you can do whatever you want with them. You know, you can't bombard some person with a bunch of drugs and just wait to see how much they can tolerate before their cells all explode. But you can do that in cell culture. So, oh, so this is like, this is like the basic thing you need to study human biology. You need cells in a dish. Yes. Problem was anytime they tried to grow human cells in a dish, my daughters, they would die. Yeah, they died. This is George Guy's former lab assistant. Can you just tell me your name? You know, my name is so and so. My name is Mary. I'll put my maiden name in there.

Speaker 1:          06:00          Oh sure. Toy Cooper cheque. Mary lives just outside of Baltimore. About an hour from where she used to work with George guys. This is Dr. Guy. Show me some pictures and he's sitting at at a microscope. He looks, he's, he seems like a really big guy, like a really tall guy who was a big guy. At least six, five judging from the picture. Yeah, he was. And in every slide that she showed me, he had kind of a crazy smile on his face. Like he's got a, like he's having a good time. Bear of a man as well. I always thought, oh yeah. In any case, Mary says they were completely stumped at why the human cells always died to us, but they just did. Yeah. So on the day that George Guy Walked in, handed Mary a two with a little chunk of a name was women cervical cancer inside.

Speaker 1:          06:41          I knew nothing about her. No one expected anything. Oh, he was doing well, he probably, yeah, when I said ever hopeful, but you know, I was eating lunch and I thought, oh, the heck with it. You know, it's not going to grow. I'm going to finish the sandwich. And that's what I did. Three. Then I went in and she gave the cells some food, did my usual turn on all the machines and left, came back the next day they hadn't died, so she came back the next day and they were growing and then the next day still growing. They just kept plugging along

Speaker 4:          07:17          in the neck. They grew a lot. RECA says they doubled in size every 24 hours. Yeah, they just grew. All of a sudden, you know, I kept transferring them and making more tubes, transferring them, making more tubes, transferring. They weren't very reliable and stronger. They just kept plugging along and alone. Meanwhile, the woman had spawned all these cells die right? Officially she died of uremia, which is a like toxicity of the blood because she wasn't able to get rid of the toxic waste. That usually goes out in your urine log in the log in the wall, not herself, and to tell us this story is a privilege to introduce Dr. George Guy. It wasn't long after the George Guy appeared on TV holding in his hand a little bottle. Oh, let me show you a bottle, like an alarm, which we have growling quantity of catheter style. So did you want to look at the photos and you can't really get a sense of how aggressive this tumor was until you go to the Hopkins Archives and looked at George guys pictures and videos. Okay, this is it. Come on Ken here to Healer Cell Film than it hits you. But you're there in a large 10,000 times. Oh my God. Swirling hurricanes of cells, just like thousands of people, some nice small and some very large together and kept transferring them and making more to leave them under the microscope. Looks like something is just exploded, like you're going to just keeps getting bigger, bigger and strong. It's indestructable, it's indescribable. Nothing can stop it.

Speaker 1:          08:50          Why? Hers just sort of took off and grew and the other ones that they had tried it didn't is just a little bit of a mystery nobody really knows for and the less George Guy knew what he had, this new cell line was what they'd all been waiting for. So early on, right after this woman died, George Guy sent Mary back down to get more cancer cells from the [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          09:13          Oh, he sent me down to the morgue. Yeah. Really? Oh yeah. So I went down there and, um, the a coroner, I don't know who he was. Dr God was there too. And they were standing down at her feet, sort of. Yeah. Meanwhile, she's like, she's flying out there. She's already opened. I got some samples. Coroner would take them out and give them to me. What'd she look like? I couldn't look at her face. I couldn't look at her. The only thing I looked at were her toes and they had chip nail Polish on them. And that was really like, oh, this is a real person. What was it about the nail Polish that hit you? Oh, cause it was chipped. Cause you know that she hadn't been able to take care of her nails for a long time if they got chipped like that. And it's showed that she was proud of herself. Not everyone wears nail Polish on their toes. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Over the next several months while this woman's body laid, decomposing and the ground George Guy and Mary produced hundreds of thousands of herself or tumor cells and he named them the heela strain. Heela like Hella h e l a [inaudible]. No one would actually know why he had named them that for about two decades. Hmm. But what he did with these cells, you know, we'd be unusual nowadays, like if somebody now found a cell that was special, they'd run off to the patent office and then sell it to Merck for 1 billion bucks. But Georgia guy, hey, just pass them out freely. Didn't try and make any money off. It was just

Speaker 4:          10:43          nice, nice new thing that could help science.

Speaker 1:          10:47          Mary says that George Guy began to send Hilo all over the world. Yeah. And pretty soon she was in hundreds of labs. And you know, this was in the midst of the polio epidemic season when polio is at its worst, we're talking early fifties right? Yeah. So there's 1951 52 you know, schools are being closed. Kids are being kept inside

Speaker 5:          11:05          today's cruel disease. Medical science still has no complete onset.

Speaker 1:          11:09          There was this enormous effort to develop a polio vaccine. Problem was in order to develop a vaccine, you had to have enough polio virus, you know enough quantity to be able to study it in the lab. And they had no way of making enough. So whether they do, well, one of the guys, that guy, one of the guys that guy had sent the sales to, this collaborator friend of guys discovered something kind of amazing, which was that polio loved the heela sell, put polio inside a heela cell healer would copy and in the process make more polio. So which the Super Xerox cell, no matter what you want to do, they'll be like, make a copy, make a copy, make a copy. Yeah. So now they had a way of making polio either could just be a polio factory and so you government made a factory at the Tuskegee Institute, a real one, literally a factory.

Speaker 1:          11:52          So they had these big, you know, stainless steel and have that sort of culture medium that were sort of rotated constantly autoclaves for sterilizing all your equipment. A row with four or five microscopes, crazy frankensteinish gizmos. They had this machine that was like an automatic cell dispenser and it had this orbit on mechanical arm in Squirt a certain amount of this cultural medium filled with Hilo cells into a two. Wow. This is like the beauty of industry right here. Yeah, it is. Absolutely. The cells that were produced at this factory, she says were used to test the polio vaccine back cleaned the test that they were doing in Norris. It was the largest field trial ever done at its peak. The tests [inaudible] he lived production center was producing about 6 trillion cells a week. Wow. Um, which is kind of inconceivable, but that was actually only the beginning says Rebecca, because this factory led to an even bigger one. It was for profit. Right. And that second factory was the first time any human biological material was commercialized. So this was the first biotech company? Yeah, basically. Okay. When they first started mass producing healer, uh, what sorts of things were done to these sales? What sorts of problems were investigated? Like anything, I can imagine.

Speaker 1:          13:11          So they infected the Hilo cells with every kind of virus, hepatitis E, Coyne and encephalitis, virus, yellow fever, herpes, measles, mumps, rabies, whatever. You just any, any back. And this was just as, there's a revolution for scientists and research on chemotherapy drugs. He cells went up in some of the first space missions. Really? Yeah. So they were Vila went into space, into space. And every time I hear it, I think of it like Beulah. Why? I mean, just because the premise was to see what happens to human cells in zero gravity. You know, if we're going to be sending people up into space and what's going to happen to them up there, they went up before any humans did. Um, and then she eventually went up his, she the cells there was actually interesting. A little slip up there. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 1:          13:59          Okay. So let's actually skip forward in the story to the point where that, that slip up, you just heard that pronoun confusion gets personal, you know. Well, what happened? Okay. It's a late sixties and a heela has led to a revolution in science and now there are hundreds of cell lines, not just he live at hundreds. And somewhere along the way, scientists discover that he lays so aggressive that she's actually been contaminating and taking over all of these other cell lines where you just said she, but I get your point and she, she does it in the way it does it in the strangest way. Can you know they can float on dust particles. They can write, they can what? They can float on dust particles. Yeah. So they can, you mean they can hop out of addition, just get on a particle and just float out the door. Up the stairs. Down the hall one he'll sell into lab rops into, into dish or cell culture where there's other cells growing and because he will Selzer. So if powerful cells they take over. So on the heels of this catastrophe, someone at Hopkins decides to make a test. Let's make a test that will allow us to genetically determine if a cell is healer or if it is. And to make a long story short, this desire for a genetic test led scientists and then journalists to ask a question, which amazingly for 25 years had not been asked who was this woman and that's when we found out her name Henrietta lacks.

Speaker 3:          15:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:44          This is the sound of Rebecca Reading Henrietta's medical records

Speaker 3:          15:47          the first time. This is a 30 year old colored woman.

Speaker 1:          15:53          She's sitting with Henry and his youngest daughter,

Speaker 3:          15:55          this is second November, so this is again when she was pregnant with you. Right.

Speaker 1:          15:59          Henrietta had five kids when she died at the age of 31 most have no memory of her because they were too young. That's especially true of Deborah was only 15 months old and I don't remember anything about my mother. Yeah. So she, you know, she, she had spent her entire life just sort of longing to know who her mother was and did she like dancing? You know, I always wanted to know what she liked to do when she went where she liked to eat. Did she breastfeed? Debra? She, she was really sort of almost fixated on that idea. She wanted to know if she was breastfed.

Speaker 6:          16:32          Oh, I don't know. You know, I don't know what I would give up just to, just to have her hair, hey,

Speaker 1:          16:40          just to see her in a whole her. So in 1973 when a scientists calls the lacks family, and Deborah hears that little bits of the mother that she never knew are still alive. And oh by the way, can we take a blood test from you and your family? Cause we're having some contamination problem. We need these genetic markers, blah, blah, blah. Well, as you could imagine, tell me about the prize. It really did. It was really confusing. I mean, how much is the, how much of ourselves is out there? You know, eventually she went online, did some searches and found thousands and thousands of hits. Like for instance, on healer clones. And Deborah had heard, you know, various journalists in the past had come to her and mentioned, you know, dolly the clone sheep and said, you know, your mom, they did this with your mom too.

Speaker 1:          17:23          Meaning that's actually where the technology started. The first cells that ever cloned were heela cells, but that was just cloning a cell, not cloning an entire being. But that distinction is very complicated, particularly for somebody who doesn't know what a cell is. Yeah. Um, so Debra, between what journalists had told her and googling Henrietta lacks and clone thought there were thousands of clones of her mother around. And really, you mean like a bunch of Henrietta's walking street walking around. And Rebecca says that one of Deborah's biggest fears was bumping into one of these clones. She said, you know, she would say, I, I would have to go talk to her and she wouldn't know that I was her daughter and, and, and I don't know that I could handle that. Wow. It sounds so fantastical. Like how could someone believed that there are copies of her mother walking around, but at one point 25 years after their mother died, someone called and said, Hey, part of her is still alive and you know, we've grown enough of her so that it could wrap around the earth several times. At that point, all bets are off. Yeah, right, exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          18:18          So,

Speaker 4:          18:19          not to mention that it's actually not that crazy because your DNA is in your cells. So if your cells are taken out of you and they still grow, well, isn't that still you alive? It's of you, but it's clearly not you. And in the end it's going on and on. It's a funny middle space, that's for sure. Yeah. So here's what happened is Rebecca went off in search of Henrietta lacks. Every so often Debra would come along and sit with her as they interviewed, you know, anyone they could find friends, family, and eventually over many, many years, the picture does emerge

Speaker 1:          19:00          of who this woman was. She was born in, in Roanoke, 1920 Virginia and I think she was the 10th of the 11 children. But apparently she was the one that stood out. Everybody talked about her as just being, you know, she was the cat.

Speaker 4:          19:15          Oh my goodness. I don't think I could top her. This is CD Sturdivan Henrietta's cousin, and it was a beautiful girl. I was dating for myself, but hint, it was very pretty brand. Okay. And this is Henrietta sister, Gladys Knight, and complacent.

Speaker 1:          19:31          Everyone that they spoke with zeroed in on the same few points. Like first she was really meticulous about her nails, always painted them red. It's very deep red and second Henrietta just had this, she was very strength forthright, very Sassy, Mike herself. Now the unfortunate thing is that when it comes to her life, you know how she lived. There's not a ton of detail. Right?

Speaker 8:          19:58          Totally. So this is when she first went in with your cancer,

Speaker 1:          20:01          but in that hotel room, when the two of them, we're flipping through the medical records, they did start to get some detail. Okay, here's her autopsy, right about how she died. These are the things I want to take notes about. Was she in a lot of pain when she died? Yeah, this was the hardest thing. She was eventually in an unbelievable amount. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          20:20          Pain, complains of pain in the right lower quadrant,

Speaker 1:          20:22          wailing and crying and you know, moaning for the Lord, the helper and according to the records, doctors tried everything. Morphine, they injected a hundred percent alcohol straight into her spine.

Speaker 8:          20:33          Wow. I knew the pain spider, the alcohol injection last week. She would have these fits of pain

Speaker 4:          20:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          20:41          to spasms where this waves of pain would hit her and she would rise up out of the bed and thrash around. So they strapped it to the bed. And for sister, um, we, along with one of her friends,

Speaker 1:          20:54          you know, one of them would tighten the straps and the other one would put a pillow in her mouth so that she wouldn't bite her tongue

Speaker 8:          21:03          if I only just had the chair. So take care of her

Speaker 1:          21:09          now dealing with how her mother died was one thing, but the cells made it more complicated. Whatever parent, her mother was alive in these cells somehow. So if that's true, that left very big questions. And the first of them for Deborah was, how can Henrietta rest in peace if part of her with part of her soul is being, you know, shot up to the moon and injected with all these chemicals in a radiated and bombarded,

Speaker 8:          21:33          painful. No one, you know, that had her shells on the back of a donkey going to Turkey, you know, and the airplanes just going all over the world. Uh, uh, I just don't know.

Speaker 1:          21:48          Is she worried about them? She worried that it hurts her mother. When you infect the cells with Ebola, does somehow her mother feel the pain that comes with Ebola and had a scientist ever like sat down with her and yeah, I mean just explained to her like this is no, never, nothing cause it's spy. It just strikes me that it wouldn't be that hard to explain it. Like when you take cells out of a body, it's Kinda like when you cut your fingernail off it just doesn't, but your fingernail doesn't keep growing and living after you cut it off. It's a, it's really hard. There is no other example of some way that you can take something from someone's body and have it keep living and not have a person feel it

Speaker 10:         22:28          and all these worries says her Baga began to build and Deborah's mind and build and build

Speaker 3:          22:35          there came at this point. So we were at her cousin's house. This is her cousin Gary. She was broken out in hives and she was telling him all this stuff that she'd recently learned. You can almost hear it on the tape. She says to him,

Speaker 11:         22:47          when you get off the leaders there,

Speaker 3:          22:49          she can't carry the burden of these cells anymore. She can't.

Speaker 11:         22:52          Okay. I don't want to [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          22:56          and I had been started trying to talk her down and he was trying to talk her down

Speaker 11:         23:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          23:01          and then just out of nowhere he just started singing

Speaker 12:         23:11          [inaudible] Yo

Speaker 11:         23:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         23:19          Ooh. Gebo

Speaker 11:         23:24          [inaudible] I know those [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          23:27          and he started preaching thing that doctors came, that he held her head in his hands and we come to you tonight, the offer then the finish of our faith. And we thank you for being a wait mic. You make a path in the the middle. You called the mountains of skip leg rams and healed. We thank you today. Thank you all. Thank you for it. Thank you though. Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible] hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          24:09          [inaudible] great, great.

Speaker 3:          24:15          And she just relaxed know like him man. Huh? I feel like, Huh?

Speaker 1:          24:24          She didn't realize it then, but that night Debra was on the verge of a stroke

Speaker 3:          24:30          one to walk up into the building one wall. Okay. You mean? He said it's just [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          24:35          One of the most striking moments of this story is when the two of them

Speaker 3:          24:37          visit hospitality. Feel Fun. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:42          Deborah meets her mother's cells for the first time.

Speaker 3:          24:45          I shouldn't have, I'll show you that room and I can show you that itself

Speaker 1:          24:49          because the scientists had finally contacted her, Christophe Lynn Gower, the scientist who invited us into his lab to see the cells. He had projected them onto a screen. Don't be confused. They look green here.

Speaker 13:         28:09          This is exactly what she always dreamed of. But then just last year, something interesting happens. Interesting and troubling. So yeah. So March, 2013 this group of scientists from Germany sequenced the genome and publish it online where anyone can download it. You just click a button. I downloaded it. It was just there and they did not ask the family. Um, and my initial reaction when I saw this press coverage was they did what? Because within the Hilo genome there is also Henrietta's genome and some of that was pet. 50% of that was passed under her kids and 25% potentially her grandkids. But one of the things, so when they put out a press release, when this genome was sequenced and on it, it had a little, you know, frequently asked questions of the press might wander about and one of them was can you learn anything about Henrietta or her or her children from this genome?

Speaker 13:         28:57          And the answer was no, you can't learn anything about them. And I do and I believe that they, that they believe this, but this is a misconception. You can in fact learn about people. And in fact you cannot even hide people's private information if you try. And so one researcher took the genome and created essentially a report on Henry at his genes, you have x percent chance of bipolar disorder, alcoholism, obesity just has this huge range of things. And some of it is, yes, there's some real potential privacy violation like with the Alzheimer's genes and things like that. Bits of information about your family. But I will not tell you what this report that this dude May, right. Did he list all of these things you're describing? And he sent it to me. So I called the waxes and said, do you know, did you know that this, anything about this? And Rebecca had called, you know, they did not.

Speaker 8:          29:54          And it kind of bothered us because we're saying, okay, why wasn't a family involved with this decision making? That was Jerry lax. Jerry lacks why Henrietta lacks his granddaughter back in the 50s, you had him Riata lacks her cells were removed without her family's knowledge. Then you go in the 70s, my dad and his siblings, um, they took blood samples, used it for research. They didn't give consent. Then you come 2013 and you have Henrietta is that I felt as though it was her medical records being published publicly.

Speaker 13:         30:32          You know, their first question was, can you get them to take it down? And so we can figure out what it is, what it means. So I reached out to the scientists and said, the lacks family, you know, has asked that you take this down. And they replied immediately. They took it offline immediately. And then I contacted, um, Francis Collins, who's the head of the NIH. I also reached out to Kathy Hudson who used to run the genetics and public policy center at Hopkins and is now over at the NIH dealing with a lot of these issues. So I reached out to them and said, somebody needs to try to just help the maximum and get consent. Somebody needs to just go back, pretend like this is starting now and just do what probably should have happened in the first place.

Speaker 8:          31:13          NSA might've been like a couple of weeks after that, several weeks after that that we had a meeting with NIH and it was my mom, myself, my sister, my dad, my uncle, my brother David, my sister Kim, my cousin Ron, Rebecca Skloot. She was actually on a conference call.

Speaker 13:         31:29          All the NIH folks drove up to Baltimore.

Speaker 8:          31:31          We Google their names, Dr. Collins and candy. I said, and it was like, oh, we weren't cutting. He was excited. Like, okay. Yeah. We sitting in a room with the director, they all met just to listen to everybody, you know, listen to our concerns, listen to our questions, what can be done, what can't be done.

Speaker 13:         31:48          The lacks family asked about everything you could possibly imagine

Speaker 8:          31:51          when over, you know the information about Gino gene mapping, sequencing,

Speaker 13:         31:56          just the basic science of genome

Speaker 8:          31:57          to get a, a clear understanding of what the Geno met to science. We don't want to stop science but yet we don't want certain information to be just broadly available publicly.

Speaker 13:         32:10          So the laid out three options. One was we don't release any of them at all. And then there was a second option which was release it with no restrictions, just put it out there like the Germans did. And then there was a third option which was release it with restrictions. So the NIH would house it on their own servers and that in order to get access to it, you would have to send in an application at said, this is the research we're going to do. There would be a committee formed that was a group of scientists and the some members of the lacks family,

Speaker 8:          32:40          the Hilo Gino Committee,

Speaker 13:         32:40          one grands child and one great grandchild. My brother David and my cousin Veronica. And yeah, this is the option they picked. So, yeah, there's this committee and they just, um, a few weeks ago saw their first batch of applications and then the news hit and it was the first time that they were part of the news. So they, the third generation, the lacks family, like Jerry lacks was on MSNBC live doing an interview about this. And like, she, you know, she'd never done this before and you know, they were in every newspaper. I mean, it was everywhere.

Speaker 8:          33:12          Yeah. It's pretty exciting. Yeah. We are stepping into the spotlight. It's the grandchildren, the third and fourth generation of waxes. It's the great grandchildren. This is their story now. And that's, you know, the other thing that is an undercurrent where all this is Deborah is gone. She was the one who was just so forceful and so dedicated with getting the information out there about her mom.

Speaker 13:         33:35          And you know, when I look at the four years since the book came out, you know, there are a few moments that stand out as incredibly emotional ones for me having to do with Deborah. But this, the first meeting sitting on this speaker phone, listening to this meeting,

Speaker 8:          33:52          these high officials sitting at the table and in pay of sincere concern about our questions. If she could have said, what? What do I dream might someday happen? That would be what she would have described. [inaudible] I could just imagine her just sitting there and then she had just laughing, rocking back and forth, twiddling her talk on them,

Speaker 2:          34:12          her finger saying, Yay, just I'm absorbing all of this, this excitement.

Speaker 9:          34:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          34:33          before we close, I want to thank Rebecca Skloot for giving us her raw tapes. Her book, the mortal life of Henrietta lacks is truly spellbinding. You can get more information@radiolab.org sign up for our podcast there. radiolab.org.
