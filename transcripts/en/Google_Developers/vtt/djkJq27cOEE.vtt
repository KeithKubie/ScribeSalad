00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:12.614
FELIPE HOFFA: It's 4:00
PM in New York City,

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:15.486
and it's impossible
to get a cab.

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:17.666
Can we use data to fix this?

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.090
I'm Felipe Hoffa, a developer
advocate for Google.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.715
I am here to attend a
hackathon hosted by NYU

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:28.540
and the Rubin Center For
Transportation, and the TLC--

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.810
Taxi &amp; Limosine
Commission of New York--

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.560
where top data scientist
and researchers will

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.640
use data to solve this problem.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.375
How?

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:37.810
Well, we've got data.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.340
We got all the taxi trips.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.450
Chris Whong, how do you
manage to get this data?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.650
CHRIS WHONG: The Taxi
&amp; Limosine Commission

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.540
has an internal
data analysis team.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.680
And they released a tweet with
a visual of available taxis

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.070
by time of day.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100
And my response, as an
open data advocate, was,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.000
is the raw data available
so that everyone

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.710
can do this kind of analysis?

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.446
And the response on
Twitter was, it's not

00:00:57.446 --> 00:00:58.820
available for
download, but it is

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.590
available from a Freedom
of Information Law request.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.470
I sent in the form.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.790
And within a couple
hours, I got a response.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.270
So a couple days later, I
had 175 million taxi trips

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.270
in CSV format on a hard drive.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.170
FELIPE HOFFA: 175
million taxi trips.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.742
And then you managed to share
this data with the world?

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:16.450
CHRIS WHONG: People
started coming to me,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.226
to meetups that I went to
to actually get the data.

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:20.975
And there were so many
people messaging me

00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:23.760
that, finally, I was like,
it's time to put this online.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.094
And within 24 hours, it was
all over Google BigQuery.

00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:28.760
There was a really
awesome reddit thread

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.410
of people doing simple
analysis from BigQuery,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.420
and just slicing it
up, and figuring out

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.720
what's in the data.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.050
FELIPE HOFFA: So all the New
York City taxi trip for 2013,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.610
and now shared with BigQuery,
and anyone can easily

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.380
analyze them.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.210
So stay with me to see
what happens tomorrow,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.860
what solutions we find.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.783
And remember, at the end of
the day, someone will be fired.

00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:53.594
Wrong show, sorry.

00:01:53.594 --> 00:01:54.094
Traffic!

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.230
We are here at NYU Rudin
Center for Transportation.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.500
And today's a historical day.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.030
It's the first time the
TLC Taxi &amp; Limousine

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.470
Commission for New York
City is meeting and working

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.050
with citizens to take
a look at the data

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.590
that the TLC is
sharing with us today.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.330
We'll try to come
up with solutions,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.990
answers, discoveries,
and I can't

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.740
wait to see what happens today.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.310
RODNEY STILES: Today, we
shared all of 2014's trip

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.890
data with the additional
information added.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.980
And the way that we
did it is we loaded it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.620
onto Google Cloud
Storage and loaded it

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.340
into BigQuery, which is how
all the participants accessed

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.425
the information today.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:39.258
FELIPE HOFFA: Hello.

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:43.225
I'm here with Ben Wellington,
a visiting professor at Pratt

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:46.055
and also the data scientist
behind iPod New York.

00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:48.767
So when you were
looking at the--

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.850
BEN WELLINGTON: It's a
parking ticket data set up.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.000
And I wanted to find out how
much revenue in parking tickets

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.410
every fire hydrant in
New York City was making.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.230
So first, I mapped out the
top 250 grossing fire hydrants

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.505
in New York City, in
terms of ticket revenue.

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:05.880
And these were the two, by
the way, top grossing hydrants

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.770
in the entire city.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.150
And if you look at the amount
of revenue they were generating,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.341
they were generating
over $55,000 a year

00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:16.007
among the two hydrants
in parking ticket

00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:18.260
revenue for the last,
at least, five years.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.220
It turns out that it looked like
a bike lane between the hydrant

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.680
and the parking spot.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.805
So the car would pull in
and say to themself, well,

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:25.910
I'm not next to the hydrant.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.868
There's a bike lane
between me and the hydrant.

00:03:27.868 --> 00:03:31.990
A month later, they actually
repainted the parking spots

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.490
by adding these stripes here,
so they prevent future people

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.640
from making this mistake.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.000
So this is a time
when open data has

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.459
changed the infrastructure of
New York City in a small way.

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.875
But imagine this
happening locally

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.025
in everyone's neighborhood.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:47.094
If every person got
together and found

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.010
some of the issues in
their own neighborhoods,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.509
put their minds
together, we can all

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.440
start to make
changes very locally.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.565
JO RAUSEN: I think that
collaboration with citizens

00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:56.130
is really important,
because again,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.180
we come from the policy
from what we know,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.110
working with a lot of
industry stakeholders

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.360
that are very, very vocal.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.230
So it's really great,
when we finally

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.807
get citizen voices in here.

00:04:05.807 --> 00:04:07.640
These are things that
actually matter to me,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.520
and that are important
to me, and can

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.390
help us understand better
what their problems are,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.459
and just be a part
of that dialogue.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.250
JEFF FERZOCO: I am
excited to be here today

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.360
to help the TLC
better understand

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.904
exactly what is happening for
taxis between 4:00 and 6:00 PM.

00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:24.320
Ultimately, what
we're going to do

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.150
is take the data from
BigQuery, put it into redash,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.400
download it, bring
it into [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.320
and make a map of where
people get picked up.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.480
See where the cabs are
spending the most time,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.630
and look at them specifically
between 4:00 and 6:00 PM,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.140
because between
4:00 and 6:00 PM,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.140
cabs shift over from
one driver to another.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.300
And if a driver doesn't
have to do that shift,

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.230
it can take advantage of the
extra amount of people that

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.280
need service during rush hour.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.940
Data that is open means that
it's accessible by anyone.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.247
And having it be open means
that people can look at it.

00:04:56.247 --> 00:04:57.830
They can come up
with their own ideas.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.121
They can start making decisions
that make cities better

00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:00.940
places to live.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.070
And having open data be
open, and free, and available

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.765
makes that all
happen a lot faster.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.640
SARAH KAUFMAN: I think
the best part of today

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.570
was that we've been focusing
so much on the data leading up

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.240
to this event.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.390
We've been looking
at the data nonstop.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.120
And today, we've had five
taxi drivers here talking

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.460
about the issues that
they deal with every day.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.280
You can look at
data all day long,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.610
but you may not be able to
see it from the other side.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.360
ALLAN J. FROMBERG: It
wasn't just numbers.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.970
It wasn't just mathematics
in ones and zeroes.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.610
There was very much a
human factor present here.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.760
And the fact that we were
taking that approach to data,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.500
adding the human factor
in with the data,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.320
and putting it all in a
bowl, and it was better

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.890
than the sum of its parts.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.400
MALE SPEAKER: Right
now, the agency

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.010
is really taking a
hard look at our rules,

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.650
and figuring out what
makes sense today

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.280
and what doesn't with all
this emerging technology.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.930
And this is one
piece in the puzzle.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.520
This is another part
of that feedback loop

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.360
to take this information and
create a progressive policy,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.310
and so I think this
will definitely

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.699
be a part that process.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.490
BEN WELLINGTON: Our
agencies do great work,

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.823
but they have limited resources.

00:06:07.823 --> 00:06:09.850
So when they embrace
the open data movement,

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.219
it allows citizens
to give back and find

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:14.760
some of the maybe
issues or problems,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.750
and suggestions of how we
can run our cities better.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.458
SARAH KAUFMAN: With
hackathons next year,

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:21.610
I hope that we'll see these
kind of micro improvements using

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.595
civic hacking to resolve issues.

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:25.790
We have a lot of
smart New Yorkers,

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.900
a lot of people who can look
at data, look at numbers,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.570
and understand where the issues
are and suggest policy changes

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.580
that we might not
have seen otherwise.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.400
We had access to more than
160 million taxi trips taken

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.370
during 2014, and a glimpse into
the for the for-hire vehicles'

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.600
data, like Uber and
Lyft, confirming

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.330
that there are 20% less
taxi drivers on the road

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.610
when we most need them.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.660
We spent the day going
deeper into the data.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.820
Noel Hidalgo and
David Marulli looked

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.950
for patterns that may reveal
the best shift change locations.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.070
Arlene Ducao and Chris
Willard explored the potential

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.380
of having three shifts instead
of the traditional two.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.110
Jeff Ferzoco, Ben Wellington,
and [? Carson Kim ?] took

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.240
Uber's data to compare
their diver's behavior with

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.380
traditional taxis'.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.030
And Damon Wischik
went deeper into why

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.200
we have the current
shifts, and also,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.690
surfaced interesting
behaviors about tipping.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.990
Why would people tip more
after a New York Knicks loss?

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.830
There's a lot more to discover,
and it's your turn to dig in.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.940
Thank you for joining us.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.610
This was an amazing day to see
how citizens, taxi drivers,

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.100
academia, government can come up
together and look for solutions

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.890
using data, using open data, got
and the right tools to do it.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.370
That's it for today.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.170
Make sure to follow us for
the next Big Data Story.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.110
I'm Felipe Hoffa.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.440
Goodbye.
