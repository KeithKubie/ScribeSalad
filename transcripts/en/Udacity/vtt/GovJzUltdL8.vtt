00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
So I've left the most interesting and challenging part of this for you to

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.460
finish as a quiz, and that's how to compute the new rank based on the values

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.710
of the previous iteration, which are now stored in the variable ranks.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.000
We want to up compute the new rank based on all the pages that link to this one,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.369
and if you think about the graph structure and how to go through the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.448
nodes in the graph,

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.800
I think you can figure out how to do this.
