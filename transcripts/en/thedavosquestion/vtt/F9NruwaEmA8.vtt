&gt;&gt; My name is James Kondo, I'm President of
Health Policy Institute from

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.130
Japan.
I think that India is already in Asia and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.150
destined to be a superpower.
I think one of the things that is most exciting

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.440
about what is the
diversity, but also the demographic that's

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.020
just different, for example,
from China, which is aging almost as much

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.650
as Japan, my own country, is.
There's going to be a tremendous, I think,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.000
demographic dividend for
India as the number of youth segment will

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.879
likely be the largest middle
market in the world, really creating a lot

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.359
of services for the middle
class, but, I believe, experimental ground

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.409
for creating a new actions
for the population in the world rolled out.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:56.729
I do think that India is destined to be a
superpower.

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:57.089
Thank you.
