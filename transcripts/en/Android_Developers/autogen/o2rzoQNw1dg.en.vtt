 I wanted to ask you for yourself, and I shot it here. 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.089
 I liked it so much that I could communicate directly with the kids in the development zone. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.440
 You really showed me that there's a game in motion. 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:50.799

 Gentlemen, I really happened to have three moderately obvious ways to write my lungs 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.799
 I'm doing it again. 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.250
 I was just looking at the part that I think is really ours

 Thank you very much to the people in Google who provided this place. 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.580

 Based on the things that you have told us, we will be ready to launch again next week. 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.580

 Now, the Korean game ecosystem is in crisis because of lack of diversity and polarization. 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.850
 The festival, which played the song, is a primer that can overcome this crisis. 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.460
 I think it is the same event.
