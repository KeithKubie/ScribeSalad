00:00:00.614 --> 00:00:02.851
- [Narrator] We're told that
the double number line shows

00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:05.934
that five pounds of avocados cost $9.

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:10.452
And so what is going on here
with this double number line?

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:14.640
This shows how as we increase
the number of avocados,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.583
how the cost increases.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:19.875
So for example, when we have
zero pounds of avocados,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.763
it costs us $0.

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:24.492
When we have five pounds of avocados,

00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:25.742
it costs us $9.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.537
And so, if you look at
any point over here,

00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:30.855
let's say you look right over here.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.910
This would be, let's
see, this is one, right?

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.910
This is one, two, three, four, five.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.512
If you look at one, this
point on the cost number line

00:00:38.512 --> 00:00:43.131
would tell you how much one
pound of avocado would cost.

00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:45.632
Two pounds of avocados,
how much would that cost?

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:48.590
You would look at this second
number line right over there.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.923
So they ask us, based on the ratio shown

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:57.257
in the double number
line, what is the cost

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.424
for one pound of avocados?

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:02.240
So pause the video and think about it.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.152
Remember, one pound of avocados
on this top number line,

00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:06.633
we look at this second number line,

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.049
the cost would be right over here.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.132
What is this going to be?

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.380
Well, we could just set it up as a ratio.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.146
The ratio of pounds of avocados to cost

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:20.621
is going to be, let me
do this in some colors.

00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:23.704
So if I have five pounds of avocados,

00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:27.108
it is going to cost me $9.

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:31.490
So the ratio of pounds to
dollars is five to nine.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.111
So if I were to have one pound of avocado,

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:37.358
one pound of avocado,

00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:42.103
I have divided by five to
get one pound of avocado.

00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:44.803
I would have to do the
same thing for the cost.

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:47.136
So if I divide nine by five,

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.523
this is going to be nine fifths dollars.

00:01:52.523 --> 00:01:55.581
Nine fifths dollars would
be the cost of one pound.

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.567
Well, nine fifths isn't
always the most natural way

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.930
to write money, so you
can view this nine fifths

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.017
is equal to one and four fifths,

00:02:05.017 --> 00:02:07.708
which is equal to one and eight 10ths,

00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:09.934
which is equal to 1.8,

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:12.517
or you could say this is $1.80.

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:15.750
So if you were to go onto
this double number line,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.258
the cost of one pound of avocado,

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:21.729
this point right over here would be $1.80.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.199
If you said two pounds of avocados,

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.819
well, now you would double it.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.736
So this would be $3.60,

00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:30.043
and you would go on and on and on

00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:33.618
all the way until you got to $9 here.

00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:35.701
Let's do another example.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.604
So here, we are told the
double number line shows

00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:44.646
how many model trains
Irene can build in a week.

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:47.802
So we can see, in zero weeks
she can't build any trains,

00:02:47.802 --> 00:02:50.978
but in one week she can build nine trains.

00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:53.865
And they asked us, which
table represents the rate

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:56.448
of Irene building model trains?

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:00.949
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.160
So once again, every week
she can build nine trains.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.931
So one way to think about it is

00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:08.568
the ratio of week to trains

00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:10.256
would be one

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.089
to nine.

00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:13.455
So let's see.

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:15.925
If I look at this table, I
just wanna see where the ratio

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:19.546
between weeks to trains
stays at one to nine.

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:23.330
So five to 45, that is still one to nine.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.395
To go from one to five,
I've multiplied by five.

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:32.218
And then to go to nine to 45,
I've also multiplied by five.

00:03:32.218 --> 00:03:34.423
So this one checks out.

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:38.961
And another way to think about
it, is 45 is nine times five.

00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:40.782
So nine times.

00:03:40.782 --> 00:03:42.946
That might be an easier
way to think about it.

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:46.307
Over here, 12 to 108, that's, once again,

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:48.057
12 times nine is 108.

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:50.908
And then 26 to 234.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.332
Let's see, 26 times 10
would be 260, minus 26.

00:03:56.332 --> 00:03:58.126
Yeah, it would be 234.

00:03:58.126 --> 00:03:59.482
So this is nine times.

00:03:59.482 --> 00:04:02.199
So in all of these cases,
the ratio of trains

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.130
or the ratio of weeks to
trains is one to nine.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.938
So this one is looking good,
so I'll just circle that in.

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:11.188
But let's just make sure
that this one doesn't work.

00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:15.960
Over here, the ratio of weeks
to trains is nine to one,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.989
not one to nine.

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.761
The train should be nine times the weeks,

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.106
while here the weeks is
nine times the train.

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:24.378
So just looking at that first one,

00:04:24.378 --> 00:04:28.002
we know that this is
not going to work out.

00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:30.169
Let's do one last example.

00:04:31.447 --> 00:04:35.217
The double number line shows
how many snowballs Jacob

00:04:35.217 --> 00:04:37.719
and his friends can make in one minute.

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.137
No minutes, they can make zero snowballs.

00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:42.328
In one minute, they can make 12.

00:04:42.328 --> 00:04:44.699
Complete the table to
show the same information

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.108
as the double number line.

00:04:47.108 --> 00:04:48.202
So once again, pause this video

00:04:48.202 --> 00:04:50.711
and see if you can work this out.

00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:53.339
Well, we can think about it as a ratio.

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:55.776
The ratio of minutes

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:57.943
to snowballs is one to 12.

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:02.666
So minutes to snowballs is one to 12.

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:05.438
Or another way to think about it is,

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:09.637
the snowballs is going to
be 12 times the minutes.

00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:12.763
And so over here, if I have 12 snowballs,

00:05:12.763 --> 00:05:16.107
we already know that's
going to be one minute.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:19.390
If I have 48 snowballs,
let's just think about it.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.540
To go from 12 to 48 you
have to multiply by four.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.991
So you have four times as many snowballs,

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:27.969
it's gonna take you four
times as many minutes.

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.923
And then if you go to five,
to go from one to five

00:05:30.923 --> 00:05:34.479
you multiply by five, so
you're gonna have five times

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.083
as many snowballs as you
would be able to make

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:37.987
in one minute.

00:05:37.987 --> 00:05:41.369
So five times 12 is 60, and we're done.

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:45.202
It could be one to 12,
four to 48, five to 60.

00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:50.703
For every five minutes,
you can make 60 snowballs,

00:05:50.703 --> 00:05:52.243
or they make 60 snowballs.
