1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,810
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W and y.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,990
S e

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,300
n n p r phone. Oh, you know what,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,820
will you forgive me if I actually
leave my phone on vibrate because, uh,

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,200
my wife is pregnant and due
literally really any day.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,550
No kidding. If this vibrates, I might
ruin your radio program, but no,

7
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:27,780
it's fine. It's all worse.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,080
So recently I had a conversation
with this Guy Josh for,

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,080
he's a journalist science journalist and
he told me about something that's been

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,920
obsessing him recently. This
very odd experiment. Well, okay,

11
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:42,240
so this is uh, one of the longest
running science experiments of all time.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,800
The pitch drop experiment.
You can actually see it
online. How do I get to it?

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,540
I had just started her pitch
drop, pitch drop. So a,

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,420
you can also go radiolab.org
we have got the live feed, uh,

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,630
right there on the website and what you
will see is this funnel list of black

16
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:59,370
stuff in it. And then, uh,

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,630
descending from the stem of the funnel
is this little tendrils of this black

18
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,140
stuff.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,140
And at the end of that tendril as a little
teardrop of this black stuff that's,

20
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:12,570
it doesn't move, do anything.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,380
But according to Josh, sure. Pitch
drop junkies all over the world.

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,990
People who are just, I've got this
open in the background on their,

23
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,670
on their web browser and he says they
all just sit there watching and waiting.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,910
And that's the thing. Once you
understand what's going on here,

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,430
you kind of can't look away. Okay.

26
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,850
So here's what happened
in 1927 there is this guy,

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,330
Thomas Cornell who is teaching physics
at the University of Queensland and in

28
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,650
Australia and he's trying to
show his students that, um,

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,710
well I guess that things aren't
always what they seem. Okay. Uh,

30
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,310
and so he takes a chunk of this material
and called pitch. What's pitch? Okay,

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,550
so pitch is a natural substance. In fact,
this is actually really the question.

32
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:57,300
What is pitch? Well, what does it
look like? It's like, is it gooey? No,

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,980
that's the thing. It's like a rock.

34
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,800
You can break it with a hammer and it
shatters into a million little pieces,

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,360
but it's not a rock.

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,040
It's a viscoelastic polymer
fisco elastic polymer,

37
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,850
which means that over many,
many, many, many years,

38
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,410
it moves really the,

39
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:18,780
what he did was he melted a handful of
pitch and poured it into a glass funnel

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,240
and once it did properly settled,

41
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,320
he snipped the bottom
of the funnel and waited

42
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,330
for what? Well, for it to drip.

43
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,610
You mean drip like a faucet would
drip? Yeah, but much, much more slowly.

44
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,580
So 1930 Pluto is discovered.

45
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,430
Bonnie and Clyde mean phone love going
to crimes where you get killed by the

46
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:45,850
police. 31 the empire state
building is finished. It'll drip.

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,900
1933 the Nazis build their
first concentration camp
prohibition and still hasn't

48
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:53,450
driven five Amelia Earhart fly solo
across the Pacific Ocean. Are you kidding?

49
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,110
No drip. 1936 5 million barrels of
cement turning to the Hoover dam.

50
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,490
No drift for eight years. This rock
is slowly, slowly, slowly stretching.

51
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,660
He's into this dangling drop
and then suddenly one day,

52
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,780
eight years after he poured the damn
thing into the funnel and the 10th of a

53
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,900
second, the blink of an eye.

54
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,970
Oh, the pitch breaks.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,450
Nobody's ever actually seen
this happen. I mean it's never,

56
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,610
there's drop has never dripped. No, no.

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,870
The drop is gripped eight times and we're
all due for the ninth drop to happen

58
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,430
any day now. So wait,
why haven't they seen it?

59
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,910
So imagine a a science experiment, right?

60
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,150
Where the critical data that you want to
gather happens in one 10th of a second

61
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,040
every 10 to 12 years.

62
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,920
It is really hard to be there
at that critical moment. Yes.

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,760
Yeah. This fellow professor John Mains,

64
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,940
then he's been watching it religiously
since January of 1961 for 50 years.

65
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,820
I am still waiting to see miss pitch
drop just at a suspense or is there some

66
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,300
question here? Well
first of all, well, okay,

67
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,340
the question is moment when you this
ever elongating droplet gives way.

68
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,230
What happened if you've got the drop
itself hilled by four little fibers,

69
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,360
call them fibers. What breaks
first? How does it break?

70
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,460
And there are lots of people who like me,

71
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,630
are waiting to see whether we can capture
that moment and see the way in which

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,800
from a mechanical point of view it becomes
imperative that the dropped in fall,

73
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,700
so 1962 mainstay and Mr.

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,650
Drop in 62 August,

75
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,610
1971 April of 1979 tat one
he looked at on a Friday.

76
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:49,140
I knew it was close and thought, well
something might happen over the weekend.

77
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,190
Came in on a Saturday, Saturday
evening, checked to pitch job,

78
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:53,821
nothing happening.

79
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:57,780
I'm going home and by the time I came
in very early on the Monday morning,

80
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,970
not having gone in on
Sunday, it had fallen.

81
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Then 1988 he standing right there
and I decided I need to cover teams.

82
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,740
Something like that. Walked
away, came back, oh no.

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,660
And low and behold he thinks he may have
missed it by as little as 15 minutes

84
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,290
had dropped. Now you take your tee and
throw it against the wall and rage. Yes.

85
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,300
Well, yes.

86
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:25,180
One becomes a bit philosophical
about this and I just,

87
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
oh well let,

88
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,460
let's be patient the next time
he installed the camera and,

89
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,820
and then, and then 28 November,

90
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,200
2000 is what happened.

91
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:41,790
Then the time I was over on the other
side of the world in London gets an email

92
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,410
saying, professor this [inaudible] drop
looking as though it might fall in time.

93
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,720
We've been waiting 10 years
for this. It's about to happen.

94
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,310
Cause it was like I said, don't worry,
we've got it covered. Got a camera on it.

95
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,910
I'll be able to see exactly what
happened when I get back to Australia.

96
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,570
The next email said, well it's dropped.

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,460
Wow.

98
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,800
Later that day, do you professor
mains then I've got bad news.

99
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,750
Unfortunately you will not be able to
see this because the system failed.

100
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,950
The camera went out, the camera went
out. We don't have this on record.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,780
Come on. So that was one of
my satisfied, I might say. Uh,

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,080
but right now the pitch is getting
ready to give birth to another drop.

103
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,660
And this time there are three
cameras, three webcams on there.

104
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,010
And this is what Josh was showing
me on the Internet. This ling little

105
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,470
almost that all is people are watching
people from China, South America.

106
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,740
You knew what people were helping the
north of Canada. Everybody's waiting.

107
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:46,890
Everybody wants to be the
person who sees the pitch fo

108
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,190
and got to admit, I've been
checking this thing online.

109
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,210
Like were you like watching
grass grow? I don't know. It's,

110
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:58,310
I think it's more than
suspect. I think that this is,

111
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,920
it's about timescale is what it's about.

112
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,870
We don't really have that
many opportunities to interact
with things that happen

113
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,550
on these two very, very different
timescales simultaneously.

114
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,630
Huh? Do you see what he means? Yeah.

115
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,510
Cause you know you're
in this funny situation.

116
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,870
You wait slower than you know how for
something to take place that's faster than

117
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,150
you can, you know, catch. Exactly.

118
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,150
So you're playing at the very
edges of what you know how to do,

119
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,290
but not if you catch it,

120
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,740
then you get this glimpse into this
world that's usually unknowable.

121
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,693
Exactly.

122
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,000
So for the next hour,

123
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,160
we're going to mess around with
this idea because you know,

124
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,830
we're humans and we live in a human scale,

125
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,320
but we've got a bunch of stories
that are gonna ask us to stretch

126
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,160
that scale to the breaking
point. Yeah, I'm Jad Abumrad.

127
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,380
I'm Robert Krulwich today on radio lab

128
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,750
speed wait,

129
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:58,100
things keep getting faster and then
faster again and then faster and faster,

130
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,610
faster,

131
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,590
faster and faster and faster and faster
and path until we get to the fastest

132
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:05,300
thing in the universe and stop

133
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,330
bit cold. But before we do that,

134
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,253
quick update,

135
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,980
some happy news and a bit of sad news
about that pitch drop experiment.

136
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,200
First up, the drop finally dripped
and it was caught on camera this time.

137
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,830
And you can uh, watch that moment in time

138
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,910
lapse@radiolab.org. Now the sad news, uh,

139
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,060
professor mainstone missed it again
after 52 years of watching over that tar

140
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,030
field beaker waiting,

141
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,780
he died without ever
actually seeing a drop fall.

142
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,800
But on the bright side, I guess
the experiment is still going.

143
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:48,010
The 10th drop is expected to
fall sometime in the next 14.

144
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,290
So in honor of him,

145
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,410
keep an eye on that live feed and a
few supervision. You might just, you,

146
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,410
okay. So let's set the baselines
here. How fast are our we,

147
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,750
you mean like how fast we run? I mean,

148
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,810
how fast do we interact with
the world around us? Uh,

149
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,740
how fast do we taste things? How fast
do we feel something? See something.

150
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:14,850
Respond. Hello? Oh, hello. Hey there.
Hey, how do we sound? That sounds better.

151
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,670
Much better. Excellent.
That's Carl Zimmer of course,

152
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,360
science writer regular around here. And
he told us that question you just asked.

153
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,480
How fast do people, humans
processed the world?

154
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,720
That question popped up in a really big
way around 1850 with the invention of

155
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,980
the telegraph because suddenly you
could send a message across the country

156
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,120
almost instantly.

157
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,440
If you're in New York and you
want to send a message to Chicago,

158
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,450
money stopped.

159
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:47,130
It's gonna take about a quarter of a
second for that message to get there.

160
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,230
That's 790 miles in a quarter. Second.

161
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,390
Now that's really fast. In
fact, if you do the math,

162
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,770
790 times,

163
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:03,090
four times 60 times 60 it's
11 million miles an hour.

164
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,770
That's amazingly fast. So fast.

165
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,020
In fact that some people when
they first used the telegraph,

166
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,850
they just refuse to
believe that it was real.

167
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,600
Cause in 1850 you're doing oh
35 40 miles an hour on a horse.

168
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,740
60 maybe on a steam engine up to
80 you're not living too fast.

169
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,180
But more importantly for our story, the
Telegraph got people thinking about us,

170
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:22,530
about our bodies, right?

171
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,000
Cause you know nerves and telegraph
wires are remarkably similar.

172
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,110
Nerves are long and skinny. They carry
electricity from one place to another,

173
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:34,440
just like a telegraph wires. So
naturally people wanted to know,

174
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:37,590
well if telegraph wires can
do millions of miles an hour,

175
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:41,280
well what about our nerves?
How fast are they? Exactly.

176
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,910
And so one day a German
guy biologist named

177
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,110
Herman von Helmholtz took a frog cause
their neurons are kind of like ours.

178
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,780
And basically what he did was he,

179
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,960
he hooked some wires up to one of
the frogs muscles. Now, this was,

180
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,400
I should tell you a dead frog,

181
00:10:56,401 --> 00:11:01,110
but he sent an electrical jolt through
the muscle and then using a very fancy

182
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,110
timer, he was able to determine, yeah,

183
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:08,111
the signal was going down the length
of the a frog muscle at a speed of 27

184
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:12,940
meters per second. What does that
in miles per hour per se. Um,

185
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,710
let's see. I can, uh, Google,
actually it's, I love Google.

186
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,750
Um, 27 meters per second is 60.3,
nine, seven three miles per hour.

187
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,690
16.3 miles per hour. Wait, this is a
frog. Is this the same speed? Not Yes.

188
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,300
60 miles an hour. That
seems so slow. Yeah.

189
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,960
What's the name of the Jamaican
runner? The fastest guy in the world.

190
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,820
Hussein bolt. Usain bolt.

191
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,780
So it was saying bolt is running at half
the speed of his nervous system. Okay.

192
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,270
But, but, but in bear
mind actually, I mean, uh,

193
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,310
there's a big range of speeds of your
neurons and actually Hussein bald is much

194
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:50,560
faster than some of your neurons. I mean,

195
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,040
there are some neurons that only go about
a mile an hour. Which ones are those?

196
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,310
Ironically, some of them are from
the reward centers of your brain.

197
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,040
Chocolate travels slowly. Yeah, relatively
slowly. What about pain? I mean,

198
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,540
that would, that would be fast.
I imagined. Yeah, you'd think so.

199
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:08,950
But pain actually runs kind of
slowly. I was surprised to learn.

200
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,520
He says it can be as slow as 1.3
miles an hour. Wait a second.

201
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:16,480
So if I put my hand near a
candle and then I go, ouch.

202
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,580
Shouldn't that happen very fast? Look,
I mean, if you were like 70 miles tall,

203
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,090
this might be a problem.
Okay. But still, I mean,

204
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,380
what if we just take a really ordinary
example like Robert Looking at the desk

205
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,550
in front of him and grabbing that
pen? What's involved? Yeah. Well,

206
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:36,970
I mean you just essentially need
to kind of walk through this brain.

207
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,650
[inaudible] you start
at the I. Okay. So, uh,

208
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,840
the eye takes the light that's
reflected off the [inaudible].

209
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Penn turns it into a little electrical
signal and then sends that deep into the

210
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,221
middle of the brain,

211
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:55,540
takes a couple of hundred 72nd bounces
around for a bit and then within few

212
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,130
more, hundreds of a second.

213
00:12:57,131 --> 00:13:01,600
The signal has made it all the way back
to the rear end of the brain where you

214
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:05,140
start processing vision. But this
is just the beginning right now.

215
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:06,640
You've got to like figure
out what you're seeing.

216
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,050
So our joke is off again this time toward
the middle of the brain and then down

217
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:14,770
toward the bottom to these other
regions that start to decode the signal,

218
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,370
the first visual regions
called v one next up,

219
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,110
v two before and so on, and
they're going to sharpen the image,

220
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,350
make out contrast edges,

221
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,390
and then the electricity goes back
towards the front of the brain after,

222
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,700
let's see, another 10th of a second or so.

223
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,740
We finally get to a place where we think,

224
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,340
oh, that's a pen we haven't gotten you to.

225
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,300
I want it exactly

226
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,730
for that to happen,

227
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,000
the electricity has to jump from one part
of the front of the brain to another.

228
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:51,200
And another before you can finally say,
that's a nice pen. I could use a pen

229
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,210
and we're still not done, you know,

230
00:13:56,211 --> 00:14:00,860
then you then then little jolt heads
nor to sort of the top of your brain.

231
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:01,220
So we've,

232
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,730
we've gone from the your eyes to the
back of your brain around up to the front

233
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:05,271
of your brain again.

234
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:09,950
And now we're up to the top of your
head where you set up motor commands

235
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,040
and then you can grab the pen. Christ.

236
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,050
So I mean

237
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,690
you add all this up and what
are we talking about here?

238
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,250
About a quarter of a second quarter
of a say feels like one month later,

239
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,160
rubber town begin slowly to move toward.
The object is design quarter of a size.

240
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,550
So that's the same amount of time.

241
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:34,540
It takes a telegraph to send a message
from New York to Chicago. Yeah.

242
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,990
So your eyes, your hand,
New York, Chicago. Oh Man.

243
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,920
The sad truth has Carl, is
that our neurons, when it
comes to communicating and,

244
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:47,990
and sending signals on your answer,
they're terrible actually. I mean,

245
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:50,600
compared to our, you
know, broadband networks,

246
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,390
particularly when one neuron
bumps into the next one,

247
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,600
there's actually a little space between
them. So the signal to get across,

248
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,733
it's got jump

249
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,500
and then jump to the next
one and jump and then jumped.

250
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,880
It's Kinda like doing
hurdles. It's not smooth.

251
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,910
And the spooky part about
this slowness says, Carl,

252
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,490
the deeper thought here is
that if you think about it,

253
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:17,780
because we have this built in delay
in processing the outside world,

254
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,860
everything that I'm
experiencing already happened.

255
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,340
[inaudible]

256
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,790
you know how like you look out
at the stars and you think, oh,

257
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,990
that light's been traveling for
thousands, millions of years to get to me.

258
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:35,080
And what's happening on that star to the
planet around that star right now does

259
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,933
even still exist.

260
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,970
Um, you can say that about
everything around you

261
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,680
because I mean by the time that you
become aware of something in front of you,

262
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,960
it's been sitting there for
awhile, relatively speaking.

263
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,670
I'm stuck in the past, but it's, it sounds
like if you want to be in the moment,

264
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,830
then what you do is you stare up at the
sun and you let the light just be light

265
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,620
entering your eyes and you don't
think anything about the light.

266
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:08,340
You don't try and comprehend the
light. You just let the light be light.

267
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,980
And that's as close as you're
going to get to now. Yeah.

268
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,970
Well you're looking at old light. Uh, but

269
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,880
yeah, it's eight minutes.

270
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,350
Like even if you switch, you know,

271
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:22,590
even if you switch on the light and you're
looking at the light bulb across the

272
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:26,490
room, it's old light because
it had to go from your eyes,

273
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,920
through your brain to you to be
aware that there was light there.

274
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,110
So what I would suggest is that you close
your eyes and you stop thinking about,

275
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,620
you know,

276
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,620
the chair you're sitting in and just
focus on your own thoughts because that's

277
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:43,080
the fastest stuff you've
got to, it's right there.

278
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,180
You don't have to wait for it to
be deliberate into your brain.

279
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:46,080
It's already in your brain.

280
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,290
So I think your thoughts are the
fastest things that you can experience.

281
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,170
So my fastest thought that
I can ever have is okay,

282
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,010
where I'm my key.

283
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,800
You've got to have faster thoughts
than that with the faster one.

284
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,670
This is an interesting question though.
I think it would be non narrative.

285
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,190
I don't think it can be a
keys or something. I think
it would just be like a,

286
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,560
ah, someone has thought about this.
What? It wasn't me because I had no idea.

287
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,280
Don't you think somebody has an answer
for us on this? Uh, hello. Hello. Hello.

288
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,760
In fact, we found a guy, his name
is Seth Horowitz. I am the a,

289
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,160
he's a neuroscientist, author
of the Universal Sense.

290
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:24,330
How hearing shapes the mind.
So we were talking, uh, with,

291
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,500
and we ran set through
the question, you know,

292
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,310
if we're all trapped in the past by
the slowness of our nervous system,

293
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:34,160
what would be the most present the
most in the now that we could be? Well,

294
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,120
if you are any actually disagreed
with Carl's gas. He said,

295
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,780
even if you think the simplest thought
that it is possible to think it's

296
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:44,620
probably still going to be on the order
of a quarter of a second half second.

297
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,040
Oh Man. You have to get away from
the conscious brain. No thinking,

298
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,360
no seeing hearing is the fastest
sense because mechanical,

299
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,540
it normally operates on the millisecond
range. Thousandth of a second,

300
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,900
a sudden loud noise activates a very
specialized circuit from your ear to your

301
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:04,470
spinal neurons. You mean and bypasses the
brain? Yeah, it's the startle circuit.

302
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,460
If you suddenly hear a loud
noise within 50 milliseconds,

303
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,240
50 thousands of a second, so you
talking 20 times faster than cognition,

304
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,980
your body jumps. We'll begin
the release of adrenaline.

305
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,790
No consciousness involved. It's five
neurons and it takes 50 milliseconds,

306
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,120
50 milliseconds. So you're
already getting into a faster,

307
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,100
much faster paradigm by using sound.

308
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,630
So if we're going to jilt ourselves
as close to the president as possible,

309
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,270
then we'd have to play a
really loud noise, right? Like,

310
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,220
okay,

311
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,350
wait for it. This.

312
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,710
I know. That was annoying. I'm
no, I know. But look, thing we do,

313
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:53,270
we just did together. We were all in the
moment, in the present tense together.

314
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:56,690
Not Quite, not as we now understand
that we were just shy just to,

315
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,630
it's he bits shy of the moment time.

316
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,480
If I spoke fast enough for me
to say thank you to Carl Zimmer,

317
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:04,430
they could have said hardwoods
and now I've got to break.

318
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,300
There's no way you could even form the
thug. Thank you. In 50 milliseconds.

319
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,900
But I tell you what, in this
next, in this next segment,

320
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,610
we're going to make 50 milliseconds
feel like 50 years. Oh, that's a really,

321
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,300
really nice promo there.
That'll make everybody lean in.

322
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,790
That's actually a terrible like there

323
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,223
[inaudible]

324
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,800

I remember Krulwich.

363
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:13,800
This is Radiolab and bead is
our subject. Keep me doing it.

364
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,180
That's what this whole
next segment is about. See,

365
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:19,340
I had it in my bones just to set it up a,

366
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:23,150
I got this idea from my friend Andrew's
Ali, who is a fantastic writer,

367
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,870
wrote the book, uh, resilience. Why
things bounce back. We were at a diner.

368
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,370
I was telling him about
this show and he says,

369
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:31,010
you should do something about
the stock market. And I was like,

370
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm the last person should do is in the
most dogmatic. He's like, no, no, no,

371
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,840
no. Forget everything you think you
know about the stock market. Um,

372
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,710
most of us, when we think
about stock markets,

373
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:46,460
if you just close your eyes and you
think about the financial world,

374
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:47,270
what you imagined,

375
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:52,270
there's a bunch of people in a room
and they're all wearing funny colored

376
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:54,050
jackets and they're
shouting at each other and

377
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,960
waiving bits of Pavia,
right? 70, this kind of

378
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,370
Rawkus Watson, it's white
gay people screaming,

379
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:09,020
trying to figure out what a crisis, and
we'll have this sort of iconography,

380
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:13,400
this cultural iconography of
how the financial system works.

381
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,720
That is in large part complete

382
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,940
lead divorced from reality because
he told me, here's my first surprise,

383
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:26,941
that somewhere between 50 and 70 plus
percent of all the trades that happen on

384
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:31,390
what we think of as Wall Street are not
executed by a human being as a result of

385
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:32,320
a human decision.

386
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,710
They're actually executed by an algorithm
at a speed rate and scale that is

387
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,840
beyond our comprehension.

388
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,010
So I decided I would try and
comprehend this new world that he was

389
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,581
describing.

390
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:51,581
And since this is a subject matter
that generally makes me frightened,

391
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,490
frankly, I decided to call up David
Kestenbaum from planet money. Hey Jed.

392
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,180
Hello? V David Casto. Indeed
there could be more than one.

393
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,930
They probably are on Twitter. In any
case, it did not click for either of us.

394
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:07,590
Just how fast, how humanly
fast trading had gotten. Yeah.

395
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,500
Until we visited this firm called trade
works. Hi David. Nice to meet you David.

396
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,510
So we go into this little
building in New Jersey.

397
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:17,750
It looks like it's a startup or
something and uh, this guy says,

398
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,120
hello, my name is Mike Dollar. I'm the
chief technology officer of trademarks.

399
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,820
And Mike over here sat
us down at this computer.

400
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:28,821
Opened up would be this little program
that logs exactly what is going on at the

401
00:24:28,921 --> 00:24:33,630
market representation of insanely
specific times. You could pick a stock.

402
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,070
Um, we could look at,
um, Yahoo for example.

403
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,000
We can literally pick some time
of day that we're interested in.

404
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,470
What time is this? So it's what time?

405
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,560
So this is at 1135 26.979 seconds.

406
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,620
And in fact,

407
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,380
that's not enough precision for us
because we really deal in micro seconds.

408
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,150
That would be millions of a second. So
we have another way of measuring time,

409
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:03,480
which is the number of microseconds
since midnight of the previous day.

410
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,320
Can you read that? 407
number. Sure. 41 billion.

411
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:12,180
729,979,559 microsecond since midnight.

412
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,980
Wow. So do you always have lunch at like

413
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,840
2,000,305,000 without,
that'd be really early.

414
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:23,680
[inaudible]

415
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,460
hi. How many trays do you do in a day?

416
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,370
Um, I think it depends a lot. Uh,

417
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,920
a high frequency trader might
do thousand trades in a minute.

418
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,640
[inaudible]

419
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,040
it's about that tempo, but
it's kind of very bursty

420
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,120
now what happens during those
bursts is a bit of a mystery.

421
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,030
It's very hard to see what's
going on. Often says, Andrew,

422
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:52,200
it's the computers testing the market
testing to see if they can find a nibble

423
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,280
on the other side.

424
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,700
They'll fire out a bunch of buy and sell
orders and then when another computer

425
00:25:56,701 --> 00:26:00,960
bites on one, they'll quickly cancel
the ones that didn't stick. Nope. Sorry.

426
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,320
Didn't want to do that. And they're doing
this on a microsecond basis by, nope,

427
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,430
sorry, sal. Nope, nope, nope,
nope. Forget about that by na,

428
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,520
and they create huge volumes
of transactions that just
disappear into the ether.

429
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,750
There are some computer
algorithms he says,

430
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:20,220
whose whole job is to combat other
algorithms, fake them out. For example,

431
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:24,570
we just a very good example, it
happened about a month ago in craft.

432
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,480
That's Eric Han. Sandra. He tracks
high frequency trading for the,

433
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,780
from Nanux craft like Kraft
cheese crap. Yes. He says,

434
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:33,030
what they saw was this
algorithm jumping in the market,

435
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:35,490
buy up a bunch of craft
which jam the price up,

436
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,580
which allowed that algorithm to sell
at much higher prices to 'em the other

437
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:44,520
algorithms and we calculate
it out. It costs them 200,000

438
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,570
to push the price up,

439
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,840
but they were able to sell about 900,000
of stock and netting again of of over

440
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,850
half a million dollars
in the matter of seconds.

441
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,120
Now to put that in context,
back in the day, you know,

442
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,780
20 years ago when the humans still ran
the trading pits [inaudible] according to

443
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:08,960
this guy, I'm Larry Tab, founder
and CEO of the TAC group.

444
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,080
The average time that it took to execute
a trade was around 1112 seconds back

445
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:19,631
then and when you ask people how did we
get from 11 or 12 seconds to forty one

446
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:22,430
million seven hundred twenty nine million
nine hundred seventy nine thousand

447
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,260
five hundred fifty one like a second.
Since we like phrases like that,

448
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,830
the answer is kind of surprising, but
I'll just start with the obvious part.

449
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,320
At least the part that's obvious
to people who work in finance.

450
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,193
It wasn't obvious to me,

451
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,420
but a basic law of the market is that
the fastest person will usually win.

452
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,120
There's always a benefit.
That's Andrew again,

453
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:42,740
to getting information faster
than the other guy. Absolutely.

454
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:47,741
This has been going on since
Julius Reuters used carrier
pigeons to send a bunch

455
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:51,620
of stock quotes faster
than guy on a horseback,

456
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,220
and that was in the 1850

457
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,330
here's a more modern example. Say
the latest job numbers come out.

458
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,070
US Employers added
227,000 jobs in February.

459
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,790
If those numbers are good, that means
the stock market is going to go up.

460
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,450
So if you can get the numbers and rush
to the market before anyone else gets

461
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,850
there and buy the stock before it goes up,

462
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,210
you could make a lot of money right
on the, you know, buy low sell,

463
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:19,690
high principle, basic
law of, of getting rich.

464
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,340
But when the market's turned electronic,

465
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,370
which began to happen in the
early nineties this basic
law created a situation

466
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:28,730
that was totally bananas.

467
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,110
What do you mean?

468
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,000
So imagine it's the year 2000
you've got this market in New York,

469
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:38,120
it's electronic. It's basically
just a building on broad street,

470
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,590
near Wall Street with a giant computer
inside of it that's matching buyers and

471
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:45,130
sellers and you have a bunch of traders
in different parts of the country that

472
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:48,240
are connected to this market,
to this building and a,

473
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:53,050
some of them are using a automated
trading bots and one day this Guy Dave

474
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:57,070
Cummings who is in Kansas notices
that his robot keeps getting beat.

475
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,410
Like when it would send
a trade to New York,

476
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:04,180
like say a buy order often right as that
buy order was about to get to New York,

477
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:08,150
some other robot would swoop in and get
their first and snatch up the trade and

478
00:29:08,151 --> 00:29:10,100
it occurs to this Guy Dave, wait a second,

479
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:16,030
is it cause I'm in Kansas if the other
guys closer to New York than his cable

480
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,370
boots

481
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,890
shorter. So I need to move
to New York. No, no, no.

482
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,600
Cause we're talking
about the speed of light.

483
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,600
Well close to the speed
of light knowledge. No,

484
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,220
obviously it's because he's
in Kansas. What do you mean?

485
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,930
Obviously cause the speed of light
is like a foot and nanosecond.

486
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,810
You're going to get your ass
kicked if you're in Kansas.

487
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,380
I don't even know how you know this for
a fact. Yeah, it's a foot in nanosecond.

488
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,130
It's a foot and nanos it takes a
billionth of a second. Go a foot.

489
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,040
It's three times 10 to the 10
something something. Everybody

490
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,350
knows. I know this because
when I was in physics,

491
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:48,550
like if I needed to delay a signal by
a nanosecond by billionth of a second,

492
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:52,780
I just added an extra foot of cable.
And then did you really do that? Yeah.

493
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,260
Cause the Proton antiproton would collide
and then it would create a mew on that

494
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,110
would go out and you only wanted to
measure, you want to filter all the junk.

495
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,820
So you knew when it was
going to arrive, roughly.

496
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,010
So you had a little like window I
had to arrive and then the window.

497
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,260
But you had to get the
timing of the window. Right.

498
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,620
So it meant like adding a delay and
we just would add cable and it was the

499
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:09,454
easiest way to add.

500
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,170
So would literally go get some
from cable and just splice it in,

501
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,880
not splice it Lima there lemo
connectors will connect. Of course.

502
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,840
Here's another way to think about it,

503
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:25,841
like say the time it takes for information
to get from Kansas to New York is

504
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:28,980
something like this. Did
you hear that? I did.

505
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,650
First piece is when it leaves Kansas.

506
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:33,080
Second beep is when it
arrives in New York. Yes.

507
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,600
Actually slowed that down just
a bit so we can hear it better,

508
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,580
but the point is that is fast,

509
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:39,980
but there's still a little space
in there between the beeps,

510
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,010
which is the travel time.
Very, very little space,

511
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,490
but even if these signals are
traveling at millions of miles an hour,

512
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:47,600
close to the speed of light,

513
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,980
if somebody is a few hundred miles closer
to New York than you and they leave at

514
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:53,120
the same time as you will,

515
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:57,410
then it's going to be like
you hear that but it a yeah,

516
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,570
that beep in the middle of some other
dude beaten you by a few milliseconds.

517
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,980
These little differences
matter that they're trying
to get in and out super fast

518
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:07,830
and maybe each trade, they're
only making a fraction of a penny.

519
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,000
That's it says Andrew.

520
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:12,240
But if you're making a fraction of a
penny millisecond after millisecond after

521
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,930
millisecond can add up. Right? But you
have to be able to react really fast.

522
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:19,170
So when this guy in Kansas decided
to move his robot to New York,

523
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,830
get closer to the big market
computer, when this happened,

524
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,990
it started kind of a land grab.

525
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,050
There was a real estate bubble around
some of these buildings because people

526
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:35,731
were trying to buy physical real estate
next to the exchanges so that the cables

527
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:41,161
that they would run into the exchanges
would be just a few feet shorter than the

528
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:42,394
other guy.

529
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,161
Wait a second. So,

530
00:31:43,161 --> 00:31:47,440
so does this mean like if I'm like one
stop up on the elevator and you're two

531
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:51,010
stops up that I have the, the,
the, the second floor advantage.

532
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:54,070
I mean how far do you do
this? Theoretically? Yeah.
I mean that's what it means.

533
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:54,760
But

534
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,580
I don't know how far this real estate
jockeying got because pretty early on the

535
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,680
the people who run the market
stepped in and they were like, okay,

536
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:06,400
this could get crazy. So they
told the machine traders, okay,

537
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:09,160
you want to be close to us,
fine, pay us some money,

538
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,210
we'll let you come inside. Inside our box,

539
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,340
inside the mothership.

540
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,510
Is there like some room or
all these computers or are
keeping each other company

541
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:24,010
now? Oh are they asked? There is, if you
visit the New York Stock Exchange now,

542
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,970
which we did after going through
months of security checks,

543
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,730
what you see is amazing.

544
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,230
Say so this is why the
20,000 square foot home,

545
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
this is Ian Jackie's head
of infrastructure at the
New York Stock Exchange.

546
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,334
He showed us around

547
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,840
with a number of rows of
racks for customer payments.

548
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,690
In 2006 New York Stock
Exchange opened up this room.

549
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:57,890
It's the size of three football
fields filled with nothing but

550
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,540
by embracive of service. A different
specific, so these are owned by banks?

551
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,380
Hedge funds brokers, yeah. Oh,
number of financial institutions.

552
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,800
Are these things training
right now? Absolutely.

553
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:14,080
Each of these computers and there
were close to 10,000 in the room,

554
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,630
give or take. Where at that
moment analyzing the market,

555
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,850
making a decision as to
whether to buy herself,

556
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:23,500
sending that decision over a cable into
an adjacent room where it gets bought or

557
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,220
sold. Yeah, no people involved. If
you stood still for a few seconds,

558
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,200
the lights went out, they
automatically went off. If not,

559
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:31,720
they moved because the assumption was
that we're not going to be people there.

560
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,730
And the whole idea of
this place says again,

561
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,120
the whole premise is
a level playing field.

562
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,320
So any firm can come in here and they
will have the same access as anyone else.

563
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,840
And to make sure of
that, my favorite part,

564
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,820
every single rack within this facility
has the same length of cabling to get to

565
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:50,600
the network points at the end and exactly
the same length. Exactly the same.

566
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,020
Yep.

567
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,080
Everybody gets the same length cabling.
Whether you're one foot away from the,

568
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,530
you know, network hub or a thousand
feet away, you get the same links.

569
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,860
I'm sure they send synchronized
test pulses from both your,

570
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,140
your trading computer and
jazz trading computer,

571
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,840
and they make sure they arrive
exactly at the same moment.

572
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:10,360
I like to imagine they have a guy with a
tape measure. That's the guy you bribe.

573
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,670
That's the guy. Anyhow,

574
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:17,770
you would think that since all machines
can now be inside the exchange,

575
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:21,960
literally inside the market building,
that the speed race would be over, right?

576
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,153
Yup. No,

577
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,590
actually it only gets worse
because the place we visited,

578
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:32,210
the New York Stock Exchange, it's just
one market. Many, I didn't know this,

579
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:36,230
but apparently when all trading went
electronic, the market's fragment,

580
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,220
it used to be that the trade stocks
there was the New York Stock Exchange and

581
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:42,980
then there was Nasdaq. Really
just those two markets is Larry.

582
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,120
Now there are 13 regulated exchanges.

583
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:52,170
There are roughly 50 what they call dark
pools in the marketplace is they're not

584
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,570
in public, basically. Yeah,

585
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,190
so you've got these 60 some odd different
markets and that's created all these

586
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:01,650
different speed races between them.
Yet, here's a super basic example. Well,

587
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:03,790
I talked about with Andrew
Actually in Chicago.

588
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,160
You've got this thing called
the commodities market.

589
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:10,900
Commodities are basic goods like corn oil,

590
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,590
soy beans, zinc, pork. That's
what they do in Chicago.

591
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:19,090
Here in New York we do equities
and equity is a share of a company.

592
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,600
So you have basic goods in Chicago,
stocks of companies in New York.

593
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,890
Those are different kinds of things, but
they're connected to each other. Right.

594
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,200
You know, cause like take oil,
which is traded in Chicago.

595
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,020
A lot of companies depend on oil
and they're traded in New York.

596
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,000
So say oil goes up in Chicago,

597
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,560
you can pretty much bet that right after
that a company like Exxon is to go up

598
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,750
in New York, but it won't
be instantaneous. Right.

599
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:43,290
Because information has a speed back
in the days of the Telegraph as we've

600
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,010
learned,

601
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,530
it took a quarter second about that
long to get from New York to Chicago.

602
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:51,950
Now with fiber optic cables, about 15
milliseconds. I love that. I had no idea.

603
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,480
You could actually hear
the time difference.

604
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,220
That one I think is pretty accurate. 15
milliseconds. But say you're in Chicago,

605
00:35:58,221 --> 00:35:59,054
oil goes up,

606
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,760
you know it and you can get to
New York in 14 milliseconds. Well,

607
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,700
you've got one millisecond
where you know the future,

608
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,980
you know exactly what's going to happen.
You're not even betting at this point.

609
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,810
This is easy money.

610
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:15,700
So what happened over time was a race of
people to provide the straightest fiber

611
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:20,380
line between Chicago, New York. That's
Mike Bellar again from trademarks.

612
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,830
He's part of this race. A couple
of years ago a company came along,

613
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,620
not his unfortunately and
spent some eight figures,

614
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,860
some to cut a straighter fiber line
between those two points. And um,

615
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,920
according to some reports
they blew through a mountain
to do it. They did a lot.

616
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:39,340
And where the state of the
art for communication lines
at the time between the

617
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:43,240
two locations was about 15
and a half milliseconds.

618
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,340
They came along and they made that
state of the art 13.3 milliseconds,

619
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,430
a savings of about one millisecond
each way, which is just an,

620
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,870
it's just a aeon is a thousands of
the second you're talking about.

621
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,700
That's not well it's an Ian.

622
00:36:57,701 --> 00:37:00,730
When your sis computer system is able
to make a decision in 10 microseconds,

623
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:03,520
which ourselves, that's 10 times
faster. So your computer's like,

624
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,600
I can do this so fast while
I'm just waiting, waiting,

625
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,500
waiting for the news for Chicago.

626
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,490
So a lot of us were sitting around
thinking what can we do about this?

627
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,790
Turns out there was a way to get from
Chicago to New York a little faster

628
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,860
because the speed of light through air,

629
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,460
it's a little faster than when you're
going through a fiber optic cable.

630
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,540
And so what they're doing now is they're
building a series of towers so they can

631
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:29,240
beam the signal through the air
from one tower to the next tower,

632
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:32,500
to the next tower, all the way
from Chicago to New York. So,

633
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,690
and that would bring the travel time down
to about in the neighborhood of around

634
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:39,170
eight and a half milliseconds. You
going from 13 to eight and a half? Yeah.

635
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,890
That would be going from
this to this. I mean come on.

636
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,420
That's a lot of potential savings.
You can totally hear the difference.

637
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,050
Is it helping? Is it, are we
fast enough now? Can we stop?

638
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,400
Um, here's the thing.

639
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,700
That's minnows neuron and
the CEO of trade works.

640
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:02,360
He joined us for part of the interview
and he told us actually we would love to

641
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:04,070
stop this arms race. Yeah, absolutely.

642
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:08,810
The arms racist and huge drain on
resources, but he says, we just can't,

643
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,140
as it stands when a new technology
comes out that makes it possible to be

644
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:15,920
faster. If I don't adopt it and my
competitors do, I will lose out to them.

645
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,550
I have to do it. And looking
at Minaj in particular,

646
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:22,490
you could kind of tell it this part of
the job. It's just like the plumbing.

647
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,210
Yeah. Just kind of makes them
weary. Yeah. Couldn't care less.

648
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,220
Why not just call a
truce and everyone say,

649
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:29,750
we're not going to try and go faster.

650
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,770
We're already way faster than any
human can think. It's fast enough.

651
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,090
We're going to stay up all a truce.

652
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:39,720
There's a such thing in game theory
called prisoner's dilemma. Um,

653
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,520
and someone will cheat, you're
saying. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

654
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,180
You can't put a gun to everyone's head
and forced them to abide by this truth,

655
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,020
even though we'd all be better off if
you could. Well, who would be better off

656
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,220
and here Minosh told us, look, even
though the speed race sucks for us,

657
00:38:55,221 --> 00:38:58,310
it's actually helping you
because on a basic level,

658
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,000
anytime you replace a human with a
computer, things are going to get faster.

659
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,880
They're going to get cheaper and
now that the machines are competing,

660
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,260
getting cheaper still in 1992 it would
have cost you about a hundred dollars to

661
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:13,010
trade a thousand shares. Now 10 bucks.

662
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,630
So yes,

663
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:17,990
humans have been completely supplanted
when it comes to short term trading and

664
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:22,390
humans who complain about that are
being disingenuous. Okay. They,

665
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,790
they have not been displaced by anything
other than the fact that they can't

666
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:29,480
compete. You seem like you've
had to, you seem defensive.

667
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,190
Well, just because I can explain the
economics of the business don't make me

668
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,490
defensive. [inaudible]
that also sounded defensive

669
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,300
if Menashe did sound defensive.

670
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:48,920
It's only because he and Mike and everyone
in their industry have had to answer

671
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:53,921
a lot of questions over the past few
years about where all this speed is taking

672
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:58,610
us and those questions always
come back to one particular day.

673
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,770
May Six 2010

674
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,400
when things got a little fruity.

675
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,900
We hadn't had a down
day in a long while. We,

676
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:12,710
the market had been slowly creeping
up for quite a while in there.

677
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,000
That's Eric Hahn, Sandra again,

678
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:17,840
the analyst who's been tracking high
frequency trading. He says, that day,

679
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,330
even though things had been
going really well that day,

680
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:22,970
it started off down pretty hard,

681
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,880
which made some sense because there
was bad news coming out of Athens.

682
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,590
People were nervous, but then

683
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,430
at a very specific moment,
two 42 in the afternoon,

684
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,000
1442 and 44 seconds,
all hell breaks loose.

685
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,660
Okay, Neil, let me just,

686
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,200
let me just interrupt for a second because
this market is dropping precipitously

687
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,580
adjustment, negative 500
it is now negative 560

688
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,630
[inaudible] on the screen. The
Dow was losing about 653 points.

689
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,270
Now Dow was down 707 points.

690
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:08,070
[inaudible] boom. There it goes. Look at
this market. It continues to slide up.

691
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,320
Gat At 835 [inaudible] in here.

692
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,580
Now it's down 900 wow. Almost
a thousand points. Yes.

693
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,440
We'll keep you out in a big way
like you had to do with the Gel.

694
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,420
All orders down at
Dalton tights, Chantelle,

695
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,640
two 45 and 27 seconds and
emergency circuit breaker shuts off

696
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:34,160
for five seconds and that was
the end of the, when it went out

697
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,700
and stopped for five seconds,
that was the bottom of the market.

698
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,430
1000 points down,

699
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,280
several hundred billion dollars
finished two and a half minutes

700
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,830
equally weird when trading started again.

701
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:48,970
Okay.

702
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,940
The market's bounced right back up.
About two and a half minutes later,

703
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,400
it was 600 points higher than the
bottom. It was like food buying.

704
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,990
Now, these kinds of swings had
happened before, but never that fast

705
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,330
and the speed is one thing.
Arguably what's more troubling

706
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,200
is that we still two
and a half years later,

707
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,540
don't really know what happened.

708
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:19,120
I mean the SEC investigated for months
released this giant 84 page report where

709
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,720
they essentially blamed the whole thing
on one bed algorithm that this guy in

710
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:25,660
New York was trying to sell a bunch
of stocks, told his computer to do it.

711
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,660
His computer just did it a
little too aggressively. No,

712
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,480
that's not how it went down
at all. Eric doesn't agree.

713
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,080
He thinks what happened is that all the
high frequency computers just clogged

714
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:35,710
the network.

715
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,280
Really the cause of the flash crash was
system overload because he says a basic

716
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:42,970
feature of these computer algorithms is
when they detect the network is slow,

717
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,253
they pull out, you know,

718
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,980
one of the maxims on the street is
when the doubts stay out or pull out.

719
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,400
And so if you've got this one computer
is selling a ton of stock and no

720
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:54,100
computers left to buy,
that creates a vacuum.

721
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,700
Now there were people who argued that
high frequency trading had actually made

722
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,530
the situation better because you know,

723
00:42:59,531 --> 00:43:02,530
Andrew says the markets did
bounce back right up to the top.

724
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,870
It computers self corrected perhaps.

725
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,960
But the point is nobody had any idea
and that's what gets him that we're in a

726
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:12,340
situation now where when things go wrong,

727
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:16,990
they go wrong in the blink of an eye
and then it takes us years to figure out

728
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:17,620
what happened.

729
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:22,620
The question that comes up is how have
we crossed some kind of Rubicon where

730
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:28,090
we've passed into a realm
where the complexities speed,

731
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,140
the volume of all of this stuff
makes it no longer human readable.

732
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,600
We just don't know what the system is
doing and can't in principle find out when

733
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:38,434
things go wrong.

734
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:00,790
[inaudible]

735
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,450
if you're having a hard time picture
just how fast and furious high speed

736
00:44:04,451 --> 00:44:08,410
trading is. Check out the visualizations
we've got at radio lab dot who are,

737
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,350
they are strangely beautiful
in a trippy sort of way.

738
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:15,970

call it just is Radiolab and today.

770
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,010
Do you want to say did today's a speed?

771
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,030
This is a perfect example of
what we've been bumping into.

772
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:27,740
All our humans are slow. We're just
too slow. But now, yeah. Hello,

773
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,940
this Lena. It is all right.

774
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,710
Now we have a story that should
make us all feel a little better.

775
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,160
Can I just say, I didn't even
think this was remotely possible,

776
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,340
but we're about to talk about and the
heroine of our story is a Lena Vestigo.

777
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,630
How that's that? Is that a hyphenate?
No, that vista go is my middle name.

778
00:46:44,631 --> 00:46:47,090
How is the last name? And
my first name is lean.

779
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,980
So Selena is a physicist at Harvard and
she has done something with speed that

780
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:55,710
is just remarkable. It's
the only way to say it.

781
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,160
If we sort of step back one,

782
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,370
we asked her to walk us through what she
does step by step because it's totally

783
00:47:01,371 --> 00:47:01,850
worth it.

784
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:06,850
We start out with a clump
of room temperature sodium
and at room temperature,

785
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:12,350
sodium is actually a nice shiny metal.
Lena and her team, they take the sodium,

786
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:16,520
they put it in an oven and heat it
up. Exactly. And as it heats up,

787
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:17,803
Adam's in the sodium starts

788
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,430
vibrate faster and then faster.

789
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:25,260
And when the temperature gets to
around 350 degrees centigrade,

790
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,400
the Adams form the vapor
super high pressure.

791
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,440
And then she forces the atoms to this
little pinhole have a little hole in the

792
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:35,801
source.

793
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:40,801
So this fins stream of atoms now
comes out of a hole and we hit them,

794
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,730
hit on with a laser beam. So you bang
them right in their pathway? Yes,

795
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:49,600
kick them in a direction opposite to
their motion and that slows them down.

796
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,653
Excited

797
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,810
and now we can load them into
what we call an optical molasses,

798
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,720
optical molester. This is so
baroque. I love it. In the obstacle,

799
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:05,980
molasses, the aims, will you be hit
by laser beams from all directions?

800
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,060
Is that your way of like saying
don't go this way, don't go this way.

801
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,530
Don't go this way. Yes. You corner
them in from all angles. Yes.

802
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,020
Then we can get them
to a really slow down.

803
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,960
It feels a little bit like you've
enslaved these Adams. I feel bad for them.

804
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,500
It's going to get worse. Yes,
because then that's not good enough.

805
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,340
Now that she has these Adams trap,
she needs to make them sit as still

806
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,290
cause possible. So she
turns off the lasers

807
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,870
total darkness in the lab

808
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,310
and then we turn on an electromagnet,

809
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,840
use the fact that he used the fact that
the Adams has morning magnets to hold

810
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:51,310
them in a particular point in
space so they don't all fly apart.

811
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:56,730
Then we can flip the magnet of this
small Adams and selectively kick out the

812
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:58,630
hardest. Just the hardest of them.

813
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:03,631
So they will fly out of the magnet and
we just keep a the lowest energy by

814
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:05,590
flipping the magnets.
You could say to the,

815
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:08,620
there's one atom that's a little bit
too jumpy. So you say get out of here,

816
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:09,783
get out of here

817
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,700
cause you, cause you want just the
quietest Adams to stay. That's right.

818
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,720
So now after all this, Lena
has this teeny little cloud.

819
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:21,620
Oh 0.1 millimeter in size typically
have just a few million atoms,

820
00:49:21,621 --> 00:49:26,330
like five 10 million. And she says at
this point they're all very, very still.

821
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,150
And because temperature is really
just a measure of speed really.

822
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:34,640
You know when Adam's are moving
quickly, we call that hot.

823
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,560
When they're moving
slowly, we call that cold.

824
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,350
These atoms because they're so still,

825
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:45,140
these Adams are really cold,
colder than anything on earth.

826
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,630
Colder than the middle of
empty space. Basically.

827
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,750
These are the coldest things
that have ever been cold. Yeah.

828
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,660
And at that point we have a
totally new state of matter

829
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:58,650
[inaudible]

830
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,560
and of course she was curious about
this new state of matters. That's right.

831
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:04,610
I'm a curious lady. And now
we get to the part where, uh,

832
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,570
well this is the whole reason
we're telling you this.

833
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,040
She now decides to poke this.

834
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:13,810
Adam's basically a center light, Paulson

835
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:18,740
shoot a beam of light into this called
Adam cloud and see Howard, we ex,

836
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,740
you know, when you have a total in,
what was it that, well, you know,

837
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,930
light fashion hates me. I mean, she says,

838
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:27,680
here's this thing that goes
671 million miles hour.

839
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,490
Then nothing goes faster than light. And
the question just occurred to her like,

840
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:35,840
what would happen if I took the fastest
thing in the universe and stuck it into

841
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:38,960
the coldest thing ever made? Exactly. Yes.

842
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,010
So she points your laser at the attic.
I mean, the laser beam hits a switch.

843
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,640
So here you have this, a light poles
coming in, zooming through space,

844
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:51,220
then the front edge will
reach our Adam cloud.

845
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,600
And unbelievably the light
poles in that moment goes

846
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:02,140
from hundred and 86,000 miles
per second to 15 miles per hour.

847
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,000
How are you getting, no. So
the light is going like this,

848
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,093
right?

849
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:14,540
That's right. Wow. And so
I know Adam cloud. Amazing.

850
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:18,370
Uh,

851
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,203
and then

852
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:24,460
it just chugs along really a
little bit at a leisurely speed.

853
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:28,540
Something that you could, uh,
feed on your bicycle. Yeah.

854
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,690
Maybe ride your bike faster
than the light mean. Exactly.

855
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,250
You can sort of think of this waste
between a bicycle and the light calls.

856
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,911
I mean,

857
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:41,080
imagine you could just bike next to this
blob of light and you could reach out

858
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,810
and maybe pet it a little bit,

859
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,700
then bike on a head. Uh, but
then you'd be in darkness,

860
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:52,180
but you can go go maybe to the edge
of the cloud and wait for the lights.

861
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:55,990
And it's all that when it comes through,
you can just catch it. Well, no,

862
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:59,170
that you can't catch it because when
the light gets to the other side of the

863
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,400
Adam cloud, the,

864
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,600
the front edge will accelerate back
up to this enormous normal lightspeed

865
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:06,403
and then

866
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,480
rushes off, scratches out again. Cool.
So here's my, Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry.

867
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,820
So, so if you've got it down to 15, is
that a kind of, uh, a, a like a, uh,

868
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,750
a limit? I mean, can you, can we, we
could, we could bring it, Lord, it's,

869
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:25,010
it's not a stop light. Can you
actually stop light? We can.

870
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,440
So that laser goes in and doesn't come
out. Yes. I mean you hold it like, uh,

871
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,970
like uh, how do you do that?
Huh? Okay. So what we do is a,

872
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:38,630
it's actually, okay, so things
get a little technical here,

873
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:40,970
but basically probably to simply,

874
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:44,510
Lina has figured out a way to tweak
the properties of this Adam cloud.

875
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,920
She can make it like a brick that like
bounces off of, or she can make it clear.

876
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:50,840
So like cruises through, in this case,

877
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:53,420
what she does is she shoots
the light into the Adam cloud.

878
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,680
So we slow it down and then right at
that moment, because it's chugging along,

879
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,420
Chuck Chuck Chuck at 15 miles an hour,

880
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:03,230
she tweaks the Adam cloud
to make it well thick.

881
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,940
And the light parts will say,
oops. Uh, it'll come to a halt.

882
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:12,770
Almost like it's frozen
in a block of ice in this

883
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,020
[inaudible]. Yes. It just
sits. Wow. When, when,

884
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,330
when you realize what you done,

885
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:24,620
did you do a little a Jig or
what did you do? You have?

886
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,010
Oh yeah, that

887
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,530
was amazing. They were just like
sitting in the lab of course,

888
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:31,500
in the middle of the night
and just knowing, Whoa,

889
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,670
you're the first one who has been in
this part of nature. Yeah, it was joy

890
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,340
[inaudible]

891
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,680
you know, of course, to
some extent I'm an engineer,

892
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,880
but this whole idea that I can take
this light poles and bring it down to a

893
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:51,140
human scale, that something you just, uh,

894
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,480
at a very personal level
gets excited about.

895
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:00,260
This is more like, you know,
I mean, you can sort of say a,

896
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,230
you know, like, like, like, like, uh,

897
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,530
a sculpturer will create
a beautiful sculpture.

898
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,330
For me, as I was thinking about this,

899
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,110
I actually think of it in terms of
painting, like Vermeer, you know,

900
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:13,944
the painter,

901
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:19,050
he could create this illusion that light
was just suspended there on the canvas.

902
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:21,660
Just shimmering. Yeah. You
Timo captured the light,

903
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:22,920
but that was just an illusion.

904
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,200
Lena actually did it. Yes.

905
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,273
[inaudible]

906
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,080
do you ever, do you ever wonder,
do you ever like, you know,

907
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:38,220
after this night you walk out and into
the log and I imagine next day and the

908
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,440
sun is shining and you just
look at the light and you think,

909
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,670
Oh, I've got your number. You're like
Zeus. No. You could resist for a moment.

910
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:51,080
Uh Huh. Uh Huh. And also
perhaps being Scandinavian,

911
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:54,110
right where we left the
a light around midsummer.

912
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,060
Yeah. You have a whole lot of it or
then a whole lot. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

913
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,160
Maybe you could do something about that.

914
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:04,580
Maybe you could store the
hay for the winter time.

915
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:07,640
You could store it up and then you could
unleash the cloud and suddenly there

916
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:10,520
would be sunshine when there was other,
and there's darkness. So save it.

917
00:55:10,521 --> 00:55:13,770
Save it for the wintertime.
Yes. Yeah. Well,

918
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,830
we've been doing this
for a number of years.

919
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,400
This is the one in the for
remarkable conversations.

920
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,430
Thank you very much.
This is wonderful. Yeah,

921
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,160
but you didn't [inaudible] real
important. Oh wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

922
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,730
So, um, we, we can play a trick.

923
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:33,560
The trigger this we can stop
and extinguish the light
person one part of space

924
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,740
and we vive it in a totally
different location. Yeah,

925
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,050
you can transport hands port it. Yeah.

926
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,680
At this point we were like,

927
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:46,530
what weird ass science fiction
movie did we just slip into?

928
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,060
Lena says when the light hit those
atoms back in her cloud there,

929
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,880
it's like pulse cloud will create
a little imprint in the arms.

930
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,260
It's like if you were to punch soft clay
with your hand and then you could see

931
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:00,510
the imprint of your
knuckles there in the clay.

932
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,940
That's what happens when
the light hits those atoms.

933
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,580
The light poles will change
the items a little bit.

934
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,020
That's how it imprints its information
in the Adams and according to Lena,

935
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:13,680
that imprint, it's like a
physical impression of the light.

936
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:16,680
All the information about the light,
it's frequency, energy, whatever.

937
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,670
All that stuff is copied in the Adams.
So with this shadow of [inaudible],

938
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,270
does that mean it's a shadow of
light? Yes. And now we can put poulet

939
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,420
imprint out.

940
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:29,870
So now what we have out in free
space is a perfect Matta copy.

941
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:33,340
You mean like physical matter? Yes,
and then we can move that around.

942
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:36,010
We can put it under shell
for, we can move it around,

943
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:39,250
we can squish it and then we can take
it all. She says if she wants to,

944
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:41,680
she can then make a few tweaks
to the cloud. Then delight,

945
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,720
pulse will come back to life,

946
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,350
propagate slowly through the cloud
and then exit and speed back up.

947
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,370
So you could store, I mean if you were,

948
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,960
if you were President Obama and
you said, I would like to put it,

949
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:56,390
put the light around me right now in a
time capsule for later generations to

950
00:56:56,391 --> 00:56:58,730
experience. He could take
it using your process,

951
00:56:58,731 --> 00:57:02,900
put it in an archive somewhere and then
putting in a bottle and thousand years

952
00:57:02,901 --> 00:57:07,700
later they would, they would know the
light that surrounded him. Yes. No,

953
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,840
that's what she said.

954
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,210
How would you know that different
light is the same? How do you know? Oh,

955
00:57:14,211 --> 00:57:15,470
that's the same light.

956
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,330
So it's a contained in my medical
copy that preserves the information.

957
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,540
So when the new light turns on,

958
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:26,020
it identically copies the light
from before in a way that will,

959
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,490
that makes it as as
specific as saying, that's

960
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,660
Mary Kay Jones again.

961
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,940
Yes, that's right. Oh Man.

962
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:38,200
I've also also also wonder about,
you know, because we could,

963
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:41,980
in our lab in Cambridge, we could send
the lay person stab at extinguish it,

964
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:46,090
make our little medicard. We put it in
a bottle. I could put it in a suitcase,

965
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:50,470
say bring it to a Copenhagen, turn it
into light. But I've thought about also,

966
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:52,870
how do I get that bottle?
So security in the airport,

967
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,060
what would it look like? Would it just
be a bottle full of a full of emptiness?

968
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,240
It would be a vacuum, but there would
be a little clump of atoms in there.

969
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:02,940
What would have to be less than three
ounces of Adams or they would have both.

970
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,090
Yes. So much less than three hours. Yeah.
You could just walk through the April.

971
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,660
You've got no problem. Yeah. Okay.
Oh, you can open and be like,

972
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:12,270
you want to do some cool blind him.

973
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:17,600
And that would probably be
also against the law. Yes, yes.

974
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,870
How am I going to get my light

975
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,063
through security?

976
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:29,030
[inaudible]

977
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:32,930
if you want to keep the momentum going,
check out our short called speedy beat.

978
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,380
It's about Beethoven and
his apparent need for speed.

979
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:41,300
Most orchestras don't play
his work anywhere near as
fast as he may have wanted.

980
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:45,770
Go listen@radiolab.org and while you're
there you can watch a string quartet

981
00:58:45,771 --> 00:58:50,600
play Beethoven's fifth at warp speed.
Seriously, it sounds like speed metal.

982
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,960
No. Six. Hi,

983
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,110
I'm Chris [inaudible] from the radio
at the turn Collagen with the credit.

984
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:00,640
I actually don't have enough credits
on this phone to try and do this again,

985
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,520
very fast. Regular lab
is actually, well, I'll,

986
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:08,650
I'll try really, really fast. Video
lab is produced by Ghetto Vermont.

987
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,180
Our staff includes Alan Horn from to

988
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,340
[inaudible] dot com Keith. All right guys,

989
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:19,630
this is harder than I thought on Keith.
Man. Let me and Andy Mills with Hellman,

990
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:23,410
Douglas Smith, Chris [inaudible]. I was
looking at Kelsey Patrick pat first.

991
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:23,991
Thanks. Josh.

992
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:27,620
Latinas copied in and craft works in a
very special tasks outpatient department.

993
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:32,090
I found that even though I just read
that very gray pat call probably cost me

994
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:36,080
about $20 hope you guys use it
on the air and this message.

995
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:39,970
That's me. I was looking
at Kelsey, Patrick, Megan.
