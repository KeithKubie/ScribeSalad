00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.131
- I'm definitely going to need
my--my blade sharpened.

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.007
- [indistinct].
- 'Cause I used it right up

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.427
until T-minus.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:13.638
I had some glitches in the
preparation

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.849
of my original blade,

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.977
and then, like, at the last
minute,

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:23.565
I had to have someone step in,
make me a blade

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.985
really in less than a week.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.945
- Wow.
- And get it from

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.322
Denver, Colorado, to New York.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.825
He really worked tirelessly...

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.326
- I bet.
- To get that to me.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.995
- Yeah.
- He worked so hard.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.998
- My blade, I had to have mine
custom-made.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:42.000
I hadn't touch mine till I got
here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.418
I had seen pictures of it,

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.211
but I hadn't physically put
hands on it...

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.588
- Wow.
- Until I got here.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.339
- So are you nervous about
taking something

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.341
you've never swung out there?

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:52.177
- Are you?
- Yeah, a little, a little.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.429
I have trust in the maker.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.722
- That's important.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.225
Did you hear it's designed
after a "Hellboy" weapon

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.727
from the movie "Hellboy"?

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.020
- No.
- That's his.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.271
- Yeah.
- His, it's designed after

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.774
the "Hellboy" number two.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.317
- Wow.
- It's--

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.152
I'm a big comic book geek.
- I think that's cool.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.528
- So...
- I loved "Hellboy."

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:14.324
- For me being able to kind of
ring that in

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.451
and still use my fundamentals,
like,

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.161
my slashings,

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.538
the slashing attack from the
[indistinct]

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.874
are gonna be basically the same
with this blade,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.211
and that's why I chose the
specific blade

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.880
and length and grip and
everything else,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.465
because I'm, like,

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.425
I don't want to change up from
what I normally do...

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.676
- Right.
- What I'm normally

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.011
dealing with.
- Right.

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:36.387
You're gonna have to be
instinctual now.

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.097
Now it's time for instinct.
- Yeah, I mean--

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.016
- This is, like, not time for
testing or anything.

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:42.727
You just--we're all gonna be
who we are now.

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:46.773
- Going into this, my thing is
just focus on my technique.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.149
- Yes.
- That's it.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.651
- Focus on what brought you to
the game.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.361
- That's right.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.030
- Because if you go out there
and let your mind wander...

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.156
- Yeah, no, no, no.

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:56.950
- It's here. It's gone.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.576
It's gone.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:01.079
Do what--do what--let your body
do it; let your body go.
