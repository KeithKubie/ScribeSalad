Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday. Sorry for Thursday. No, it isn't. It's not the money. My, it's a Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast at [inaudible]. Just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on you. How you doing? What are you, what are you done today? How did you watch the news? Did you fill your head up with all the fucking craziness on the news? Isn't it great watching the news? Oh yeah. Hey, I'm waking up. I'm feeling good. You know what? Let's turn on the news. Why would you put on the fucking news? What are you going to see? Are you going to see an accurate portrayal of what's going on? Sticking out the fucking window? I look at your neighbor. Hey Buddy. I look at him walking out to his car with his little brown sack with this fucking lunch in it. Oh, is he saluting Hitler? You know, it's just, ah, is he got a bomb strapped around his waist as he got a mosquito on his head that's biting him and Zoe has babies with little heads.

Speaker 2:          00:01:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       Jesus fucking Christ the Goddamn the hysteria, the hysteria that these news organizations, social media in all of this shit has created. Yeah. Can you just need, I'm just, I'm fucking one block in a way, man. I'm walking away. I'm done. I don't need to know what's going on. I don't need to be informed. Okay. Because walking around in a constant state of fucking hysteria is, I don't think that that is being informed when,

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       my real, my reality, my day to day is I get in a car, I drive to a building and I write dialog for cartoon characters. Occasionally I get to play drums. I do stand up, I hang out with my wife in his, that by right. I hang out with my daughter and that's it. But I put on the news and I will literally think that there's a glacier melting right above me that's going to drown me. Polar bears are going to swim in and eat me with fucking a bomb strapped around their fucking waste. That'd be body fucking relax, fucking relax and all these people fucking going on there and they just show and show. Got On TV and told Trump supporters. I love these people that like, you know, on these fucking news channels, they go on and they fucking, you know, give the other side a piece of their mind is if the other side even sees it, they're too busy, like watching their own shit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       And even if they see your shit, you're not going to sway them. Equate it to the, all those years I lived in New York City as a Boston red sox fan. During that time I didn't have money for the baseball package, so I used to watch the yes network. I always watched Janky home games, always home and away, whatever. I rooted against them the entire time I watched them. I watched more Yankee Games from 1999 to 2007 then I watched red sox games. So in theory I should have become a Yankee fan, but I, I did not.

Speaker 3:          00:03:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       Because I was a staunch, uh, red freckled faced red sox fan and that's it. So all these people going on TV talking about these fucking people. Now these fucking jerk offs are going to go up to Boston, right? You know, 18 fucking jerk offs, you know, I know it's more than that, but everybody, oh my God, or the nats, he's taken over and then they're going to take it to show the fucking footage of Boston and busing and all of that shit from way back in the fucking day. Is this a perfect storm or racism? Is Hitler really dead when we return? His body was never found.

Speaker 3:          00:04:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       According to reports, there was an angry looking jerk off riding around in a Mercedes Benz spotted just last year down in South America. Um, I'm done with all of them. Absolute fucking hysteria out there. These people are losing their fucking minds, losing their minds, screaming and yelling at each other. Nobody's listening to anybody. Everybody's acting like the fucking sky is falling. One fat fuck shoots off a fucking missile and everybody loses their shit. One missile, we do that every fucking day, but worry about this guy

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       when fucking fat guy with, I just don't understand the level of fucking freak out that's going on. You know, it's fine. Yankees of playing the red sox this weekend. All right. College football's coming up. Nfl Football, baseball playoffs are coming. It's all going to be fine. All right. I gotta tell you, there's always been Nazi supporters and they've kind of always had rallies, but at, it's not like they're growing, you know what I mean? Are they, I mean, I just, I gotta be honest with you. You, you don't get any whiter than me and I've never gotten a flyer. No one's ever asked me to join. I don't walk down the street. Hey, hey,

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       Guten tag. Look, I'm not saying these aren't important issues, but I'm just saying that the level that people are fucking freaking out. All right? Just need to fucking relax. Just fuck of a Laxman. Okay. You can vote against whoever you want to vote against very soon, right? Isn't it like midterm elections and then there's this other shit. You know it's going to happen. You know what's going to happen. Okay? There's this fucking country goes, wait, gone way over here. We're going to go back and back over here. So anyways, whatever. How are you doing? How was your Thursday afternoon? Huh? Got Good people in your life. Do you have a sandwich today? Ah, I wasn't that delicious. Was there a terrorist in your sandwich? Was there a little Nazi flag on the fucking toothpick that they stuck in your fucking club sandwich there?

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       Pr. I'm going to say there wasn't, I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to say there wasn't, I'm actually doing the Trump hand thing right now where you put your index finger and you're on your thumb. I like it. The other three fingers stickup you know what's great about it? You really feel like you fucking drive and your point home. I'm going to start doing that with my wife. Okay. I'll tell you right now there's going to be cold, cold beer in the fridge. Um, you know at the biggest crisis in my life is right now is I cannot fucking, I cannot sustain a work out or eating well for any significant amount of times to prevent me from staying at the fucking weight or gaining weight. I just can't do it. This fucking writer's room. You're just sitting in there with all these people you love watching them slowly die. That's what it is. Because no matter how few calories you eat, you're sitting on your fucking ass for eight to 10 hours a day and you just can't. You can't fucking do it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       I'm so fucking pissed at myself right now. I'm going to have to start doing two a days. I'm going to workout in the morning and I'm just going to have to like, I don't know what to do. Went out last night and I did, uh, I did a show down at Largo and I stopped eating it. Like, you know, I don't know when the fuck I didn't want to have like five o'clock. I don't even remember what I had for dinner. Five 30 or something like that. Oh. Then I got down to the club and I was hungry and I went to this vegetarian restaurant, those fucking things. Oh, I didn't eat meat. Yeah, but what did you eat? What was in that fucking sauce? You know, it's gone right to your fucking ass, right. Your stomach. And then, um, you know, I have one, one whiskey.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       That was it. And then I came home and I'm fucking starving. My wife had a little bit of Thai food and I had that and I'm just, I'm fucked. I'm killing my side. I don't know. I, I gotta, I gotta I don't know what happened to by discipline. Um, I dunno. I'm just under a lot of fucking stress right now. I guess that's why I'm having this reaction to the fucking news. And everybody's watching it and then they are coming in and they're like, can you fucking believe this? Can you fucking believe this? It's just like, all right, Kay. You know, it'd be great in the news that they, if they showed the amount of fucking people last week who didn't get in a car and plow down a bunch of fucking people, like a complete piece of shit, that would be the rest of us. Then this one fucking asshole does it. And then everybody starts thinking, is this what the world's going to be like now? Is this going to happen? It's just how fucking, I don't know how awful a fucking parents did that person have Jesus Christ. You know? I think when your kid starts putting like the Hitler poster on the wall, it's time to be a little more involved. Maybe sign them up for volleyball or something. Try to get them out there, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:09:28       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       I Dunno what you do with that. Is there a hotline for that? A one 800. My son's into Hitler.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       A one 800. I keep finding two holes poked in the pillow cases. Um, you know what I mean? There's unconditional love and then there's Hitler. Right? Who's kidding who, and then it's Kinda like, all right. You know what? Uh, I think it's a time to ship you off to the loony Bin and let's make a new kid. It's time to make a new kid shot. You know what? You're like an old star Steinburg Gulf, which you like Brett Farve when he got shipped to the fucking jets. It's all there for you. It's over. Okay. You can't make the pass across the field anymore. You know what I mean? You've lost your vision, ed. You got posters, a Hitler, it's over with Trey to you, to the New York jets and what bringing in the nose. That baby, she had a baby man. We're having a fucking, that's what I would do.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       By kid became a racist. I would fucking turn my kid in and then I would just make a new kid. That's it. I, you know, go back to the draft. You know what I mean? I maybe adopt basically signed a free agent.

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       Yeah. You really have to have a strict no Hitler fucking policy and your house. You just have to have it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:50       Um, anyways, I saw this thing where, uh, people were going on to an white people go into an and ancestry.com and we're not pleased with some of the results. Yeah. I mean, that's going to happen, right? It's going to happen. You're going to find a couple of surprises in there that's going to fuck up. Fuck with your manifesto. You know, I would love if he could fucking, what the fuck did they

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       do with Hitler anyways? What do you mean? Even if he lived, he's gotta be dead by now. Right. And what was that guy born 1890 something. He's so evil. Like maybe he's still alive. Just the hate is keeping him going.

Speaker 2:          00:11:26       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:27       You know, just picture them with like a fucking s s walker screaming with every step trying to get to the fucking toilet, you know, to take a master race shit.

Speaker 3:          00:11:46       Ah, if

Speaker 1:          00:11:46       they only just encouraged his painting at that, it only happened that you wouldn't have all this craziness. Why you still want, they'd find something else anyways, socks up, down, up, down, up, down against this week it a Yankees, I think they won last night against the mets. So the red sox Yankees played this weekend. Right. Everybody's going to have a good time and enjoy the game. I take way out to the ball game, take me out to the crowd, buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks,

Speaker 4:          00:12:15       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       scan your fingerprints at fucking tiger stadium because you are a fucking dope opal. So anyways, I'm going to start doing two a day workouts. That's when I got to do it. And I just have to, I have to fucking commit.

Speaker 4:          00:12:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       I'm trying to figure out this new life that I have with this fucking writer's room because it takes up so much, so much of my head

Speaker 4:          00:12:37       time that um,

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       you know, I have a very finite amount of time to fucking work out. It's still actually keep my standup back going and all of this shit and I think it's causing me stress.

Speaker 4:          00:12:49       And uh, maybe that's the fucking problem. Maybe I'm just old. I Dunno. I got a fight. A dude, I can't have the fucking dead, but you know, we just like just thick it big fucking you stupid skinny arms coming out the side that Mr. Potato Head, fucking body, you know, I can't fucking do it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       I guess also because I blew out my shoulder, which is finally the thing is, is better now I'm going really slow. Add the a the rotator cuff shit going on. Right. So I'm now, this morning I actually for the first time in like a year, I had the fucking Bob Bell and I was benching and I had five pounds on each side. That's how long and slow this processes. And I felt like the, just a little something and I was going to do three sets and I said I immediately stopped, which is what you have to do with an injury. So you'd have to immediately go, you know what? Fuck this. I'm not doing this anymore. So anyways, let's, let's, you know, let's, let's Google some news.

Speaker 4:          00:13:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       All right, let's just read this one. Let's see, we see we are canceling daily stormers registration with Google domains for violating our terms of service. This supposed person told business insider, well, where the fuck was this a while ago? Uh, you read Google's registration agreement, you can read it here. Okay, go, go. Didn't want it. Service used to incite violence. A source close to Google told business insider. Um, I dunno, I hate to do the Cliche, but when you, those fucking white supremacist groups, they just, the dumbest fucking people look at this fucking guy.

Speaker 2:          00:15:11       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       It's like if they went there, they made a movie about white supremacists. Guy went to the casting.

Speaker 2:          00:15:19       I Dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       I don't get people who go down and protest the fucking these hate groups just to let him go down there and screaming, yell to nobody. You know what I mean? Why do you go down there and then what do you do? You start tearing their signs down as if they're going to be like, oh, they tore our side down. Now I see their fucking, now I see this side of it. All you're doing is reinforcing it in their head that you guys are fucking assholes. You should go down there. You should make them a little pumpkin pie, little apple pie and just give him some food and just be nice to them. That's what we should do with that fucking guy that fatty over there in North Korea.

Speaker 2:          00:16:03       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       Bob's trumpet go over there and smoke a cigar with the talk about grabbing pussies. Whatever the fuck you wanted to do, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:16:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       Instead of using the old book, we do that. We're going to do this. All right. Um, oh God. I have to get out of this vortex here. I just fucking Google News Boston to hate groups. You're not welcome here. Ah, you're not welcome here. We got plenty of VI. Hate is already here in Boston

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       that, that

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       it'll be funny if other racists in Boston were upset about the racist coming here. They're going to take our, Hey, I think I'd take her jobs, man.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       Doh. We can't have a bunch of other people coming up here dropping the fucking Edward or what are we going to dote in?

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       You're not wanted here. Dope. We're not hiring. We got fucking plenty of them. Um, anyways. Uh, what else? What else? I got nothing going on, dude. I'm just sitting in a fucking writer's room eating salads and somehow putting on weight because at the end of the day, I fuck it up. But last night I was at Largo. I've got one more show down there tonight. Um, I worked with Joe Barton, nick and Todd rex to absolute fucking bese and um, they killed it last night. We're going to be down there again tonight for a, a a great cause. A friend of mine, uh, peak common unfortunately passed away last year. Uh, one of the great comics that I met on the way up and just a great guy. So we're raising money for his kids. So I want to thank everybody that came down there last night tonight, raising funds, doing something positive, not being an isis, not being in a hate group. Write something positive. Um, honey, when I told you I wanted you to be more social, I should've been more specific.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       That's it. Mom pulling up to like a Klan rally yelling at her son Timmy. I wish you wouldn't do that. I really wish you wouldn't. Could you just stop it? I mean, um, anyways, I just can't get out of the vortex of that. So anyways, I'm all freckles is trying to invest his fucking money because the government's taken all of it. And I'm sitting here trying to buy the smallest of small little properties here. So someday when I'm in my fucking seventies and eighties, and I don't feel like going out on the road unless I want to, I don't have to. You know what I mean? I don't want to fuck, you know what I mean? Cause you know, you, what goes up comes back down again. And if I'd start the gentle slide back down to doing the fucking comedy vault at Remington's in Boston, when I'm in my eighties, um, which unfortunately that room finally passed away like a year or two ago, about a year and a half ago.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       The comedy vault. Okay. Legendary room starting in 1993. Dick Doroty. How Spike Tobin, I was on one of the first nights. They're put together my first five minutes write down there right next to the fucking bank vault. Why am I thinking of that shit? Because right now I'm trying to get a loan. All right. And I have, I should have perfect fucking credit, but I don't because I pay off my credit cards every fucking month. So when they don't like that, I paid off my loans early. They don't like that dings your credit. They look at that like a loss. Like, Hey, we were gonna make five grand off this loan. He paid it off twice as fast, really made 2,500 bucks. We lost 2,500 bucks in this guy. So I've given these guys every fucking goddamn piece of information they need. I have the credit, I have the fucking money.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       It's a fucking joke. And then today they come at me. They want two years of my, uh, my fucking cell phone bill. Now I've got to dig through all of my shit to try and find that. And I just want to say to them, you can you just tell me why you need all this? Oh, these are the new regulations. Blood. Yes. Yes. And why? Why are these new regular, why do these New York regulations exist? Yeah. Well, I mean that's just something that all, yeah, they exist because you guys were irresponsible with your own country, Mints Money 10 fucking years ago and you fucking nuclear economy. I didn't do it. I'm a responsible fucking guy. I live within my means. My checkbook is balanced and now I have to jump through all these hoops. Why? Because you guys are greasy, greedy fucking pieces of shit that gave every fucking mouth breathing dope. 500 fucking thousand dollars came walking through your bank doors for good. Seven, eight years in the last decade. Now I got to sit here digging through shoe boxes. A fucking phone bills.

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       You know, because you're a double secret probation cause you're a fuck up. I love how cause they're a fuck up. All of a sudden it reverts back to me like now I have to pay for this since well actually build this you the fact that they are holding their feet to the fire like DC, you know that's a good thing for you and your money because your money's tied into the system. I realized that. I just wish that when you say, hey, why do I have to do this? They don't hide behind a regulations. They should say, well, because we got so greedy 10 years ago, the combination of our greed ended up with the, the fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       the cooking of the fucking economy and old people thought they could retire then had to continue working right into their fucking grave. That's what the fuck we did with your money. Hence, we need to see the last fucking two years. You got damn phone bill. Oh, we're taking collars. Um, all right. Let me read a couple of advertisements here. All right. All right. In don't cheat or Indochina, Indochina, uh, talk about how every man looks better in his suit. Ah, tell you, you know what I mean? When I look at Paul version, I'm like, this guy's a fucking animal. Yet you put them in a suit. I'm like, Holy Shit. I want to hear what that man has to say. He looks a lot better. Look at him in that three piece suit and those Jordan threes.

If this country spiraled down in the rankings, you know like what happened to the Michigan Wolverines over the last 20 years where they were, they were this powerhouse fucking program and then they just dropped out at site, flatlined for 15 years. That's when, that's when they can take hold. But you know everybody, everybody's got their fucking, everybody's walking around with Crocs, right? They got the Jags Jagging Zion.

You're going to die fucking deal with it all right? And God knows if you've got a woman in your life, you're going to die sooner rather than fucking later with all of this shit that they do, they just, you know, they can't help. It's just what they are. They give they love and they take this to balance. You know, everything that they give your kid a, they take away from you and then you just slowly died. This lonely existence in a room full of other people. And that is the podcast for this afternoon. Kidding. Um, that's everyday was fucking around today on this podcast. But seriously, stick your head out the window. You know, just fucking everybody relax.

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       Fucking relax. She's fucking Christ. He can see these goddamn people. I mean, they're too fucking stupid. They're too fucking stupid to brush their teeth. They're going to run a country. Um, anyway. And what does everything always go back to Germany to this is like jeopardy and the fucking 1930s. Well, why isn't it like Russia?

Speaker 2:          00:33:10       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:33:11       why is it that our country in the fucking 16, 17 and 18 hundreds, it wasn't exactly a great place to live for a lot of fucking people. Um, oh Jesus, now I'm doing it. I'm talking to the fucking, I don't know what I'm doing. Am I, am I ranting and raving now? I have no idea. All I know is I'm going to be in a good mood today and I have to do two a days, two a day. So I don't look like a freckle doughboy here. I worked out this morning, you know, I did my little half hour on the fucking elliptical and I threw the weights around. Now the most crucial thing is what I eat. And when I stopped fucking eating. All right, so I already got it tonight. I stopped eating at five o'clock I'm having a Turkey Patty with the Tabbouleh Salad, and then that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:59       And then I have to drink waters for the rest of the fucking time. And then to make up for my, since last night, I'm going to skip rope for fucking three rounds. You know, try to burn off some shit that way. And maybe that's what I'll do. I'll do fucking two a days. Is that what I got to do? I know what I gotta do. I gotta fucking get out of this writer's room. That's what I have to do. Maybe instead of taking a lunch, maybe I'll, I'll fucking bringing elliptical into the office. And when we pitched jokes, I'll just be on the fucking thing. And everybody in the writer's room just takes a turn, you know, or every time you pitch a joke and it doesn't get a laugh, he owed 10 minutes on the fucking elliptical. You know, our whole fucking room will look like a, you know, they look at the end of the Tour de France.

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       We just burned so many calories. Like your body's like eating yourself. Um, they'd be going to the table reads by episodes eight and nine being like, you know, it's a funny show, but Jesus Christ fucking Amaziah what kind of show we do it here? Um, they put their heart and soul into this fucking thing. Um, oh wait a second. All of a sudden it got loud in my ears. Oh, I turned it up by accident. Brushed against it with my forearm there. All right. Um, hey, by the way, I got a new band and I'd been listening to, and I'm not going to remember the fucking name of him cause I know my phone. It's a really weird name for a band. Let me see. I'm opening my fucking iTunes, go to artists. I know it begins with an a, this is getting everybody excited, pleased.

Speaker 1:          00:35:28       Say My alt J. I downloaded this album called this is all yours and I fucking love it. Great album, great album to chill out to. I listen, I worked out to what this morning cause it was early in the morning. It's kind of fucking, you know, you know, creepy and mellow and all that type of stuff. You know, I guess I knew I was going to get on the fucking s scale, but um, I never heard of them. And Josh, Adam Meyers from the goddamn comedy jam, the actually when I was on the road he goes, Hey, I'm going to go see this band tonight. Uh, all Jay and Mike, what? I thought it was a Typo. It's a l t lowercase dash capital j. Uh, I really enjoyed them. And once again, you math has a new album coming out next month. Alright, that is it. Please listen to the music. Little interlude here before we give you another half hour of greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon podcasts from a Thursday, from a Thursday that went by on a Thursday that you didn't even pay attention to. All right. That's it. God bless you. Thank you for not being a Nazi and a, I'll have a good weekend. You can sit. I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 5:          00:36:43       And the Nice [inaudible] far trumpets, the suit of Patty, they say your son. No cause no body is dry walleyes.

Speaker 6:          00:37:30       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Barr and this is the Monday morning podcasts from Monday, August 17th, 2007 2009 why can't I have a decent date, right? I actually, this is the second time I started the podcast because I always just start it and then I go to say the date and I realize I don't know what the date is. So I'm sick of doing that. Like I just did that and I fucked up the date and I was like, I do this every time. People are gonna think it's a gimmick, like always deliberately fucking up to date. So I just hit stop. I hit a race and I started over again and I fucked up the year something wrong with my brain. You know what it was? Cause it was the 17th. Then my brain was thinking seven. So then when I went to say, the year, I say said 2007, in case you're wondering case you're wondering, I'm anyways, I'm actually, uh, it's Sunday when I'm doing this podcast because, uh, if you listen to this east coast time in the morning, I'm on an airplane right now.

Speaker 6:          00:38:33       And uh, I just got a bunch of shit to do. So I figured, uh, I'm not doing anything today. Why not bang out a podcast, you know, anybody can go out and Atlanta and hang out with another human being. You know, it takes a real secure fucking loser, okay. To, uh, you know, still being his fucking hotel bed at what the fuck time is it? 1220 in the afternoon. Ah, Jesus Christ watching the, um, whatever the fuck golf major. This is the PGA. I'm actually betting against tiger woods kind of have this ongoing a bet. I keep betting against tiger woods with a another comic, a friend of mine who is of African persuasion, you know, basically, cause I've kind of not been watching baseball lately. Uh, I've been trying to pick up new sports and the only way for me to get into golf is to have stupid ass bets.

Speaker 6:          00:39:32       So I figure I'll bet against not only while, I bet against tiger woods, I will bet against tiger woods with another black dude. And I will, uh, you know, just to make an interesting, you know, say dumb shit, like golf's a white man's game. Um, I'm betting on Ernie els. You know what? I actually won in the fucking masters, I bet on Phil Mickelson and I won that one cause he beat tiger woods. And then, I don't know, I got busy and I could've won another, you know, we bet like 25 bucks a major, I could have won the US Open and I also could have won the fucking, uh, that went over there in England and I blew those off and I think I'm going to lose today. It's weird. I'm betting against tiger, but you know, my money is, but I'm actually rooting for him, you know?

Speaker 6:          00:40:22       Is that exciting now? I don't think it is either. Anyways, let's, uh, let's plow ahead here. I'm going to fucking bad mood. I had a really had a really bad show last night. Now I had a bad show. I went up there and I did this whole bit on Michael Vick coming back and it killed and everybody was having a great time. And then at the end of my set, this, this woman comes up to me and, uh, you like when someone's going to insult you, you know, rather than have an, I'm going to insult you. Look on their face. They come up and they have an ear to ear, like Erik Estrada Grin on their face.

Speaker 6:          00:41:00       That's what she was doing. And she was just going to like, hi. Hey, how are you? Yeah, yeah. That whole thing about Michael Vick. Yeah. Yeah. Did you really believe that? Is that really how you feel? Yeah, and I, I immediately knew. I'm like, Oh God, this is a dog lover. Here we go. So I was just like a, okay ma'am. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't like the show. Uh, you know, they're just jokes. If you want to take them seriously, go ahead and take them seriously. And then she just gave here. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you stayed. Me and she statements are really ignorant. I just say you should know that she was like nodding and smiling. You stay me through really ignorant. It's like first of all, why are you smiling? You know, I I, that was the most annoying thing. Not that she came up to me.

Speaker 6:          00:41:42       I mean it's my own God damn fault. I fucking not only do I go on stage and I say a bunch of stupid shit, but then I stand there like an idiot selling DVDs. I'm opening myself to somebody coming up to me and telling me to go fuck myself. I don't have a problem with that. That comes with being a fuck can shit at who sells DVDs at the end of his show. All right. So I totally could have avoided that. So I'm not complaining about that. What I'm complaining about is people who are telling you to go fuck yourself, but they're smiling. Like, is that supposed to like mind? Fuck me. Like I'm gonna like I'm not even going to notice what you're saying. Okay. Like, wow, it sounds like she's telling me to go fuck myself, but she's smiling. Maybe I'm hearing this wrong.

Speaker 6:          00:42:25       And then she's like, your statements are really ignorant. And she's nodding like, you know what I mean? Like that bugs bunny shit. Like remember that when he, when he would be like, no, you know they've gotta be like, yes, no, yes, no. And then at some point he would switch and go, he would switch over his fucking argument than the other guy would end up arguing bugs bunny's argument. That's what the fuck she was trying to do to me, you statements are really ignorant and she's like nodding like I'm going to be like, yes, my statements were ignorant. So I said, lady, so basically what you're telling me is because I don't agree with your point of view, that that makes me ignorant. And, and then she pulls this, this thing. She goes, I'm actually a member of the humane society. All right. You know, first of all, who the fuck breaks out credits during an argument?

Speaker 6:          00:43:12       You know what I mean? She says it right. I'm, I'm a member of the humane society, right? Like it's supposed to be like this. Dun, Dun, Dun fucking moment. Oh Shit. Are you a member of the humane society? Good Lord. How many years of college did it take to get that Holy Shit? Did you have to go through medical school to become a member of the fucking humane society? I actually, if I have the second was like, wow, I actually thought that she was on the board of the humane society. First of all, I don't even know what the fucking humane society is. Humane sounds like Humana to me, like you're into people and evidently it isn't. You're into fucking animals. So I'm sitting here later on tonight, I'll fucking annoyed with this lady. This lady is Jerry Lewis would say, right? I'm all fucking annoyed with this lady thinking like a man.

Speaker 6:          00:43:58       I'm like, wait a minute. She's a member of the humane society. You know, I was a fucking member of, uh, the fuck is that, that that day. Now of course I can't remember. You know what I'm taking right now is how fucked up my brain is. I'm thinking a apocalypse now. Amnesty International. I know it was an a because I, for some reason I thought there was a pa, I was a member of Amnesty International for like, like two, three years, you know, that was against torture and people around the world. And he and I became a member. I gave him 25 bucks.

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       I went on the Internet and I gave him 25 bucks. I have no fucking idea what they did with the money. I don't know if they stopped someone from getting tortured. I don't know if they just took that money and they both, you know, a couple of them went out to a movie. Yeah. 25 bucks. We go to the matinee can, I was probably eight bucks each set up for some popcorn to two tickets and a popcorn. Come on and do it. We're not going to stop torture. Um, so that's what I did. So go, let me go on the fucking Internet. Let me look up this, this, uh, this humane society. And uh, so I went to it humane society.org and sure enough, this is all you have to do to become a member. It's $19 a month or whatever you can afford. So I could give these fucking people a dollar a month and then I too could walk around and be a total fucking cunt and then throw out my credit that I am a member of the humane society. And you know what? I'm going to fucking join the humane society at $1. So the next time I do this Michael Vick bit, when one of these fucking psycho people comes up to me having memory of the humane society, Oh shit. You know what? So Am I. Holy Shit. I can't believe I didn't see it, the meeting. Oh, that's right. Neither one of us go to him.

Speaker 2:          00:45:45       Yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:45:46       there is no fucking meetings. A member of you made society. You want to fucking, I can't put, she threw that out like she was on fucking like she just did the tonight show.

Speaker 6:          00:45:58       I'm the head of NBC. You will never get a show on my network. That's the way the fuck she was saying it.

Speaker 6:          00:46:06       God dammit. It got worse. It got worse. So you know me, someone's being a con to me. No one can out count me. So you know, I'm actually upset with myself because I allowed her to make me mad. As you can tell, considering it's fucking 12 hours later and I'm still on, I'm talking about it alone in my hotel room with the drapes, pulled clothes. This is how I always do it on the road. Fucking sit around like Howard Hughes. Um, yeah. So then she goes, uh, you know, I remember the human or humane society and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said, look, okay,

Speaker 2:          00:46:38       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:46:39       You know, I just, I don't want to do, why do people take comedy seriously? Those are stand up comedy show. I'm not doing it. I'm, I can't even begin to tell you guys how many times am I act. I say that I'm a moron. You guys listen to my podcast. You know I'm a moron. Actually, some people don't. I had some guy send me this fucking email this week on bill for the love of God. Stop talking about banks. You sound like a moron. Read this shit. What do you mean read this shit? That is goes against everything that I am. I don't fucking read. And Like I love how you talked about those banks. You sounded like a moron. And what? When I talked about the other shit, I sounded intelligent. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:47:19       So fucking podcast. Just stand up back. I don't, I don't, ah, all right. You know what? Look at it. Here I go again. I'm allowing myself to get fucking worked up about this shit. So anyways, couple more back and forths go. And then she just realizes that I don't give a fuck. I said something like, well, you know what you should do ma'am, is what I always say when somebody just says that they don't, uh, you know, enjoy me and they just want to keep telling me how much they don't enjoy my act. What I always say to him, I was like, well, you know what you should do. You should never come to one of my shows again. That'll show me.

Speaker 6:          00:48:00       So then she finally realized is that I don't give a shit about our humane society fucking credit that she basically purchased, you know, it's, you know what a, again, being a member of the humane society is less respectful than when they give some famous person an honorary degree, because at least the celebrity didn't fucking pay for it. He didn't go, didn't go to Syracuse university.org and give $19 so he could be like, I have an honorary degree from fucking Syracuse University, you know? So anyways, so that's why I say so. Well, this lady, all right, you know, you know what you should do. You should never come to one of my shows again. That'll show me. And at this point there's kind of some people around me that are starting to laugh. So then this girl just, you know, who's a member of the humane society because she cares so much than just, she just starts going from my juggler.

Speaker 6:          00:48:49       She goes, yeah, well, you know, smiling and nodding, right. This is creepy fucking smile. And this whole time too, she's got a clump of lipstick on her upper lip. She's one of these girls you could tell was hot when she was in her twenties and now she's doing, the worst thing that you can do is you're trying to hang onto it, you know, so she looks like, you know, one of the real housewives of fucking Tupelo, Mississippi or wherever the fuck she's from. Right. And she's calling, uh, she's gone out. Yeah, yeah. Well you're doing great, right? You're doing great. You're here at the punchline. Hi, you're doing great. And I'm like, yeah, you know, shows kind of seem to be selling well, she goes, now, yeah, it's great. You know? Yeah, you were on Hbo and now you're here, you know, and it's like, lady, so are you your ear too? And you fucking paid to come here to watch me. What is your fucking point? And she's like, and I didn't pay, I didn't pay whatever. And then she'd said something to the, if she started talking really, then she did that, that, that, that thing. You know what, how women have confrontations. Like that was what they do is they stop talking to you and then they start talking to their friend really loudly about you and she starts getting that guy a fucking piece of shit.

Speaker 6:          00:50:06       The funny thing was was she couldn't have been more than five feet away from me. And she's yelling at [inaudible] pizza is yet, and then that's when I told her, you know, lady, you know, I really didn't want to tell you this, but you got a big, he got something on your upper lip and I didn't want to bring it up, but now you're being a jerk. And she goes, it's lipstick. I Dunno, I don't even what happened after that, that point I was actually mad. And, um, and I dunno, I kind of blamed the whole evening on a not drinking if you can fucking believe it, you know, cause I usually enjoy doing the road. And now this is my third weekend that I've done where I have not had a drop of alcohol. And now I finally understand why comedians want to get off the road. I never realized how many fucking morons there are out here because I was drunk and I was part of the problem. But now, now I'm sober. I'm like, God, I'm talking about myself. Like I'm actually a fucking alcoholic. I'm not. I'm just so fucking lonely loser. And that's what I do. I have a couple of beers, talk a little shit. That's it built denial. That's the first fucking stage of it, VJ saying, oh, what a shot. Jesus Christ from the French.

Speaker 6:          00:51:28       Oh, you know what that was from yesterday. Don't you fucking hate like when you do that, when you're watching sports, you ever done that in a sports bar? You looked away for a second. He didn't realize it was a replay from a month. Again, somebody hits a home run, you're like, ah, fuck it. And you're like the only guy, not dude, that was from my last Tuesday, they were playing the rangers. They're like, oh, I thought, I thought there was, I thought that was so, now you want another case at dia. Um, you know what I like about Vj Singh? Ali's fucking douchebags nowadays a days they're trying to bring back that rat pack swagger and you can't, you can't do it all right. And the only guy, I dunno why, I dunno why he can't wear shirts the way they wore shirts back then. You can't wear that fucking little bing Crosby hat the way they wore it.

Speaker 6:          00:52:13       I don't know why. I have no fucking idea why frank and why Dean and Sammy and all those guys look so low, so fucking smooth. I have no idea why, but I was watching this, uh, golf the other day. I got to admit fucking Vj Singh, he's got a little swagger to him, you know, plus he said that, uh, that hateful shit against women, you know, which really lines up with their generation. Remember that back then once they just like beating their women with a mop handle every time they didn't have their raw roast beef and mashed potatoes ready or some shit. I Dunno what's, so anyways, I've had a uh,

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:52:55       I'm trying to figure out why that lady bug me so much. Last night I, you know, she was just, I dunno, I, I felt I was pissed at myself that I got mad and then I was also mad at myself die stand there like a fucking idiot selling DVDs.

Speaker 4:          00:53:11       MMM.

Speaker 6:          00:53:12       You know, I don't know. It really just made me want to be like, you know what, why don't I just go to the green room after shows and I'll do my shows and then, you know, whatever. I'll get an email and you know, I dunno, you fucking sit there dance around like a monkey boy for 50, 50, 55 minutes. I bet you even did an hour of that show. I can't remember. Then they have somebody come up to you, just talk and say that you're a piece of shit because of a joke. And then there are a woman, so you can't like, you know, you know it was funny was she was with a guy. So the whole thing time she's given me shit. It's like I don't want to lose so I'm giving her shit back. But at the same time I got to keep my eye on the dude and also like not go too far because then I got like a physical confrontation with the dude, which I don't want to have.

Speaker 6:          00:54:03       I'm 41 years old. Last time I had a fight 35 that was when my brother and a red roof inn. That's an entirely different story. And that doesn't count either because your brother's going to stop at some point cause he has to answer to your dad. You know, I can't fucking remember. Right. I ain't not tough sky. I tell jokes. Right. So I don't want to get into this guy. You know, it was funny the entire time the guy had his back to me and he was trying to get the woman out of the club. Okay. And that's the exact kind of guy who goes out with a woman like that. And vice versa. If it's a loud mouth Douche bag guy, they always have a little mousy girl because nobody who actually would speak their mind would ever tolerate dating somebody like that man or a woman.

Speaker 6:          00:54:47       They will be like, are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind right now? You know, it's a joke. This guy's telling jokes or whatever. You made your point. Now you're just gonna stand here screaming. I Dunno. I Dunno. It was a fucked up night. Then I had the next show. I'm onstage and I'm doing my act and I'm having a great time. And you know, I told the story about the woman I call direct contact and I felt like I got that out and everything was going great. Then all of a sudden this, uh, this, this, uh, this lady just walks up to the stage. I'm in the middle of my acts. She's like, can you, can you, can you say happy birthday? And my friend had there, it was like, lady, could you act like maybe I'm fucking in the middle of doing a show at some point.

Speaker 6:          00:55:39       I know it was just, it was a fuck. It was a weird, it was just a weird night. And then after that, then I went over to the club to 90 next door. Um, as I always end up doing, and this time, this is the first time I went in there and I wasn't drinking and I realized how fucked up that place was. It was just, dude came up to me, right. And this whole week I've really been having a difficult time understanding some of these, uh, who, people who live outside of Atlanta, they're fucking accents this, uh, I'm standing there talking to a couple of people from the club and this guy just comes up to me. He's like, we'll,

Speaker 8:          00:56:16       yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:56:16       I'm like, what? He's like, will he sticking his hand down? And um, I thought he was saying like, will you like, he was starting to sentence like, will you stop standing there? Will you buy me a drink? I know what the fuck he was going to. Evidently he was saying his name, he was introducing himself, his name was William, but he's got will, will, and I was like, what? I don't, but this is one of those bars. Everybody's, every other person seemed like they were on fucking coke. And uh, I don't know. This is just Peter and out. I don't know. I'm just fucking, I've had enough and I usually do Thursday through Saturday and something fucked up happening this weekend when I'm doing Friday, Saturday, Sunday. And somebody asked me this question last week, like, uh, asked me if Sunday was a depressing day on the road. Um, I don't know if you listen to my past podcasts, I think I answered that.

Speaker 6:          00:57:10       Yes it is. Sunday is the fucking worst. You know, two shows Friday, three shows Saturday in know the big peak and you want to fucking leave and then you got to hang around the entire fucking day to do one more 50 minutes set. And then you've got a fly in on Monday, which is the fucking worst. You know, I like flying on Sundays, you know, flying across the country, everybody's still asleep. They go into church, you know, they're waking up from a hangover finishing that last slice of dominoes. I don't know what they're doing, but they're not on the road driving. So when I land at the airport, I just grabbed my shit at, jump in a cab and I'm fucking back at my place. You know, you fly back on a Monday, the ups trucks, the Fedex guys are out there, right? Fucking homeless people laying in the streets.

Speaker 6:          00:58:01       It's just fucking horrific. So anyways, I had such a great week too. I had a great week. You know, one of the people listens to my podcast, works over at Cap, the capitol records place, and they invited me over there to go on a tour, which I did this past week. And I got to tell you was it is the, was the the greatest tour of anything I've ever taken ever. Do you remember if Geraldo Rivera, when he did al Capone's vault and everybody thought it was going to be the greatest fucking thing ever. I remember how great you thought it was going to be. Like what the fuck is going to be in that safe? And you're like there's no way this is going to suck. And it just didn't live up to it. Whatever your expectations of that where this was 20 times that it was unbelievable. The guy basically explained it. Uh, and I'm saying the guy, cause I don't use people's names on this, he was basically explaining that the capital records building is basically a functioning museum, meaning that there's a bunch of shit that they're still using that really should be in a museum. I walked into the room where Frank Sinatra sang all those songs. Luck be a lady, Dean Martin, all them, they had nat king Cole's piano and they had this little metal chair like yeah that's Frank Sinatra's chair and I'm looking

Speaker 7:          00:59:22       at it and I'm like that's not fucking Frank Sinatra's chair that looks like it should be in an ips class. That was like one of those science room classes and later on in the tour he was showing all these black and white photos. Cause I guess back in the day, the capitol records label had their own photographer and they took all these fucking pictures. And by the way, frank and dean never looked bad at any moment. They want a picture of Dean Martin eating a bowl of soup and he looked like a fucking million bucks. But anyways, then you look at the photos and there's that fucking chair. They had a microphone over there that said Frank. Oh yeah, that's Frank Sinatra's microphone.

Speaker 7:          00:59:59       And then they just use it. You know, I gotta just fight. Absolutely fucking blew me everything. And I can't even like they had like the masters of like a, the band, you know that group. Like they just had them laying, not like laying in the corner. They were going to be doing something with them. And then I fuckin actually got to hold it in my hand. A master. It was, it was, I don't know if you're a music geek, that is the, that it was the place to go. And not to mention later on that afternoon, one of my favorite drummers of all time, Steve Jordan was recording with, uh, some huge artists.

Speaker 9:          01:00:35       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:00:36       And they actually, you know what sucked was, they had already recorded his drum shit. So he was going to be doing, I get some, some percussion shit and all I wanted to see was his kit set up in, in the, uh, in the studio. That's all I wanted to see. But I fucking missed it by a day. But other than than that, then I got to go on top of the building, you know, like I was fucking dice clay and Ford Fairline unbelievable view. It was, it was the greatest fucking thing I've ever done. Um, and I know it. And if I was more articulate, I could explain how awesome it was. So, uh, I want to thank everyone over at capitol records for being so fucking cool. That was the greatest tour of anything I've ever taken. And, uh, do you ever want to come to one of my shows?

Speaker 7:          01:01:17       If you bring 40 friends, I will still hook you up. That's how great that tour was. So there we go. Look at me. I'm bringing it around to something positive. Half the fucking Twat from the humane society. Oh wait a minute. I can donate by phone. You want to hear me do this? Let's see how easy it is to fucking join the humane society of America. You think they answer on Sunday? Do they make their people work on Sunday? That's not very humane. Is it? Three, nine, three nine. Alright, let's see if we can do this. Oh wait, I'm gonna have to give my credit card number over and you guys can hear this wedding. Oh wait, they're saying the number has been changed or disconnected.

Speaker 7:          01:02:11       Oh fuck you. Computer woman. I'm joining the humane society. I cannot fucking wait for the next dog lover to come up to taking that joke. Seriously. I'm a member of the humane society. So Am I. I have your credit too, ma'am. And I got it in the time that it takes to write a check. So stand down. All right. And why don't you blot your fucking lips before you walk out of the fucking house? I'm good. Phil Mickelson. [inaudible] got love about Phil Mickelson. That guy always goes for the pin. You have an order set shit. He just doesn't give a fuck. And then he for Putts, the guys aren't into. And then e four plots. I don't know. So anyways, let me, let's get to the podcast questions this week by phone is vibrating. Um, you know, it's weird. I have not drank and so long and I still feel hung over cause I stayed up till four in the morning last night.

Speaker 7:          01:03:06       I couldn't go to sleep. I was so fucking pissed. All right, here we go. Let's get to some of the stuff. Okay. A youtube videos. If you would like a laugh this week for some reason, I only have one of them. I don't know why. I know I got more, I don't know. I get busy. I fly around sometimes I fuck up. This is actually a cool video watch. Ah, it's, it's snuff box boyfriends scenes, s n u f, F snuffbox boyfriends scenes. And uh, I think you'll enjoy that. I got a couple of other ones, but people will kind of send me stuff that I just feel like they're just classic, um, youtube videos. Like who hasn't seen that woman who you know, who she stomps the grapes, you know, she's having that competition and then she falls out of the thing and then she,

Speaker 10:         01:03:53       oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

Speaker 7:          01:03:58       You know, cause you've got the wind knocked out of her. And I know that sounds like I'm doing a fucked up impression, but that's exactly what she sounds like. And if you don't believe me a let's, let's fucking bring up that video right now. Shall We? Let's see a stomp stomping grapes. Let's see if that'll work. Did that just fucking work? Of course it didn't. I really don't like typing with one hand stomping grapes. And I'm telling you it's literally, yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:04:31       Oh, oh, oh

Speaker 7:          01:04:34       here we go. Here we go. Listen how she does it.

Speaker 5:          01:04:38       Oh, that's done is right here. These buckets are filled with grace.

Speaker 7:          01:04:44       Jess, fall off the fucking thing. Shut up. Shut up. All right, here they go.

Speaker 5:          01:04:52       It's like a tight, here we go. So what's The dip? Sorry, I'm trying to fast forward to this. Shut up.

Speaker 7:          01:05:03       Why can't you fast forward these videos better and now it won't fucking play. God dammit. You know what am I gonna have to start this podcast over again? This is so fucking horrific. Go play.

Speaker 7:          01:05:18       Here we go. There we go. Uh, you know what? Go Fuck yourself a plate later on. Why the damn thing's to load up. All right. You don't, I feel like right now I feel like one of those news guys who I just threw it to the field and then the story's not there and I got to stand there smiling and I'm like, oh, okay. Now there's nothing on the teleprompter for me to read, so I feel like a fucking moron. All right, let's go to ask bill. Hey Bill, I want to be a standup. My friends say that I am funny. I wrote down about five minutes of Shit. I thought it was funny and I did a little stand up back to my brother. He laughed and said it was great. I have dangerously low self esteem in myself. And the fact, uh, that I don't usually like to laugh at myself when I'm writing jokes by myself.

Speaker 7:          01:06:03       I usually laugh at a joke I tell when I say in front of people and I realized how crazy it sounded. I live in a small town so there's not really any standup clubs. There is a place called the coffee connection, which has an open Mike. There I am a little nervous to go because I don't want to bomb and completely destroyed my confidence. I have to actually become a comedian. I'm not afraid to talk in front of people. I just don't want to fuck up in front of other people. But um, here is where a bigger problem comes in at my high school. They have a talent show around the end of the school year. If I got up there and did shit and didn't make anybody laugh, everyone that didn't know me at the school would think I'm some dusty cunt. That just was up there for the attention.

Speaker 7:          01:06:43       I think. Uh, I would just use the classic, I was just fucking around. I wasn't even serious line, but inside I would still feel like shit. Do you have any advice that could help me? Yes, I do. All right. First of all, having low self esteem and can sort of hating yourself. You have the foundation for becoming a comedian. Um, you got to give yourself permission to suck and you got to give yourself permission to grow in the beginning, which means you have to go out and you have to perform in front of people that you don't know. The last fucking thing that you want to do, not knowing how to do stand up would be to go on in front of your entire high school. I mean,

Speaker 5:          01:07:27       okay,

Speaker 7:          01:07:28       that, you know what maybe at that takes that right there. The fact that you're even considering doing that, you have way more balls than I ever had at your age. Okay? So you're already fucking ahead of me. And not to mention that you're still in high school and you're already starting it. So I didn't start doing stand up till I was 23, almost 24. So you're way ahead of the game. There's no fucking reason to put yourself into that situation unless you feel confident. You know, if you feel confident, you feel like you're going to destroy, who knows? You might bang one of them fucking cheerleaders there. But, uh, but then that would probably boost yourself confidence. It'd be like, well, maybe I'm not a Douche and then you just get some regular job and you'd never get into show business. Um, but I digress now you've gotta give you gotta Oh, um, you know, something.

Speaker 7:          01:08:15       I did stand up and for the first year I didn't tell and none of my friends even knew I was doing it. I think one of them knew and nobody saw me for the first year. I wouldn't let anybody cut my, my family knew that I was doing it and I would not let any of them come out to see me do it. And, um, I didn't let my parents first saw me. I started in March of 1992 and my parents first came out to see me in March of 1993 and I've always been blown away by comedians. Um, they'll go there first time ever on stage and they invite everyone from their office to come down to the place where they work to watch them do stand up. And I'm just like, dude, do you realize what it's going to be like if you fucking bomb and you have to go to work the next day?

Speaker 7:          01:09:04       I mean, why would you set yourself up? I mean it's just, I dunno. So what I would do, my advice to you is, is first of all, don't worry about having a low confidence or low self esteem or whatever the hell it is. You don't have to worry about that. You'll, your confidence will build as you do it. But what you have to do is just, you just go out and go do open mikes. You'll, you'll get in the click of other open makers, you'll make some friends and then you become like this little platoon, you know, and it's like you against the world. Okay. And everybody's going to bomb all every, all your Oprah micro friends are gonna bomb. You're going to bomb. You're all going to fucking do it. It sucks. But it's the best stories you'll ever tell in your life and later on in your career, you're gonna look back and tell some stories. I mean, I'll tell you, you know, it would be a hell of a fucking story is if you went up in front of your entire fucking high school and you ate your balls. I mean that's some shit like later on in your career if you, you know, if he was starring in a movie and you needed a panel story to tell on Letterman or fucking Conan, I mean that would be a hell of a one to tell.

Speaker 7:          01:10:12       So that's, I mean I, it's hard for me to tell you what to do as far as whether you should do that high school show or not. All I can go is with, with my gut. The fact I got like scared reading your email, thinking of just putting myself in your position of like just picturing myself at 1718 if I ever went on in front of my high school and try to tell jokes, I mean I probably, that would have been a bucket of blood above me and would have poured down on me just like in that movie, Carrie would have been bad. You know, I got to met halfway through that. I wouldn't, I just thought like, what if I killed the, you know, say you're like a junkie. He just keep fucking chasing it. All right, so don't worry about it man. Just fucking have fun.

Speaker 7:          01:10:57       Go Out, sign up for some open mics and just do it in bars where show in football games and no one's looking at you and you just learn, get tough that way. That's what I would do. You know? And if you want to do the high school show, by all means fucking go for it. Personally, I wouldn't do it, but that, but coming from a place of fear, so you know, if you got the balls, go ahead and do it. But if you do it, I want to hear the results so please email me back. All right. But other than that, don't worry about, you know, second guessing your material and all that stuff and thinking stuff sucks. That's just a part of it in the beginning. Okay. If you think you're awesome when you first start out, you usually end up being a hack, you know, and you're out there, you know what's deal with local jerks and I'm fucking great.

Speaker 7:          01:11:40       All right. I hope that helped you out. Okay. All right. Any, uh, next question, Bill. Um, I want to ask you about how you felt about parents taking their kids on planes. Recently I had a flight to Denver back from Los Angeles. Not a long flight, but I was absolutely exhausted and looking forward to the two hours of not talking to people and hoping to maybe catch a nap. I had no such luck on young couple with their two year old Brat set behind me. And proceeded to let their kid kick the back of my seat and screamed repeatedly. It was awful. I don't blame the kid. Two year old kids, they, they kick and scream. That's what they do. But the kids' parents did nothing to control the child other than saying, you shouldn't do that. What really pissed me off was that we were, when we were landing, they were asking their child what he wanted for dinner.

Speaker 7:          01:12:30       And this is written in capital letters. Are you fucking kidding me? Two year olds don't get options. 12 year olds don't get options. 20 year olds don't get fucking options if they're living in your house and you're paying for everything. As we were getting off the plane, I was hoping these people would have the decency to apologize for their kid kicking the back of my seat. But of course they didn't. I've thought about telling these people that they ought to both get a, they ought to both get fixed because they were absolute assholes and all they were doing was raising another absolute asshole and adding one more to the fucking population. Um, but I kept my mouth shut because people like that see nothing wrong with their behaviors. So what's the fucking point anyway? Have you ever, have you ever experienced, had an experienced slice like this?

Speaker 7:          01:13:16       Um, did you think about saying something? Did you actually say something? All right. Uh, great question. I gotta be honest with you. When I'm on it plane and a kid starts crying, I don't know why I can't explain it, but it makes me laugh and it makes me laugh watching other people get fucking annoyed because, uh, I don't know. Somewhere along the line I just sorta let go of that. It's like, look, these people, they have kids just like you said, they can't control them. Um, and that's it. But I will tell you this, if you have a kid and it's in the fucking thing, cause it two year old, it's not a person yet, it's a fucking thing. The fucking thing is kicking the back of the seat of the person in front of me in front of you. You have to do something about that.

Speaker 7:          01:13:59       All right? They got little short little fucking legs at that point. All you gotta do is just scoot him back and they won't be able to, they won't be able to, to, to kick the back of the seat. Now I might be fucking ignorant here cause never had a little two year old thing. And I might be over simplifying this because I really have sympathy for, uh, for, for people in that situation. Man, I don't what, what are you supposed to do? I mean, in a perfect world, you could just knock the kid out, but you wouldn't want to do that. It's a kid. You can't punch your kid. I mean you can, but then you'd have to talk to somebody from the fucking humane society. A wow, I didn't know what the fuck I'm saying. You know what I mean? Perfect world. You could just tie him to the seat.

Speaker 7:          01:14:37       They would move, but you'd psychologically damaged with them, um, you know, damage the kid and then you've got to live with them for at least another 16 years before he fucking moves on to community college. So, um, have I ever said anything? No, I have never said anything. I wouldn't, I would never say something like, you know, you know, tick. Do you understand that? I also like when the planes landing, you know like when you ears a pop and like little kids, they don't know what to do. They don't know what to do. But I've definitely given some people, some not even like what the fuck I give him that look like really? You just kind of let the kids sit there. And this is another thing too, if your kid is freaking out, if you're just making a fucking effort, even if you can't stop the kid from freaking the fuck out, just make an effort. This is weird. I'm gradually agreeing with this person more and more. Just make a fucking effort. That's all. When people are just sitting there and letting the kid cry. I mean, I don't know if they're doing an experiment because I've heard like if you pick a baby up every time it cries and it learns, okay, all I have to do is cry and then I get this comfort. Um, if you're trying to retrain them, I don't know if you're going to retrain him. Could you do it at home?

Speaker 7:          01:15:45       I think they should sedate kids. There you go. Yeah, I just said that, you know, just come in with the fucking, have one of those fucking world war two psycho doctors just come in with an old fashioned needle. You just drug them up or maybe they could have like a fucking a glassed in area. Do you guys ever have that? Like the crying Roman church, you'd put your kid's way in the back and they just be behind glass, you know, so they wouldn't interrupt the priest scaring the living shit out of you that you're going to be going to hell. Maybe they should have that down by the luggage. Um, anyways, uh, so no, I've never said anything. Yes, I've wanted to say some things, but um, you know, by the end of it, you know when you're actually going to say something, the flight's over anyways. And uh, I had some part of flying, isn't it? Some kids screaming anyways. All right. Um, what am I moving on to the next part of the podcast? Oh wait, is this video loaded up yet? Remember my impression? Oh, oh, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:16:44       okay.

Speaker 7:          01:16:44       Here we go. Here we go

Speaker 2:          01:16:46       on a whole day.

Speaker 5:          01:16:53       Oh Wow. I was up. I was, oh, I can't read.

Speaker 2:          01:17:04       See, I told you. Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker 7:          01:17:09       You know what that was, that's the first time she ever got the wind knocked out of her, so she didn't know what to do. That's what I sounded like when I was five. The first time that happened to me, and the first thing you learned is when you get the wind knocked out of view, is to shut the fuck up. Because every, anyone, if you try to talk, when you get the wind knocked out of you, that's what the fuck you sound like. So you learned afterwards. Once you get your breath back, you're like, wow, I really sounded like a fucking idiot as I was going. Do you know, you just fucking, can anybody explain that phenomenon? What is that and why? No matter how hard you're trying to breathe in, does your breath keep exhaling or just pushing out? You know, it's like when you, when you, uh, he's like, you're having a dry heave but you're not puking, you know, just for those of you, like, you know, I dated a girl one time, she was like 27 years old.

Speaker 7:          01:17:59       She'd never had the wind knocked out of her in her life. Um, which I thought was one of the most adorable things I'd ever heard. Yeah. It was like she was living under glass or something. But anyways, uh, why is, you know, do you, how many fucking times that happen to me as a kid? That was like what we did. Me and my boy, you know, had four brothers. That's what we did as a kid. That's, that's what you did. And your brother wasn't paying attention. You didn't have to do it hard. That was great. You just give him a fucking rep right in the stomach and the kid, fuck this. Ho, um, does all the wind literally go out and why can't you just, why can't you just breathe in?

Speaker 7:          01:18:38       Why am I acting like you guys, a fucking doctors? Why this isn't just a bunch of truckers. Just forget it. Don't even, you know what, I want somebody to attempt, you know what half the people who are going to fucking answer this question. I'm going to do exactly what I'm going to do at the end of this fucking podcast, which is just look it up and then give me the Wikipedia reason. All right, here we go. Here's some questions for the week. Um, Bill, um, on a different not that's what someone just wrote. I think they wanted to say no to on a different not, I was wondering what did you think of the song Baba O'reilly by the WHO? I recently started listening to rock music and I thought that this song was incredible. Is it? Or I am or am I just some dumb fuck no, you're not.

Speaker 7:          01:19:15       You're a young kid and you're discovering the WHO and they are the shit. Um, I would get who's next? I would get a live at Leeds. Start with that. Just, just surf the Internet. They've got some great shit. Um, dear bill. Ha. How much drinking do you typically do during the week? Um, you're out on the road all of the time working places that serve booze. And it seems like it would be tempting to drink pretty often out of boredom, boredom and loneliness. I think I already, to answer this, at least I could see myself doing that if I were a traveling comedian. Is it tough to avoid being a lush? Ah, yeah. It kinda is. You basically become an alcoholic out of, uh, like proximity, you know, it's just there. It's one of those deals where, you know, I don't know, if you weren't a bar four nights a fucking week, I would think the odds of you would, would go up exponentially.

Speaker 7:          01:20:09       Yes. I just said that. So, yeah, it is, it is hard to not, uh, to not drink. I already answered this shit, you know, I dunno, but I gotta tell you it's fucking boring as hell to be out here. It, this does not, drinking is actually put me on edge. MMM. I mean, you should. The way I've lived this week out here in the road. If I live my entire life like this, I could run for president and I wouldn't have to hire the, I wouldn't need any hush money. Okay. I've worked out the first day I went to the grocery store, I bought food. I've got a little fridge here. I've been eating healthy. I went to the gym every single day. I even brought my little practice drum pad thing with me fucking around learning some rudiments. I wrote jokes, e okay. I looked at some internet porn. All right. Right there. That, that would fucking lose governatorial fucking race gubernatorial or whatever the fuck they say it. But you know, that's the last thing. If I could just cut out the fucking internet porn,

Speaker 8:          01:21:17       mmm.

Speaker 7:          01:21:19       I would be completely bored. That's, you know, I gotta tell you that's what I am right now. I am sober right now and I am not feeling this, this unbelievable fucking high of like, wow, I can't believe all this shit. Um, I, I was missing. All I'm thinking right now is, I can't believe how fucking long the day is. You know, thank God I stayed up until four in the morning last night, so I didn't wake up until 11, you know, but then you end up feeling like a loser because now it's already fucking one. I Dunno. I think I'm done. Everybody. If I don't drink, I don't think I can do the road anymore and I don't think I'm going to be fucking selling DVDs after my show. I decided I'm not fucking doing this anymore. I'm going to be stones fucking sober and just seeing a mirror image of what a fucking Moron I've been all these years.

Speaker 7:          01:22:03       All right. Overrated. Underrated. Um, I didn't, I don't know that I actually got any this week, so I actually throw in a couple of mine. I probably got some and I just, Oh, it's tough. During the weeks I traveled to try to save all these fucking emails between my blackberry and this, this, uh, computer here. So a overrated, I say expensive jeans. I remember when, you know, if you had a pair of Levi's, you were cool. You were in the club, right? And what were they? 30, 40 bucks. And then people, all of a sudden diesel jeans, that was the first expensive jeans I remember in this, this girl was talking me into buying them and they were like 180 bucks, hundred and 60 bucks. This is, you know, this is like eight years, seven, eight years ago. I remember like, how do I need $80 for a pair of fucking Jesus?

Speaker 7:          01:22:46       Ridiculous. I can buy four or five pairs of Levi's. And she says like, no, but you'll see the quality's better. They last longer and you know what they don't, I think they look a little better. I think nice jeans look better. Like at this point then like, you know there's, I mean I think we can all agree there's nothing worse than gap jeans, you know, and they have like that sort of, not quite stonewashed look to them, but you know, they just look, you just look broke. I notice a lot of white dudes and like their, their 30s and forties will be wearing those and they'll have like a button down sort of like, I'm going to go see Jimmy Buffet shirt on and they'll tuck it into that and then they'll have a pair of dirty white all white Seinfeld sneakers on and it is just like, wow dude, you are fucking married with children because uh, that is if ever, if there was the anti pussy, that is the anti everything that is just the asexual outfit that you could possibly be wearing.

Speaker 7:          01:23:49       So I've been one of these guys who get sucked into buying, you know, more of these expensive jeans and these fucking things they wear out. They wear out. Just like, you know, you don't want to, you want to make your jeans last, you've got to buy like fucking five pairs and you've got to revolve them. That's how you make them less. But if you're wearing them, you know, every two to three days, like I do like a fucking, I'll tell you, he knows the most filthiest motherfuckers out there are musicians. I can't believe I forgot to tell this story. Right? Uh, last week when I was flying back from Providence, Rhode Island, I decided to upgrade to first class. I just said, fuck it. You know, I'll deal with the fucking credit card bill who was one of those deals where I just didn't want to fly and I'm so sick of fucking flying.

Speaker 7:          01:24:31       And they were like, Hey, do you want to upgrade to first class? And I was like, of course I do. And they go, well, we're just going to put our virgin island, fucking airline Dick in your ass. And I was like, you know what? I don't give a Shit Gad and raped me. I want to fucking sit in a lazy boy, the entire fucking ride across the country. So that's what I do. So I'm sitting down and on the plane comes to skinny dude with his big titted girlfriend and they're like, is there anyway you could switch seats with that so we could sit together and I was like apps or fucking locally, if I was in coach right now, I'll give you a dirty look and get may give you some sort of bullshit. I'm superstitious, I'm not changing my seat. Fuck you and your love affair.

Speaker 7:          01:25:12       But I was in first class and now I'm affable. Absolutely. Absolutely. So I walked over and I sat in my seat and they will fucking sit in there. The first thing is dirty ass musician does. He's got these flip flops on, right? And His fucking toes, it looks like you know. Now I know why people wash Jesus's feet. That's all I can fucking tell you. Okay? This fucking guy, he looked like he looked like a bird of prey. That's the only way to describe his fucking toenails and everything. And he did the most disgusting fucking thing I've ever seen a human being do. Halfway through the flight. This mother fucker gets up to use the bathroom on the airplane. And I'm going to say that airport airplane bathrooms are some of the dirtiest fucking bathrooms ever, just from turbulence alone. And the fact that it's so fucking cramp, this dirty motherfucker, he got up in his bare feet and just walked into the bathroom and his fucking bear faith. I couldn't believe it. I, I was just as does this, no fuck, there's no fucking way. There is no fucking, and he just walked right in there.

Speaker 7:          01:26:23       I mean, he should've got a tetanus shot when he came out. I couldn't fucking believe it. How filthy is that? And you know what kills me? Women love fucking love. Musicians absolutely love him. CanNot get on their knees quick enough to jump down into their crab infested pubes and stick that fucking read in their mouth. You know, could give a fuck, could give a fuck about comedians. What are women doing after the end of the comedy show? They come up and they'd say, you're a loser for the place you're fucking working in. And then talk about what a piece of shit you are really loudly, which brings me to my underrated, underrated for the week. Learning how to play an instrument. Unbelievably underrated. You know, cause if you really stick with it, you can get in a band. And I see even if you suck, you're going to get some pussy and a, and if not, it's just, it's so much better than reading and it's better than, you know, you read, what are you doing?

Speaker 7:          01:27:22       You know, you're getting smarter. So what are you making the person's day next to you better you're not, but you actually learn how to play guitar. You can play drums or something like that. I Dunno. I just think it's, I think it's a great fucking thing. Um, you know, I'm actually excited because I actually, you know, I told you guys I bought this Les Paul Guitar and by the way, God rest his soul. You know, Les Paul died this weekend. I'm really bummed. I never got a chance to see that guy. That guy was still playing shows every Monday night in New York City. And when I was back in New York for the month of June, I actually tried to go see the guy. And um, unfortunately the night I was open where I could go see him, he was a, he wasn't performing that night, so I didn't get a chance to see him.

Speaker 7:          01:28:02       And uh, I'm really sad about it because, um, I dunno, that guy is legendary and I'm trying to see who I would put that guy up with. I mean, he, he's right up there with, for me anyways, all the inventors, I'm so stupid, Jesus Christ. But you're gonna put them up there with Einstein, the light bulb because the guy fucking did something with a guitar. You know what I'm going to hit my world is important. If you guys, if you're not, if you're not into a, if you don't play an instrument or anything like that, just, just Google images for a Gibson Les Paul and just look at how beautiful that Qataris. It's literally, it's literally a fucking work of art. And even if I didn't attempt to play guitar, I think I would still own one. Rather than going out and buying a painting, I would actually buy a Les Paul because that's how fucking beautiful they are.

Speaker 7:          01:28:57       But anyways, I'm actually learning how to play guitar. And a last week I discovered drop d tuning and it might've been the greatest sound I think I've ever produced as a human being on that Les Paul. It's just fucking sounded unbelievable. And uh, I can't wait to get back to my apartment to take out that guitar, to not read, to not watch TV and be informed on what's going on in the world. So I can continue to sound like a moron on this podcast so some people can continue to take me seriously and tell me how fucking dumb I am, even though that is my point of view.

Speaker 7:          01:29:33       What am I talking about? All right, let's wrap up with this. Now. You know, we have to do, we actually have to hype some of my shit. Okay. And by we, I mean me, I need to get better at this type of stuff. All right. And this is what I'm, I am going to be hyping for the rest of the biggest date that I have on the horizon for me, believe it or not, is my Improv Gig in Ontario, California. Okay. I live in Los Angeles and I'm not able to perform out in the La area because I have not shown to the clubs that I am a draw. You know, it's a, it's a weird, I gotta I gotta get on the, the, the Latino radio stations out there so I can get, you know, a significant portion of the population to at least kind of know who the hell I am.

Speaker 7:          01:30:20       Because, you know, I don't want to get on a fucking plane every other week. I just don't want to do it. Um, I just don't want to hear every once in a while I would like to fucking, you know, just be able to get in a car and drive. Like I did when I lived on the east coast. I drive down to Philly, I drive up to Boston, I take the fucking train down to DC, you know. So anyways, I have this Gig at the Improv in Ontario, California. It's a from September 17th through the 20th for the love of God. Can you and 58 of your closest friends buy some tickets and come out to that show? I never beg people to come out to my chefs. Maybe I do, but I, I don't gravel right now. I'm groveling for the love of God. Please show up to that show so I can somehow just have one weekend during the year when I don't have to fucking, you know, just be sitting there in row 33 Gandy attention please.

Speaker 7:          01:31:19       This is a very full flight. All of the overhead spaces going to be used up. So if you have one of your smaller, smaller containers, if you could just put it underneath your seat and please don't put your jackets in the overhead compartments. This is a very full flight and you know what? Everybody fucking blows it off and they're sticking lunchboxes and for length, fucking full length fucking coats as the ladies say in that. So just once I flying Tang is four hours in 58 minutes. Um, I would just, you know, every once in awhile we'd like to not have to fucking listen to that so I could just perform. And a in California, so for the love of God, could you southern California people, I know you got a lot of options for the love of God. Can you come out to my show?

I'm going to be there from September 10th through the 12th and I got a big date coming up in a, the Improv, Addison, Texas September 24th through the 26th possibly the 27th because I think I'm hanging around on Monday night because the cowboys got a football game and my life is awesome and I'm going to go to the fucking game and I'm going to look at those fucking blonde, big titted fucking Dallas whores with their Mary Kay cosmetics. You know who likes those broads? Is that guy from the playboy, the playboy. Ya what the fuck's his name? That Hugh Hefner, you know, he's really into that Tex Mex.

You know, just cause you dye your hair blonde and you're in shape doesn't mean you're good looking. Um, all right. I know I got a lot of fucking nerve balding redhead fucking throwing down like that. All right, let's, let's fucking get on with it. All right. That's the a podcast for this week that I did on a Sunday and I'll be uploading this thing, um, as I always do right around midnight.

Speaker 7:          01:33:50       Just to make sure that I, I never post them on a Sunday. If I posted it on a Sunday, then it would be a very special Monday morning podcast. And this one isn't special. This was sort of me bitching, which is sort of the standard. So anyways, I hope you guys all have a great week. Once again, thanks to everybody over at Capitol records.
