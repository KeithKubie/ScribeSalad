I'm studying medical chemistry and I

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
I'm studying medical chemistry and I
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.509
I'm studying medical chemistry and I
have two questions to be answered first

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519
have two questions to be answered first
 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.730
have two questions to be answered first
one is a question how would you probably

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
one is a question how would you probably
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.010
one is a question how would you probably
solve the problem of still growing

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
solve the problem of still growing
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.220
solve the problem of still growing
population and the second question way

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
population and the second question way
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.340
population and the second question way
important is okay hi

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350
important is okay hi
 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.450
important is okay hi
so Martina what I'll get to your second

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
so Martina what I'll get to your second
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.040
so Martina what I'll get to your second
question at the end the growing

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
question at the end the growing
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.580
question at the end the growing
population is a problem but notice that

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590
population is a problem but notice that
 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.440
population is a problem but notice that
the rate that the population is growing

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
the rate that the population is growing
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420
the rate that the population is growing
human population is growing is slowing

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
human population is growing is slowing
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.380
human population is growing is slowing
down and this is almost certainly not so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
down and this is almost certainly not so
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420
down and this is almost certainly not so
much a consequence of finite resources

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
much a consequence of finite resources
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.000
much a consequence of finite resources
which is what people like Malthus

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
which is what people like Malthus

you as women and girls get better

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
you as women and girls get better

educated they have fewer kids and the
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859
educated they have fewer kids and the
kids they do have have more resources so

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
kids they do have have more resources so
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.270
kids they do have have more resources so
they're better taken care of and they

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
they're better taken care of and they
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820
they're better taken care of and they
are more successful so what we want to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
are more successful so what we want to
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.300

fast as we can so that there will be
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330

coming years the Popular's population is
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.539
coming years the Popular's population is
almost certainly going to go to 9

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549

billion and apparently the earth has

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
billion and apparently the earth has
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.569
billion and apparently the earth has
enough resources for that and we just

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
enough resources for that and we just
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.330
enough resources for that and we just
have to redistribute or reconfigure the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
have to redistribute or reconfigure the
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.020

solvable problems and I'm excited to be

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
solvable problems and I'm excited to be
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.340
solvable problems and I'm excited to be
working on them every day like even

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
working on them every day like even
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.980
working on them every day like even
right now I'm working on so how do we go

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
right now I'm working on so how do we go
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.979
right now I'm working on so how do we go
about doing this it's important to keep
