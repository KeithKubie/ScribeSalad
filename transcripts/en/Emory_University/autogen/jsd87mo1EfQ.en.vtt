we have to choose disorders where we

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840
we have to choose disorders where we
 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.020
we have to choose disorders where we
know the need is there but we have a

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030
know the need is there but we have a
 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.290
know the need is there but we have a
window of opportunity to

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300
window of opportunity to
 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.390

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400
so this might not work as well for say
 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.450
so this might not work as well for say
somebody who has a life-threatening

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460
somebody who has a life-threatening
 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.950
somebody who has a life-threatening
disorder that you need to do something

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
disorder that you need to do something
 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.159
disorder that you need to do something
within 24 hours but since we're we can

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169
within 24 hours but since we're we can
 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.550
within 24 hours but since we're we can
see this coming long ahead this is the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560
see this coming long ahead this is the
 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.200
see this coming long ahead this is the
type of ailment we're with the window

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210
type of ailment we're with the window
 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.610
type of ailment we're with the window
two to three weeks it takes rest

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620
two to three weeks it takes rest
 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.469
two to three weeks it takes rest
produced two cells and then to

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479
produced two cells and then to
 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.510
produced two cells and then to
administer so we're basically we feel

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520
administer so we're basically we feel
 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.129
administer so we're basically we feel
that treating up to a dozen kids could

that treating up to a dozen kids could
 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.939
that treating up to a dozen kids could
be done within a year we don't do

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.060
healthcare I think these types of
programs that really show this kind of

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.070
programs that really show this kind of
 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.360
