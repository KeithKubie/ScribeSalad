00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Good morning.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.999
I am David Ferriero, I'm the Archivist of the United States

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and it's a real pleasure to welcome you to my house this morning.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.499
And a special welcome to those who are joining us by webcast.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.499
I know there are a number of library schools participating

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.499
and it's a pleasure to welcome you especially the folks in Boston - hello, Simmons!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.499
This is a fitting place for this meeting.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.499
This is a house that holds history

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.499
and I believe today we are making history so it's very

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.499
appropriate that we're all here together.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.499
I want to knowledge two very special people this morning .

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.499
We wouldn't be here if Bob Darnton of Harvard haven't taken this on as a personal cause.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.499
And I have first-hand information from my five years at the NYPL, where Bob is a trustee

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.499
and the conversations we had about doing something here in this country.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.499
Bob, thank you very much for getting us started.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.499
[Applause]

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Another important person is Doron Weber and all the folks from Sloan

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.499
who saw the importance of this and actually put money to where we were going

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.499
and made this possible. Thank you very much. [Applause]

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.499
We are lucky to have with us graphic reporters,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Martin and Heather are capturing what is happening today which which is wonderful.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.500
The work streams met yesterday at George Washington University

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.499
and we want to thank them for making that possible.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.499
Thank you to all the the DPLA team, the Secretariat

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.499
and the Steering Committee for making yesterday such a productive day.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.500
I am high on DPLA and you will hear more from me in the next session,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.499
but it's a real special treat to be here this morning.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.499
And a special treat to introduce a new member of the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.499
administration who came back to Washington just before I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.499
did in August 2009, James Leach who is the chair of the Endowment for the Humanities,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.499
Jim served 30 years in Congress and as I reminded him this morning,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.499
we have his records upstairs. [Laughter] Jim Leach.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.499
[Applause] Thank you, David. I want to tell you a story.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.499
We had a meeting a few months back

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.499
and someone came up to me

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.499
and said some of the nicest things

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.499
and I was kind of blushing.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.499
The person looked up and said you are the archivist, aren't you? [Laughter].

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.499
I am in David's shadow.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.499
I would like to join this revolutionary throng

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.499
in thanking David and the National Archives for hosting this meeting

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.499
and make a few observations from NEH's perspective.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.499
NEH is in the knowledge development and dissemination business.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.499
We are concerned with recording of the accumulated knowledge of the past and facilitating research in the future.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.499
We're concerned that the concept of research is being co-opted by science in a time

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.499
when humanistic understanding has never been more important.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.499
We're full bore in support of scientific in endeavor,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.499
but we also think it critical to prioritize idea exploration

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.499
and access to the wisdom of the ages.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Half a century ago the English physicist and novelist, C.P. Snow gave a controversial lecture called "The Two Cultures"

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.499
in which he lamented gulf between scientists and what he called "literary intellectuals".

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.499
He cited several six samples.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.499
Scientists are hard to break beckons

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.500
and humanist who couldn't to find the second law of thermodynamics.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.500
The Gulf might be described as a literacy matching in numeracy in academia.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.499
Snow held the breakdown of communications between the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.499
sciences and humanities hindered solutions to problems.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.499
What is the situation five decades later? The science

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.499
and humanities division is more extreme today as physics

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.499
has become math dependent, biology more complex and scientific or theoretical.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.499
From a methodological perspective the technological

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.499
revolution began with the digital computer which was

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.500
discovered at Iowa State University and allows humanities

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.499
and sciences to share an increasing portion, Brown.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.499
Digitization of books enables the application of methods

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.499
to vast amounts of social science data. Technology

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.499
and the Internet give an open window to humanities.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.499
The social market of our times is the emergence of a new

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.499
digital class characterize by his -- then by curiosity.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.499
The important division in the new communications aides is

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.499
no longer the one between science and humanities.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.499
It is a -- you have crossed the digital divide

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.499
and those who seek information from diverse sources with an open-minded perspective.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.499
The question of whether -- would cause greater understanding

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.499
and social integration at the community level

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.499
or lead to greater tolerance is yet too be resolved.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.499
What is clear is that few revolutions in history can

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.499
match the consequences for learning a big development

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.499
spread of digital communications devices

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.500
and the software capacities that fueled the use of hardware.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.499
The issue of the quality has been looked upon as a

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:15.500
political ideal type two techniques and organization and governmental policies.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.499
In the modern world access to knowledge -- an opportunity

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.499
across the globe and has access to the ballot boxes

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.499
and been the key to advancing political rights.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.500
The development of marks and letters represent words, the invention of paper

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.499
and the printing press have been sitting stages in human progress.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.499
The concept of establishing in the public domain

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.499
and a vast conglomeration of written material

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.500
and created matter appears to be an extension of these prior revolutions.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:02.499
We don't know how such an institution will be managed or how it will progress.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.499
We don't know what to call the enterprise.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.499
We don't know how the cost burden of the effort will be

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.500
shared between corporations and nonprofit community and governmental bodies.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.499
We do know that shortly we are going to hear from the

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.499
21st century incarnation of James Smithson.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.499
Whatever the cost, if storage is far cheaper

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:36.500
and user-friendly than localized efforts with diverse standards and methodologies.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.499
Last evening at the White House we enrolled a documentary

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:51.499
called freedom writers that recently won three Emmys.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:09:00.500
After showing the film about young civil-rights pioneers beaten in prison in 1961,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.499
the audience was given a chance to interview several.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:14.499
When a student was asked what she

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.499
and others thought they would achieve when they started

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:27.499
out? Her response was they didn't know.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.499
All they knew was it is the right thing to do.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:38.499
Despite knowing what to expect,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:45.500
facilitating this advance in ideas may be the greatest policy option.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:54.499
Just as we need an infrastructure of roads and bridges,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.499
we need an infrastructure of ideas. Thank you. [Applause]

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.499
Hello everybody, it's a pleasure to be here

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.499
and to participate in the first public plenary meeting.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.499
It's gratifying to see an impressive group of leaders and experts both academic

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.499
and public from cultural institutions, technology companies

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.499
and people who care about education and community.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:30.499
Thank you to the DPLA steering committee and the DPLA secretary

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:36.499
and a special thank you to our host.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.499
Although we have been working on the DPLA concept for 1

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.499
year and people have been talking about it

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:50.499
and striving toward the digital library system,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.499
today we are announcing the biggest effort yet to make

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.499
the stream library system a reality.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:04.499
The digital resolution may render the library

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.499
insufficient but it has given us a digital tools to

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.499
create a new paradigm where people can go

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.499
and access knowledge online while preserving the physical

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:24.500
library as a center for community, education and empowerment.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:30.500
The digital public Library of America helped us make this shift.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:40.499
Participants at this meeting agreed to work together

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:48.499
toward the creation of an open network of comprehensive

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.499
online resources that would draw on the nation's heritage

00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:01.500
from libraries, archives and museums to educate and empower future generations.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:10.499
The meeting generated excitement and energy.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:16.499
By January 2012 a blue ribbon steering committee was

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:24.499
formed and an active discussion was created.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.499
In March the first meeting was held and in April,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:35.499
DPLA met with funders and gained additional support.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.499
In  me they met on ways we might work together.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:48.499
They developed a working prototype. In June,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.499
DPLA helped -- to support the legal work stream of the

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.500
DPLA initiative by developing solutions to copyright obstacles.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.499
By July or 440 submissions were received

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.499
and in September a review panel selected the promising candidates for development.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.499
Today we are seeing a grassroots progress for the

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.499
national library system to develop the prototype into content digitization efforts.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:23.499
DPLA has accomplished a lot in 1 year.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.499
You see the major leaders in this room today but a lot

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.499
remains to be done. We are a common format

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.499
and shared platform to facilitate discovery

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:39.499
and exposure of our digital heritage content.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:44.499
Collections that exist like the library of Congress,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:51.500
Stanford University, the Boston public Library and the Internet archive.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.499
We're also talking about K-12 education

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.499
and letting students provide a topic.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.499
Empowering people in community colleges.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:13.499
Practical tasks like looking for employment,

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.499
renovating your house or looking at genealogy.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:24.499
Shared code and interoperable data

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.499
and cooperative collection building with other nations in

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:35.499
Europe, Asia and Latin America.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:43.499
Mobile apps that social media sites and books.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.499
Pamphlets, newspapers, and much more.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.499
The Digital Public Library of America is a big bold idea for the digital age

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.499
and the effort to support the existing library system

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.499
and assist knowledge to people everywhere.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:07.499
The Sloan foundation has approved a two port five they

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:16.500
don't grant in support of the DPLA initiative over the next two years.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:30.500
That Grant has been matched by the Arcadia foundation with another $2.5 million.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:41.499
I would now call a Peter Baldwin.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.499
I will be brief but I'm willing to bet there were a few

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.499
people in this room who have heard of the Arcadia fund until this moment.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:55.499
We are not a big foundation,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.499
but we share a lot of interest in common with them

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.499
and one of these is digitization.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.499
We've been working on digitization for several years.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.499
We have collaborated with Harvard and UCLA.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:18.499
We have a project with the national Library of Israel.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:27.499
We are cooperating with the Hill foundation.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:35.499
We are trying to cooperate with the Internet archive.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.499
All of these are a boutique digitization projects.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:48.499
It is with pleasure we are able to stand here today

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.499
and be part of this move of the digitization project to a

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:59.499
new level into its Wal-Mart phase.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:05.499
We are delighted to be able to punch above our weight in

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.499
present company. Thank you for letting us be part of this.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.500
We think it is a project if it is accessible could change

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:21.500
things. Thank you. [Applause]
