all different one thing that was very
 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.719
all different one thing that was very
striking today is we listen to all the

lot of them try the same experiments and
 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.960
lot of them try the same experiments and
got similar results some of them are

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970
got similar results some of them are
 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.909

breaks or different focuses and so we

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139
breaks or different focuses and so we
 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.020
breaks or different focuses and so we

accurate a number of our speakers we're

accurate a number of our speakers we're
 

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:30.870
accurate a number of our speakers we're
talking about really doing this at the

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880
talking about really doing this at the
 

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.909
talking about really doing this at the
community level for some of our big

00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:32.919
community level for some of our big
 

00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:34.799
community level for some of our big
local cities like New York the city is

00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:34.809
local cities like New York the city is
 

00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:37.220
local cities like New York the city is
just too big to think about doing this

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.230
just too big to think about doing this
 

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.960
just too big to think about doing this
effectively the only cities has to be

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:39.970
effectively the only cities has to be
 

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.940
effectively the only cities has to be
the only entity for doing this something

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:41.950

some development occurs in communities

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:43.270
some development occurs in communities
 

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.450
some development occurs in communities
like the Union Square partnership and

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:45.460
like the Union Square partnership and
 

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.370
like the Union Square partnership and
presumably this is true of many of our

other big cities is you need to have

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:49.570

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.200
other big cities is you need to have
just as we say that the virtue of cities

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.210
just as we say that the virtue of cities
 

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:52.950

that relative

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960
that relative
 

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.720
that relative
to the nation-state is that they can be

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:54.730

attempted to two distinctive local needs
circumstances and preferences and

00:17:59.580 --> 00:17:59.590

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.880
circumstances and preferences and
stakeholders so when within a big city a

neighborhood people who are at working

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960
neighborhood people who are at working
 

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.480
neighborhood people who are at working
at the neighborhood level can even can

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.490
at the neighborhood level can even can
 

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.269
at the neighborhood level can even can
be attentive to the particular needs and

00:18:09.269 --> 00:18:09.279
be attentive to the particular needs and
 

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:11.159
be attentive to the particular needs and
circumstances and preferences and

00:18:11.159 --> 00:18:11.169

and so I think we need to have that

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:14.770
and so I think we need to have that
 

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.799
and so I think we need to have that
community-based level as well as a city

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:16.809
community-based level as well as a city
 

00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:18.930
community-based level as well as a city
level and at the other end we need to

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:18.940

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.060
