00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.590
My name is Laura Forese. I'm Class of '83,
civil engineering and operations research.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.550
I'm currently the chief medical officer and
chief operating officer at New York Presbyterian

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.710
Weill Cornell. At New York Presbyterian, I'm
responsible for the Weill Cornell campuses.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.040
It's about a thousand beds on two different
sites, and I have the honor of essentially

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.380
making things go. The chance to talk to patients
and to staff really at all levels is one of

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.260
the most important things that I do. My assistant
would tell you that she often can't find me

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.780
because my favorite thing is to escape and
just wander around the institution. Right

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.770
after I left Princeton, I went immediately
to medical school, and there it was pretty

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.780
clear to me that I wanted to be a surgeon.
The field I ended up in is orthopedic surgery,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.370
where my engineering background was a tremendous
asset. Matthew Larson was a little boy that

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.830
I knew well who was diagnosed with a brain
tumor at age two, and he fought a valiant

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.070
effort for about five years, but ultimately
he succumbed. His family started the Matthew

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.890
Larson Foundation for Pediatric Brain Tumor
Research. Currently, I'm chair of the medical

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.250
advisory committee. We've been able to raise
millions of dollars for this foundation, and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.680
we're delighted to be able to sponsor cutting-edge
research.ÃŠI hope that we'll be able to cure

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.920
this disease so that no children, no family
will be affected in the same way that I've

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.670
seen the Larson family affected. I think surgery
has a lot of parallels that I can draw on

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.531
when I think about leadership. As a surgeon,
you are the captain of the ship, but you are

00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:10.950
not there alone, so you need to have a team
with you. You need to delegate, otherwise

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.450
you won't be successful; that patient won't
make it. Now, you have got to be transparent

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.250
and explain to people what you need done,
because no one can understand completely what

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.379
you, as the surgeon, are thinking. But you
have got to be willing and able to be decisive.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.030
You know, in an O.R., the patient's not going
to make it if you just stand there. And similarly,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.280
as a leader, sometimes you don't have all
the information that you want. You have got

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.620
to be willing to say, "I am going to go with
the best information that I have. I am going

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.900
to make the best decision that I can. And
if we were wrong we'll admit it and we'll

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.000
fix it but we won't just stand there." My
name is Laura Forese, and I'm a Princeton

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.669
Engineer.
