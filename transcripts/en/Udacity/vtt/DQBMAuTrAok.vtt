00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.780
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.640
&gt;&gt; So personally I said that
D is the most similar case.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.430
There are a couple of cases
that are closer to the origin,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.640
like A and B, but they both go in a very
different direction than we're trying

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.730
to go with Q.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.780
Similarly, E ends even closer to Q,
but E starts much further away.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.810
D looks like it's the one that
both starts closest to Q and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.530
ends closest to Q.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.215
&gt;&gt; D here is the right answer.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:25.710
Let us think how we can program an air
agent to come up with this answer.
