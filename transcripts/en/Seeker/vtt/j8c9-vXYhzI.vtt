00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.920
"Julian! Are you done with your homework?"

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.500
One sec, I'm playing an online game.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.500
"Well pause it."

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.100
You can't, you can't, you can't pause an online
game...[sobbing]

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.330
What up, players, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.539
Video games have been blamed for the decline
of children since pong…

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.660
The game pong… with the paddles.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.980
Look it up.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.550
Anyway whenever something goes wrong with
the youths, invariably someone will point

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.330
a finger towards video games.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.850
But is it possible someone could play a videogame
and still do well in school?

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.980
According to a new study from the Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology, it is in fact possible

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.280
to enjoy video games regularly and not become
a flunkie.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.640
The study drew data from PISA, the Program
for International Student Assessment, an international

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.219
survey that tests the math, reading, and science
skills of 15 year old students.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.899
The survey also collects information like
how much time a student spends online playing

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.160
games and their parent’s education level
and occupation.1

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.420
Using data from 12,004 Australian students,
the researchers assessed the correlation between

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.079
playing video games online and academic performance.1
They found that students who played games

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:09.799
almost every day performed substantially better
in all categories, scoring 15 points above

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.139
average in math and reading, and 17 points
above average in science.1

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:18.429
How or if video games had an impact on performance
is not something that can be figured out from

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.850
this sort of analysis; it’s a classic case
of correlation does not necessarily equal

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.850
causation.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.229
The author of the study, Alberto Posso1, suggested
a few different possible explanations.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.100
Maybe the games are having a direct impact
when they use concepts from math, science,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.219
or language as essential gameplay elements,
forcing players to master these concepts to

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.429
progress in game.1 It’s also possible that
people who enjoy math and reading prefer to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.490
play these types of games anyway.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.669
Interestingly the data also shows that more
games don’t always mean students are more

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:47.669
smarterer.

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:51.079
While scores generally went up the more students
played, they dropped again for students who

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.959
played every single day,1 possibly because
of the opportunity cost of playing games instead

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:56.959
of studying.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.140
This isn’t the first study to look into
the relationship between academic performance

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.109
and video games, and past research is a bit
of a mixed bag.

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.039
Another study published in Social Psychiatry
and Psychiatric Epidemiology in 2016 found

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.010
that children age 6 to 11 who play video games
are more likely to do well in school.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.069
In 2009 PLoS One published a review of PISA
results that found playing games had no big

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.379
impact one way or another.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.409
And a study from the University of Missouri-Columbia
in the year 2000 found a slight negative correlation

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.129
between GPA and time spent playing video games.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.849
So this new study out of Australia isn’t
exploring a new idea, but it does claim to

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.920
control for outside factors like a student’s
household and school environment better than

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.250
previous studies.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.440
One thing the study didn’t mention though
is what games these students were playing.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.000
If you’re a gamer you know not all games
are the same.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.470
There are adventure and puzzle games, platformers,
MOBAs, RPGs, MMORPGS, RTSes, FPSes, pretty

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.670
much every acronym you can think of.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.129
Could the genre have an impact on learning?

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.590
Some research says it does.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.989
A 2009 study in Issues in Mental Health Nursing
concluded violent games correlated to attention

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.079
problems while educational games were associated
with good academic achievement.

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.030
A study in Educational Technology Research
and Development from 2008 argued that massively

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.249
multiplayer games promote higher order thinking.

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:14.260
A 2005 paper from the Educause Evolving Technologies
Committee suggested strategy games foster

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.500
an understanding of economics and history.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.030
An engineering professor at Northern Illinois
University found students were more engaged

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.150
when their homework was to use numerical methods
to make a digital car navigate a racetrack.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.620
So if the content is good and the game doesn’t
become too time consuming, it looks like it’s

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:52.010
possible to be a gamer and a good student.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.219
You 
may be wondering what happens in people’s

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.829
brains when they play video games.

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.849
Well good news, because Trace has a video
on exactly that, and you can find it right

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:20.430
here.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.919
Does gaming ever cut into your academics,
or do you think it’s helped you in some

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.400
way?
