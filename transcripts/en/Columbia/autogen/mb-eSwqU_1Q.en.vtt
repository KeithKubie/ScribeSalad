it is that we need to learn from it and
 

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.610
it is that we need to learn from it and
then most importantly for sites of

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620
then most importantly for sites of
 

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.070
then most importantly for sites of
conscience and they try to use people's

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080
conscience and they try to use people's
 

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.510
conscience and they try to use people's
stories to tap into what the questions

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520
stories to tap into what the questions
 

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.820
stories to tap into what the questions
are that the place closes for us today

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:58.830
are that the place closes for us today
 

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.070

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.039
 
questions so these are the ways that i

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:07.049
questions so these are the ways that i
 

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:08.330
questions so these are the ways that i
think these sites are really trying to

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340
think these sites are really trying to
 

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.340
think these sites are really trying to
use these histories so that was all just

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:13.350
use these histories so that was all just
 

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.870
use these histories so that was all just
to give you a little bit of example of

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880
to give you a little bit of example of
 

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.960
to give you a little bit of example of
how we've worked and to date and what

how we've worked and to date and what
 

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.549
how we've worked and to date and what
these sites are about what are some of

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559
these sites are about what are some of
 

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:21.529
these sites are about what are some of
the issues that they wrestled it because

the issues that they wrestled it because
 

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:23.270
the issues that they wrestled it because
all of this is now being brought to bear

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280
all of this is now being brought to bear
 

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.360
all of this is now being brought to bear
on a new project that we're working on

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:26.370
on a new project that we're working on
 

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.480
on a new project that we're working on
to tap the power and the lessons of a

a little bit about this at lunch but
again that the sites and the coalition

00:21:40.159 --> 00:21:40.169
again that the sites and the coalition
 

00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:43.450
again that the sites and the coalition
have tremendous amounts of experience

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:43.460
have tremendous amounts of experience
 

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:49.970

have been wiped off the map by there
 

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.210
have been wiped off the map by there
because they have literally been

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.220
because they have literally been
