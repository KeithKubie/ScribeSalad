00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.050
These two lines look likely to be repeated in every prototypal class.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.270
After all, a prototypal class needs some object that it can operate on and then,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.030
it needs to make sure that, that object delegates to some prototype object and

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.430
lastly, of course, it needs to return that object.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.090
So we can expect that all of these operations are going to happen in

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.650
every single prototypal class.
