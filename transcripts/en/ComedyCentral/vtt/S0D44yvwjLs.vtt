00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:03.102
let's get...

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:03.803
[snickers]

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:06.139
Ha-ha-ha.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.807
L-O-L.
L-O-L.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.143 align:start position:0%
Very funny, guys.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.477 align:start position:0%
And blastoff!

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.814
Let's start by asking
a simple question:

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:19.152
why are we here?

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.154
- Shouldn't you know
the answer to that?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.355
- Of course, Baron.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:23.489
Because that was
a rhetorical question.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.825 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Okay.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.361
We just need to brainstorm
five ideas.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.329
- But to be safe,
let's come up with 50.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.165
- Let's make it 100!
- Any idea is welcome

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.133
when brainstorming.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.634
Literally anything you say
will be discussed

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.069
in detail without criticism.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.471
- My brain just stormed an idea.

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:40.139
How about
we call off this meeting

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.140
until Christian gets back?

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:42.475
- Come on, that's a bad idea.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.811
- I thought we weren't gonna
criticize ideas.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.546
- Fine. Yeah.
Let's put it on the board.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.781
[clears throat]
- Any other ideas?

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.249
- We're going into
a brainstorm hole.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.185
I can literally
say anything right now.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.653
Racism.
- Racism.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.854
Great idea.
- Nice.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.456 align:end position:100%
- Jesus Christ,
this is a nightmare.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.824
- What's that, Matt?

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.826 align:end position:100%
- Oh, I just said
that this is a nightmare.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.095
- This is a nightmare.
Great.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:04.163
- You know, this reminds me
of when I was selling

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.399
cigarettes wholesale
to health food stores

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.167
back in the '70s.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.203
At the time, we didn't know
they were bad for you.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.805
Or, actually, we did know,
but we kept a lid on it.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:14.407
Back then, you were allowed
to have secrets.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.743
Secrets from the government,
from your wife.

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.345
It didn't matter!

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:21.681 align:end position:100%
- I hope my grandma died
doing what she loved most:

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.883 align:end position:100%
sitting in her chair,
worrying that I'm gay.

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.451
- Your grandma's lucky.

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.420
When you're dead, nobody
expects anything from you.

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:29.155
Death is
the retirement package you get

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.623
for a lifetime full
of pain and suffering.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:32.625
- That's why I say
you should always bring a gun

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:33.893
to a knife fight,

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.761
or a knife to a gun fight,
if you wish.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.797
Now, you might die,
but at least no one can say

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.633
you weren't interesting.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.801
- Thank you...

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.669 align:start size:44% position:56%
so much, Bill.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.171 align:start size:41% position:59%
Very helpful.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.239 align:start size:50% position:50%
Does anyone have
a coherent idea?

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:52.578
- Hey, guys?

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:53.880
Guys!

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.715
Can we get off our phones
and focus up?

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.551
- You know, we didn't
used to have phones in meetings.

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:01.687
Back then, if you wanted
to send someone a nudie pic,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.657
you had to show up at their door
wearing just a trench coat

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.826
and show them what you got!

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.461
Your thoughts?

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:10.463
- Yeah, well, Bill makes
a good point here.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:11.464
Um...

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.232
Oh.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.367
Here's an idea.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.701
How about
we try something new

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:18.171
and have everyone in the room

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.772
put their phones

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:20.873
in this box.

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:22.142
<i> [screaming]</i>
- No!
