Speaker 1:          00:01          The Joe Rogan experience. What essentially was hacking Dharma? Like what was the motivation behind it? Was it for a person like me or was it for everyone? Like as far as for everyone. And so what I really wanted to do, so the background's going to be gift. I can give you just a little bit of background. So more than 20 years ago I was working on the National Security Council and my then boss, um, Richard Clark, who was then this obscure White House official who is jumping up and down saying we need to be focusing on terrorism and al Qaeda and bin Laden. And he was trying to tell everybody and nobody was paying attention to is totally marginalized. And when nine 11 happened, I'm Dick's memo was on George Bush's desk saying exactly that we need to focus on [inaudible]. Here's what's going to happen to, and Dick even before then would always tell me that if everyone in Washington was focusing on one thing, you could be sure there was something much more important that was being missed.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And so more than 20 years ago, I was looking around and I saw these little pieces of disparate information and I came to the conclusion that the genetics revolution was going to change everything. So I educated myself. Um, I started writing articles. I was invited to testify before Congress and then to try to get that story out. I was, I started, I wrote my, my two most recent, um, near term Scifi novels, Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata. And when I was on book tours for those and I explained the science, uh, to people the way I kind of a self educated citizen scientist, um, and a novelist would explain the science, all of a sudden people got it. And that was when I realized I needed to write a book about the genetics revolution that people could absorb that wouldn't scare people. But my mission for the book is that this stuff, as we've talked about, it's so important that everybody needs to be part of the conversation.

Speaker 1:          01:43          We have this brief window and what I'm calling for is this species wide dialogue on the future of human genetic and genetic engineering. And I have a whole game plan, uh, in the book about what people can do, how they can get involved, a people individually on a national level. We have to put a lot of pressure on our elected leaders and say, stop focusing on the crap. There is really important stuff that needs to be addressed and we need leadership. I'm going to, I'm speaking on, uh, in, uh, in Congress, um, and we can a half from now talking about about these issues. So we need to have an them on an international level. We have to have some kind of international system. We're so far away from being able to do that. We don't even know what the standards are, but we have to be pushing it.

Speaker 1:          02:27          So I know you think of it in terms of like the same way we have with nuclear weapons. Yeah. In a way. And in many ways. Yeah. But the thing is with nuclear weapons, a lot of that happened at the state level, at the country level. This needs to happen at a popular level and at a, uh, at a government level. So the only way that those that's going to happen effectively as we need, um, real comprehensive education on the subject. It's not something that people can just guess. Right. And need to know what's the consequences, what where we're at right now. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And that's, and that's like Sanjay Gupta, um, had a wonderful quote that's actually on the cover of my book, which is if you can read one book on the future of our species, this is it. So what I've tried to do is to say like, if you just want to go to one place to understand what's happening, what's at stake, what it means for you and what you can do now if you want to get involved. I've tried to do that, but then ironically I'm now like, as I mentioned, being asked to speak to thousands of doctors and scientists because they're all reading this book and they're saying this is, this is positioning my work in, in a much bigger content.

Speaker 2:          03:25          Sanjay Gupta is a very interesting cat because he was very anti marijuana and then started doing research on it and then totally flipped 180 degrees. Yeah. Which to me is a great sign of both humility and intelligence. I recognize that the data was different than his presuppositions. Yeah. He had these prejudices that were very common. Yeah. Yeah. Now, when you speak to Congress, yeah. What do you, do they brief you in terms of like what they would like specifically for you to address? No.

Speaker 1:          03:54          So this one, um, it's, uh, I've been asked to go and speak into a lot of members of congress who were going to be invited. And what I'm going to tell them is, look, this is really important. Our congress is not doing enough and here are the things that we need to do. And what are you going to say to try to really get it into their head? What I'm going to say is that the genetics revolution is here. If we don't have a system, if you don't have a rational system to manage it, if we don't have a system. You talked about public education. The challenge that we face in the United States is we traditionally have had a representative democracy and now we're transitioning from a representative democracy to a popular democracy. So Switzerland has a popular democracy, but they have like really well educated people who are able, who have enough information to make smart decisions.

Speaker 1:          04:42          We haven't educated our public and yet the public is making big decisions and a lot of it is happening just on a gut feeling. That's what's happening with trade agreements where people just have, I have a feeling it's bad without the ability to, to, to really get into the, into the details. And so we are having that transition, which means there's a lot of responsibility on us to educate our public. And it's just, it's a tragedy. We treat people in this country. Like you can just throw people away like you somebody, if you're in some crappy school system and you know your, your, your chances of success are so minimized, not because of anything that you've done just because of your circumstances. And it's unacceptable.

Speaker 2:          05:20          It is only, sorry. I mean the equal opportunities, what we really should all strive for us, and I think some people conflate that with, uh, op equal success. Right? And you're not going to get the same equality of outcome. You're going to get different, different amounts of effort and different people are qualified or more talented at different things. But what I'm worried about is what I said initially, that some people are going to get a hold of this stuff quickly and it's going to give them an a massive advantage. Yes. Sort of like, I mean, if you, the first person that has the ability to go forward in time, five minutes,

Speaker 1:          05:58          right. Is going to be able to manipulate the stock market and yeah. Unprecedented way. Yeah. I don't think that that's really possible in our lifetime, but that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. You could get so far ahead that if we're talking about competition, that will be no catching up. They'd be, you don't have to travel in time to do that. Right. But I'm saying that if it was, but there's real technologies that are likely to happen, which are going to confer billions, tens, hundreds of billions of dollars of benefit of advantage. Yeah. And that stuff is happening now. And this is the concern with getting behind countries like China, cause if they get ahead of us and something like that when they were already moving in this direction in terms of technology. Yeah. So I am a proud American. My father and grandparents came here as refugees.

Speaker 1:          06:44          I believe in what this country at our best dance floor. I want us to continue to be the country that setting an example for the rest of the world that is articulating what our ideals of responsibility and governance, good governance and accountability and all these things that we have championed. And because of that, I want us to get our act together politically. And I want us to be the leading technological country in the world. Um, and so I think that's what's what's at stake and we're losing so much time because there was a time in the period after the Second World War where we recognize that technological leadership was the foundation for everything else we were, we had recreated the world out of the ashes of the, of the war. But we realized that we needed to have the economic growth. We needed to have the competition, we needed to have these technologies, and we've, it was a miracle. What we've, what we've done, and now we've lost our focus and we have to regain it.
