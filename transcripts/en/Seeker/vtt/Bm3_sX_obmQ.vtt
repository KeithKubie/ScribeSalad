00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.960
Is NASA lying to us?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.180
What's happening?

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.569
Antarctica is GAINING ICE!

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:05.569
WHAT?!

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.620
GLOBAL WARMING?!

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.940
HOW?!

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.840
Commonly, during these climate change, global
warming conversations, people point at the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.070
horizon and shout, the polar ice caps are
melting!

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.810
But guess what, they're not.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.810
NASA says so.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.130
In fact, according to new research, Antarctica
has gained so much ice, it's overbalanced

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.230
for the ice the continent has lost.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.640
From 1992 to 2001, the continent gained more
ice than it lost to melting to a tune of 112

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.760
billion tons every year!

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.670
So wait, if global warming is real, how come
Antarctica's ice is thickening?!

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.160
Okay, so, I apologize for the slightly clickbaity
headline, but to be honest, whether they're

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.690
lying to us a real question!

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.820
But did anyone lie?!

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.329
No, Internet buddies.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.329
No.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.309
In fact, this ice research is consistent with
other papers climatologists have released.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.070
In 2013, NASA's Earth Observatory announced
Antarctic sea ice had set a new record, another

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.479
study said the same thing in 2012!

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.070
There's more sea ice now than the 1981 to
2010 average levels!

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.680
I know what you're thinking, because I thought
the same thing.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.550
If the globe is warming, how can Antarctica
be gaining ice?!

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.060
Okay so, don't believe the hype.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.040
Research still states, unequivocally, Antarctica
is still losing ice at a fantastic rate across

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.450
most of the continent.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.060
Ice has increased in "East Antarctica and
the interior of West Antarctica."

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.600
But other parts of Antarctica are still melting.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.100
A lot, a lot.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.130
So, let's be clearâ€¦ gaining sea ice at this
point is actually bad.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.899
Yep, you heard me.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.899
Bad.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.340
Well, there's an annual cycle of sea ice melt
and freeze, where ice is at it's lowest point

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.520
in February and March, and thickest in September
and October.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.579
And according to a new not-yet-published paper,
from a NASA Goddard, scientist brought to

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.399
our attention by DiscoveryNews writer Patrick
J. Kiger: global warming and climate change

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.310
are actually INCREASING the sea ice.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.899
See, melting glaciers have been depositing
freshwater into the Southern Ocean, and if

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.480
you think about seventh grade science: which
freezes first saltwater, or freshwater?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.810
Exactly, saltwater has a much lower freezing
point; it can get colder before freezing.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.050
This paper's conclusion is the top layer of
water surrounding Antarctica has been diluted

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.510
by the massive freshwater melt from the ice
shelves and freezes more easily today than

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.650
in previous decades!

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.770
The 2012 study found a 1.5 percent increase
in sea ice accumulation each decade.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.640
And this isn't the only paper reaching this
conclusion.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.980
According to a 2012 paper in Nature which
also predicted this effect, it's happening

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.790
more quickly in the real world than it did
in their model; which is even more troubling.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.180
In a few more years, the new author James
Hansen says, "it will be clearer," because

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.440
the sea ice will continue to expand.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.310
Even worse, however, is the overall ice trend
is still more melty than freezy.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.480
It's melting and freezing and MELTING and
freezing.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.830
Plus saltwater underneath the freshwater dilution
is still warming thanks to the overall climate

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.840
trend.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.790
NASA scientists are quick to say, that it
is very difficult to accurately measure all

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.810
of these things, because of snow levels sitting
atop the ice, and the constantly changing

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.040
landscape of such a large area!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.740
The big learning from this, is that even though
the UN announced in 2013 a .27 millimeter

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.830
per year sea level rise, and blamed it on
increasing sea ice; there's more than meets

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.830
the eye.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.989
NOAA say YES the seas ARE rising, the thing
is, now we aren't 100 percent sure why.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.660
Which is almost scarier if you think about
it.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.371
Moving forward, scientists know they have
to learn even more about what is causing the

00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:55.370
sea level rise, because it might not just
be ice melt.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.069
The oceans have warmed about zero-point-one
Celsius over the last century, in the top

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.799
700 meters, and though that seems small, that's
just an average!

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.819
Something so small, over something as large
as the ocean, could completely change the

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.909
topography, weather, and expected behavior
of the largest single entity on Earth.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:14.909
Yikes.

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.470
So, climate people, who I assume have already
left this video huffing and hoing, more sea

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.740
ice doesn't mean no global warming, but in
fact MORE global warming.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.940
You're welcome.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.150
Sincerely, your friend science.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.960
How are you all feeling about this?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.300
