JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Are
we ready to go.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.740
All right.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.360
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.370
Thank you very much for
coming to our session.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.020
I know we have a lot
of interesting

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.890
talks to discover today.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.980
First, I would like to
start with a warning.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.510
We will have some good demos,
but they are nowhere near the

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.070
keynote demo.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.620
So I think they set us up
for failure today, but

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.370
we'll try our best.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.020
So let me first introduce
the speaker.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.990
Since we have quite a few
speakers today, I really want

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.120
to give you an overview of
what's going on in the mobile

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.730
space and YouTube.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.320
So we will have Andre
Doronichev, who is the product

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.100
manager for YouTube Mobile.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.860
He's the guy behind our
wonderful YouTube Mobile app.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.850
He will talk a little bit about
the past and the future

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.390
of YouTube Mobile.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.880
We will have guest
speakers from

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.500
Flipboard, Arthur and Jason.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.080
And they have recently
launched YouTube API

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.100
integration, so this
is very fresh.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.680
You will be able to learn
about their experience.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.560
Hopefully, they will not say
anything bad about our

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.930
performance.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.770
But we'll see.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.150
Then we have Kiran Bellubbi
from 955 Dreams.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.540
They build beautiful mobile
consumption experiences.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.680
He will give us a
demo of his app.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.580
And Krishna Menon
from WeVideo.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.820
They focus on creation.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.740
So we'll talk a little bit about
their architecture and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.140
what they're doing
with their app.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.300
Together with me, I also have my
buddy Shannon "JJ" Behrens.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.370
He will lead a panel
discussion towards

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.800
the end of this talk.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.360
So let's get into it.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.120
We'll talk about what's in it
for YouTube and for you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.630
developers when it comes
to mobile video.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.970
And then we'll talk about
specific three areas that we

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.080
are focusing on.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.690
The traditional strengths of
YouTube, which is creation and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.630
platform for content creation.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.440
We'll talk about curation, which
is something new that we

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.160
have been working on, and we
have a wonderful developer

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.300
ecosystem around it as well, a
lot of innovative companies

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.240
trying to surface content.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.610
And then we'll talk about
beautiful consumption

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.230
experience.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.650
And again, for all three of
them, we will talk about what

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.990
we do to enable it from API
standpoint and then give you

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.410
an example, real life
applications.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.720
At the end, we'll have a panel
discussion, where JJ has some

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.970
tough questions to our
participants, and then you are

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.830
welcome to join us and ask
your questions as well.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.760
So first, I would like to
introduce Andre, product

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880
manager of YouTube Mobile.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.190
And then, he will talk a little
bit about the past and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.730
the present and the future
of YouTube Mobile.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.600
Thank you, Andre.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.050
ANDRE DORONIHEV:
Thanks, Jarek.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Here you go.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.170
ANDRE DORONIHEV: Hey, guys.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.420
I wish I could land--

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.370
like sky dive down
here on stage.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.680
Unfortunately, I didn't today.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.530
I lead product management for
YouTube on Mobile across our

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.760
devices and mobile website.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.790
And I want to talk a little bit
about opportunities that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.900
we see in mobile videos.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.830
Now when we launched YouTube
Mobile back in 2006, it was,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.170
as many good products, it was a
toy, a toy for engineers, a

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.160
baby product.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.200
Well, guess what.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.530
It has grown up a
lot since then.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.580
Today, we're streaming 600
million playbacks per day on

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.480
mobile devices.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.870
Numbers are huge.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.450
Today, hundreds of millions of
phones and tablets can access

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.650
full YouTube experience.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.780
And what we really see
is how the user

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.830
perception is changing.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.830
So for many users today,
mobile is becoming the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.260
dominant way of accessing
YouTube.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.710
Another trend that we see is
that a lot of users see Mobile

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.890
YouTube as a core feature
of their device.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.300
They just expect it to be there,
like those guys, those

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.740
are my kids by the way.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.260
These guys, they just don't have
a concept of hey, this

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.080
video is not on the device.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.730
For them any touch screen phone
or tablet they can grab

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.050
is sort of a magical portal
that allows us to play any

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.200
video they have in
mind instantly.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.180
Now, you may say these guys are
biased, and they may be.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.560
But look at our stats.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.490
As I said, 600 million playbacks
per day, but what is

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.310
most fascinating is the pace
at which it is growing.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.240
3x year on year, just
in the past year.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.770
Three hours of mobile video
uploaded every single minute.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.560
So far, our goal with mobile
was just to make it work.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.270
We wanted to deliver great
consistent YouTube experience

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.810
across all sorts of
mobile platforms.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.390
And the way we achieved that
was the decision we made a

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.510
couple of years ago to focus on
Android application as our

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.200
core experience, as the place
where we showcased new

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.290
features and try out new stuff,
and then scale it

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.190
across platforms via HTML5.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.030
That worked really well, and
today you can access YouTube

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.160
from your Blackberry OS device
or Windows Phone or iOS

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.130
Android, pretty much any modern
smartphone or tablet.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.810
Now, what's next?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.250
You know the world is changing,
and YouTube is

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.450
definitely not a website
anymore.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.720
YouTube is this ecosystem of
different devices accessing

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.140
the cloud of video.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.180
And it's becoming more and
more channel centric.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.930
So as you have seen already
with the site redesign on

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.530
desktop, we are seeing ourselves
as the platform for

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.650
the world of hundreds of
millions of channels.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.570
So what we want to achieve with
mobile going forward is

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.700
to turn it into daily ritual,
this application that gives

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.900
you access to all your
subscriptions

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.760
wherever you are instantly.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.100
So let's say you have 10 minutes
to spare on the bus,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.410
you could just grab your phone,
open your field of

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.130
subscription updates, and
instantly watch whatever you

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.510
want to watch.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.190
Now, it will take us some
work to get there.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.960
We're quite not there yet.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.120
And here's our strategy, how
we want to get there.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.630
First of all, we need to
improve consumption

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.950
experience a lot.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.510
We acknowledge that.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.230
Second of all, monetization
is very important to bring

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.560
content to mobile.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.840
We need to make sure that
content creators have

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.110
incentive to shift the usage
from desktop to mobile.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.500
Otherwise, they wouldn't just
enable videos for mobile

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.030
consumption.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.290
And finally, well, you know how
they say today you cannot

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.195
spell capitalism without API
in it, so opening up the

00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:31.900
ecosystem is very important.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.440
Now, let me talk about
detail consumption.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.910
I'm not sure if you noticed yet
today, we launched the new

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.360
YouTube application for Android,
which is bigger than

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.680
just another update, because
it's really showcasing our

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.800
vision of future consumption
in the future.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.340
First feature that we launched
is the new UI

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.660
focused around channels.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.080
We call it the guide.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.040
When you launch the app, you
instantly get access to all

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.790
updates from your channels.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.360
And if you have a specific
channel in mind, like you want

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.940
to check out the latest
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.300
for example, you can very easily
swipe the UI to the

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.980
right and pick a particular
channel you care about.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.470
OK, you have all this great
video surfaced for you, but

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.460
you know how it happens.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.730
You're on the bus.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.990
You have all this
great content.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.070
You know there's something
really cool there.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.960
You try to watch it.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.740
The connection is very slow.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.740
And it's just a pain.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.760
Instead of watching the video,
you're watching the spinner.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.990
And this is unfortunately true
despite all the recent

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.060
improvements on mobile networks,
because it really

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.040
depends on many factors.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.300
Like right now, in [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.130
there are so many mobile
devices, the network is just

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.920
overloaded.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.290
So the second feature we're
introducing today with this

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.070
new application we call Wi-Fi
preloading, and it's quite

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.660
revolutionary in its way.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.525
What happens is any time your
phone is on Wi-Fi and charger

00:07:58.525 --> 00:08:02.540
we will predownload video
content into it and store it

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.400
securely on the device.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.130
So that next morning, for
example, you were on charger

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.940
and Wi-Fi overnight.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.930
You wake up in the morning.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.160
You get on the shuttle,
commuting to the office, and

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.150
you have flaky connection.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.430
You go through tunnels,
and so forth.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.070
But the video's already there,
so you enjoy flawless HD

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.720
quality playback in your phone,
and this is really a

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.730
great way to improve your
experience on the go.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.950
But now, we also acknowledge
that mobile devices are not

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.929
only used on the go.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.309
Truth is, the gesture UI is so
convenient, the touch UI is so

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.929
convenient, that many times
you find yourself like

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.159
chilling out on the sofa, and
instead of standing up and

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:48.455
turning on your laptop, you'll
grab your phone and explore

00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:49.900
YouTube on it.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.650
Now, touch screen is very good
for exploring and engaging

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.860
with videos, but video itself
was created to be watched on a

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.220
big screen TV.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.620
So the third feature we'll
launch in this

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.420
new UI is Play On.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.610
This allows you to connect, to
pair your phone with the TV in

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.620
the room or a smart TV in your
room, or like a TiVo box, or a

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.270
Nexus Q that was presented
today.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:20.380
And this way, you can take
best of both worlds.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.930
You're using the UI on the phone
to navigate the side and

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.220
pick the video to watch.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.430
And you're using the big
screen TV to play it.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.790
Now the best thing is that
unlike mirroring technologies,

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.750
here everything's happening
through the cloud.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.150
So while your TV is playing the
video, you can continue

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.330
exploring YouTube
with your phone.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.590
Or you can just leave the
YouTube app and keep it

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.690
playing there.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.960
Now to recap, the way we see
consumption in the future--

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.530
three things, it's
channel centric.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.950
It's optimized for streaming
on the go, and it makes

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.240
devices in the living room work
together in a way that

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.440
makes sense.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.510
Now switching the gears, the
second pillar of our strategy,

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.650
as I said, is monetization.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.120
And it is important, because
giving great monetization

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.790
options to our content creators,
we're unlocking

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.280
content on YouTube on mobile.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.850
And this is a very common
problem with many devices

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.830
today when you cannot play some
of the videos because

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.420
content creators just didn't
feel like enabling them.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.250
We want to make sure that they
have incentive and they have

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.750
great options to enable their
content for devices.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:37.430
Now, for advertisers mobile ads
on YouTube are actually

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.190
quite cool, because unlike many
other properties that

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.820
struggle with mobile
monetization, in the case of

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.100
YouTube the video ad format is
very well understood, and it

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.460
brings a lot of value
to advertisers.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.960
So they're willing to
pay more for it.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.940
Finally, by introducing
skippable formats, we're

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.670
giving users the choice to
only watch relevant ad

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.470
content, which is also
quite great.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.030
And finally, as I said,
third pillar of our

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.350
strategy is you guys.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.510
We've seen a lot of success with
mobile video recently,

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.350
and we really want to
share it with you.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.510
Well, of course, we don't want
you to use the API to build

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:21.060
clones of YouTube application,
or do things that are

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.860
prohibited by our policy, like
downloading content.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:30.250
But we see it as an opportunity
to explore new use

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.080
cases around embedding videos
into existing products or

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.700
building video centric
applications, like apps for

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.260
content creation, curation,
or different ways

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.740
of discovering videos.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:49.680
So to sum up, mobile video had
seen a lot of success, and

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.430
it's growing really
fast right now.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.700
But the ecosystem is
in the very early

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.910
stage, its very beginning.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.160
There is a lot of opportunity
with mobile video, and we

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.650
really hope that you guys will
take it to new heights.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:02.900
Thank you.

00:12:04.976 --> 00:12:06.226
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thanks.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.810
Thanks, Andre.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.330
All right.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.410
So now, first of all, quick
question for you guys.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.022
Who in the room has
used YouTube APIs?

00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:19.990
Oh wow.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.670
Great.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.190
So you don't really need this.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.550
For those of you that haven't,
a quick refresher.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.210
We have two sets of APIs, data
APIs and player APIs.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.310
Data APIs allow you to integrate
with our back end,

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.020
so pretty much everything you
can do on YouTube.com you can

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.960
do programmatically in
your application.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.830
Player APIs allow
you to customize

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.880
the playback behavior.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.930
And going back to our topic of
this talk, we will transition

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.030
to a specific APIs relevant to
the three menus cases that we

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.960
would like to promote.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.370
Before we get there though,
does anybody

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.620
know what this is?

00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.520
Exactly.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.940
So when I see this painting, it
puts creation in my mind.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.650
So we'll talk about creation.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.230
What APIs are relevant to
content creation on mobile.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.860
Well, first of all, you need
authorization in your

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.510
application so the
user can upload

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.200
video into their account.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.010
And in the old times, people
used client login, this is now

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.990
deprecated, and we are all
using OAuth 2, right?

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.180
Quiet.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.740
Yeah, unfortunately, that
is not the case.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.610
We're trying to make it easier,
however, in two ways.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.740
One is Android is actually
introducing a new way of

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.060
obtaining OAuth 2 token,
GoogleAuthUtil, and there's a

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.710
code sample of how we use
it right here below.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.810
As you can see, it's actually
quite simple.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.330
You invoke GoogleAuthUtil
authenticate method.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.030
You provide the user name and
the scope for the token.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.420
You can get a bunch
of exceptions.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.370
For example, if the user hasn't
authorized yet, you get

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.890
user recoverable
auth exception.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.350
If the system is overloaded,
you get a transit exception

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.110
telling you to retry later.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.240
And then, if things are really
bad, you will get a failure

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.680
exception, and that means
don't bother.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.930
You can just give
up right now.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.780
So this is Android.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.220
And for iOS, we have OAuth2
touch controller.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.420
I don't know if you guys have
seen this, but this is open

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.360
source code that wraps
the web view.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.180
It makes it very easy to
incorporate all of the flow

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.020
into your application.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.140
Another thing that is
important for upload

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.110
application is resumable
uploads.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.700
So if you have not used
them in your mobile

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.510
apps, check it out.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.890
Really the fundamental part
about it is it uses the

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.610
content rage mechanism from
HTTP, and here's a code

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.850
snippet of how you can use that
in your application if

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.440
you're not using a
client library.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.240
Really the gist of that is you
can query the system to figure

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.740
out how many bytes have
been uploaded if

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.290
the connection drops.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.100
So this gives you more than a
day to complete an upload.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.560
So somebody creates
a big video.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.510
You can keep trying in the
background, keep pushing some

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.750
bytes, curating to see how much
content has been uploaded

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.860
and received by us.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.950
And then try again until the
completion, so it makes,

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.990
actually, the upload experience
a lot less

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.250
frustrating for the user.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.420
And then, finally, metadata
is very important.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.280
We drive video discovery through
metadata related video

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.430
content and so forth.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.530
So couple of pieces that
are important.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.560
The developer key, so you can
monitor the performance of

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.600
your application.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.580
We actually grant more quota for
applications that identify

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.260
themselves with a
developer key.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.020
That's actually required
for uploads.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.460
Some people don't know about
this little trick here.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.820
You can actually add additional
tax to your upload

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.830
that are scoped within
the developer key.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.440
So they are not searchable
on YouTube.com.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.410
They are not visible in the user
metadata, but they are

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.860
visible in your application.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.250
So then, for example, you can
encode additional information

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.440
about the upload that is
meaningful to your

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.040
application.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.590
It may not be meaningful
to YouTube.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.270
It's totally opaque to us.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:06.720
And location information, APIs
allows you to submit the

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.390
markup that identifies the
location of the upload.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.420
Obviously, you need the user's
permission, but that is very

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.790
handy, because then you can
query for videos, for example,

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.160
within specific radius
and so forth.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.730
So here's one example of how
I typically do this.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.140
Without a client library, you
can just create a template,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.190
populate it with the metadata,
and then you will get back,

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.000
you will actually post a
document that kind of looks

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.850
like this one with all the major
pieces of the metadata.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.040
Here's my developer tag that
I was talking about and my

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.520
geolocation information.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.720
So to put it in context.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:51.800
I put a quick app together that
allows you to basically

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.320
capture video.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.180
Let's launch it.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.320
So I'm actually asking
for the account.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.430
I want to use my account.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.980
And then what this app does is
actually, it records video

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.089
from the camera, but it does
it frame by frame.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:15.890
And it applies a nice little
effect to the video frames as

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.560
they are received.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:24.794
So I am recording our panelists,
and then I can then

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:25.930
add the metadata.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:31.700
So I'm using the tags that
we were talking about.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.380
And then submit.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.380
Agree to terms of service, and
now I'm using resumable upload

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.650
to upload the video
to YouTube.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:44.090
OK.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.925
So this is my little demo.

00:17:45.925 --> 00:17:47.990
We'll come back it to
it a little later.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:53.330
But I'm not a pro, so I'd like
to now transition to pros that

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.570
actually build content creation
application and

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.090
introduce Krishna
from WeVideo.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.415
Over to you, Krishna.

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:02.260
KRISHNA MENON: Hi, everybody.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.440
My name is Krishna Menon.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.060
I'm the CTO for WeVideo.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.170
And today, I wanted to talking
about our cloud based video

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.365
editor, which we've obviously
integrated with YouTube.

00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:14.940
But before I get started, I
wanted to show you a short

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.690
video clip.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.890
And hopefully, the idea here is
to give you an idea of what

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.570
the platform is capable of
doing in terms of the

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.710
capabilities for
video editing.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.840
Now, just to set
it in context.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.920
This video was created as part
of a marketing campaign for

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.350
the movie Avengers.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.920
And for lack of a better
name, it's a process.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.860
I'll call it crowd sourcing
of movie trailers.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.200
So they put a bunch of short
video clips from the movie up

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.810
on our platform, and then
invited users to come in and

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.470
use our editor to create
a trailer.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.130
So this was created completely
on our platform by somebody

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.440
who's not a professional
editor.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.590
SAMUEL L. JACKSON: War
has started, and we

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.185
are hopelessly outgunned.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.470
MALE SPEAKER: We're
not a team.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.185
We're a time bomb.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.740
KRISHNA MENON: This is very well
done, and hopefully you

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.410
noticed that the kinds of
effects that were done and

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.920
also how the audio and video
effects are synchronized.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.640
And all of that was done
on WeVideo by really an

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.820
nonprofessional editor.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.920
So, now a little bit
about what the

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.990
architecture of WeVideo.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.110
So it's completely cloud based
if you look up on the top.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.090
It's in the cloud.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.440
The content is delivered
using a CDN.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.410
The storage could be
either our storage.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.390
We also integrate with
Google Drive.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.650
So the content itself could be
sitting on another cloud

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.920
storage system.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.390
In terms of applications, we
have applications both for the

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.790
consumer and the prosumer, and
we also like to cover all the

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:36.520
different devices.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.780
We've got applications
for smartphones,

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.460
tablets, and the desktop.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.650
And what I'm going to do is
quickly show you some of the

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.860
user experiences on the
smartphone and the tablet, so

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.330
you can see what are the kinds
of things we do on those

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.830
applications.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:54.610
And so first thing I want to do
is just bring up our camera

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.260
application.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.210
So this is intended for
the smartphone.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.610
The idea here is that for us
this is an acquisition device,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.970
but it also gives you the
ability to trim content.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.810
So it also allows you
to apply effects and

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.120
also share it to YouTube.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.550
So if you look at the projects
here, and if I pick one of the

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.150
projects, and I want to add some
content, what it allows

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.800
you to do is upload content from
a gallery, or record a

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.470
video, or take a picture.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.150
I'm not going to record a video
here, but I do have

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.120
something in the gallery.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.580
I did go ahead and record Jarek
when he was talking.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.097
So if I just load that
up, and obviously, I

00:21:30.097 --> 00:21:33.090
can play it out here.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.450
And then what I can do is I kind
of trim it if I wanted to

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.770
cut out parts of it.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:40.030
So for us, everything is in real
time, so any trimming or

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.860
applying effects, we want to
avoid the rendering process.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.570
Everything needs to be done in
real time, so we'll try to

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.300
preview it.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.350
And the key to that is you use
proxy files for content, so we

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.980
use a lower bit rate file that
gives you the same kind of

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.560
user experience.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.800
Once I'm done with my
trimming, I can

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.370
do a style and share.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.180
Since this is intended for a
smartphone, we try to optimize

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:00.890
it for the real estate.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.780
So we have these things called
themes, and themes are

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.660
automated effects, which apply
both video effects and also

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.640
audio to it.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.330
So if I wanted to go ahead and,
say, apply a memory's

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.610
[? theme ?] to that
and play it.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.490
And so if I didn't like that,
and I said I want to change it

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.600
to passion again, it's
all real time, and

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.850
I can look at it.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:27.040
And so once I've done that, the
last step is I'll go in

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.510
and I'll share it to YouTube
and that's kind of the

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:33.920
smartphone process.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.960
Now all of this gets stored in
a server, so I wanted to

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.100
continue editing.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.920
I could go back and work on
my tablet version, which

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.810
obviously takes advantage of
the larger real estate.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.880
So if I go to the tablet
version, you'll see that it's

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.670
actually a full blown editor.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:56.050
It's got a timeline with a lot
more effects, titles, audio

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.300
recording, and things
like that.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.620
So again, I've got that
project here.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.870
I'll open that up.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.240
And I just started creating
a new movie.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.870
Now, we have this concept
of wizards.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.670
Again, we're trying to
attract the product.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.950
We're trying to go for
the breadth of users.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.205
If you don't want to do the
editing, we also have a wizard

00:23:22.205 --> 00:23:24.770
that allows you to quickly
create a movie.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:30.020
I'll go in, and I'll
pick some videos.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.440
So this is Jarek talking
right here.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.650
But I'm just I'm just going
to go ahead and

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.930
use something else.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.180
So I'll pick a couple clips.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.352
Drag it in.

00:23:44.352 --> 00:23:45.602
I'll pick another one.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.930
And then what I can also do is--
if I just to play that,

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.670
obviously now I put two
clips together.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.410
And if I wanted to go ahead and
put some effects on that,

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.500
we've got a big selection of
effects in the application.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.815
And I'll just go ahead,
and we've

00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:12.940
got animations, patterns.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.330
I'll do a 3D horizontal effect
at the transition there.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.468
And then I'll just move it so
we don't have to watch the

00:24:23.468 --> 00:24:24.560
whole thing.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.050
So as it goes to transition,
you'll see a little effect.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.240
So all of this has been
happening in real

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.810
time as it goes on.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.500
And then I can add some titles
to it, or I can add

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.750
some audio to it.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.100
So the idea is that, again, we
want to do as much of this in

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.040
real time as possible.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.390
And once I'm done editing, I
just publish it to YouTube,

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.850
and that process happens
in the background as we

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.100
go along with it.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.730
So hopefully, that gives you an
idea of what the product is

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.120
capable of doing.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.300
Now, let me talk a little
bit about--

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.320
OK, so core technology.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.080
So obviously I talked a
little bit about this.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.020
We support multiple devices
across multiple apps.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.960
Quick thing about it, if you
look at the fourth bullet

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.060
there, a proxy.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.420
So that's how we do a
lot of the editing.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.360
We take the high risk file,
create a lower bit rate proxy.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.350
That's how we get the efficiency
and performance

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.490
during the editing process.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.450
Again, the idea is you want to
be able to make quick changes

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.530
and preview it.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.110
And since this is all based in
the cloud, the whole process

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.850
of publishing to YouTube is all
done through a scalable

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.250
form that we are encoding from
that we have up in our cloud

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.500
infrastructure.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.430
Just kind of looking at the
end to end workflow, so we

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.350
integrate both with Google
Drive and YouTube.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.750
So Google Drive is where
all the content sits.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.210
So what we have is that we have
a process that watches

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.740
the Google Drive folders to see
any new content comes in.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.220
When that comes in,
we pick it up.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.170
Create the proxy, and then
that's available for editing.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.760
And then you have the option of
putting the published edits

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.350
on YouTube, or you can
also store it back

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.600
to your Google Drive.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.530
Lastly, talking a little bit
about the integration points.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.830
Obviously, authentication
happens

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.770
through open ID and OAuth.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:27.090
The publishing process, it's
basically, when the user

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.080
decides to publish it, we go
through the timeline, create a

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.640
single file about it, and then
use GData YouTube API to

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.350
publish it to YouTube.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.920
And then the drive integration,
as I mentioned,

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.830
happens through synchronizing
our CMS with the drive folder

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.240
so we can pick up the new media
files, create the proxy,

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240
and do the editing.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.290
And all of that is
done through the

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.640
drive API and the .API.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.520
Thank you.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.085
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thanks.

00:26:56.085 --> 00:26:57.835
Thanks, Krishna.

00:26:57.835 --> 00:27:01.290
I thought you were going to
leave that topic for me.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:01.660
All right.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.870
So a lot of interesting thing
happens on the back end with

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.390
that application.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.620
So now let's talk about
something else.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.700
Again, another picture for
you to guess what it is.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.680
Any thoughts come through to
your mind when you see this?

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.570
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:24.900
Yeah, so what I see is a
beautiful content in beautiful

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.760
settings, which is what content
curation is all about.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.780
So let's chat a little bit about
the APIs that we have

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.900
that enable that.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.690
And then give you an example of
a great app that uses them.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.810
So if you use the Google data
APIs you see that we actually

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.570
have a set of content
discovery APIs.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.600
For example, you can
search for videos.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.505
You can search for channels.

00:27:46.505 --> 00:27:49.410
You can find out what
videos are related.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.110
This is very simple.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.610
You can invoke an
HTTP request.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:57.920
It gives you a set of entries
that corresponds to videos

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.410
that match your search
criteria.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.390
In this case, I was actually
asking for all

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.640
minecraft-related videos.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.100
We have some APIs that are
really relevant for creation.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:14.470
For example, we have an API,
which allows you to figure out

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.650
what's on YouTube right now.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:21.040
And if you have been using the
standard feeds in your app,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.030
you will notice there is an on
the web feed, so you can

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.970
actually query to figure
out, tell me what's

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:27.670
trending right now.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.310
Maybe my user will want
to see that and share.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.570
So I have a simple query
expression here.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:38.220
What I'm asking for two top
entries from the trans feed,

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.610
and I'm actually only interested
in the entry name

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.280
and the title.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.660
So let me just click on that.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.070
And this is always
a nice surprise.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.550
So here are the two top trending
videos right now.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.970
Kite surfer Reddington Beach.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:57.370
I wonder if this is better
than our keynote demo.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.850
And then we have some more
APIs coming in this area.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.400
So if you're interested in
this type of curation,

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.700
discovery APIs, get in touch
with us, because we are always

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.060
looking for trusted testers.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.510
Now, if you have access to
YouTube's account for a

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.950
specific users, in other words,
if they have actually

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.100
authorized you through OAuth,
you can learn more.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.800
So for example, you can figure
out what videos the user has

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.410
saved in order to watch later.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.970
And if you have, again, been
granted the OAuth permission

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.970
maybe you can use that to
drive their discovery

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.340
experience.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:37.550
So to do that you can write some
code to do this, or you

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:51.300
can use our handy little
OAuth tool.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.190
Let me see.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.440
This one.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.790
So what I can do is I can
request the OAuth token,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.300
authorize this application
to access my account.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.770
Find, get the access token.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.840
I got the access and the refresh
token, which is nice.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.050
And now I can issue an
authenticated request, so I

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:25.580
have a request, say, looking for
all the videos that I have

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.620
saved into my watch
later feed.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.080
So if I just invoke this
operation here, I'll get a

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.350
bunch of videos that
have been saved.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:42.410
If I use the syntax partial
responses with this field's

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:47.960
param, so we can do that, what
I'll actually get is only the

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.080
elements that I have explicitly
requested.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.160
So you see this is a lot easier
to parse, and there is

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.320
a perfect video that
I wanted to watch.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.600
Didn't have time, because I
was prepping for I/O. I'll

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.120
watch it tonight if everything
goes well, and it's saved into

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.660
my watch later feed.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.020
So again, this is the type of
stuff you can do if you have

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.230
authenticated access to
the YouTube account.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.180
Now, if you Flipboard, you
can also build beautiful

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.490
applications that use
these types of APIs.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:21.710
So I would like to introduce
Arthur, the CTO of Flipboard,

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.630
and Jason, who worked on YouTube
integration, to share

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.830
their experience.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.080
ARTHUR VAN HOFF: Thank you.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.020
Thank you very much, Jarek.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.230
My name is Arthur van Hoff.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.370
I'm the CTO of Flipboard.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.980
I'm sure a lot of you have
heard of Flipboard.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.170
Flipboard is a social
magazine.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:53.070
It's a magazine that is curated
by your friends, your

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.505
friends on Twitter, Facebook,
and actually since last week

00:31:56.505 --> 00:31:59.580
on Google+, and YouTube.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.810
And that's why we're here.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:06.980
Flipboard helps you find and
discover interesting content.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.900
Originally an iPad application,
it's designed for

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.610
a magazine format,
but we've also

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.900
created an iPhone version.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.160
And since last week, we now also
have an Android version,

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.170
which we'll show you.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:27.810
When you get the content, you
get it in a paginated format.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.350
There's no scrolling
in Flipboard.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.840
And one of the reasons for that
is it makes it a much

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.210
easier to read to find something
and quickly page

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.660
through a feed.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:42.280
And if you like something, you
can tap on it, zoom in, and

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.200
explore more.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.000
For some partners, we
have full content.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.860
We have partnerships, so we can
share the whole article.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.110
And for some content, you can
only see an excerpt, and we

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.810
send you to the original
website.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.800
Flipboard has already supported

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.770
video since the launch.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:07.390
We supported YouTube video
playback as early as two years

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:12.530
ago, but we're now allowing you
to log in to your YouTube

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.830
account and get all your
personal subscriptions and

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.110
also to interact with the video,
add comments, and see

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.680
the comments, and like
videos, et cetera.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.470
That is what has been added.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:29.890
So with that, I'm going to hand
it over to Jason, who did

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.040
a lot of the actual hard work of
implementing this before we

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.154
launch into a quick demo.

00:33:35.154 --> 00:33:38.780
JASON CULVERHOUSE: So, we use
the pure YouTube data API, the

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.200
RESTful interfaces,
all of JSON.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.690
We're using the search API for
users for video so you can

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.960
find people to follow.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.760
All the standard feeds
trending on

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.050
the web, most popular.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.100
We let you view individual
subscriptions or everything

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.400
that you've subscribe to is kind
of the default of what

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.310
you can flip through.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.650
We're using all of the rating,
the commenting.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.790
We allow you to subscribe.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.810
And then after we have all this
information on Flipboard,

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.940
we can actually surface
interesting content from your

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.500
social graph that's
on YouTube.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.460
It will show up in your
cover stories.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.739
And then we can also aggregate
all of the stuff that people,

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.000
all the videos that they're
watching on Flipboard

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.510
themselves, and then it's what's
trending or popular on

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.880
Flipboard that's on YouTube.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:36.110
And so we try to be smart
in the API usage.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.549
So like I said, we
just use JSON.

00:34:38.549 --> 00:34:41.594
The YouTube format, as you
saw, is very verbose.

00:34:41.594 --> 00:34:44.739
We actually filter a lot of
stuff just to get what we

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.270
want, so we don't transfer too
much data to things that we

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.760
aren't using.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.280
Sometimes, we put filters, like
this filter, would just

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.090
be things that were
mobile videos.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.850
Actually, probably pretty
aggressive, if you were to do

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.800
that filter, someone will go
to their uploads and see an

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.480
old video and say why
isn't it here?

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.740
Because it may not be for the
mobile schema, but actually,

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.070
it'll still play on
their device.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:13.940
We use a lot of the query
language, because we're trying

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.360
to get the new stuff in your
feed, the new subscription, so

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.530
we only grab what's required.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:23.220
And you can do that with the
API, which is really nice.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.160
And again, we also limit the
size of the JSON responses by

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.200
really digging in and
just grabbing the

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.870
pieces that are required.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.610
So actually, there's a
new JSON seed format.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:37.480
I don't know if everyone uses
the API, which is a lot

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.600
cleaner as far as a JSON format
versus the existing

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.170
JSON format, which is kind
of exploded XML.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.700
But not every feed supports
it, so actually,

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.920
we don't use that.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.650
Now, I'll go to Arthur
for a demo.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.880
ARTHUR VAN HOFF: So
Flipboard is a

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.500
magazine, as I was saying.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.460
And what you're seeing here
is the cover page.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.540
It basically shows you
a selection of

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:07.710
stories from your Flipboard.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.400
It also shows you on the right
all the contributors of those

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.800
stories that I go to
and Nexus 7 tablet

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.970
hands-on video posted.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:21.570
And then I flip over to
my table of contents.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.940
And in my table of contents I
immediately see the cover

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.280
story style at the top.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.820
And the cover story style is
intended to be a selection of

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:34.530
the best content that is
selected especially for you.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.270
And that's done by looking at
your interactions with your

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.990
friends and content
on other networks.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:46.660
So for example, when you look
at who you +1 in Google+ or

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.470
who you like in Facebook
or what videos

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.910
you watch in YouTube.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:54.040
And we take all that
information, and we use that

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.130
as an input for a ranking
algorithm that creates the

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:58.840
content you might like.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.770
So we're going to tap on that.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:03.250
It takes me to a magazine
full of content that was

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.620
selected for me.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.480
Here's an interesting article.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.835
I'm going to tap on
that in there.

00:37:07.835 --> 00:37:08.970
I can read the article.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:13.230
It's a six page article, and I
can find out about the Nexus

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.360
Q. And then when I keep going,
it goes on to the next

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.290
article, photos about it.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.590
I can also go--

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.540
let me go back--

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.010
I can also go and get some
new content if I open the

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.420
content draw here.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.110
You'll see featured content.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.250
There's news sources.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:33.750
There's businesses.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.060
There's all sorts of different
content partnerships we have.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.776
I want to show you one that
I like particularly.

00:37:40.776 --> 00:37:42.920
It was the National
Geographic.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.080
It's great, because it's got
really fantastic photographs.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.320
So if I go into an article here,
then what you'll see as

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.070
I'm paging through you'll
occasionally

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.970
see a full page ad.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.110
It's an ad that's delivered by
National Geographic, and it's

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.650
almost part of the experience.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.920
It's like when you're reading
a magazine, you also

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.040
occasionally see an ad.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.520
But it doesn't interrupt the
flow of reading so much.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.890
And also what's very important,
you never see it

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:12.820
sort of half.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.970
You never sort of scrolled half
of the page, which is

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:21.150
very important for people that
are into magazine layout.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.620
Let me show you some
videos playing,

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.670
which is very important.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.900
Let's go to trending videos.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.260
This is the view you get when
you go to a YouTube feed.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.170
This is the usual selection
of fun videos.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.420
Let's play one here.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.850
I have not watched this
one, but I'm sure

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.100
it's going to be great.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.820
So the audio's coming
out of the iPad,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.080
which you don't hear.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.540
So this is great.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:58.080
I can also pull up any comments
by tapping down here,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.650
and I can immediately see
all the comments.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.770
This is coming in through
the YouTube APIs.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.070
And if I like this video, I
can just hit the thumbs up

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.070
button, and off we go.

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.230
And this is because I'm already
signed into my YouTube

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:13.850
account, so the interaction
is very, very simple.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:19.930
It's also live, and let
me refresh here.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.625
Get an update of the latest.

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:24.120
And what is this video here?

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.400
Oh, that's the video that
Jarek just made.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.100
Let me see what that
turned out to be.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.350
Play.

00:39:34.728 --> 00:39:38.690
It's a wonderful video,
I'm sure.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.940
Come on play.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.750
I hit pause.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.100
Sorry.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.640
What a wonderful
effect, Jarek.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.890
I'm impressed.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.460
But as you can see, it's live.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.000
And it really does work.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.755
Last thing I want to show you is
so you can also do searches

00:39:57.755 --> 00:39:58.220
by the way.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:02.930
This is a search for the io12
tag, and it shows you posts on

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:06.890
Google+ from the conference,
which I really like.

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:11.210
I also want to really briefly
show you this working on this

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:16.780
wonderful device that
occasionally works.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.672
You, there we go.

00:40:19.672 --> 00:40:21.650
And that box is going
to go away.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.620
That's perfect.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.580
We did on your telephone.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:29.270
If I tap on that, it takes me
to Flipboard, and I got the

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:33.380
same kind of layout, except
that the paging is now

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.050
vertical rather than horizontal
because it's a

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:37.230
portrait device.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.260
So again, I got the same
video over here.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.140
Click on to my cover stories.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.080
I get to read my cover stories
and interact with them.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.650
If I see video I like I can just
tap on it and immediately

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.200
get all the comments
and get feedback.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.380
So there you have it.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.320
Flipboard on Android, Flipboard
on iPad, Flipboard

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.470
integrated with YouTube.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.560
It's awesome, and it's free.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:07.910
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you, Arthur.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.160
Great demos.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.690
I think much better
than my demos.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:18.900
All right, so now we talked
about creation and curation.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.190
Let's talk about consumption.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.800
So when it comes to the API,
there's a couple of different

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.600
ways in which you can integrate
YouTube video

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.290
playback on mobile devices.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:35.250
The simplest one, on Android,
is just by drawing an intent

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.250
and launching the YouTube app.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.960
One of our API partners referred
to this as the outer

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:44.960
body experience, which I find
actually very accurate.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.790
It works well.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.170
It's reliable and so
forth, and it's

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:47.830
actually quite simple.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.690
As you see, you really don't
need to write a bunch of code.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.710
And you can do the same
thing on iOS by using

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:57.620
the open URL method.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.550
If you want to get a little more
sophisticated, you can

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:01.850
use the web view approach.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:02.910
And some people love it.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:04.200
Some people hate it.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.710
It does work for
the most part.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.530
So really the way it works is if
there is an iFrame embed on

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.430
the page, and you render that
page inside of a web view on

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.480
Android or UI web view on iOS.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.860
It will actually use our HTML5
player, and it'll work.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.440
And here's a code snippet
for Android.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.920
I'm actually setting up a web
view and loading a URL.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.330
That URL actually uses the
YouTube API, the JavaScript

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:33.440
API, and it works.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.240
And I can do the same
thing on iOS.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.370
Now, we actually have something
even better coming.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:46.740
And I'm really actually very
glad to say that we will be

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.200
offering a preview of some new
developments in this area.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.250
So it's still pretty early.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.850
We're looking for feedback, but
we wanted to give you a

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.560
heads up that this
is coming at I/O.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.570
So what we're building is
YouTube Android player, API,

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.570
which allows you to integrate
YouTube video playback

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.010
directly into your mobile
application without the web

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.300
view, without having to cross
the entire technology stack in

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.850
your app with full API support
in a lot of features.

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.810
And here's what it looks like,
so it's very simple.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:21.300
You can basically extend our
activity and call load video

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.090
on it and off you go.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.920
So it's quite straight
forward.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.550
I would like to encourage you
to come to our session

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.860
tomorrow, new Android Player
Tools, and we'll talk about

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.850
that and give you some cool
demos in more detail.

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.480
So let's look at
some examples.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.040
And with that I'd like to
introduce Kiran, who's the CEO

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.310
of 955 Dreams, and they build
beautiful consumption apps.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.110
KIRAN BELLUBBI: So
hi, everyone.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:49.530
Thanks, Jarek for inviting
me over here.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.080
I'm really happy to be here.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.360
This is my second Google
I/O, and I'm having

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.520
a great time today.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.860
We started 955 Dreams, my
co-founder and I, TJ Zark and

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.050
I, with one mission, and that
was to create beautiful mobile

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.930
experiences.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:13.170
We've done seven apps as a team
until now with five Apple

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:14.430
hall of fame apps.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:17.910
All seven of them app of the
weeks, and last year's iPhone

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.615
app of the year runner up
to Instagram, which

00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:21.080
is Band of the Day.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.640
And I'll show that
to you today.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.830
If you have an iOS device, an
iPhone, or an iPad, you should

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.290
check this app out.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.790
It's called Band of the Day.

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:30.970
After the demos hopefully,
you'll be convinced to go and

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:31.510
download it.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.610
It's free.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:37.760
All our apps have used
YouTube in them.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.300
And we believe that YouTube
actually helps us create more

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.945
compelling experiences
for our users.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.720
For us, when we think about
building mobile apps, we think

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.400
experience first.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.180
And APIs and all the other
technical jargon really is

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.800
just there to help.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.650
And let me show you
a couple of--

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.510
can we switch to here.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.970
So let me tell you what we mean
by experience first and

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.320
how that sort of relates
to YouTube.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.380
This is Band of the Day
on the iPad, and let's

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.260
go to today's band.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.210
Every day, we feature
one band.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.770
The music is essentially
full play.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.040
I don't know if you guys can
hear all that now, but anyway.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.220
We have YouTube sort of
interspersed in the entire

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.010
experience for the app.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.570
A lot of our users are sort of
reading the content, some of

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:45.110
them might enjoy sort of just
browsing the videos, or just

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.110
listening to the
music as audio.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.570
And the experience is really
just fluid and works

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:03.620
beautifully on the iPad.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.290
I can show you the iPhone
version as well.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.590
This is all the videos
for this band.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.604
And if you switch back to--

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:21.250
so we have a few ground rules
when we talk about using

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.500
YouTube in our app.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.210
And the first one is that we
don't like to see loading

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.720
signs anywhere.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.820
So when we use thumbnails or
when we are preloading any of

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.830
the content for our users you
will never see a loading sign

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.880
on Band of the Day, and just
small things like this make a

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.540
huge difference for our users,
makes it easier for them, and

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.150
the experience is just really
clean and simple to use.

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:51.170
So if you look at the YouTube
experience within our app, we

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:53.110
haven't added comments and
things like that yet.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.710
But we plan to do
that very soon.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.710
You can share the video
with your friend.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:59.370
You can send it to a friend.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:06.450
You can just start watching
the videos directly here.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.780
There are more features
coming.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.030
That's odd.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.870
Let me show this to you on
the iPhone really quick.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:42.050
So the same experience but
more for one-handed

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:43.210
navigation.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.845
Extremely fluid again.

00:47:44.845 --> 00:47:47.800
Go to today's band.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.680
Listen to the music.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.160
They are full play songs.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.520
They aren't clips as you see
with many other apps.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.660
Here you see more YouTube videos
sort of embedded inside

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.010
of the experience.

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:13.580
Everything is preloaded
for the users.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.210
Thumbnails sort of the
one click play.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.820
It just sort of works.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.790
We've had any questions that
we've had, the YouTube

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:26.580
developers have been really
good at answering.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.540
But mostly we focus on the
experience first, keeping it

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.930
simple, preloading stuff on
a mobile device and never

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:35.240
showing the loading sign.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.345
We've had some success
with usage.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.450
So a couple of interesting
stats from our app.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:52.960
In terms of engagement, 35% of
our sessions watch at least

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.980
one full YouTube video.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:58.890
This is sort of a really
interesting statistic for us.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:04.430
We noticed a lot of primetime
usage of the product, a lot of

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:06.590
the usage of the product was
happening in primetime

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:08.850
television hours, which
is very interesting.

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:11.830
So further solidifying
our user of

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.350
YouTube within our product.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:18.030
9% of the average session
length, which is currently 17

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.610
minutes is spent on
YouTube videos.

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:22.650
And this was fascinating
for us.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:24.090
So yeah.

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.340
That's about it.

00:49:29.384 --> 00:49:31.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Thanks, Kiran.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:36.830
All right, so let's get into
Q&amp;A. And to get it started my

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.460
buddy JJ is going to lead a
panel discussion, so I'm going

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.370
off to the external speakers
to please come up and

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.620
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.700
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS:
Are we ready?

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.400
Hey, great.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.170
We're ready.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:55.140
Jarek has to go give
another talk.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.250
What room are you going to
be speaking in, Jarek?

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.760
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.910
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: Video
mobile, video gaming.

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:01.920
And what room is that?

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.890
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS:
Number five.

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.040
That's going to be
pretty awesome.

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.990
We got some super secret
awesome stuff

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.790
coming up in that.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:10.200
But before he leaves,
let's give

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.450
Jarek a round of applause.

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.000
OK, so we got a few minutes
left, and I want to ask you

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.620
guys a few questions.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.900
First of all, can you guys tell
me what languages you're

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.550
using to talk to the
YouTube APIs.

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.830
Tell me if you're using a client
library, and tell me if

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:35.460
you're using XML or JSON.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.690
KIRAN BELLUBBI: We're using
Ruby in the back end.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.750
We don't use a client
library on iOS.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:43.710
We sort of manage the data on
the back end using Ruby and

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:45.850
then deal with it ourselves.

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:51.460
KRISHNA MENON: No client
libraries.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.810
We use the RESTful
APIs with JSON.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.030
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS:
Which language?

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.520
KRISHNA MENON: Java.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.250
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: Java.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.010
ARTHUR VAN HOFF: Same here.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:01.120
Java, OS2, REST, JSON.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.420
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: Great.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:08.130
So a lot of applications do a
mix of talking to the YouTube

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:12.510
API in real time in response to
users as well as a lot of

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:13.810
batch processing.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.650
And I know that some of your
apps do a lot of background

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:19.630
processing, so can you tell me
of the breakdown of how much

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:23.010
your applications talk to the
YouTube API kind of in real

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.730
time versus batch processing.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:28.800
JASON CULVERHOUSE: For
Flipboard, most of what you

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.660
saw Arthur doing, flipping,
that's all real time.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:35.500
But we, also, if you sign in
with your YouTube account,

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.880
we're going to basically
crawl and look at your

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.220
subscriptions and stuff.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.650
And that's how things
will bubble up

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:42.840
into your cover story.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.340
So we actually do do a lot of
background processing too.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.150
And we'll also look at all the
people you subscribe to.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.170
And then if you have other
friends, what are they

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:53.960
subscribing to, so we can
do a little social graph

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.750
computations.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:59.250
But a huge portion of it is
going to be real time.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.282
KIRAN BELLUBBI: We don't do
anything real time on the app

00:52:04.282 --> 00:52:05.330
right now with YouTube.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.650
Although I think commenting and
stuff will require some

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:13.170
sort of real time API usage,
which we might do soon.

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:14.150
KRISHNA MENON: Yeah, nothing
real time right now.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:16.290
Most of our integration
is on the publish.

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:18.170
So that's our batch
processing.

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:20.710
After the users says publish on
the back end, we'll publish

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:21.880
it to YouTube.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.790
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: Great.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:26.360
OK, so I've got a squirrelly
question for you guys.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.930
I want you to tell me about
the future of mobile,

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:33.430
specifically creation, curation,
and consumption.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:35.320
And I want you to tell me what
the future's going to look

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:40.580
like two years from now, five to
seven to 10 years from now.

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:43.430
And then I want you to throw a
Hail Mary and tell me what

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:48.180
it's going to be like
50 years from now.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:48.905
ARTHUR VAN HOFF: [INAUDIBLE]
first.

00:52:48.905 --> 00:52:50.930
KRISHNA MENON: Well, I'll
address the creation, and I'll

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:52.590
try to be as realistic
as possible.

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:58.330
So the trends we're seeing are
obviously it's video's

00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:58.940
ubiquitous.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.600
It's on every platform.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.100
Creation is now happening
on mobile devices.

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:06.300
Things that were not possible
on those platforms are now

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.310
possible today.

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.280
It's becoming more and
more mainstream.

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:14.720
I think in previous times, it
used to be that creation was

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.800
1% of the population, using
a lot more of it.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.050
And I think that trend's
going to continue.

00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:23.880
KIRAN BELLUBBI: On the
consumption side, I think as a

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.270
user, what I'd like to
see is more really

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:28.070
high quality content.

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:31.050
I mean if you look at what you
guys did with Coachella

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.900
streaming live this year, I
think we want more of that.

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:41.825
Not everybody can go at 35, 36
to Coachella, and Bonaroo, and

00:53:41.825 --> 00:53:44.940
Lollapalooza, all of them
in the same year.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.390
But I'd love to be a participant
in that experience

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:50.310
at least through YouTube
on video.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:57.540
Hopefully, in the next 10 years,
maybe there will be

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:03.750
some user created demographic,
democratic way of high end

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:08.560
news that we can consume on
YouTube, really high quality.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.830
Almost like 60 Minutes.

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.210
I don't know if that's
possible on YouTube.

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:13.460
But maybe.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.970
ARTHUR VAN HOFF: So in the
short term, I think that

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:25.250
search would be interesting in
video, like how do you find

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:29.140
videos about something without
really knowing all the tags.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.970
That will be an interesting
project, and I know that

00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:32.966
Google is working on that.

00:54:32.966 --> 00:54:38.650
In the longer term, I'm going
to predict that display

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:43.010
technology is going get so cheap
that pretty much every

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.680
surface is going to be covered
with displays.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.700
So you just going to spray
them all the walls, and

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.820
obviously, they're going have
to be powered by YouTube.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.460
So wallpaper powered
by YouTube.

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.820
That's my prediction.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.440
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: Great.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.510
So we have a little bit under
three minutes left.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:05.190
Is anybody interested in asking
a question, and if you

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:08.250
do ask a question, you could
come up here afterwards and we

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:10.005
have a few YouTube t-shirts.

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:17.660
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys, so I have
kind of a technical question

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.270
about the switch to OAuth2.

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:22.440
I don't know if any of you
encountered this, but with our

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.560
app, when we switched to OAuth2,
we ran into a problem

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.410
with YouTube, where Google will
happily authenticate a

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:32.370
user even if they're not
an YouTube account.

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:34.800
And we'll get this access
token back.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.900
Then when we do an API, we'll
get the no link to account

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.930
response back, and it just
feels really clunky.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:44.010
It kind of feels like something
we felt that Google

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.120
should handle on their end.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:49.440
When we say we want YouTube
data, and it's not a YouTube

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.830
user, they should just
be like, no, it's

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:51.980
not a YouTube user.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:55.130
Instead of pretending like the
authentication went fine.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:56.740
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: So
I could answer that.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:01.420
If you look at our YouTube API
blog, we have a blog post

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.820
that's called something
like Google accounts.

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.920
And the idea was that we'd like
to open up YouTube as

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.060
much as possible to people who
don't have YouTube accounts.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:13.180
And so it's up to you to follow
the advice in the blog

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.120
post to correctly handle
certain types of users.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.410
And then for the users who
aren't YouTube users who are

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.700
trying to do something that
requires YouTube user

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.790
abilities, there are
ways basically

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:28.440
to help him to upgrade.

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.670
So the blog post will help
you out with that.

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:32.250
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:33.290
I'm familiar with that.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:36.850
But I mean could there may be
an additional scope, like we

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:40.670
need a real YouTube user with
a YouTube user name?

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.790
And in that case, Google
handles it.

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:44.260
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: Why don't
you come, and we could

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:46.790
talk more about that
at the sandbox?

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:49.190
And if any of you have questions
that don't get

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:52.210
addressed today, I will be at
the sandbox all day tomorrow.

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:56.120
So please don't make me
stand there by myself.

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.360
JASON CULVERHOUSE: I
can answer that.

00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:00.400
So for Flipboard, we have
the same issue.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.140
But we don't want to create
the user's account.

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:04.430
Actually, there's an API where
you can just add a name for

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:05.520
their channel.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.730
But we sort of just pop up a
dialogue box and say you need

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.330
to go to YouTube.

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:14.220
But we let people browse
anonymously too.

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.290
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: OK, I
think we can get one more in.

00:57:18.954 --> 00:57:21.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, I just have
a general question.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.780
I would love to get
your thoughts on

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.390
Socialcam and what it means.

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:29.650
And if it's something that's
lasting or flimsy?

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:30.740
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS:
Arthur, I have a

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.140
feeling you have an answer.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:36.950
ARTHUR VAN HOFF: Oh, I'm a big
believer in the Google Glass

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:39.730
Project and Recording
Your Life.

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:42.025
The big issue is going
to be again search.

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:46.450
I mean if I can record 100 x as
much content how am I going

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:50.390
to filter that down to
the relevant parts.

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:52.830
So I think that's going
to be the big thing.

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:58.420
I'm not entirely sure what you
mean the Socialcam, but that's

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.370
what I think.

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:00.770
KIRAN BELLUBBI: Are you talking

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:02.020
about the app Socialcam?

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.210
I don't know.

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:08.310
A lot of people use YouTube
in their apps.

00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:09.440
I mean so do we.

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.610
955 Dreams, all our apps have
had some form of YouTube

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:14.360
embedded in it.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:18.270
And users enjoy using
apps that have been

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:20.520
curated really well.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:24.660
I don't know, I guess, if you're
fishing for some sort

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:28.010
of like, I don't think there's
anything wrong that they're

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.700
doing, per se.

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:33.080
I mean it's another form of
curation mixed in with content

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.670
that already exists
in YouTube.

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:38.105
And they're just surfacing
some of those videos.

00:58:38.105 --> 00:58:41.420
And I think if it's good for the
users in the end, it can't

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.120
really be that bad for them.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.390
I don't know if that answers
your question.

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.780
SHANNON "JJ" BEHRENS: OK.

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.880
I'm going to have
to wrap it up.

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.860
Thank you, guys very
much for coming.

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.480
Come afterwards, and we
could talk afterwards.

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.180
The hashtag for today is IO12.

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:57.160
We'll be at the Sandbox
afterwards.

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.080
And can we get one more
round of applause

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.870
for all of our speakers.

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.120
Thank you.
