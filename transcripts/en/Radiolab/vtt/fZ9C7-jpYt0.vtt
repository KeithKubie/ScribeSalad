00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.740
You are listening to radio lab radio from w n y s

2
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.280
do you, can I ask you, do you,

3
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:18.220
do you just want to like lay out for us the chronology of your obsession?

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.570
I think I feel comfortable saying it with him.

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.620
Has it become an obsession or just a PR? Just a PR.

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.770
A dalliance or maybe you just noticed a crumbling building and ran over to stick

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.100
your pen. I mean, I, I am, uh, I'm a contrarion

8
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.030
and I'm interested in alternative facts about science. Let's say.

9
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.340
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

10
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:45.730
This was radio lab and a little while back our editors, Soren Wheeler and I,

11
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.530
we talked to a science journalist named Dan Engber who got us kind of tangled up

12
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.730
about something that we thought we knew about the world, about ourselves.

13
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.410
Something beautiful as I recall. Yeah.

14
00:00:56.411 --> 00:01:00.070
That we talked about at great length on this show. Okay. Hello? Hello.

15
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.450
And to set that conversation up,

16
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.600
we're going to start with the sky is this glove seal? Yes.

17
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.800
Professor Claude Steele.

18
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.120
<v 1>I am the Lucy Sterns Ameritas professor of psychology at Stanford University.</v>

19
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.190
<v 0>We actually had them on the show number of years ago. Sometimes.</v>

20
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.030
I can't remember how many years ago. Yeah, it's been, it's been a long time.

21
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:20.470
I'm looking at the sheet here and it says 2009 which blows my mind. Yeah,

22
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:23.120
that was a lot younger man than I know.

23
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.590
And the reason we had him on the show back then was because he had done a study

24
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:31.150
in the mid nineties that just completely changed the way that we thought about

25
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.220
the power of stereotypes.

26
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.640
<v 1>Well, my mother was white, my father was African American there,</v>

27
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.880
and they were very active in the civil rights movements.

28
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:43.881
So you can imagine that race was no distant or passing thing in our life and

29
00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:45.010
family

30
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.280
<v 0>for Claude growing up. That was just every day dinner table.</v>

31
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.370
<v 1>Yes, exactly. So the topic is sort of family birthright,</v>

32
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.890
<v 0>but then years and years later,</v>

33
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:57.350
midway through his career as a psychology professor,

34
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.620
Claud ran into a demonstration of the power of race that really surprised him.

35
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.950
<v 1>I got a job offer.</v>

36
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:07.660
This is in the 80s at the University of Michigan and it was part psychology and

37
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.840
part to administer a minority student program there.

38
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.100
<v 0>This is called steel in the original program. We ran back in 2009</v>

39
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.650
<v 1>and I'm in the process. I saw data that surprised me.</v>

40
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.880
<v 0>What he saw was a troubling trend. Two kids would enter Michigan, one was black,</v>

41
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:27.960
one was white. They'd come in at the exact same level, same skills,

42
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.240
same sat score.

43
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.950
So theoretically they should do the same when they get to Michigan,

44
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.330
but without fail or almost without fail, after one semester,

45
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.840
<v 1>the black kid was winding up with lower grades, lower, pretty, pretty, um,</v>

46
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.690
pretty dramatic. At least two thirds of a letter. Grades,

47
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.300
<v 0>meaning if the white kid got an a,</v>

48
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.400
the black kid who should be getting an a too is instead getting a B or a B plus

49
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:53.880
significant. It's significant. It's significant. And he also, by the way,

50
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:58.170
saw this performance gap between women and men when it came to match at the same

51
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.040
degrees degree in advanced math

52
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 1>courses. It was comparable. I learned this as a national phenomenon.</v>

53
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.780
If I was to walk into an endless any college class in the United States,

54
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.990
I'd have a very high probability of finding exactly that

55
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.740
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

56
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.040
<v 3>so I think it's important to put it in context of what was going on at the time.</v>

57
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.210
This is Dan Engber again and he says that that gap in achievement between black

58
00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:22.890
and white students that cloud had noticed.

59
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.430
That was actually a huge topic of conversation at the time.

60
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.330
There was a lot of discussion of what to do about the achievement gap and the

61
00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:31.920
familiar argument is,

62
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.840
well this has to do with a systemic racism and systemic differences in

63
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:41.430
opportunities that play out through an individual lifespan.

64
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:42.960
Now that seems right.

65
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.370
It's also daunting because how are we ever going to like cure all of the

66
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.160
socioeconomic disparities in this country,

67
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.610
but then in 1994 different and in many ways very dangerous idea was being tossed

68
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:02.490
into this debate. Charles Murray coauthor of the book the Bell Curve.

69
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.320
When the Belker came out,

70
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.580
the bell curve intelligence and class structure in American life,

71
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.460
Bell curve argued that one explanation for that achievement gap among others was

72
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.690
genetic and IQ based. Now of course it's not,

73
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.500
but even though there is no scientific backing at all for the idea of genetic

74
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:23.700
differences like this,

75
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.750
the bell curve was still significant just because of the kinds of conversations

76
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:30.840
it was creating at the time and the effect that it had on researchers in this

77
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:31.550
field.

78
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.000
<v 1>Well,</v>

79
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the bell curve is one point in a long history of that kind of argument that the

80
00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:41.000
difference between groups really is rooted in genetic differences.

81
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:43.910
Let's just be frank and honest, and if you really can't admit that,

82
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.280
then you don't have the courage needed to be a real scientist. That's,

83
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.470
that's a thumbnail way of describing this experience that I've had being

84
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:58.130
confronted with with that notion, and this was obviously disturbing to Claude.

85
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.580
Well first on a personal level, in order to be a scientist,

86
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:06.581
are you supposed to actually be open to the possibility that you and your family

87
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:11.641
and your whole race have some genetic limitation.

88
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.440
But also because it was so weak, you know,

89
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.530
scientifically it's been very difficult,

90
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.000
impossible to produce anything like definitive data that the differences in test

91
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:23.770
scores between groups is genetic.

92
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.860
But while the differences between these students that cloud was seeing in

93
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:29.470
Michigan, clearly wouldn't be explained by genetic differences.

94
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.100
It also didn't seem to him like it could be explained simply by their

95
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:36.230
backgrounds or their opportunities. Because you take,

96
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.300
let's say a black kid and a white kid at Michigan,

97
00:05:38.301 --> 00:05:40.560
they both have extraordinary scores like you know,

98
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.310
are in the 98th percentile and they're sats.

99
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.810
So the background between the two kids,

100
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.670
whatever it is, has not resulted in, in a difference to that moment in time.

101
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.700
So if going forward and taking a test,

102
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.780
the black kid gets a lower or a lower performance in a course of some sort,

103
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.670
then something must be happening right there, right there.

104
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.090
<v 0>Something must be happening in the moment.</v>

105
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.770
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

106
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.700
<v 1>there was something there that people didn't understand and that we certainly</v>

107
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.534
didn't understand it.

108
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.430
<v 0>So he figured he would start with the woman in math issue.</v>

109
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.620
He brought a bunch of women in and a bunch of men

110
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.660
<v 1>sophomore brought them into the laboratory one at a time,</v>

111
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.800
gave them a half an hour section of the graduate record exam you take if you're

112
00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:31.300
a math major, very, very difficult math. And sure enough,

113
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.410
the women who had all the same credentials coming into that situation performed

114
00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:36.790
dramatically worse than the men.

115
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.500
Worse as in be a couple hundred points in an sat testing difference.

116
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.400
This is a big effect.

117
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.010
<v 0>So Claude Steele thought, all right, step one complete.</v>

118
00:06:44.011 --> 00:06:47.730
I've got a lab situation that resembles the real world. Good.

119
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.430
Now the next step is to tweak things a little bit.

120
00:06:50.431 --> 00:06:51.540
See if I can mess around with it.

121
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.990
No, normally in these situations,

122
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.650
<v 1>the test giver has got a little white lab coat on and he brings in a big stack</v>

123
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:05.850
of cellophane wrap tests. He puts a clock on the table.

124
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.040
It's all, it's all, you know, it's like that's,

125
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.030
it's gonna intimidate almost anybody.

126
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.080
<v 0>Maybe that's what's happening. He thought, what if I took away the clock,</v>

127
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.470
took away the coat,

128
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.660
and most importantly right before the test I had the test giver.

129
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:27.770
Instead of saying the normal, I'm going to give you a test pre test thing.

130
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.340
Maybe instead say something like this. Look,

131
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.800
<v 1>you may have heard that a women don't do as well as men on difficult</v>

132
00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:37.050
standardized math test. You may have heard that,

133
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.780
but that is not true for this particular test.

134
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.490
This particular test does not show gender differences. Never has never will.

135
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.670
<v 0>He wondered if maybe saying that simple sentence before giving the test would</v>

136
00:07:49.861 --> 00:07:50.690
have an effect

137
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.130
<v 1>and sure enough,</v>

138
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.250
I wouldn't be here if their performance didn't go up and go up to match that of

139
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:01.880
the equally skilled men, that performance gap vanished. She look at this thing,

140
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.130
so we raced and did it very quickly.

141
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:06.380
The same kind of an experiment with African Americans

142
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.450
<v 0>there. The pretest disclaimer went like this.</v>

143
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.470
<v 1>This is an instrument that we use to study problem solving and it is not</v>

144
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:17.080
diagnostic of individuals intellectual abilities.

145
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.630
<v 0>In other words, this is not a test of your intelligence. I repeat,</v>

146
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:22.280
not an IQ test,

147
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:25.640
so just do the best you can and with that simple disclaimer at the start,

148
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.660
same kind of an effect.

149
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.420
The black students and the white students were now equal.

150
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:39.010
<v 6>Just recently, Ryan Brown and Eric Day did an even clever treatment.</v>

151
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.960
There is an IQ test which is nonverbal called the advanced progressive matrices

152
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.240
has figures, very abstract.

153
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.450
They got lines crossing that you have to match and so on checks,

154
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.700
it's essentially pattern matching diamonds with dots and totally visual and so

155
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.650
they can, that test isn't as it is as an IQ test.

156
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.260
It's in fact seen as the gold standard of IQ test because it's quilt culture

157
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:02.340
free. There's no map,

158
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.120
there's no reading because it doesn't involve language or you could represent

159
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.520
the exact same test as a puzzle puzzle puzzle

160
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.150
<v 0>meaning you can give an IQ test to a bunch of kids and the black students will</v>

161
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:16.020
perform worse, but if you give that same test, lose the word test,

162
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.870
lose the word I

163
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.430
<v 6>cute. You just call it a puzzle.</v>

164
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.580
The black participants suddenly jump up in their performance.

165
00:09:21.581 --> 00:09:24.100
Basically we got a reversal. When you represent it as a puzzle,

166
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.930
blacks perform as well as white. They did. Yeah. That's all it takes.

167
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.880
Just change a few words.

168
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.100
<v 0>Stereotypes are powerful. Okay, that makes sense now.</v>

169
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.090
But in terms of understanding how this works, can you make this tactile for me,

170
00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:48.960
like if the stereotype is having all these effects is like a thing like a

171
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.280
[inaudible], like a little Gremlin that bites make.

172
00:09:52.281 --> 00:09:55.650
When in the test taking process does it actually like do its damage?

173
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.790
That's going to be way open to debate.

174
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.660
What does seem to be clear from the data according to Eric Day and Ryan Brown

175
00:10:02.661 --> 00:10:03.470
and Claude Steel,

176
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.390
is it the Gremlin only seems to appear when the test is sufficiently hard.

177
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.620
If the test is easy, it's important to point out, uh,

178
00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:14.750
these effects don't happen. It's not that the Gremlin is not there. Well,

179
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:15.770
he walks in with you,

180
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.820
but he doesn't speak necessarily until things get challenging.

181
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.040
As soon as the test gets difficult, that's where the voices kick in,

182
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.010
which means that for most of the tests, everybody's doing about the same.

183
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:30.010
It's only at problem number 17 the one about co-signs and factorials and

184
00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:32.480
whatever where things start to go wrong,

185
00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:34.760
and at least that's the theory at that problem.

186
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.970
The black student starts to stiffen up a little bit. That's right.

187
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.550
In Claude Steele's measured this. Their blood pressure's elevated,

188
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:42.440
their short term memory is impaired.

189
00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:46.220
It's that flicker of frustration through their body that wakes up the Gremlin

190
00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:49.430
who starts to whisper in their ear, I don't know if you can do this.

191
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.490
Oh Shit is what they say about us. True. They don't think you can do it.

192
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.190
All the usual stuff and even if the student doesn't believe it,

193
00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:56.960
which is likely so you don't have to believe it.

194
00:10:56.961 --> 00:10:58.670
That's the kind of insidious thing here.

195
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.270
Just the fact that he has now this extra bit of mental chatter,

196
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.770
that little guy whispering, well,

197
00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:07.970
it's a distraction and that makes their performance go down just a little bit.

198
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.680
All of this dialogue is keeping you from being a hundred percent focused on the

199
00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:14.600
task at hand, which is solving these problems.

200
00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:18.890
Who the real subtle power of a stereotype isn't that it prevents you from doing

201
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:19.724
the thing you want to do.

202
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.220
It distracts you for just the beat from doing the thing you want to do.

203
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:26.840
And that may be all the difference.

204
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:34.730
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

205
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.590
<v 0>so that's how we ended the piece that we did back in 2009. Um,</v>

206
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.740
but in the years after Claude did that original study, um,

207
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.260
and the effect which she called stereotype threat became one of the biggest

208
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.320
stereotype threat and most important ideas type threat in all of social

209
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:54.290
psychology types.

210
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.450
But now some psychologists say stereotypes can become self fulfilling.

211
00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:59.950
Prophecy and card steal.

212
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.470
Ladies and gentlemen is my great pleasure to present clots.

213
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.320
He became a sort of academic rockstar professor Claude Steele,

214
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.543
doctor Claude Steele,

215
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.290
speaking to overflowing audiences at places like Columbia and Cornell.

216
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.450
Welcome Dr Steven

217
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:19.470
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

218
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.250
<v 0>And this idea of a stereotype threat was shown to be relevant in cases that had</v>

219
00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:25.770
to do with age and socioeconomic status.

220
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.870
There were studies about women playing chess,

221
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.630
men being tested on like social sensitivity.

222
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.653
<v 8>I mean,</v>

223
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.160
Clyde's work ended up inspiring sort of a whole generation of social

224
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.690
psychologist. Yeah. I mean,

225
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.360
I would say that the original stereotype threat paper by stealing Aaronson,

226
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.240
you know, blew me away,

227
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.130
just spoke to me and it was beautiful and it seemed to offer answers,

228
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.660
uh, you know, to questions that troubled me.

229
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.740
So this is Michael Slick and I'm a professor of psychology at the University of

230
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.020
Toronto. So when did you begin, uh,

231
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:08.970
if you could give us sort of the cliff notes version of your history with Stereo

232
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.830
type threat in particular? I mean,

233
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.190
I think I was certainly attracted to,

234
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.940
that's that part of social psychology that dealt with prejudice and

235
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:20.710
discrimination. So I'm Jewish,

236
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:25.450
I went to Jewish day school and high school and kind of perhaps baked into me

237
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:29.860
was a desire to, to for, for social justice, um,

238
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.370
and you know, seeing, you know, the evils of prejudice and you know,

239
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.490
how those evils taken to their logical extreme what could happen.

240
00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:40.480
So I was passionate about the topic. I, um,

241
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:42.430
so it seemed like a very hopeful, um,

242
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.080
sort of explanation that also offered relatively easy solutions to fix.

243
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.900
Sounds like you really came into it with a very social,

244
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:52.880
political sort of bent to it. Yes, that's right. Uh,

245
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.640
I wanted my work to have an impact. I wanted it to have to change the world

246
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.080
coming up after the break. Michael tries to change the world,

247
00:14:06.081 --> 00:14:09.740
but the world kinda changes him. Him. Yeah.

<v 8>Jed, Robert Radiolab,</v>

263
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.760
we're back and we're talking about Claude steals a seminal research on

264
00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:11.050
stereotype threat,

265
00:15:11.051 --> 00:15:15.010
how the threat of a negative stereotype can impact a person's academic

266
00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:16.600
performance. Right. And, uh,

267
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.170
just before the break we were talking to Michael intellect who after getting

268
00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:21.610
into stereotypes or at research,

269
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.560
he went on to Grad school and really focused in on stereotype threat as his

270
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:27.870
field of choice. Yeah.

271
00:15:27.871 --> 00:15:31.390
So how many studies of stereotype threat did you end up doing?

272
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:36.540
I would say in the order of like, uh, in terms of number of studies, you know,

273
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.520
20, maybe 15 to 20, something like that.

274
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.400
He did a lot of studies on women's performance in math,

275
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:45.610
but also just looking at different environments and how they create our

276
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.180
encouraged these stereotypes. And over the course of his career,

277
00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.200
he ended up editing a book about stereotype threat. Um,

278
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.900
gave numerous talks on the subject all over the world.

279
00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.250
Even signed a brief kind of explaining stereotype threat to the Supreme Court of

280
00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.060
the United States.

281
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.930
The supreme court heard the oral argument and Fisher v University of Texas at

282
00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:08.170
Austin, as it applied to the question of affirmative action,

283
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.040
the court will decide whether race used in university and college admission

284
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:16.660
policies, its constitution. Um, so I, you know, put my name to this, but then

285
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:17.840
<v 9>I went to,</v>

286
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.310
<v 8>he moved to Toronto.</v>

287
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:26.500
I started my,

288
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.140
my current job at the University of Toronto in 2005,

289
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.190
and while he was there,

290
00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:35.760
he was running a lot of his stereotypes or at research on women in math,

291
00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:36.180
you know,

292
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.930
giving women a test and then doing some intervention to reduce the stereotype

293
00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:44.931
and seeing if there'd be a difference in their test scores and simply put for

294
00:16:45.661 --> 00:16:50.190
the first time, I was not able to consistently show any effect of, of,

295
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.380
of stereotype threat. In other words,

296
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.280
the women who had received this stereotype threat reducing intervention

297
00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.450
performed just about the same as the women who hadn't. So I think, um,

298
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.810
when I first got here, I, you know, fail to, to,

299
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.220
to replicate some of these effects. I'm like,

300
00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.880
let me go back to the drawing board. Let me think about what is my,

301
00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:10.500
how is my population different?

302
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.700
And his first thought was maybe it has something to do with Toronto. So Toronto,

303
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.260
uh, incredibly diverse. A place like take the freshman psych classes,

304
00:17:19.261 --> 00:17:22.740
he was teaching, we're talking about, you know, a third East Asian I,

305
00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:27.741
third South Asian and only about 15% Caucasian or European Canadian and then a

306
00:17:28.801 --> 00:17:29.730
little bit of everything else.

307
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.490
So he started wondering to what extent do our students even,

308
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.660
how are they aware of these stereotypes about, you know, women in math. Um,

309
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.230
and remarkably when I would ask, you know, our students this, like he'd asked,

310
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.830
who here is heard of the stereotype that women are bad at math? Um,

311
00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:48.150
I would say no more than like a quarter to a third had, you know,

312
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.460
a strong awareness of this stereotype.

313
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.680
So he started running the experiments again,

314
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:57.681
but I'd only pick those women and men who actually had awareness,

315
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.610
but even then I still then couldn't get the effect. Um, so it's like, okay,

316
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:04.530
well maybe I'm doing something wrong.

317
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.070
Or maybe like maybe the interventions he was designing weren't reducing the

318
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:09.150
threat or would these students,

319
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:12.120
maybe the threat just wasn't that much of a threat in the first place.

320
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.620
But by this time Michael had already done a ton of research on stereotype threat

321
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.880
and you know, like I'm a person who gets bored a rather quickly and I just,

322
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:21.151
you know,

323
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:25.710
started at least started losing interest but just a couple of years later. Well,

324
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:27.990
so, um, things changed

325
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.370
on October 17th, 2011 this one paper was published,

326
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.470
it was a paper called false positive psychology and this paper detailed how just

327
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:44.460
by doing some very standard practices in psychology research and these

328
00:18:44.461 --> 00:18:47.160
techniques, some of which we're taught explicitly in Grad school,

329
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.110
you could sometimes end up with these sort of ludicrous conclusions.

330
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.200
Yeah. So you're saying there were,

331
00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.260
this paper was showing ways in which experimenters could subtly unknowingly

332
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:05.010
juice their results. Is that essentially what it was set? Yeah, essentially. Um,

333
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:08.070
so the paper was pointing out that it becomes sort of standard practice that you

334
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:08.191
know,

335
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:11.760
when you are researching for some effect like oh how happy people were or how

336
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.050
well they did on a test that you would measure that thing in a couple of

337
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.840
different ways, which is what I said. It's considered a good practice, right?

338
00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:23.040
You want to know one measure captures your construct perfectly so you should

339
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:27.120
measure that thing and as many ways as possible. Um,

340
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.940
but now what if you find that it quote unquote works.

341
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:34.830
Your hypothesis has confirmed with one of those measures but it's not confirmed

342
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:38.730
with three or four of the other ones and it was not uncommon practice at that

343
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:39.760
point to just, you know,

344
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.110
report the one place where you got an effect when they report the one that

345
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:43.560
worked.

346
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.130
You could even argue that you were just dialing in exactly where this effect

347
00:19:47.131 --> 00:19:48.750
happens. But the paper,

348
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:53.640
this false psychology paper pointed out that if you ignore the places where it

349
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.533
didn't work,

350
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.920
that's not really a full picture of what that data actually looked like.

351
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.360
And the data is a whole, if you looked at all of it,

352
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.980
might not actually support your conclusion. I remember reading that. Um,

353
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.670
my jaw dropped. I sent this, this paper,

354
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:13.671
I circulated it to the other faculty in my department and all of us,

355
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.360
or many of us saw the,

356
00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.610
the importance of this paper and we call it an emergency meeting called an

357
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:22.880
emergency meeting. Yeah. I'll never forget it. I mean, it was,

358
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.230
what does an emergency meeting look like of the faculty on, of, uh,

359
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.040
the graduate students to just discuss the contents of the paper, um,

360
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.190
to see what it meant, what the implications were. And as they talked it over,

361
00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:39.740
they realize that in some ways, probably some of their own work, um,

362
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.040
had fallen prey to the problems that this paper was pointing out. I,

363
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.980
I did see myself in, in some of this, um, and I thought,

364
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.280
<v 3>you know, wow. Like, well, you know, what has been implicated,</v>

365
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:55.080
what papers of mine, but papers more generally, uh, have been in,

366
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.830
bucketed in the fields, you know, writ large.

367
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.040
People looked at that paper and everyone thought, oh,

368
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:06.440
<v 7>this is Dan Engber again. And according to Dan emergency meetings,</v>

369
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.400
like the one that Michael Inzlicht found himself in were happening all over the

370
00:21:10.401 --> 00:21:15.380
world. You know, this is, this is what we're all doing this stuff.

371
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.740
And now we know from this one paper that it's very,

372
00:21:20.901 --> 00:21:25.010
very easy to turn up spurious findings this way. Yeah, it changed.

373
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.740
It changed everything in part because a group of scientists started thinking,

374
00:21:27.741 --> 00:21:27.951
wow,

375
00:21:27.951 --> 00:21:32.720
maybe we really need to go back and reinvestigate some of the key findings in

376
00:21:32.721 --> 00:21:34.870
our field. They call them high power replication.

377
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:37.430
So you're just kind of doing the same thing but just with more people.

378
00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.120
So they started doing these studies with bigger sample sizes and with strict

379
00:21:41.121 --> 00:21:42.950
rules about what data you were looking at.

380
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.860
They say ahead of time exactly what they're going to do and how they're going to

381
00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:47.090
analyze the data. So you know,

382
00:21:47.091 --> 00:21:52.091
there's no possibility of monkeying around to get the answer you want.

383
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.840
And these attempts to replicate or reproduce, you know,

384
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.220
major findings in social psychology.

385
00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.350
And the sort of panic that went along with it came to be known as the

386
00:22:03.351 --> 00:22:08.210
replication crisis replication. It's the cornerstone of science.

387
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.650
There's articles who this week are talking about the reproducibility crisis in

388
00:22:12.651 --> 00:22:16.250
science. It's like, Oh man, what, you know, what is going on here?

389
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.130
Because as they reexamined some of these studies,

390
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.540
facial feedback effect studies that got lots of coverage in newspapers and

391
00:22:23.541 --> 00:22:27.260
magazines and then you'll be taking part in today involves some of these

392
00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:29.900
replications we're failing.

393
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:35.150
<v 3>So specifically what got me really into covering the replication crisis was news</v>

394
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.330
about ego depletion.

395
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.350
So this is a whole literature of studies that were all about, um,

396
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.830
how we sort of use up our willpower.

397
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.030
Your original study is you go into a lab and you're presented with a, um,

398
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.970
a dish of delicious fresh bake chocolate chip cookies.

399
00:22:50.971 --> 00:22:52.440
I love the method section of that paper.

400
00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:56.010
They described baking the cookies in the labs so that the smell that would be

401
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.970
around the subject when they come in and they,

402
00:22:58.971 --> 00:23:02.790
they put these cookies out and they say you can't have any cookies and then they

403
00:23:02.791 --> 00:23:05.880
leave you alone with the cookies. And what they found was that, you know,

404
00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:07.290
if someone has to sit there,

405
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.160
I'm resisting a cookie with it right in front of them and the smell is wafting

406
00:23:11.161 --> 00:23:14.010
up their nose as they sit there. Um, if they have to go through that,

407
00:23:14.011 --> 00:23:17.940
it'll actually be much harder for them to complete certain kinds of logic

408
00:23:17.941 --> 00:23:22.770
puzzles. And the argument was you use willpower on task a,

409
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.450
then you tried to do task B and you just won't have a store of willpower in less

410
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.960
later studies found you drank some lemonade in the meantime because sugar,

411
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.300
the argument goes, replenishes your willpower.

412
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.440
So there were sort of like increasingly bizarre elaborations of this original

413
00:23:37.441 --> 00:23:40.770
theory. It ended up working with M and m's ended up working with cookies.

414
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.150
It ended up over the years. Dan says,

415
00:23:42.151 --> 00:23:45.920
this idea that you use up willpower in one place and have less another just

416
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.410
start entering all different corners of our lives.

417
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.510
The insight of that original study was replicated again and again and again for

418
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:54.200
decades.

419
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.700
But then this group of scientists did this massive effort to replicate the

420
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:02.630
original study. They had over 2000 um, subjects.

421
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.680
They followed these rigorous rules about like what data they were going to look

422
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:09.980
at. This is as rigorous a replication as you can get.

423
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.510
And they just found like no effect, basically no effect.

424
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.970
But I guess I still don't understand like how is it that they're,

425
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.910
that they are finding nothing now but,

426
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.450
but before they had a study that was then replicated a bunch of times and a

427
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:27.830
bunch of different labs, look what I still don't get what's going on?

428
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.260
Well [inaudible] so, so you have that original cookie study? Yeah,

429
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.060
I think it's notable that no other studies that I know have used cookies.

430
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.670
Now I've found studies where mnms were used.

431
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.960
So that just makes me wonder, I'm,

432
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.700
I have no idea how that lab did their study,

433
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.930
but it makes me wonder what would happen if I would ran a lab and I wanted to

434
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.520
reproduce this cookie finding and extend it in a new direction and I kept trying

435
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:56.870
it with cookies and it just never worked. Let me try it with um,

436
00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.230
Charleston Chews doesn't work. Hmm.

437
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.160
Cause it's not hard to resist the Charleston.

438
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.870
Maybe Charleston shoes are not good candy. And I end up, I'm like,

439
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.260
I do it with m and ms and it works. Boom. There's my dissertation,

440
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:11.990
I publish a paper out of it. So now that's in literature.

441
00:25:11.991 --> 00:25:15.080
And so now ego depletion seems like an even stronger,

442
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.370
more valid thing because it's not just about cookies now it's about cookies or m

443
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:20.150
and. M's.

444
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.260
My point is that you don't really know how many things were tried and each

445
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:25.094
individual lab.

446
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.490
Do you think that might be what's happening in these labs is that there's a lot

447
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:33.491
of trial and error and the error is sort of swept aside and the successes are

448
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:38.270
offered up and then suddenly you have one more success that bolsters the idea.

449
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.640
Is that what you think might be happening? I think that's,

450
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.500
that is the heart of it.

451
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.940
<v 7>Whatever the problems are, not with those followup studies.</v>

452
00:25:47.941 --> 00:25:52.620
The big thing was that scientists were continuing to fail at replicating these

453
00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.980
big [inaudible] and fairly well known studies like the,

454
00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:01.580
the idea that when you smile it changes your mood or offering you a free no tech

455
00:26:03.901 --> 00:26:04.620
life hack.

456
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.520
The idea presented in one of the most watched ted talks ever that that the way

457
00:26:08.521 --> 00:26:13.320
you sort of hold yourself or stand you make yourself big, you stretch out,

458
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.640
you take up the idea that that could have a measurable impact on your behavior

459
00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:19.110
or even your hormone levels.

460
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.980
That one also failed to replicate and that kept happening with study after

461
00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:25.680
study. And of course, you know, other people would come back and say,

462
00:26:25.681 --> 00:26:30.570
oh the replication effort wasn't done right or you didn't really design it well.

463
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.370
You're seeing a lot of the researchers who have made their careers studying

464
00:26:35.371 --> 00:26:39.270
certain effects, they're just not budging. A few of them are,

465
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:44.160
but most of them are not budging. So, uh, you just have a forming,

466
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.110
<v 3>I one researcher described it to me,</v>

467
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:49.570
it's like a civil war within social psychology is still,

468
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.470
so is stereotype threat now itself under threat is,

469
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.240
is it one of these bodies of research that's being rethought?

470
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:02.330
Well no one has yet done the big multisite preregistered replication that they

471
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:07.290
did for ego depletion. The one that like really woke me up to this.

472
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.010
But Dan says there have been sort of smaller scale here and there kind of

473
00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:13.860
attempts to replicate some of the studies and you know,

474
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.000
some of those have failed.

475
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.950
Some studies came out that found that he knew what I tried to Redo.

476
00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:24.540
I tried to do the stereotype threat thing on a big group students and I found

477
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:28.830
that sometimes the opposite happened when I tried to induce stereotype threat.

478
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.270
The students did better. It's like, I'll show you,

479
00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.710
<v 1>well let me, let me say this.</v>

480
00:27:35.711 --> 00:27:39.850
Maybe this will help there because this is something, you know,

481
00:27:39.851 --> 00:27:41.410
I've thought a lot about from the very beginning.

482
00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.120
<v 0>So when we talked to Claude Steele about all this, um,</v>

483
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.820
he had a couple things to say. First of all,

484
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.580
this research has been dramatically well replicated.

485
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.970
The stereotype threat affect has been demonstrated, you know,

486
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.840
way more times in way more different contexts than really any of those other

487
00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.580
social psychology study.

488
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.120
<v 1>I don't know if there's another, if there's another phenomenon,</v>

489
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:06.210
it has produced so many demonstration and if you can't replicate one of them or

490
00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:11.560
six of them, I don't know. I wouldn't, I would, that doesn't surprise me.

491
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.921
<v 0>And he says, you know,</v>

492
00:28:12.921 --> 00:28:16.330
you could even see the failures as just information about, um,

493
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.940
where the effect really applies and where it doesn't.

494
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.980
<v 1>This is science gradually getting sophisticated enough to help apply it</v>

495
00:28:25.161 --> 00:28:26.420
inappropriate places.

496
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.111
<v 0>For example,</v>

497
00:28:27.111 --> 00:28:31.250
he says he would only expect the effect to appear in at times when the person is

498
00:28:31.251 --> 00:28:34.670
really invested in what they're trying to do and thus the negative stereotype,

499
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.080
you know really is threatening on top of that he says the kinds of stereotypes

500
00:28:39.081 --> 00:28:43.520
that are actually threatening to a given group might change over time.

501
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.770
<v 1>If you just exactly replicated what we did 25 years ago.</v>

502
00:28:47.771 --> 00:28:51.790
I'm not sure that the stimuli and the procedures would have the same meaning

503
00:28:51.791 --> 00:28:54.580
with today's college students that they had then.

504
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.770
Now the social psychology is the meanings come from the contemporary moment,

505
00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:01.630
the way the state of the culture at that time.

506
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.271
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

507
00:29:02.271 --> 00:29:06.460
I mean that is interesting actually that I mean if what this research is doing

508
00:29:06.461 --> 00:29:11.461
is studying like an individual's relationship to like threat and like that's

509
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.520
going to be different depending on who you are because you're going to find

510
00:29:15.521 --> 00:29:18.430
different things threatening where you are or even when you are.

511
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.490
<v 1>Yeah, I, I don't have,</v>

512
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.580
I don't think I know enough about quote the culture of black students today

513
00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:29.100
versus the culture of black students 25 years ago.

514
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.780
But it wouldn't surprise me that there are some real differences. So I,

515
00:29:32.781 --> 00:29:37.781
I don't put as much stock in the exact replication of experiment a or B as I do

516
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.130
in the conceptual

517
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.470
<v 3>replication. Is it possible, I mean,</v>

518
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.250
you mentioned there are just hundreds of studies that,

519
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.740
that kind of a circle around the same idea in different ways that is on its

520
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:55.790
face, very compelling evidence that, you know,

521
00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:00.550
this is a robust phenomenon, but the same time, you know,

522
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.120
there's people who gather all the data together and they say, look, you know,

523
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.810
maybe there's some kind of bias that slips in when people are doing this

524
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:08.201
research.

525
00:30:08.201 --> 00:30:13.201
So they just keep trying different versions until they get something that looks

526
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:15.970
like a result. Does that seem plausible to you?

527
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.530
<v 1>Boy, that's a deeply,</v>

528
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:22.743
<v 4>um,</v>

529
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.260
<v 1>I guess cynical, you know, I</v>

530
00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.880
count of, uh, of the scientific literature this big,

531
00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.590
it would seem to add to it that doesn't seem highly probable to me.

532
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.770
Didn't seem highly likely. To me,

533
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.340
it's clearly real and replicable under these circumstances is just because

534
00:30:40.341 --> 00:30:45.341
they're not everything doesn't mean they're not strategically important to the

535
00:30:45.471 --> 00:30:46.820
progress of this society.

536
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:47.790
<v 0>And in fact,</v>

537
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.760
Claude points out that the stereotype threat is pretty unique in the fact that

538
00:30:50.761 --> 00:30:54.870
many of the studies in this literature are not just in the lab they've been

539
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:59.070
taken out into the streets with, with real people. That's really where the,

540
00:30:59.400 --> 00:30:59.671
you know,

541
00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:04.671
the tire meets the road is can you actually move the educational performance of

542
00:31:05.851 --> 00:31:09.780
real people in real, uh, school situations.

543
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.730
And Claude sent us actually a list of 37 different studies showing that the

544
00:31:14.731 --> 00:31:19.731
interventions designed to reduce stereotype threat can have dramatic and long

545
00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:23.790
lasting effects on achievement. Now we should say there was at least one case,

546
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:23.940
a,

547
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.940
there was a study done in 2006 that a researcher tried to replicate in 2011 he

548
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.580
has several hundred students instead of whatever it was,

549
00:31:32.581 --> 00:31:34.970
several dozen from the original study. And he finds it,

550
00:31:34.971 --> 00:31:39.510
the fact is just much smaller than the original 2006 effect.

551
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:44.130
And then just last year he did it again with more students this time and he got

552
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:45.780
pretty much nothing.

553
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Is the same guy in the same school system trying to do the same study with you

554
00:31:51.331 --> 00:31:53.640
know, hundreds and hundreds of kids and he came up with nothing.

555
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.430
I'm curious to know at Lehman,

556
00:31:55.431 --> 00:31:59.090
given that replication has become a conversation that you have to unfortunately

557
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:02.750
contend with. I'm just curious if it's changed your opinion of the work.

558
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:10.160
<v 1>No, I mean I, I don't think there's anything that could make me go, oh,</v>

559
00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:11.540
this whole thing is not true.

560
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:16.700
<v 0>I mean, I want the truth out there more than I want anything else.</v>

561
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.150
This is the Spencer. He was an early collaborator with Claude Steele,

562
00:32:20.151 --> 00:32:23.330
especially on those studies involving women and math tests.

563
00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:27.920
I did recognize in some of the critiques, real issues that we need to deal with.

564
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:28.491
But Steve,

565
00:32:28.491 --> 00:32:33.491
like Claude is very confident in the results of his studies in the effect of the

566
00:32:34.341 --> 00:32:36.150
stereotype threat in general. Um,

567
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.920
so much so that I'm writing right now an where

568
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.040
<v 10>I'm going to disclose every single study I've ever done,</v>

569
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:47.150
what the results are and put the data up for everybody to look at. Wow. Um,

570
00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:51.500
I will admit to the question will research practices that I've done,

571
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:56.870
um, and be as forthcoming and honest with everything in my own lab.

572
00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:01.460
In addition to doing that, I've entered into an adversarial collaboration.

573
00:33:01.461 --> 00:33:01.970
It's called,

574
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.720
<v 0>which just means he's going to do a big scale reproduction study</v>

575
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:09.660
<v 10>with people who have serious doubts about whether stereotype threat is real.</v>

576
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.230
You know, I can't say ahead of time what my reaction will be.

577
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:18.470
I think what I can promise is that I will take the findings very seriously and I

578
00:33:19.141 --> 00:33:22.170
will do my utmost not to be defensive about them.

579
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:27.060
Are you nervous about this itself? No. I mean the stakes are pretty high.

580
00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:32.160
No, no. I mean, you know a what you mean the stakes are high.

581
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:35.250
I mean, I'm a full professor. I have tenure.

582
00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:40.020
What are the real stakes for me in this? Not really much,

583
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.650
<v 0>but, well,</v>

584
00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:46.750
not everyone in the field is handling these kinds of niggling doubts. Um,

585
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.500
so, well,

586
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.290
<v 8>there are so many pieces of evidence that things are not, all right.</v>

587
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.670
<v 0>This again is Michael intellect, the professor from Toronto</v>

588
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.680
<v 8>to be faced with the, the, the, the probability,</v>

589
00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.710
the likelihood that all this might've been for not,

590
00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.250
or much of it might've been for nod. It's, you know, it's unsettling, right?

591
00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:07.680
It's, it's, it's a loss of meaning.

592
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:12.550
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

593
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.480
<v 8>you know, W was, I was, I doing good work was a contribute to knowledge. Um,</v>

594
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.380
I was, I, part of the problem was I tasting, you know,

595
00:34:20.381 --> 00:34:22.600
signal was I tasting noise.

596
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.520
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

597
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.300
<v 8>I mean, I think the effect is, you know, it might be there,</v>

598
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.620
but it might be so small as to not be, not be meaningfully important.

599
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:43.743
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

600
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.140
[inaudible] [inaudible]

601
00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.600
<v 0>that's interesting. I don't know. It's hard to know where to stand on this.</v>

602
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.220
Well, one thing that you know,

603
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:57.730
you should make clear is that stereotypes can be really damaging. I mean,

604
00:34:57.731 --> 00:35:00.820
having someone tell you you suck at something when you're under the gun to do

605
00:35:00.821 --> 00:35:04.900
it. Um, that's always gonna you know, that's going to have an effect.

606
00:35:04.901 --> 00:35:07.360
I guess the question is, yeah, how you know,

607
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.720
what effect exactly and when and how and what can you do about it and,

608
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.660
and those things feel like maybe,

609
00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:22.390
I guess it feels like the part of me that wanted this to be a kind of very

610
00:35:22.391 --> 00:35:26.440
simple fix that would work everywhere and sort of save the world. You know,

611
00:35:26.441 --> 00:35:28.960
that part is really, you know, feeling a little bit of,

612
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:33.550
a lot like worrying that this whole thing is shrinking on me a bit. But yeah,

613
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.820
totally. It does feel that weirdly, like we're all growing up a little bit.

614
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.980
Is it, you kind of just have to walk away from the, those big simple promises,

615
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:41.810
you know? Yeah.

616
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:45.210
Maybe that's exactly what you need in order to be able to find the smaller

617
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:48.600
places where you can have an effect. You know, right here,

618
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.260
right now with this person trying to do this particular thing.

619
00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.773
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

620
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:10.973
[inaudible]

621
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.310
