00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.320
Find the range and the
mid-range of the following sets

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.490
of numbers.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.172
So what the range tells us is
essentially how spread apart

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:10.130
these numbers are, and
the way you calculate it

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.630
is that you just
take the difference

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.630
between the largest
of these numbers

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.787
and the smallest
of these numbers.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:17.870
And so if we look at the
largest of these numbers,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.530
I'll circle it in magenta,
it looks like it is 94.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.200
94 is larger than
every other number

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.990
here, so that's the
largest of the numbers.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.000
And from that, we
want to subtract

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.490
the smallest of the numbers.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.100
And the smallest of the numbers
in our set right over here

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.010
is 65.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.120
So you want to
subtract 65 from 94.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.420
And this is equal to-- Let's
see, if this was 95 minus 65,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.380
it would be 30.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.080
94 is one less than
that, so it is 29.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.810
So the larger this number is,
that means the more spread out.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.230
The larger the difference
between the largest

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.310
and the smallest number.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.990
The smaller this is, that means
the tighter the range, just

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.840
to use the word itself, of
the numbers actually are.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.110
So that's the range.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.820
The mid-range is
one way of thinking

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.864
to some degree of kind of
central tendency, so mid-range.

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:08.280
And what you do
with the mid-range

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.690
is you take the average of the
largest number and the smallest

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.570
number.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.940
So here we took the difference.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.730
That's the range.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.470
The mid-range would be the
average of these two numbers.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.364
So it would be 94 plus 65.

00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:22.780
And when I talk
about average, I'm

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.330
talking about the
arithmetic mean over 2.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.540
So this is going to be what?

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.750
90 plus 60 is 150.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.650
150, 4 plus 5 is 159.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.610
159 divided by 2 is equal
to-- 150 divided by 2 is 75.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.050
9 divided by 2 is 4 and 1/2.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.902
So this would be 79.5.

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.360
So it's one kind
of way of thinking

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.855
about the middle
of these numbers.

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:54.730
Another way is obviously
the arithmetic mean,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.521
where you actually take
the arithmetic mean

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.313
of everything here.

00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:58.979
Obviously, you could
also look at things

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.280
like the median and the mode.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.810
So range and mid-range.
