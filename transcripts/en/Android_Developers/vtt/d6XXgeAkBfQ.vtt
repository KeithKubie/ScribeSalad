Hello, my name is Reto Meier,
and welcome to This Week in

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.740
Android Development on Monday
August 5, 2013.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.590
Last week, I waved my hands
around in a sign of unbridled

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.620
excitement as I introduced
Android 4.3, an exciting

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.620
gourmet flavor of jelly
bean available for

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.520
your development pleasure.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.280
Stefan and took a deeper dive
into one of these new Android

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.700
4.3 features with a look at the
new UI Automation Testing

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.600
Tool Kit, while Ankur continued
his series of making

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.160
apps beautiful with a glance
back at backwards

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.580
compatibility and a fresh new
take on modernization.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.930
Not to be outdone, Chet did some
stretching and squashing,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.180
and also recorded a DevByte
on animation.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.080
The July Android Developer
Survey closed last week with

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.610
6,000 Android developers
sharing their thoughts.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.370
It was no surprise to see the US
developers account for the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.510
largest number of responses.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.520
But which country do you think
filled the number two spot?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.110
The Google Play Games Services
team had found an ingenious

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.530
way to ensure that they have
more time for playing games by

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.710
having you do their jobs for
them with the launch of the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.890
public bug tracker for Google
Play Game Services.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.050
Join them this week for another
episode of Game On

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.920
where they'll be taking you
through the process of saving

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.870
game state to the cloud.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.970
Our European colleagues joined
the Paris Android user group

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.290
for what I'm sure was a
debaucherous event filled with

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.100
fine wine, soft cheeses, and
some Android development, or

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.930
at least that's what their
expense report suggests.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.560
Coming up this week, JF is back
with a breakdown of how

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.330
to detect Overdraw using
the Hierarchy Viewer.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.000
And Nick the Butcher has
prepared some find cuts of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.070
aged and marbled design bytes,
starting this week with a look

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.910
at responsive design.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.650
Not to be outdone, keep an eye
out for the latest from Chet

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.470
as he delves into the magical
world of cartoon animation

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.710
techniques.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.040
Also this week, our Australian
advocates will be hosting the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.550
second part of their Making Apps
Beautiful backstage show.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.370
Join them to ask questions on
how you can make your apps a

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.790
little more magical.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.760
That's all for this week
in Android Development.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.110
Be sure to check out this week's
Dev and Design bytes

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.110
and know that I'll set fire
to your new shoes.
