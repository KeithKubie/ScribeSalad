00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.800
Thought I would do some
more example problems

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.120
involving triangles.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.810
And so this first one, it says
the measure of the largest

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.990
angle in a triangle
is 4 times the measure

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.360
of the second largest angle.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.850
The smallest angle
is 10 degrees.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.677
What are the measures
of all the angles?

00:00:18.677 --> 00:00:19.760
Well, we know one of them.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.760
We know it's 10 degrees.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.550
Let's draw an arbitrary
triangle right over here.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.940
So let's say that
is our triangle.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.401
We know that the smallest angle
is going to be 10 degrees.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.900
And I'll just say,
let's just assume

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.570
that this right over here is the
measure of the smallest angle.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.180
It's 10 degrees.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.960
Now let's call the
second largest angle--

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.090
let's call that x.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.960
So the second largest
angle, let's call that x.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.535
So this is going to be x.

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:44.910
And then the first
sentence, they

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.130
say the measure of the
largest angle in a triangle

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.340
is 4 times the measure of
the second largest angle.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.160
So the second
largest angle is x.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.100
4 times that measure
is going to be 4x.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.620
So the largest angle
is going to be 4x.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.269
And so the one thing we
know about the measures

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.980
of the angles
inside of a triangle

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.820
is that they add
up to 180 degrees.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.200
So we know that 4x
plus x plus 10 degrees

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.590
is going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.630
It's going to be equal to 180.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.100
And 4x plus x, that
just gives us 5x.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.170
And then we have 5x plus
10 is equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.050
Subtract 10 from both sides.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.710
You get 5x is equal to 170.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.716
And so x is equal to 170/5.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.860
And let's see, it'll go into
it-- what is that, 34 times?

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.130
Let me verify this.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.904
So 5 goes into-- yeah,
it should be 34 times

00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:50.320
because it's going to go into
it twice as many times as 10

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.100
would go into it.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.730
10 would go into 170 17 times.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.300
5 would go into 170 34 times.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.420
So we could verify it.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.345
Go into 170.

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:00.340
5 goes into 17 three times.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.230
3 times 5 is 15.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.310
Subtract, you get 2.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.320
Bring down the 0.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.510
5 goes into 20 four
times, and then you're

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.919
not going to have a remainder.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.430
4 times 5 is 20.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.090
No remainder.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.280
So it's 34 times.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.540
So x is equal to 34.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.370
So the second largest angle
has a measure of 34 degrees.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.890
This angle up here is
going to be 4 times that.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.340
So 4 times 34--
let's see, that's

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.090
going to be 120 degrees
plus 16 degrees.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.660
This is going to be 136 degrees.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.320
Is that right?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.180
4 times 4 is 16, 4 times
3 is 120, 16 plus 120

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.640
is 136 degrees.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.380
So we're done.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.630
The three measures, or the
sizes of the three angles,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.090
are 10 degrees, 34
degrees, and 136 degrees.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.860
Let's do another one.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.440
So let's see.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.650
We have a little bit
of a drawing here.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.282
And what I want
to do is-- and we

00:02:52.282 --> 00:02:53.740
could think about
different things.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.420
We could say, let's solve for x.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.080
I'm assuming that 4x is
the measure of this angle.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.320
2x is the measure of that
angle right over there.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.264
We can solve for x.

00:03:03.264 --> 00:03:04.930
And then if we know
x, we can figure out

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.990
what the actual measures
of these angles are,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.690
assuming that we
can figure out x.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.231
And the other thing
that they tell us

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.350
is that this line
over here is parallel

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.390
to this line over here.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.730
And it was very craftily drawn.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.800
Because it's parallel,
but one stops here,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.165
and then one starts up there.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.540
So the first thing
I want to do--

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.730
if they're telling us that
these two lines are parallel,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.730
there's probably going
to be something involving

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.840
transversals or something.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.923
It might be something
involving-- the other option

00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:29.840
is something
involving triangles.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.019
And at first, you might
say, wait, is this angle

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.310
and that angle vertical angles?

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.290
But you have to be very careful.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.831
They are not.

00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:36.750
This is not the same line.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.920
This line is parallel
to that line.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.240
This line, it's bending
right over there,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.010
so we can't make any type
of assumption like that.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.390
So the interesting
thing-- and I'm not sure

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.140
if this will lead in
the right direction--

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.940
is to just make it
clear that these two are

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.130
part of parallel lines.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.330
So I could continue this
line down like this.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.185
And then I can continue
this line up like that.

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:00.560
And then that starts to look
a little bit more like we're

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.740
used to when we're dealing
with parallel lines.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.280
And then this line
segment, BC-- or we

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.160
could even say line BC, if
we were to continue it on.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.580
If we were to continue it
on and on, even pass D,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.590
then this is clearly
a transversal

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.550
of those two parallel lines.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.700
This is clearly a transversal.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.850
And so if this angle
right over here is 4x,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.330
it has a corresponding angle.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.140
Half of the-- or maybe most
of the work on all of these

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.930
is to try to see the parallel
lines and see the transversal

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.970
and see the things that
might be useful for you.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.660
So that right there
is the transversal.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.950
These are the parallel lines.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.150
That's one parallel line.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.515
That is the other parallel line.

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:42.950
You can almost try
to zone out all

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.810
of the other stuff
in the diagram.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.330
And so if this angle
right over here is 4x,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.930
it has a corresponding
angle where the transversal

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.930
intersects the
other parallel line.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.190
This right here is its
corresponding angle.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.640
So let me draw it
in that same yellow.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.770
This right over here is
a corresponding angle.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.810
So this will also be 4x.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.710
And we see that this angle--
this angle and this angle,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.470
this angle that has measure
4x and this angle that

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.960
measures 2x-- we see that
they're supplementary.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.330
They're adjacent to each other.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.269
Their outer sides
form a straight angle.

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:19.810
So they're supplementary,
which means

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.640
that their measures
add up to 180 degrees.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.990
They kind of form-- they
go all the way around

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.300
like that if you add the two
adjacent angles together.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.210
So we know that 4x plus 2x needs
to be equal to 180 degrees,

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.020
or we get 6x is
equal to 180 degrees.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.670
Divide both sides by 6.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.580
You get x is equal to 30,
or x is equal to-- well,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.100
I shouldn't say--
well, x could be 30.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.880
And then this angle right
over here is 2 times x.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.600
So it's going to be 60 degrees.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.480
So this angle right over here
is going to be 60 degrees.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.320
And this angle right
over here is 4 times x.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.720
So it is 120 degrees,
and we're done.
