00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.140
It’s almost impossible to release a film
that doesn’t include a single flawed stunt,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.690
unexpected mistake, or even a minor plot hole
most fans will overlook.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.610
When the budgets get bigger and the action
sequences and running times grow along with

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.520
them, the errors that can slip through are
often hard to believe.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.340
And for the die-hard fans, the best bloopers
can make a film worth watching all by themselves.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.980
Here are Screenrant’s 10 Biggest Blockbuster
Movie Mistakes You Didn’t See.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.980
Fast Five

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.720
How do you rob the richest man in Brazil when
his money is scattered throughout Rio?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720
Easy.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.899
Get him to store it all in one place.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.219
That’s the plan for the crew of Fast Five,
aiming to steal a massive safe once the movie’s

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.570
villain has done their work for them.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.140
It’s easier said than done, since the vault
can only be unlocked by the villain’s palm

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.140
print.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.550
Giselle uses old fashioned sex appeal to work
around the lock, stealing his fingerprints

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.620
from her own swimsuit.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.940
Once fans are done wondering why the villain
needed to see his money gathered if only he

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.129
could open the vault, they’ll notice it’s
his right hand that unlocks it – and they

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.320
only got the prints from his left.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.320
The Avengers

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.130
When Earth’s Mightiest Heroes finally decide
to join forces willingly to take down Loki,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.689
Captain America asks Black Widow if she can
pilot the team into action in a SHIELD Quinjet.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.229
Hawkeye confirms that he can, and is invited
along for the ride.

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.560
But it doesn’t make any sense for Cap to
ask Widow in the first place.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.890
Not only is she one of Nick Fury’s top operatives,
but Cap personally flew on a Quinjet she was

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.729
piloting earlier in the film – in two different
scenes.

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.130
Maybe his years frozen solid had an effect
on his memory.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.780
The Return of the King

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.600
In the final chapter of Peter Jackson’s
Lord of the Rings trilogy, Aragorn realizes

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.410
that in order to defeat Sauron’s forces,
he’ll need some backup from the Army of

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.189
the Dead, doomed to haunt a nearby mountain
after betraying Aragorn’s ancestor.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.689
They’re definitely powerful, since even
speaking their name causes a massive gust

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.590
of wind through the ranger’s tent.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.270
More powerful than the filmmakers expected,
since a suit of armor is clearly knocked over

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.049
by the wind, falling in total silence in hopes
that viewers won’t catch it.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.829
Good luck un-seeing that mistake.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:03.829
The Dark Knight

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.679
When blockbuster action gets heated, the person
holding the camera not only has to capture

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.690
it the best way possible, but make sure they
don’t end up in the finished cut.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.570
In The Dark Knight, an interrogation room
covered in mirrors turned out to be too much

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.570
of a challenge.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.000
When Batman takes a hands-on approach with
Joker, the camera and its operator can all

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.200
be seen reflected for a split second beside
the two actors, an error that somehow made

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.580
it through editing.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.050
Transformers: Age of Extinction

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.200
Fans of Michael Bay’s movies know that when
action sequences shoot for the sky, some mistakes

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.230
or confusing sequences are par for the course.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.540
In the climactic Hong Kong battle of Age of
Extinction, star Mark Wahlberg and his daughter

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.320
flee across rooftops under heavy fire from
nearby Decepticons.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.780
Explosions are everywhere, but one long shot
reveals it’s not quite as dangerous as it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.780
seems.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.660
The director loves a good explosion, and obviously
hoped fans would be distracted enough to miss

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.060
the camera man, special effects and production
team members in plain sight scattered across

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.050
the rooftop.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.080
Jurassic Park

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.290
Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur thriller begins
with a bang, showing how deadly the park’s

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.440
Velociraptors can be.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.550
When one is simply being moved to her new
habitat, she singlehandedly manages to kill

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.709
a park worker from inside her own cage.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.580
When the gatekeeper tumbles from on top of
the cage, audiences were probably too terrified

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.390
to catch the hands that tried to break his
fall towards the camera.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.760
The next shot confirms it wasn’t one of
his co-workers, but a member of the movie

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.110
crew whose hands made an unexpected cameo.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.110
Star Trek

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.040
Few will forget the space dive sequence from
the 2009 Star Trek reboot, but those who were

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.130
paying close attention to the movie were probably
confused by the ship’s version of events.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.310
When Kirk, Sulu and Engineer Olson are speeding
towards the planet, Kirk is – obviously

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.700
– leading the charge, with Sulu close behind
him.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.790
When the camera immediately cuts to the bridge,
not only are they out of order, but Chekov

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.050
claims they are at a height of “20,000 metres”,
despite the screen showing a height of 102,000

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.050
metres.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.590
The images and audio have been lifted from
later in the sequence, and spliced in ahead

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.590
of time where it’s better to ignore them.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.590
Independence Day

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.330
Some science fiction fans may take issue with
this story of alien invaders, but there’s

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.370
one incredible error in the finished movie
that has nothing to do with computers or alien

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.370
tech.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.080
When Jeff Goldblum’s character has given
up all hope, he turns to alcohol, and storms

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.590
his way through Area 51’s hangar bay.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.480
His father eventually calms him down, but
not before Goldlbum kicks over a garbage can

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.690
clearly marked by the film’s “Art Department”.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.449
The piece of set dressing drew more attention
than it ever should have.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.110
Either that, or Area 51 is employing its own
team of artists.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.110
Avatar

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.270
James Cameron relied on green screen and CGI
wizardry to make most of his 3D epic, so it’s

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.780
no surprise that one of the most surprising
mistakes is set right here on Earth.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.259
Jake Sully is only given the chance to pilot
an alien Avatar because it was been grown

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.490
for his brilliant twin brother Tom, who was
killed in a robbery.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.060
Actor Sam Worthington plays both brothers,
but when Tom’s corpse is re-covered, it

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.030
is clearly a different actor on the second
shot that was used.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.050
We can only assume Worthington’s face was
going to be added in post-production, but

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.389
considering the other effects in the film,
it’s easy to see how this one slipped through

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.419
the cracks.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.740
Thor: The Dark World

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.849
Jane Porter may not be powerful as the average
Asgardian, but when she absorbed the Aether

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.050
in Thor 2, she became much more than just
a brilliant human scientist.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.370
But when the cosmic power was shown entering
her body, her wardrobe was a far cry from

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.290
the street clothes she was wearing before
and after.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.860
She would only wear the Asgardian metal and
robes once she made the trip to Thor’s homeworld

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.039
much later.

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.090
So unless the Aether can give glimpses of
the future for no reason whatsoever, it appears

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.300
the footage was taken from later in the movie,
with the hope that fans would be too distracted

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.789
by the flowing red energy to notice the inconsistency.

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.319
