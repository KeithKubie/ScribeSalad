00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.110
When people refer to Social
Security in the United States,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.220
they're really referring
to the OASDI, which

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:19.815
stands for Old Age Survivors
and Disability Insurance.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.190
And it is exactly what
this acronym implies it is.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.530
It provides retirement
benefits when someone retires.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.050
Or if someone passes
away before that

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.180
and they had paid into, or
paid into this social security

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.860
insurance, this OASDI,
then if they pass away,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.480
it'll provide benefits
for their survivors.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.370
Or if that person
doesn't pass away,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.390
but becomes disabled
and can't work anymore,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.030
it'll also provide
benefits for them.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.500
Now, one very, very
common misconception

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.340
with Social Security
is that it is somehow

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.670
a form of a retirement savings
account like a 401k or an IRA.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.450
It is not that.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.950
From the government's
point of view,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.850
they actually do it more
as a kind of insurance.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.150
But in reality, all it is
a way of current workers

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.290
to directly pay for the
retirement of existing

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.990
retirees.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.120
And the reason why they did this
is when it started off in 1935,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.080
they wanted the current retirees
to immediately get benefits.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.330
They didn't want to wait
for the current generation

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.600
to save enough money and
only use their money.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.540
So they made it kind
of a direct transfer

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.620
from the current
workers to the people

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.820
who are using the benefits.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.410
And just to make
the point clear,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.380
a traditional
retirement account--

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.070
so let's say this is me over
my career, and then I retire.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.660
And this is me after I retire.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.500
And so this is as I get older.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.250
So this is I'm aging
as we go to the right.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.200
So while during
my working years,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.310
in a traditional
retirement plan,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.880
I would be putting money
into some account someplace.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.200
And so this would be the
case of an IRA or 401k.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.090
And so this is an account--
and with the cases of IRAs

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.329
and 401Ks are tax deferred
and you can invest this.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.370
You invested in, you can
get some interest on it.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.560
So it can grow as
you invest it, as you

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.600
put more and more money into it.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.920
And you invest it well.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.250
And then once you
retire, that money

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.960
that you directly
placed there, will

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.755
be used to fund your retirement.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.020
Social Security is not this.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.790
When you pay the
FICA tax, and we'll

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.160
talk about that in more
detail in future videos.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.276
When you pay that
tax, you are actually

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:32.150
not putting it into a
little separate account

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.440
that you will then
tap into later.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.030
You are actually
for the most part,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.420
paying current retirees,
or survivors, or people

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.430
with disabilities, you're
paying their benefits.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.860
So the way Social Security
works is more like this.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.190
You have all of the current
workers paying their FICA

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.689
taxes.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.220
And right now, at least I think
these numbers are as of 2010,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.675
you have 157 million people
paying into Social Security.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.655
And you have 54 million people
receiving Social Security.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.780
And so this ratio
is pretty good.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.780
This money is right
now, as of 2010, 2011,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.740
it's enough money to pay
for all of these benefits.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.920
And actually we are running
a little bit of a surplus.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.170
And that surplus is put into
a separate trust account.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.100
And it's normally informally
call the Social Security Trust,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.280
or the more formal name
is the OASDI Trust.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.330
But I'll just call it the
Social Security Trust.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.090
And the idea behind this is,
OK, we're running a surplus now.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.910
We can cover at least all
of our current obligations

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.340
and we have a surplus.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.110
And then as more baby boomers
retire, and more people

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.650
go from this side
of the equation

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.260
to this side of
the equation, then

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.210
we can use the trust to
kind of make up any deficits

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.830
we might have.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.420
Because as we have more
people on the right,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.860
we're going to
have to spend more.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.640
And we're going to have
fewer people on the left.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.223
So we're going to
have less coming in.

00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:05.580
But look, we had all that
saved up surplus before.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.950
And so we can use that.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.780
And that might sound like
overall a decent idea,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.220
but the problem
is that this trust

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.260
is going to start
shrinking because

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.170
of all the retiring
of the baby boomers.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.649
And we estimate 2023-- and
these things move around based

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.870
on how much benefits
to retirees get,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.120
the economy, how many
people are paying into it,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.170
and a whole other
bunch of assumptions.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.770
But we estimate
is going to start

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.360
shrinking in roughly
a decade from now.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.370
And the really bad
thing is this thing

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.240
will be completely depleted.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.030
So we won't be able to
provide that extra funding

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.860
for this kind of,
this deficit, not

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.930
having enough money to
pay for all the retirees.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.110
It will be completely depleted
sometime between 2030 or 2040.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.797
And once again, this
is a good ways out.

00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:52.380
So it's based on a
lot of assumptions.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.830
But it's not that far out.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.280
This is actually
going to affect--

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.580
let's see I'm right now 35 in
2011, so in 2031, I'll be 55.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.240
And this will essentially
affect my retirement.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.850
By the time I retire,
in I don't know,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.030
hopefully I'm around 2042.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.560
Actually I'll probably have to
be 67, so what is that, 2045

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.550
or whatever I'm going to retire.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.930
Based on the current
taxes that are coming in,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.590
the current level of the Social
Security Trusts, the interest

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.840
that the Social Security Trust
is getting on its invested

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.256
money, and it's
all being invested

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:25.750
in Treasury securities.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.030
So it's invested in Treasury.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.470
So it's not getting crazy.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.314
Interest it's getting only a
few percentage points per year.

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:32.730
But it has to
because it has to be

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.350
invested in a very safe place.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.060
So given this, there are
three possible eventualities.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.794
Either the FICA tax goes up.

00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:42.710
So based on the number
of people working here,

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.560
you get more revenue per
person right over here.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.380
Eventuality number
two is the benefits

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.090
go down, or even
possibly disappear.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.090
And eventuality three
is, by this time frame

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.440
right over here, that other
parts of the government's

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.997
budget is going to have to
fund Social Security to make up

00:06:00.997 --> 00:06:01.580
the shortfall.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.996
Because you don't have enough
revenue coming from the FICA

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:05.570
tax and you don't
have enough money

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.160
from the Social Security Trust.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.600
So other parts of the budget.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.270
But as we'll see,
there wont really

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.230
be a lot of other
parts to the budget

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.280
because you also have
Medicare also growing.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.570
And actually Medicare is a
really unsustainable one,

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.410
the one that's growing even
faster than Social Security.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.780
So this is very much in
question whether there's even

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.480
another part of the budget
that you could possibly even

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.310
take from.
