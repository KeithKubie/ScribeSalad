00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.640
You are listening to radiolab radiolab. W.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.380
N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R. Good.

3
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.760
<v 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.820
<v 3>Three, two, one. Hello.</v>

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.110
<v 1>This show we are about to do, it began. Hey guys,</v>

6
00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:23.530
how's it going with the conversation that we had with a friend of ours that Eric

7
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.290
Simmons? Yeah. And he told us about this moment. Yeah, that was kind of strange.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.980
This is the, the San Jose sharks actually. Who is this a?

9
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:35.620
This is a hockey team or a yeah, hockey team. And like I,

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.520
I'm pretty strongly identified with, with hockey to begin with.

11
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:42.870
Like I play hockey. My Dad has played hockey his entire life. Um,

12
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.910
and the sharks started in the bay area like when I was 10 years old.

13
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.280
The sharks are my favorite, favorite creature by a long ways.

14
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.180
And so I've rooted for them forever. And for like the last like six years,

15
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.380
they've been really good.

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.980
Every year they're picked at the beginning of the year to go to the Stanley Cup,

17
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:01.740
maybe to win the Stanley Cup. And every year they fall short.

18
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.140
And so in 2007 they were in the playoffs. The sharks are the top seed.

19
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.780
They're playing the eight seed, which also is Anaheim,

20
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:14.390
which is probably their biggest arrival and they lose.

21
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.360
Oh, and I remember driving home from the ice rink,

22
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.520
it was probably about midnight and it was a really pretty night out,

23
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.890
<v 0>like the city lights and they're like shimmering on the water and there's always</v>

24
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:29.260
these tankers out like parked in the bay.

25
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.490
There's like the silhouettes of the boats and the Oakland coastline and the San

26
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.210
Francisco shoreline and like this is everything that makes me happy in the

27
00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:41.890
world. Eric says usually when he sees that view, no matter how he's feeling,

28
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.960
he's like, okay, everything's going to be good.

29
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:48.100
It's going to be fine because that is one putable city.

30
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.830
But that night I was so

31
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.820
<v 1>angry that I remember noticing this like this like beautiful scene and thinking,</v>

32
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.080
<v 0>I hate this. I hate everything about it. Burn down in flames</v>

33
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.720
<v 1>like I, that's embarrassing.</v>

34
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.250
The fact that these guys that I don't know lost a hockey game in Dallas that has

35
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:17.251
the power to override everything I think I like about myself and just turn me

36
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:21.430
into this like drooling, savage, angry beast. I don't like that.

37
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.600
Yeah. What I love about that story, by the way,

38
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:27.960
you know Eric is so taken with the subject that he's writing a book about it at

39
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.100
the moment. Anyway, go ahead.

40
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.600
But what I love about that story is it's so typical, you know,

41
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.670
almost every sports fan has had a moment where you're like,

42
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.090
I cannot believe my own emotions right now. Are you a burner? I mean, do you,

43
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.520
I'm not know. I mean, I watch sports, but I don't get into that.

44
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.950
I don't get into a darkness. I do.

45
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.480
There have definitely been times I've wanted to burn down New York and if you

46
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:50.330
ever asked yourself like, yeah,

47
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.870
<v 0>well that's the question, right? Yeah. For this hour anyway,</v>

48
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.610
like why is it that something as trivial as a hockey game feel like life or

49
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:05.050
death, which probably doesn't happen to a lot of public radio people, but hey,

50
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.730
we'll input because you shouldn't think that. Yeah. All right. All right.

51
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.050
[inaudible] you widened the category a little bit and just said Games Belden.

52
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.950
You'd include everybody right? Game everybody.

53
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.780
So then what is it about a game that makes it more than a game?

54
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.420
Yeah, well let's find out.

55
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.030
<v 1>Radiolab. I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Chad Abu Mirage. They with us</v>

56
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.450
sports to me as a kid were vital. Sports were the,

57
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.970
like if everything else on the planet had disappeared except for sports,

58
00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:41.960
I would've been fine if, if, if the church had gone away of school,

59
00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:44.450
had gone away, even if all my brothers and sisters had gone away,

60
00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:45.320
I liked them fine.

61
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:49.850
But sports was the only thing that I really loved as a kid.

62
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.410
Can you introduce yourself?

63
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.700
My name is Stephen Dubner and Stephen a is the author of freaking off

64
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.180
Freakonomics, the books, the blog, and I've got my own ISD in line,

65
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.490
kind of an inside joke.

66
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.240
And it's a fancy piece of studio equipment because now freakonomics is also a

67
00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:07.310
radio show we talking to you like in your living room.

68
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.280
And the reason we call Steven up, and this is the honest truth,

69
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.600
is that Soren Wheeler,

70
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:15.830
one of our producers overheard Steven telling this story in the men's room.

71
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.730
That's where I do most of my research for the show, actually answering the door.

72
00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:21.350
I look for friends

73
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.720
in case sworn overheard Steven and the stall got him to come into the studio and

74
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:30.410
tell to us, cause this is a story about a boy, a hero, and a dad,

75
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.860
and how those three things can get a little intertwined.

76
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.180
I don't really know what happened.

77
00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:40.181
What I know is that when I came into being in 1963 I was the last of eight kids

78
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.460
and Steven says already at that point sports was family law. In fact,

79
00:04:46.461 --> 00:04:49.640
when it came to baseball, no two people in the family,

80
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:51.260
including my mother and father's, there were 10 of us.

81
00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:54.980
No two people rooted for the same team. And as it turned out,

82
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.000
there was even a rule. No two people were allowed to root for the same team.

83
00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:02.660
Now he says his dad actually assigned each of the family members their own

84
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:03.890
baseball team and told them,

85
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.310
this is your team only you get to root for this team.

86
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.630
So my dad was a mets fan. My mom, I don't remember,

87
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.350
but I had a sister who was a red sox fan,

88
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.950
was a cardinals fan by San Francisco giants fans and La Dodgers Fan.

89
00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:19.910
That was my brother Peter.

90
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.920
And I have no recollection of a time before I was a Baltimore Orioles Fan.

91
00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:29.390
So I think what happened is Stevie was born. Here's another kid,

92
00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:32.420
we need another team. Who Does he get? How about the Orioles?

93
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.720
When I was just like the tooth fairy sticking a dollar under your pillow,

94
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.080
how did he assign the oils to you? Okay, so first of all,

95
00:05:39.081 --> 00:05:42.650
I should just say like a lot of things in life as a very young,

96
00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:47.150
very obedient Catholic boy, I accepted this mystery without question.

97
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.290
But here's my hunch. My father,

98
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:56.291
I think felt that it was a shame that he couldn't give more to his materially

99
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:01.730
more and even more of himself and so in my mind,

100
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.420
the greatest gift he could give to each of us was our own baseball team.

101
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.550
<v 4>No,</v>

102
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.130
<v 1>but this is ultimately a story about more than just baseball.</v>

103
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.590
<v 4>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.520
<v 1>My parents were both Brooklyn born Jews, kind of typical.</v>

105
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.020
I'm second generation American who before they met each other,

106
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.050
while they were in their twenties they both converted to Roman Catholicism.

107
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.330
What was the reaction from their parents? Oh, that was bad. That was bad.

108
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.480
The way that my grandfather discovered that my father had had converted was when

109
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:37.661
some rosary beads slipped out of his pocket and fell onto the floor.

110
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.890
So it was like my grandfather basically threw my father out of the house,

111
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.960
literally declared him dead. Wow.

112
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.470
Set Shit before him until he says when his dad met,

113
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:51.530
his mom was another Jewish convert to Catholicism.

114
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.950
They were like two refugees who'd found each other exactly together.

115
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:56.450
They left Brooklyn, went upstate,

116
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.330
spent all their money on an old farmhouse in the country,

117
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.410
leaving behind a past that was toxic.

118
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.680
But then when they got upstate, they found themselves a little out of place.

119
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.770
We were these kinds of farmers, Jewish, Brooklyn,

120
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:14.670
Jewish city people who are now upstate Catholic farmers,

121
00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:19.650
survivor types. We had no money, a lot of kids. And my dad,

122
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.490
he said his dad would often be upstairs, quote, lying down for hours and hours,

123
00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:26.620
which didn't make a whole lot of sense to him at the time.

124
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.910
He thought they'll come on, why isn't he down here with us? But now as an adult,

125
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:34.650
he understands that his dad was not well. In fact, he was depressed. Yeah.

126
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.580
Really depressed.

127
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.610
And how much did you know about your parent's backstory when you were growing up

128
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:43.740
and on the farm? Uh, can my knowledge be measured in negative terms,

129
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.700
but it was plain to me that my father was a kind of diminished man,

130
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.880
that he wasn't capable of doing all the things that other men were capable of

131
00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:56.194
doing.

132
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.870
So Stevens says he would go outside to the backyard and he'd spend time by

133
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:04.400
himself pretending to be the Oreo recreating the games that had been played the

134
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.450
day before in your life.

135
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.100
<v 5>And here come Pike Robbin, he still spearheading the Oriole,</v>

136
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.840
<v 1>you know, one game could last me six, eight hours and I would literally,</v>

137
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:16.170
I would literally play 162 game seasons,

138
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.700
<v 5>make the two guns.</v>

139
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.780
<v 1>I would be every batter on both teams and the announcers</v>

140
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.110
<v 5>Robinson completes his home run trial.</v>

141
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.190
<v 1>And you know this thing about ownership and whether my dad did that on purpose</v>

142
00:08:29.191 --> 00:08:33.840
or not, he did make me feel like if, if they fail then they needed me to,

143
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.750
to boost them up. And that kept him busy for awhile.

144
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.640
But then the play happens and everything changes

145
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.670
to explain. Somewhere along the way, when he was 10 Stephen discovers football,

146
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.623
football

147
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.890
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

148
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.130
<v 1>was considered barbaric. Worst of all,</v>

149
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.910
<v 6>it was played on the Saturday. The regardless, he fell in love with it.</v>

150
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.773
I love it.

151
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.453
<v 4>Route 47</v>

152
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.680
<v 6>the fact that all these guys wear helmets that made them look kind of like kind</v>

153
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.390
of like knights and almost immediately he latched onto a particular running back

154
00:09:11.391 --> 00:09:14.150
from the Pittsburgh steel and that was Franco Harris

155
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:18.740
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

156
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.880
<v 6>I discovered Franco Harris and his rookie season read about him in sports</v>

157
00:09:22.881 --> 00:09:26.570
illustrated and from the beginning everything about him just made sense.

158
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.050
I came from a big Catholic family. He came from a big Catholic family.

159
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.480
His family was kind of mixed, so his Franco's, his dad was black,

160
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.110
the mom was Italian. He was very unusual guy,

161
00:09:36.111 --> 00:09:40.790
very kind of thoughtful and quiet and I became a big Steelers fan because of

162
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:43.890
him, which brings us back to the

163
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.470
<v 4>proud of Spanish.</v>

164
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.331
<v 6>Saturday,</v>

165
00:09:46.331 --> 00:09:51.331
December 23rd all those Christmas 1972 MS Steelers were about to lose to them.

166
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.520
<v 4>The Oakland writers have taken a lead.</v>

167
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.850
<v 6>40 seconds left on the clock. We had the ball on something like our own 35</v>

168
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.850
<v 4>forth down at 10 yards to go last gas. Hang onto your hats.</v>

169
00:10:03.851 --> 00:10:07.690
Here come the Steelers out of the huddle. Very Brad shot to control.

170
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.920
Brad tried drops back to pass back running out of the pocket looking for

171
00:10:11.921 --> 00:10:13.530
somebody that pro two fires it down,

172
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.960
field Bradshaw throws and justice or see what's about to catch it and gets

173
00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:17.794
crushed.

174
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.990
<v 6>The ball pops up, goes falling through the air</v>

175
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.310
and right before the ball hits the ground, Franco Harris,

176
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.340
his guy zooms into the frame out of nowhere and catches it in full stride at his

177
00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:37.424
shoe tops.

178
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.270
<v 4>[inaudible] Franco runs 60 yards into the end zone time runs out, Steelers win.</v>

179
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.143
Shortly thereafter,

180
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.860
<v 1>this play was dubbed the immaculate reception.</v>

181
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.380
<v 7>[inaudible] Christmas Burkle. There was a miracle of all vertical</v>

182
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:08.090
<v 6>for me as a kid watching it where my team won and my guy was like,</v>

183
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.883
I was

184
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.030
<v 1>sealed for life. In fact,</v>

185
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:15.930
this guy was so much his guy that when Steve would write his homework papers,

186
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.830
he began signing the papers. Franco Dubner. Wow.

187
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:22.200
And I thought of myself as Franco Dubner, which I mean,

188
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:23.940
I know it sounds funny now, but it's very naturally.

189
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.340
We're all named for saints to start with. I mean,

190
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.790
my oldest brother was named Joseph. My oldest sister was named Mary.

191
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.590
So we're your name for saints.

192
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.320
Wally Franco was my sane the following thanksgiving.

193
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.840
Stephen's parents drove off to a prayer meeting,

194
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.230
was part of this religious offshoot that they participated in called the

195
00:11:41.231 --> 00:11:44.920
charismatic Christian Renewal. Very fervent group, lots of speaking in tongues.

196
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.690
It was strange and a little scary to me to see my parents speaking in tongues.

197
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.740
Steven would sometimes go, but this time he did.

198
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.050
So his parents drove off to the meeting in Albany kind of far from our house and

199
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.750
a few hours later only his mother returned.

200
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.860
My mother comes home and tells us dad had an attack.

201
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.550
She told him in the middle of the meeting, he just fell over.

202
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.910
He was in the hospital now,

203
00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:10.520
but it would be out of the hospital in time for Christmas.

204
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.430
So that's all I heard. I was a 10 year old kids like,

205
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.360
oh my dad's coming home for Christmas. Cool. Right.

206
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.350
And the football playoffs are coming up month later.

207
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.220
It was the 21st of December almost exactly a year after the immaculate

208
00:12:22.221 --> 00:12:25.400
reception. It was the last day of school before Christmas break was a half day.

209
00:12:25.401 --> 00:12:28.060
We had grab bag, Christmas gift exchange at school,

210
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.200
Stephen Races home from school, pretty excited.

211
00:12:30.201 --> 00:12:34.980
Playoffs are coming up and my dad's coming home and then my mother comes in and

212
00:12:34.981 --> 00:12:38.580
says, uh, dad died,

213
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.350
<v 4>uh,</v>

214
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.640
<v 1>I'm going to go upstairs to lie down.</v>

215
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.253
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

216
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.343
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

217
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.733
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

218
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.280
<v 6>that is when the dream began. No,</v>

219
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:02.590
he's not exactly sure if it was that night or maybe the next,

220
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:05.500
but when he went to bed and closed his eyes,

221
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.880
this is what would happen. I would go to the VFW hall in Albany.

222
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.450
This is a place his dad had taken him were Franco Harris was giving a talk and I

223
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:16.000
would invite him to come back to my house,

224
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:19.990
way out in the boondocks for Spaghetti and meatballs. And in my dream,

225
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:22.480
he would come back, he would eat the spaghetti. It wasn't terrible.

226
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.040
Then I would say, hey, you want to go out in the,

227
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:28.450
in the yard and play some football? And we would go out and it's dark. Yeah.

228
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.020
And it's just me and him where this skill or it against some other mythical

229
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.120
teams, darkness. Yet we're playing on our field in our backyard.

230
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:42.121
And I'm kind of embarrassed because our backyard is all lumpy with frozen a cow

231
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.130
hoof principal. Cause sometimes we'd stick the cow back there

232
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.140
and on the second to the last play of the game,

233
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.880
it's like we're behind by three points.

234
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:56.930
Franco would turn his ankle and one of these cow hoof prints and then we'd hand

235
00:13:57.511 --> 00:13:57.920
the ball. Yeah,

236
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.010
<v 1>to me. And he'd say, kid, you have to take it from here yourself.</v>

237
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.320
What was the look on his face? We need hand you the ball and give you kids.

238
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.500
You know Jesus on the cross space.

239
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.140
<v 6>Jesus on the cross because he's in pain, he's got a beard.</v>

240
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.920
He's kind of sweating and dripping and frying a little bit.

241
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.180
And then I'd have to run it in for the winning touch and the dream.

242
00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:24.000
But the dream would always fade there. I'd never knew if I made it or not.

243
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.200
<v 1>And he says the next night he had the same dream.</v>

244
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:31.150
Exactly who the same in the next night,

245
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.630
the same in the next day. Same in the next night.

246
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:39.970
Same almost every night for about three or four years in the next night.

247
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.090
The same. So I, you know, I had that dream several hundred,

248
00:14:42.091 --> 00:14:45.510
maybe a thousand times. Yep. And every time you woke up from that dream,

249
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.040
I'm just curious, how did you feel?

250
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:52.550
What I remember feeling is that Franco Harris came to see me and that he

251
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.510
couldn't win the game for me,

252
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.990
but that he was on my side and he wanted me to win kind of period.

253
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.063
<v 8>Um,</v>

254
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.440
<v 9>so if we were to stop this story right now,</v>

255
00:15:13.441 --> 00:15:15.450
this would be a story like many others.

256
00:15:15.451 --> 00:15:20.000
You've heard boy falls in love with athlete, dreams of athlete goes out,

257
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.590
leaves athlete behind. But this is a different one.

258
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.530
<v 1>Eventually after a few years, Steven stopped having the dream.</v>

259
00:15:26.531 --> 00:15:30.460
He moved out of the house, went off to school, got married, became an adult,

260
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.940
pretty much forgot about Franco. But then

261
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.070
something happened purely by accident. Living in New York, maybe, I don't know,

262
00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.630
15, 18 years ago,

263
00:15:40.631 --> 00:15:44.710
I caught sight of him on the cover of black enterprise magazine.

264
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.640
Franco had become a very successful small businessman.

265
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.460
And my heart just started to thump like it had when I was a kid.

266
00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:55.330
And I thought I gotta, I gotta get to know Franco. So he, uh,

267
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.960
tracked down frank as address, wrote him letters and then more letters.

268
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.460
And to make a long story short, one day the phone rang and it was him.

269
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.960
He did agree to meet with me.

270
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:11.410
I told him I'd like to write a book about a boy getting to know his childhood

271
00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:15.220
here on trying to figure out what that person is like in reality.

272
00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:17.390
And I was also interested in, I, um,

273
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:22.860
I was very careful in my mind that first day that I met him in Pittsburgh.

274
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.600
Say, don't tell him the dream,

275
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.200
don't tell the dream because he will think that you were a fricking lunatic.

276
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.980
Right. That first day I told him the dream. I couldn't,

277
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.750
it's like this, his reaction was he clarified,

278
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.170
he doesn't show her. He's a very interesting fellow. He's got a really, uh,

279
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.250
he's got a really interesting manner, a very low key.

280
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.220
They did end up meeting a few times. Uh, Steven wrote his book,

281
00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:53.080
but he says Franco was always really careful to keep them at arms length.

282
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.810
I would say at anytime they kind of got close,

283
00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.110
Franco would sort of disappear a little bit. In fact,

284
00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:01.900
toward the end of the book project, they make an appointment to meet.

285
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.330
I get to Pittsburgh a couple of days early.

286
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.960
Typical and frank is not there. Actually,

287
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:13.290
Steven ends up standing in a parking lot waiting for him and waiting and waiting

288
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.100
and waiting. And then eventually we heads back to New York.

289
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.230
And I guess I thought that somehow he had a lot to teach me, you know,

290
00:17:23.231 --> 00:17:27.910
about being a man, being in a real, a real grownup,

291
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.890
um, being a father. Um, and he was polite and uh,

292
00:17:32.891 --> 00:17:34.480
and just not really that interested.

293
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.590
And it was around this point that Steven decided, you know,

294
00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:41.980
maybe that's what he was trying to tell me in the dream and in real life too,

295
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.690
that no one can save you but yourself.

296
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.630
Part of his Messiah job was to persuade me that, you know,

297
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.860
everybody's got to be their own messiah. That was the message.

298
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.910
<v 6>But isn't that disappointing to you? This guy was your, your hero.</v>

299
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:57.480
You want him to be all these things. And he didn't want to be those things back.

300
00:17:57.481 --> 00:18:00.330
I mean, that must have hurt a little, you know, look, um,

301
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.000
Frankel Harris didn't fall in love with, you know, me.

302
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:06.180
He didn't want to be my best friend, but that, that aside,

303
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.280
he is an exemplary human being. He's a really, he's a good human being.

304
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.900
I think you can easily go too far.

305
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:17.070
I think you can put too much of your emotional life in the hands of people who

306
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:21.300
have, you know, who don't know you and, and have no responsibility for you.

307
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.720
But I think sports fandom is a fantastic gift with almost immeasurable value,

308
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.820
um, and my weight. But why? I mean, really, I mean, I love sports, but I mean,

309
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.840
he's just a running back. He's not saying what exactly about sports. It makes,

310
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.860
it gives it in the measurable value. Yeah.

311
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:46.290
Um, it's a proxy for real life, but better. Uh, you know, it renews itself.

312
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.150
It's constantly happening in real time.

313
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:52.560
There are conflicts that seem to carry real consequences,

314
00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:55.620
but at the end of the day, don't, that's war where nobody dies.

315
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.730
It's a proxy for all our emotions and desires and hopes. I mean, heck,

316
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.900
what's not to like about sports? There you go.

317
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.220
You just Sorta, you just wrap it all up in a little bell right there. That was

318
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.453
<v 8>awesome.</v>

319
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.230
[inaudible] Stephen Dubner

321

323
