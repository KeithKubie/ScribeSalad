spend on performance and we don't think

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
spend on performance and we don't think
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.270
spend on performance and we don't think
that you spent all your time focusing on

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280
that you spent all your time focusing on
 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.970
that you spent all your time focusing on
performance either well we realized that

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980
performance either well we realized that
 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.289
performance either well we realized that
you have to keep an eye on performance

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299
you have to keep an eye on performance
 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.420
you have to keep an eye on performance
all the time and that it might make

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
all the time and that it might make
 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.309

actually just focus on improving the
 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.509
actually just focus on improving the
performance of your application and hold

the ABA English team did this and they

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780
the ABA English team did this and they
 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.360
the ABA English team did this and they
spent one quarter focused effort and

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
spent one quarter focused effort and
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.210
spent one quarter focused effort and
reduce their ARH by 97% as a result this

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220
reduce their ARH by 97% as a result this
 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.000
reduce their ARH by 97% as a result this
and a bunch of other things resulted in

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010
and a bunch of other things resulted in
 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.470
and a bunch of other things resulted in
them being able to increase their star

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480
them being able to increase their star
 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.119
them being able to increase their star
rating to 4.6 stars

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129
rating to 4.6 stars
 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.490
rating to 4.6 stars
now obviously you can't get a 4.6 star

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500
now obviously you can't get a 4.6 star
 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.080
now obviously you can't get a 4.6 star
rating but just focusing on files but we

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090
rating but just focusing on files but we
 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.029
rating but just focusing on files but we
guarantee that you will never get such a

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039
guarantee that you will never get such a
 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.010
guarantee that you will never get such a
high rating if you have terrible files

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020
 
 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.180
 
okay so I've gone through some examples

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190
okay so I've gone through some examples
 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.470
okay so I've gone through some examples

using violence what we've actually also
 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.270
using violence what we've actually also
done is we looked at of the top thousand

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280
done is we looked at of the top thousand
 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.690
done is we looked at of the top thousand
apps on play-i we looked at their

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700
apps on play-i we looked at their
 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.460
apps on play-i we looked at their
engagement in the viola section since IO

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470
engagement in the viola section since IO
 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.830
engagement in the viola section since IO
and we found is that the developers who

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840
and we found is that the developers who
 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.440
and we found is that the developers who
engaged most in the violin section like

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450
engaged most in the violin section like
 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.200
engaged most in the violin section like
the top 10% they reduced their crash

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210
the top 10% they reduced their crash
 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.410
the top 10% they reduced their crash
rate by 50% over that time period and

rate by 50% over that time period and
 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.090
rate by 50% over that time period and
this isn't just good for those

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100
this isn't just good for those
 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.590
this isn't just good for those
developers in those apps this is really

of these metrics are interrelated so one
 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.900

this resulted in a bad user experience

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040
this resulted in a bad user experience
 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.360
this resulted in a bad user experience
where users actually result had a very

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370
where users actually result had a very
 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.610
where users actually result had a very
high denial rate of this permission they

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620
high denial rate of this permission they
 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.350
high denial rate of this permission they
were to see that in Android vials and

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360
were to see that in Android vials and

then be able to redesign that feature to
give users an explanation of why they

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240
give users an explanation of why they
 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.560
give users an explanation of why they
needed it and that permission and only

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570
needed it and that permission and only
 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.210
needed it and that permission and only
asked when the users actually really

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220
asked when the users actually really
 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.770

and one of the things they found very
 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.960
and one of the things they found very
useful with files is the ability to be

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970
useful with files is the ability to be

from the field this is pretty useful
 

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.379
from the field this is pretty useful
because with the pre-launch report these

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:39.389
because with the pre-launch report these
 

00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:41.179
because with the pre-launch report these
are test lab devices so there aren't the

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:48.149
and one of the things I really struggled
 

00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:49.699

you and your teams all to start using
 

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.199
you and your teams all to start using
these metrics in your conversations with

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:33.209
these metrics in your conversations with
 

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:36.499
these metrics in your conversations with
your senior leadership and and with the

gonna get left behind because quality

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:41.610
gonna get left behind because quality

great that's impacting those other
 

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.879
great that's impacting those other
developers but it's not impacting me my

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:49.889
developers but it's not impacting me my
 

00:13:49.889 --> 00:13:51.350

apps awesome even though it says it has

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360
apps awesome even though it says it has

a high crash rate I don't believe you

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040
a high crash rate I don't believe you
 

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.410
a high crash rate I don't believe you
well we've looked at at the data of

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420
well we've looked at at the data of
 

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.569
well we've looked at at the data of
users who experienced a high crash rate

00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579
users who experienced a high crash rate
 

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:01.040
users who experienced a high crash rate
versus users who experience the lower

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.050
versus users who experience the lower
 

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.900
versus users who experience the lower
medium crash rate and what we find is

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:02.910
medium crash rate and what we find is
 

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.489
medium crash rate and what we find is
that users who have a higher crash rate

00:14:04.489 --> 00:14:04.499
that users who have a higher crash rate
 

00:14:04.499 --> 00:14:07.129
that users who have a higher crash rate
for the same app leave 52 percent more
