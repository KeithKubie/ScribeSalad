The specific lesson objectives for this lesson are, we will look at the basics

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.390
of what we had started off in our introductory lecture, which basically talks

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.960
about how we're going to go from rays of light in a scene to pixels.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.550
To help us understand this, what I'd like to do is first I'm

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.612
going to introduce a concept of a camera which has no optics.

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:22.200
And, then next thing we will look at is basically add lens and

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.740
our optics into the camera, so

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.320
we can actually start seeing what other foundational elements within a camera.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.620
And, just to kind of provide us with the mathematical foundations, we're also

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.970
going to look at the lens equation on how light goes through a lens and where in

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.140
an image plane is it formed to create a 3-D scene on a 2-D plane of an image.
