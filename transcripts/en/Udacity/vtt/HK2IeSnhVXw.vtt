00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
To fill the ray called energy, we go through all steps which is one more than you may think.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The equation as such isn't really surprising.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This time for the first time to use a line break, which is a break slash.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What the results tells us is that energy keeps increasing.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
With every orbit, there's a gain in energy and that's pretty much visible in the trajectory,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which of course is not the actual physical trajectory.

00:00:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The trajectory keeps expanding and expanding so the long-term behavior of this orbit is pretty poor.
