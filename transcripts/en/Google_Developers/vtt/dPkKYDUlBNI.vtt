MICHAL SEGALOV: Welcome to the
first episode of Women

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.235
Techmakers in Israel.

00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:12.850
Women Techmakers started in
the United States, and its

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.510
goal is to increase visibility
of highly successful women

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.710
entrepreneurs in the tech
industry, and it's now rolling

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.450
out globally.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.830
We have with us Rony
Ross today,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.279
which we will indroduce.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.211
We will quickly introduce
ourselves and then move on.

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.980
I am Michal Segalov, I'm a
software engineer at Google's

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.290
Israel R&amp;D Center.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.517
Here I work on technical
infrastructure, mainly on the

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:33.000
Google computer network.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.320
Prior to that, I worked on
YouTube and prior to that, I

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.400
worked in Search Quality.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.065
I hold a computer science
[INAUDIBLE] from the Technion

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:41.640
and a masters from Tel
Aviv University.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.934
And here with us is Daniela
Raijman-Aharonov.

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:44.365
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: Hi!

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:46.640
I'm Daniela Raijman-Aharonov.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.530
I'm an engineering manager and
software engineer in Google's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.360
R&amp;D Center in Israel,
like Michal.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.800
I've been here for a little over
five and a half years,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.078
and my current group is
technical infrastructure, just

00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:01.440
like Michal.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.800
We go back a long time.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.300
So my teams work on products
whose goal is to optimize the

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.400
way that other Google products
use the Google network.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.205
I have a bachelor's degree and
a master's degree in computer

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:16.140
science from Tel Aviv
University, and I live in the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.782
suburbs of Tel Aviv with my
husband and son, and we're

00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:21.040
expecting another one.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.360
So I'm very proud to introduce
our first guest to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.810
Israel, Rony Ross.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.250
Rony is the chairman and founder
of Panorama Software.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.130
And Rony will start by telling
us a little bit

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.880
about Panorama Software.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.130
RONY ROSS: OK, so Panorama
Software is a business

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.895
intelligence company.

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:42.200
It's been around for a while,
actually since 1994.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.540
But what is special about
Panorama Software is that

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.150
right now as a company, we are
actually redefining business

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:57.420
intelligence into the new world
of social, contextual,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.950
and suggestive systems.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.720
But first of all, let me tell
you a little bit about myself.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.520
I've been in computer science
most of my life.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.560
I have a master's degree from
the Weizmann Institute of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.460
Science and an MBA from Tel
Aviv University, and I was

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.330
actually privileged to work
in one of Israel's first

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.844
high-tech companies, called
Scitex at the early

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:22.332
stages of my career.

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:26.134
And eventually I opened up
Panorama Software, as a

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:31.012
business intelligence company
in 1994, and I'll tell the

00:02:31.012 --> 00:02:32.770
story maybe a little
bit later.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.200
So, about Panorama today.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.545
We have been in business
intelligence for a long time.

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:43.860
We have thousands of customers
using our product.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.190
And about three and a half years
ago, we looked around us

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.792
and we saw how the world--

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:52.640
the way people used technology
is changing.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.600
People in the consumer world,
and the personal world use

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.530
technology in a different way.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.170
They collaborate a
lot with others.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.087
They are all in the social
environments of sorts, you

00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:08.852
know, like Facebook,
Google, et cetera.

00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:12.850
They all get systems who know
who they are, and know to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.010
suggest to them what
they may like.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.020
You know, like YouTube
suggesting to you what

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.255
additional videos you may want
to watch, or Amazon suggesting

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:24.870
to you books that you've read
based on the books that you've

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.950
read before and what your peers
and friends have been

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.720
reading with similar tastes.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.530
And we looked at that and we
said, well, you know, it's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.710
time that the enterprise
systems, we also take this

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.260
angle-- we've also opened up
and changed the way of

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.510
operation to be more
crowd-sourcing, more open more

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.636
suggestive, more
recommendation.

00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:53.340
But you know, most of
the ERP systems are

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.860
very rigid and very--

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.242
there's nothing much about
crowd-sourcing when you want

00:03:58.242 --> 00:03:59.430
to issue an invoice, right?

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.395
You either issue an invoice
properly or you don't.

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:05.380
But when it comes to
decision-making in the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.180
organization, this is where
we thought we could bring

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.830
enormous value to the
organization.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.730
In enabling people to
collaborate better with their

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.769
peers and get the system to help
them in analyzing what

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.769
they need to analyze, and
suggesting to them better ways

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.810
of analyzing and suggesting
to them better solutions.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.360
So we actually redesigned,
from the ground up, our

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.010
original system, so that
it now is social.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.340
In what respect it is social?

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.910
It really recognizes the other
people in the organization.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.360
It knows what their interests of
each person are, either by

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.830
these people defining what they
want through tags, or by

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.840
looking at the things that
indicate that they like, or

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.250
tracing the way that they
analyze and what they view out

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.700
of there-- the I system-- the
things that the I system in

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.430
the organization offers them to
look at, what they do, and

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.406
the system knows to connect
between me, as the decision

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:11.530
maker and the other people
in the organization.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.530
And I think you're going
to have that first

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.030
demonstration, right?

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.660
So now we have a system
that knows--

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.360
that enables people to
collaborate on the data.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.880
Why is this important?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.080
Because there are many systems
who enable collaboration.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.670
But enabling collaboration,
just talking, and just

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.280
exchanging--

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.750
if used, it's not enough.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.490
What is special about the
enablement of collaboration of

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.790
the data, is that it makes
collaboration meaningful, and

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.385
it makes collaboration useful.

00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:50.357
Part of the problems that the
organizations have today that

00:05:50.357 --> 00:05:53.630
say yes, we can use Yammer, we
can use Jive, but we don't

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.696
know what we are getting.

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:59.262
But it's very obvious what you
can get from BI if you enable

00:05:59.262 --> 00:06:00.030
collaboration.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.280
You actually get a shorter
resolution time of issues.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.920
The time that it takes between
identifying your problem and

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.630
the time it takes to resolve
it gets shorter.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.718
And this shortening of the
decision window is very, very

00:06:14.718 --> 00:06:16.706
important to the organization.

00:06:16.706 --> 00:06:20.185
And the next feature that we
introduced to the system,

00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:23.730
which we thought was extremely
important, is the contextual

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.295
and suggestive feature.

00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:29.170
This is that feature about
understanding who you are,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.350
what your needs are, comparing
you to other people in the

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.090
organization and based on that,
making suggestions to

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.830
you on what you may want.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.255
The system may either suggest
to you who you want to

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.370
collaborate with, it can suggest
to you additional

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.250
views, it can suggest
to you solutions.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.790
This is a contextual and
suggestive system.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.420
So here is where we're going
to have the second piece.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.550
OK?

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:04.030
So and on top of all of that, we
also have the new algorithm

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.560
sorry, based on the way that
people have been analyzing

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.340
data, now simulate the way
people have been doing

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.740
analysis, and provide the best
result, as people would have

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.790
otherwise found, only they
would've toiled a lot in order

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.655
to get to this result.

00:07:22.655 --> 00:07:25.570
And this is where we're going
to have the third system.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.820
OK?

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.006
Now, what I would like
is to wrap it all up.

00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:37.663
So what we actually saw-- we saw
how we took a regular BI

00:07:37.663 --> 00:07:42.420
system and we opened it up to
be social, to be contextual,

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.194
to be suggestive--

00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:47.785
we opened it up so that it
really covers the next step in

00:07:47.785 --> 00:07:50.770
the decision making of the
organization, which is the

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.310
step of here's where we work as
a team and make decisions.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.010
Now we figured that BI would be
the perfect place to start

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.650
with this initiative, because
BI is the hub of the

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.540
organization decision making.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.970
Well-run organizations have all
their issues displayed in

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.760
the BI system, which is the
system that actually displays

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.710
data for managers to
make decisions on.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:22.000
So if you address and make the
decision making social, you

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.050
get enormous value.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.950
So you get shorter decision
windows, you get higher

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.860
quality decisions, you've got
better adoption of the system,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.549
because you've got better ways
to utilize the system.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:39.340
I, personally, before I used a
system like Necto, I would

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.990
spend hours trying to find out
what additional views or

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.570
reports or KPIs would be useful
to me in my work.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.970
Today I don't need to.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.807
The system suggests to me what I
would probably prefer, based

00:08:51.807 --> 00:08:55.215
on the way that I'm using the
system, people like me with a

00:08:55.215 --> 00:08:56.550
similar interest.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.240
So it increases the penetration,
it increases the

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.702
proficiency of the users, and
altogether it brings an

00:09:04.702 --> 00:09:06.830
enormous value.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.140
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: So
it seems from what you're

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.130
saying that actually within
Panorama you would use your

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.280
own software as well for
business intelligence.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.976
RONY ROSS: Of course.

00:09:15.976 --> 00:09:19.520
How could we know what works and
what doesn't if we didn't

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.690
use it ourselves.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:21.670
And you know what?

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.100
It wasn't easy.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.350
It wasn't easy to get
to that, but we did.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.585
It's very important.

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:29.270
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: It's
a very interesting approach,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.710
which we also use at Google.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.750
So I'm wondering, from using it
internally have you learned

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.720
something that you thought
things were going to work

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.020
right in a specific way, and
then when you started using

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.580
it, you said, oh no, this has
to be completely different?

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.460
RONY ROSS: Yes, we did.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.440
We found a lot of ways which
we found out that we really

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.550
should be doing-- that
there was a better

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.220
way of doing things.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.910
It doesn't mean that the
old way didn't work.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.610
It just means that there is a
new way to do things, and it

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.035
opened up my eyes to see where
the focus of other people was,

00:10:00.035 --> 00:10:03.830
especially looking at me, kind
of in a higher position.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.820
Looking to see where the focus
of the organization keeps

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.790
shifting and how people advance
into analyzing issues

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.750
because certain periods
of time you analyze

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.645
profitability, and then you
analyze sales, and then you

00:10:15.645 --> 00:10:21.410
analyze investments, and then
you analyze percentage of

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.720
resources invested
in certain areas.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.740
And you can see how the focus
of the organization changes

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.024
and it's very easy to keep
up and be with how people

00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:32.008
do what they do.

00:10:32.008 --> 00:10:32.960
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV:
That's cool.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.370
Do you also work with
your users to get

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.390
feedback from them?

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.620
RONY ROSS: From the start.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.722
This is actually
how we started.

00:10:41.722 --> 00:10:45.610
Let me tell you a small story
about how we started.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.550
As I said, I have a masters in
computer science and an MBA,

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.800
and the one thing that I always
wanted was to harness

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.110
IT to bring strategic value
to the organization.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.810
Strategic as opposed
to functional or

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.485
performance-wise, because IT
was always about enabling

00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:06.670
performance in the organization
and about the

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.895
tactics, but I was looking into
how I can really make a

00:11:10.895 --> 00:11:13.440
change in the paradigm
of the organization.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.990
Make it more competitive.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.030
Bring out this competitive edge
that is so important to

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.670
each and every organization.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.940
And, you know, I got
there by mistake.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.850
We were doing--

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.820
I set up my own consultancy
company in late 1990s.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.790
We were doing consultancy
work.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.890
This was early Windows days.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.110
And what we did, it sounds
amazing today, but we took

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.180
systems that were in Unix and
we rewrote them for our

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.790
customers in Windows
technology.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.820
So in order to convince a
customer to do a job, we

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.910
developed a small reporting
module that showed reports

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.140
online in a Windows environment
for that customer.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.080
And we looked at [INAUDIBLE],
it looked cute.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.225
And we said, you know, maybe
we can actually develop a

00:12:03.225 --> 00:12:05.920
system that automatically
takes any

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.970
data from any database--

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.605
you know, all these databases
are hidden down

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.960
there in your cellars--

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.650
and exposing it to managers
in a way that is going to

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.540
facilitate the decision
making.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.490
And what we did, we developed
a mock-up of that system.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.866
And we went around and we
interviewed 15 customers and

00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:31.660
we asked them what they thought
about the idea.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.480
It was a small company.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.240
It was privately-owned.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.170
I had no resources.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.020
This was early days.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.880
VC industry in Israel
was just nascent.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.730
They weren't really investing.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.580
There were no other software
companies around doing

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.350
development work, not
even selling their

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.560
products outside of Israel.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.350
So I had to verify that what I'm
doing is really valuable.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.952
So we went and we interviewed
these 15 customers, and we got

00:13:02.952 --> 00:13:04.310
amazing feedback.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.240
We found out that there are
other vendors in the field.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.610
We found out that customers
really have very specific

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.990
requirements about what they
want such a system to do.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:19.290
And we also found out that
customers can really drive

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.970
competitive value, if the system
was to work, according

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.245
to their needs.

00:13:25.245 --> 00:13:27.670
And these needs were
very complex.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.930
So we started development.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:36.820
We were lucky.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.140
One day, after a couple of
months, we got a phone call

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.160
from one of these customers
that we interviewed, an

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.740
insurance company, and they told
us, you know, we looked

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.230
at what you are offering us and
we think this system can

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:55.220
bring strategic value to us,
and we want to buy it.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.280
We only had a mock-up.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.310
We didn't really
have a system.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.700
But luckily, they were a company
who was just starting

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.750
operations-- it's an
insurance company--

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.900
so they didn't really
have a [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.730
So we said, you know what?

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:12.380
We build a system according to
your specifications, and you'd

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.086
be our first customer.

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:14.230
You have to understand.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.795
This is it.

00:14:14.795 --> 00:14:16.598
This is what we can offer.

00:14:16.598 --> 00:14:18.270
And they were willing
to gamble on us.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.560
They thought that if we build
a system according to their

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.830
needs, they're going to have
such a tremendous value, that

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.990
it's worth the risk that
they are taking.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.060
The only caveat was that they
said that they would pay only

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.440
after a year of operation.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.390
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.820
So I had to make a very tough
decision of deciding to

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.160
develop and invest in the
development of a product out

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.626
of my own funds.

00:14:42.626 --> 00:14:45.860
It's not something that I
grew up thinking I would

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.860
ever have to do.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.820
And I really had to kind of put
my hand in my pocket and

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.050
pay for the people
to do their work.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.250
The team was wonderful, and they
really collaborated well.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.645
They did consulting in the
morning, and development in

00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:02.260
the afternoon, and then we
worked nights and days and

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.270
weekends, et cetera.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.980
And we were successful.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:10.755
We were so successful that the
guy who decided on the product

00:15:10.755 --> 00:15:14.050
to buy the product for this
insurance company called us

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.480
six months later to
say thank you.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.370
He was just promoted
to vice president.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.390
Because he was an actuary, and
he did such a great job in

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.850
being an actuary for
this insurance

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.880
company, that he was promoted.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.960
Eventually, two years later,
he also became the CEO.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.070
So you can see that when you use
the system right, if you

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.570
do a good job with BI, it
could change the whole

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.900
strategy of the organization.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.970
It can make the difference
between a successful and

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.940
unsuccessful organization.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.610
And I was extremely, extremely
proud of that.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.790
But here I was with customer,
so I went around--

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.280
we sold the system to another
customer and to another

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.870
customer and what we found out
this would be that there was a

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.840
technical problem that people
had when they developed a

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.630
system like that.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:15.056
The way the other systems in the
market worked was that in

00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:18.840
order to provide immediate
response time to all these

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.195
type of queries that people may
ask, they precalculated

00:16:22.195 --> 00:16:24.711
overnight all the potential
queries that

00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:25.914
anybody would ask.

00:16:25.914 --> 00:16:27.838
Google would know a
little about that.

00:16:27.838 --> 00:16:30.790
So you know something about
precalculation.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.140
And that was great.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.660
But when you come to an
organization that has dozens

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.560
of millions of records, and you
have to precalculate, you

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.850
may get to hundreds [INAUDIBLE]
of precalculations

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.960
and it would be a very tedious
and time consuming process.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.620
So one day we had
a breakthrough.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.820
We thought about it and said,
well, how many decision-makers

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.820
are there maybe in an
organization, a thousand?

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.040
How many questions each one
maybe asking over a year,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.363
what, a hundred?

00:17:01.363 --> 00:17:02.782
So what are we talking about?

00:17:02.782 --> 00:17:04.630
100,000 questions.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.210
Why do we precalculate?

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.569
A hundred million?

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:13.470
The big question is, so how do
you know which questions to

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.792
precalculate?

00:17:14.792 --> 00:17:19.930
So what we developed was the
first multi-dimensional

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.040
engine, which is the technology
we are talking

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.530
about, that knew to learn from
experience from the way people

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.670
were using the system.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.570
And Google knows about
that, right?

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.599
We developed the system based
on the way that people were

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:38.335
using the system, we will decide
what to precalculate

00:17:38.335 --> 00:17:39.660
and what not.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.270
So we would, indeed, sometimes
and somebody would come out

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.290
with a question out of the blue,
it would take longer.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.570
But all the rest of the
questions were answered

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.770
immediately, and that one
question that took a long time

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.780
would also be answered
very quickly the

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.460
next time it was asked.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.755
So we found a way to create a
multi-dimensional engine that

00:18:01.755 --> 00:18:06.030
was fitted the way that people
were using the system.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.970
Which is very much like what
we are all doing today,

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.540
contextual, right?

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.450
So we developed what we might
call a contextual,

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.140
multi-dimensional engine.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.790
So it was a great
breakthrough.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.260
It simplified development.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.700
It simplified the lifecycle
of the system.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:27.410
And that was a wonderful
system.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.930
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: Is
that the technology that was

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.190
eventually sold to Microsoft?

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.910
RONY ROSS: Exactly.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.840
The story about it is funny.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.171
Because what happened is that
first of all, I went and I

00:18:36.171 --> 00:18:38.110
tried to raise capital
for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.960
I had three customers, a great
technology, beautiful user

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.770
interface, obviously a great
story in a fledgling market.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.214
It was a growing market.

00:18:48.214 --> 00:18:49.690
You could see the
people were very

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.310
interested in this system.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.390
And why I wanted the funds?

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.670
I really wanted the funds
so as to start

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.140
marketing the product.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.750
And what a wonderful
business plan.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.400
And I laid it all down and there
were about eight VCs,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.610
just new visitors in Israel
that were just starting an

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.630
operation and I went and visited
every single one of

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.440
them, gave them a page, gave
them customer testimonials and

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:21.220
everything, and they looked at
me and they said, this lady,

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.185
she's not from X200.

00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:28.370
The Israel-- the military
intelligence unit where most

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.110
of the geeks to date
still come from.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:40.980
She's not an ex-pilot, so she
doesn't really fit the model

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.340
of a startup entrepreneur
that we can think of.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.160
And they didn't invest.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.520
So--

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.410
MICHAL SEGALOV: Do you think
this has changed?

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.640
Or you succeeding has
changed that plan?

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.450
RONY ROSS: Oh, absolutely!

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.880
Absolutely changed, but it also
changed everything for

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.450
me, because eventually what I
did, was I actually adopted

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.152
some business principles that
made a huge difference to the

00:20:04.152 --> 00:20:05.533
way that I ran my business.

00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:09.740
And it really brought me to a
situation where my product was

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.756
extremely competitive.

00:20:10.756 --> 00:20:13.060
Because I actually
found myself with

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.470
my back now to wall.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.600
I had no money to fund
international marketing and

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.442
sales, and I had to think what
I'm going to do with my

00:20:22.442 --> 00:20:25.130
product, outside of the
Israeli-- which was great.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:29.923
It's a great market, it's a
great, better site, but it's a

00:20:29.923 --> 00:20:31.775
relatively limited market.

00:20:31.775 --> 00:20:35.950
So I decided I'm going to give
myself up for publishing with

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.050
a big flair.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.760
You know, there are database
vendors, there are ERP vendors

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.270
out there, you know, some of
them, they had to plug it.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.060
So how do I prepare myself
for something like that.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.500
I'll bill myself as a
company that they

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.490
will think is a valuable--

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.890
with a product that they
will appreciate.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.550
And the way that I did it is
I decided I want to try to

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.720
assemble as many different
customers into the product as

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.572
possible, and I will adopt all
of the requirements these

00:21:10.572 --> 00:21:12.508
customers are asking from me.

00:21:12.508 --> 00:21:15.420
It was a very unusual way
of doing business.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.010
It wasn't really the best
practice that everybody would

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.430
tell you about developing
a product.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.220
But as a result of these two
decisions, we actually came to

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.830
have product that was extremely
powerful, and

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:33.520
eventually after two years, we
had a roster of 65 customers.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.105
Everything from the largest
settle-up company to two of

00:21:38.105 --> 00:21:41.730
the larger banks, and a couple
of insurance companies, and a

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.450
pharmaceutical, and
an education

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.410
institute, and whatever--

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.100
everything you could think of.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.234
And eventually, when we got to
meet with Microsoft, it took

00:21:51.234 --> 00:21:56.225
them exactly a 3-hour demo, and
after the demo, they took

00:21:56.225 --> 00:21:57.740
us out to lunch.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.162
And over lunch, the guy who sat
next to me turned to me

00:22:02.162 --> 00:22:06.680
and said, you know, you have
great technology, and a very

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.250
attractive product, and
it seems like you

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.770
have a great team.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.200
We at Microsoft, we have great
marketing and sales

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.060
capabilities.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:16.830
Do you think you'd
ever consider

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.780
selling us your company?

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.786
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV:Wow.

00:22:20.786 --> 00:22:22.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.560
RONY ROSS:Just like that.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.730
Out of the blue.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.210
And believe me, it was
out of the blue.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.430
Because the last thing I
imagined was that I would get

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.855
a proposal from Microsoft,
right?

00:22:32.855 --> 00:22:34.340
Microsoft!

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.710
MICHAL SEGALOV: Partner?

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.640
RONY ROSS: It's not a partner.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.020
I thought maybe they're asking
to develop something,

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.690
something like that.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.500
I thought of myself more
of a small outfit.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.840
And I was scared, you know,
because we were actually

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.280
working out in a garage.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:58.480
It was a small apartment,
an underground

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.180
apartment type of thing.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.440
And I thought they will come,
they will see all my

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.405
development team sitting
in one room.

00:23:04.405 --> 00:23:06.470
What will they think?

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.600
And you know what?

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.085
They came.

00:23:08.085 --> 00:23:11.520
And they actually liked it,
because they realize that if

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.490
you have all of your developers
sitting together in

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.780
one room, they really
collaborate with each other.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.400
They know how to work
together as a team.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.390
And eventually, this team
continued to work for

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.090
Microsoft for 10 years,
as a team.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.360
Leading the whole BI industry
within Microsoft.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.540
Which was a great value
to Microsoft.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.600
Obviously not a great value for
me, because whatever money

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:43.250
Microsoft paid, I haven't had
any investors to share with.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.660
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV:
You were lucky that the

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.070
VCs turned you down.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.896
MICHAL SEGALOV: So this scale of
approach that you took, do

00:23:47.896 --> 00:23:50.120
you think that the fact that you
decided to focus on more

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.370
diversity in terms of customers
was the key aspect,

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.105
or was it the great team that
you had and the collaboration

00:23:55.105 --> 00:23:55.850
that they had between them?

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.090
RONY ROSS: It was everything
together.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.860
You can't do everything--

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.630
you have to have the team, and
actually it was a great team,

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.166
a really great team.

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:08.300
You had to have the know-how to
what you want to develop,

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.730
and that's what my customers
really told me.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.520
It was amazing.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.340
I thought the customers
were crazy.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.072
They would ask all sorts of--

00:24:16.072 --> 00:24:19.290
why do you want to do that?

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.590
And it was really necessary.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.110
So we actually learned
from our customers.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.320
And today, this is what
we try to do.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.290
We try to learn from our
customers and it always helped

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.860
us to develop better product.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.090
And the reason that we are able
to do that, by the way,

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.022
you know, here we are
sitting in Israel--

00:24:38.022 --> 00:24:39.270
Israel is small.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.010
All their customers, every
industry, every type of

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.810
organization is within
a one-hour

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.100
drive from your office.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.170
And everything is very open
and very accessible.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.500
So here we can interview
three customers a day.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.690
And this is what makes such
a huge difference.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.670
MICHAL SEGALOV: So it sounds
like the customers are really

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.890
key throughout your career, but
how do you scale this up?

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.956
I mean, I'm sure that you have
many more customers now, so

00:25:04.956 --> 00:25:08.110
starting with 50 must be easy
for doing this now.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.870
RONY ROSS: No, obviously we
don't do that anymore.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.770
No, we do that in the respect
of in the development.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:18.340
We have key customers that we
integrate into the process.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.630
And we interview them
extensively, and they're part

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.200
of our beta program,
and we learn a

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.365
lot from their feedback.

00:25:24.365 --> 00:25:26.725
We continue to listen
to our customers.

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:28.850
Customers are extremely
key to us.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.974
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: So
going back to maybe a little

00:25:34.974 --> 00:25:37.660
bit outside of Panorama
Software.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.560
RONY ROSS: OK.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.010
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: So did
you always know they want

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.150
to found your own company
and what was your prior

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:44.605
experience?

00:25:44.605 --> 00:25:47.000
How did it prepare you
to being an actual

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.460
founder of a company?

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.146
RONY ROSS: So it's
interesting.

00:25:50.146 --> 00:25:52.910
I didn't really think I was
going to be an owner of a

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.390
company, first when I started.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:02.570
I must admit, as a young woman
I had not very concrete ideas

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.290
of career and where
I'm going there.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.015
I was much less determined.

00:26:08.015 --> 00:26:16.500
You would think, based on--
because I was sad.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.660
The term entrepreneurship
didn't really exist.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.755
And the funny thing is that
the first time I heard the

00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:27.480
word "exit," was when I
overheard somebody say, "Rony

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.670
Ross, who's this Rony Ross?

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.740
She had an exit." I had what?

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.030
That's what I mean.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.800
This is how nascent
this thing.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.430
This was the first deal that
anybody ever sold technology

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.020
outside of Israel in the
software industry.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.560
And obviously, not really the
first time we did use somebody

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.850
like Microsoft, which
was very important.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.990
The most important partner
part potential

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.730
possible at the time.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:00.790
So I didn't have this concept
very, very clearly, but once I

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.740
got there, I knew this is
what I should be doing.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.610
I knew this is what
I'm good at.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.470
And even though I spent
sleepless nights worrying

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.490
whether I'm going to meet
payroll or not.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.980
And even though I worked myself
to the bone, and I felt

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:21.390
like I'm bleeding from climbing
walls sometimes, I

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:27.626
just kept on doing it and
eventually, for me, it worked.

00:27:27.626 --> 00:27:31.300
It wasn't very easy, really.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.900
MICHAL SEGALOV: And so, going
back to Panorama, recently

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.655
your headquarters moved
to Toronto.

00:27:34.655 --> 00:27:34.950
RONY ROSS: Yes.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.470
MICHAL SEGALOV: How would you
say that affected the company,

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.636
and what you think about
startups in Israel versus

00:27:39.636 --> 00:27:41.770
North America, Silicon
Valley, et cetera?

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.210
RONY ROSS:So, I think 2003,
indeed, Panorama specialized

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.070
really itself as a developer.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.950
First developing the first
generation, then second

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.270
generation, but all our sales
were done through partners,

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.180
big partnerships outside the
first generation with

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.630
Microsoft, the second generation
with Kronos, we

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.800
never really ventured
outside of Israel.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.700
Then in 2003, we could see that
the Business Intelligence

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.015
market is booming, and what we
have is a really competitive

00:28:10.015 --> 00:28:13.400
product, so we raised capital
and we opened up our

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.460
headquarters in Toronto.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:20.380
I, myself, relocated to Canada
with my husband, together with

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:25.725
two other people from Panorama
to open up this facility, and

00:28:25.725 --> 00:28:29.050
it made a huge difference.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:34.770
You think that you understand
the mentality of people in The

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:38.220
States or in Canada, who are
your main customers, but you

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.700
don't really understand it.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:46.620
Both from experience, but also
from actually going--

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.920
being on different sides
of the ocean.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.240
All of a sudden, when you found
yourself sitting in

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.270
Toronto and the guys in Israel,
all of a sudden on the

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:01.275
other side and other people in
UK and other people in the US,

00:29:01.275 --> 00:29:04.840
all of a sudden, you understand
what it takes in

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.250
order for a company to
really become global.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:11.115
What it takes in order to
prepare your team, to support

00:29:11.115 --> 00:29:16.370
not only your customers, but
yourself, each other.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.900
Sharing the know-how.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.840
Understanding how to
support each other.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.335
How to engage people.

00:29:21.335 --> 00:29:23.230
How to help them
be productive.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.800
It made a huge difference
to us.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.542
And I can only say that if you
ever wanted a startup to work,

00:29:31.542 --> 00:29:34.930
to bring yourself into a larger
company, you have to

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:39.670
work for at least a few
years internationally.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.820
That's my belief.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.130
I also recommend for everybody
to go back.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.960
The weather is better, the
social life is wonderful, and

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.300
besides, you know, me, if I get
up in the morning and I

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.930
don't see big headlines in the
newspaper, or something that

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.740
makes you, "Oh, oh, oh, my life
is in danger!" I don't

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.530
know how I'm going to
go through the day.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:06.430
Just a simple, quiet newspaper
like in Toronto, you'll never

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.281
do it to me.

00:30:07.281 --> 00:30:09.440
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: You
like living on the edge.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.080
RONY ROSS: Exactly.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.920
MICHAL SEGALOV: Do you think
this is changing?

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.830
I mean, on one hand, there
is more technology

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:13.820
now available, right?

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.262
There is a video conferencing
that's really good, Google

00:30:16.262 --> 00:30:19.770
Hangouts, and so on, but then
on the other hand, there's a

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:20.790
lot more competition.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.225
So how do you think
these two play?

00:30:23.225 --> 00:30:27.132
RONY ROSS: Well, first of all,
it's true. that there was a

00:30:27.132 --> 00:30:28.210
lot of competition.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.720
But you see, if you have
creative minds, you always get

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.930
to do something which nobody
ever though of.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:38.370
For example, this third
generation, what we call BI

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:43.190
3.0, this concept of taking
the social, and the

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.850
contextual, and the suggestive
into the BI system, the fact

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:49.580
is that we thought about it
and other company was just

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.460
taking it on.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.120
I was scrambling, trying to
say me too, me too kind of

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.030
stuff, and they went there.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:59.320
So there was a low limit to
creativity and there's no

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:04.130
limit to the way technology
reshapes itself and reshapes

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:07.200
the way that you're working.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.000
I can still remember a time
before the internet, and that

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.140
was there, and there was not
always internet around, and

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.410
now there is internet around, so
we change everything and I

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:25.690
remember a time where there
was no iPhone around.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.190
So and now we change everything
that we do.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:33.450
And in five years, people will
say, "Wow, we had BI that

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.261
wasn't collaborative?

00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:38.460
How could we work?" That's
what they mean.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:43.030
And you don't know what is
going to be the next wave

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.260
that's going to change the
way that we all will even

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.670
interact, in five
years from now.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:49.900
MICHAL SEGALOV: So how do
you get a hint for that.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.585
You identify something
that will--

00:31:51.585 --> 00:31:52.575
RONY ROSS: Yes, exactly.

00:31:52.575 --> 00:31:53.317
MICHAL SEGALOV: How
do you do that?

00:31:53.317 --> 00:31:55.545
How do you get that hint?

00:31:55.545 --> 00:31:56.130
RONY ROSS: I don't know.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.940
I can't explain it, really.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.276
It's having people--

00:32:01.276 --> 00:32:02.910
we try.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.350
We kept on.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:11.940
Almost every year, we have
strategic sessions, where all

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.133
our management team, and our
creative team, and our design

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:16.910
team, sit together--

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.600
it's kind of a retreat
version--

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.800
and we think about
what's next.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.140
What is changing?

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.330
How is the world changing
and how does it

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.660
affect what we are doing?

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.370
What is the possibility of it
to affect what we are doing?

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:39.520
Because here, the first
generation Panorama, the big

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.980
thing was Windows.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.370
The second generation, by the
way, was the internet.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.530
We developed an engine that
enabled internet deployment

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.964
for us of BI.

00:32:48.964 --> 00:32:51.470
The first one in the Microsoft
environment.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:57.270
And now, this thing about
enabling Panorama and blending

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.610
social and interaction.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:03.150
So it's something that
the company either

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.550
has or doesn't have.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.290
And you know what?

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.852
In the process, we also made
gambles that didn't work.

00:33:08.852 --> 00:33:10.910
There's no guarantee.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.980
You try things, and sometimes
you think you're onto the very

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.030
next big thing, and it doesn't
always work that way.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.350
And it hurts, and you spend a
lot of money, but it doesn't

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.170
necessarily work.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.390
MICHAL SEGALOV: But knowing
when to stop is another

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.270
important skill.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.090
RONY ROSS: Yeah, you have to
know when to stop, and when to

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.580
change, and when to adopt.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.840
It's very complex in
the fast lane.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.495
MICHAL SEGALOV: How do you
choose which activities or

00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:39.590
what changes to be
involved in?

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.752
You must get a lot of offers
from-- either from other

00:33:41.752 --> 00:33:44.230
companies or industries?

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.530
RONY ROSS: Yes, I get a lot.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.229
I try to limit myself
basically to areas

00:33:49.229 --> 00:33:50.726
that I fit good with.

00:33:50.726 --> 00:33:52.722
That I can feel that
I can contribute.

00:33:52.722 --> 00:33:58.211
Just being a dumb investor
has no value.

00:33:58.211 --> 00:34:00.140
Not to me and not
to the other.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.615
People think that it's enough
to raise money, and bringing

00:34:04.615 --> 00:34:06.377
any type of money is helpful.

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:10.760
It is, in a sense, but the truth
is, if you bring money

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.670
that can also have strategic
value and we get, for example,

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.080
strategic value from our
investors, we get strategic

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.739
value from our board members.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:26.803
If you get that, you're in
a much better position.

00:34:26.803 --> 00:34:28.585
MICHAL SEGALOV: So your advice
to someone starting a startup

00:34:28.585 --> 00:34:30.320
would be to choose the
right investor?

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.469
RONY ROSS: Yes, absolutely.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.390
If they can choose investors
who are useful to them, it

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:35.396
will make a huge difference.

00:34:35.396 --> 00:34:38.679
Eventually, as an entrepreneur,
it is a very

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.400
lonely road.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.449
There are so many difficulties,
and so many

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.755
hardships, and so many issues.

00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:52.090
If you have somebody that you
can really, truly help--

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:57.261
who can really, truly help
you, it's priceless.

00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:00.039
MICHAL SEGALOV: Have you had
mentors or people that were

00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:01.440
with you along the way?

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.990
RONY ROSS: As I said, when I
started, there were very few

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:08.210
people who were doing what
I was doing intuitively.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.580
What influenced me a lot,
was, as I told you,

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.626
I started in Scitex.

00:35:14.626 --> 00:35:17.406
I don't know if you know that it
was started by [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:17.406 --> 00:35:20.180
was practically one of
the really first

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.730
entrepreneurs anywhere.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.900
And it was always a model of
me, what Scitex was doing.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.355
And actually, from Scitex, I
think, probably over 50 maybe

00:35:31.355 --> 00:35:35.490
even over 100 similar startups,
some of them

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:39.650
successful, some of them less
so great, but was formed,

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.020
based on the experience
that we, as

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.240
people, experienced there.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.000
So he was one hero
that I followed.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.130
But my mentor in my early career
was actually my father,

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.240
[INAUDIBLE], was a very,
very wise man.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.820
I was lucky to have a person
like him that many people

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.310
valued as a consultant.

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:06.818
As a mentor, I had him naturally
and I didn't have to

00:36:06.818 --> 00:36:08.282
pay for his time.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:15.975
And today, my brother is
actually-- you know, my father

00:36:15.975 --> 00:36:18.960
passed away four years ago,
and my brother is actually

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.740
stepping up, in a way, and
becoming kind of my alter ego,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.050
trying to help me resolve
issues that I face.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.565
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: So I
think that this story that

00:36:30.565 --> 00:36:33.020
you've told us is really
amazing, and the Women

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.500
Techmakers series also features
really great women

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.850
leaders, but it's not a secret
that there aren't as many

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:44.010
women leaders as there
should be.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.320
So what do you think is the
reason that we don't see more

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.060
women in top positions?

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.520
RONY ROSS: It stems maybe
because of the should be.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.404
The should be is a relatively
new thing.

00:36:55.404 --> 00:37:00.651
Don't forget that until, I don't
know, 40, 50 years ago,

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:03.520
women did not necessarily--

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.990
were not really compelled, did
not feel that they have to

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:12.260
become part of the workforce, or
take care of the social and

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.460
economic future of
their families.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.020
Marriages were a long-term
affair.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.800
The arrangement was that a woman
would look after the

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.540
house, which at that time,
was very time-consuming.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.306
No dishwashers, no washing
machine, et cetera.

00:37:29.306 --> 00:37:36.590
And the men were out there
bringing in the money.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:37.970
These things change.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.700
First of all, technology
enabled the change.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.630
It made life, home-keeping much
easier, simple, it's not

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.205
a full-time job.

00:37:48.205 --> 00:37:52.225
And we changed also the social
and economical way that we

00:37:52.225 --> 00:37:53.560
look at the world.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.820
But by deciding that we want an
option not to stay married,

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.270
or not to get married or marry
late or do what we want.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.370
We wanted to control
our own destiny.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:06.450
And it meant that both sides are
no longer committed to a

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.680
very long-term relationship.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.880
And as a result, it means that
at least 50 if not more--

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.870
I don't have statistics, but I
think it's probably over 60--

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.290
60 percent of the women will
find themselves as the main

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:24.370
providers of the family,
themselves and their children

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.050
at the major portion
of their life.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.970
Maybe all their life, maybe
a major portion.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:30.560
Why?

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.330
Because either they will not
get married, or they'll get

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:38.390
divorced, or their spouses will
not be able to support

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.920
them, and the work conditions
change for them.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.590
I don't want to get into that.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:50.230
Anyway, then we find that the
responsibility for the family

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.820
is on their shoulders.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.670
And that means where they're
going to live, which

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:58.030
neighborhood, what type of
house, what kind of car will

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.420
take the children to school,
what kind of vacation they can

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.630
afford to himself, what kind
of education, what kind of

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:07.220
after-school activities, what
type of universities they can

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.124
send their children to.

00:39:09.124 --> 00:39:09.606
Whew!

00:39:09.606 --> 00:39:11.780
This is a huge responsibility.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.986
And we don't have it in
our genes, right?

00:39:13.986 --> 00:39:17.330
All these years, it wasn't
our responsibility.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:25.195
So we never really understood
ourselves as the breadwinner

00:39:25.195 --> 00:39:26.430
of my family.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.430
I am the breadwinner
of my family.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:33.670
And I have to make sure that
I act accordingly.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.830
I don't think we had
it in ourselves so

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:37.990
much over the years.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.150
And it's something
that changes.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.775
You can also see when you
say to women, money.

00:39:45.275 --> 00:39:47.200
It's not me.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.530
Oh, yes it is you.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:50.420
Money is you.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.710
So you have to step up and say,
I want this career, I

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:58.920
want this position, I want the
money, I want the option, I

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.110
want this, I want the perks.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:04.220
All these things that
we, kind of--

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.940
it wasn't in us so much.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:10.000
We have to change this attitude
to fix the new

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.715
conditions that we are in.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.540
There is no prince on a white
horse who is going to come out

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.300
and rescue you, damsel
in distress,

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.130
and make life simple.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.900
MICHAL SEGALOV: Were you
always thinking that?

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.346
Or is that something
that evolved?

00:40:26.346 --> 00:40:27.310
RONY ROSS: I did.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.010
I actually felt myself--

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:33.910
I was very self-reliant from
very early on, and

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.040
I became more so.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.490
But all of a sudden, I started
looking around, trying to

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.540
understand why is it that I
feel this and other people

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.026
don't get there as much.

00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:48.592
And I realized, that we have
an issue with money.

00:40:48.592 --> 00:40:53.140
We have an issue with
identifying ourselves with our

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.060
social and economic future.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.860
We have always that thing
that maybe somebody will

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:58.992
take care of it.

00:40:58.992 --> 00:41:00.320
It's not.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.083
MICHAL SEGALOV: How
important is

00:41:01.083 --> 00:41:02.201
risk-taking with that approach?

00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:03.240
RONY ROSS: It's very
important.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.896
And it's part of that, because
part of the thing about

00:41:06.896 --> 00:41:09.870
fortune favors the bold,
you have to take

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:10.900
risks in order to succeed.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.536
And you have to risk the fact
that you're going to fail.

00:41:14.536 --> 00:41:19.020
It's not easy, but I don't want
to see the world changing

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:25.220
and all of these lower echelons,
the social economic

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:30.630
echelons full of matriarchal
families.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.360
And actually, you can see
that in many respects.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.150
If you look carefully at
the data, you will find

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.110
out that it's true.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:43.415
So we actually have to build
ourselves better to build a

00:41:43.415 --> 00:41:46.330
career, to stand up
for a career--

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.770
and it's not just a career, not
what I'd like to do, it's

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:50.820
what makes money.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.426
It's what makes you successful
financially.

00:41:54.426 --> 00:41:55.780
It's very important.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.985
Because it's not just for
me, it's for my kids.

00:41:57.985 --> 00:42:00.520
It's for my family.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.170
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: So
we're almost out of time, but

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.317
there's one thing I really want
to ask you and that's out

00:42:05.317 --> 00:42:08.180
of everything that you've told
us, and what you haven't had

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.360
time to tell us yet, what are
you the most proud of?

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.940
RONY ROSS: You know, I said at
the beginning that one of the

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.970
things that I always had in my
mind was to be able to bring

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:23.080
strategic value to the
organization through the IT.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.570
And the thing that always makes
a difference to me is

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:27.800
when I meet him.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.040
Another CEO, a chairman of
another company, and they will

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.280
tell you, you know, there isn't
a single decision in our

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.190
organization that's not taken
through your Panorama system.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.982
This really makes it for me.

00:42:40.982 --> 00:42:48.490
Knowing that my customer's
life, financially and

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:51.545
strategically, is made
better, through

00:42:51.545 --> 00:42:53.190
the use of my software.

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.566
It's an amazing feeling.

00:42:55.566 --> 00:42:57.580
MICHAL SEGALOV: Indeed.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.430
DANIELA RAIJMAN-AHARONOV: So
Rony, thank you so much for

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:02.820
speaking to us and telling
us your story.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.405
Thank you, Michal.

00:43:03.405 --> 00:43:06.470
And thank you all for tuning
into the first episode of

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.450
Women Techmakers in Israel.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:10.960
We will have some more really
exciting episodes coming up,

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.640
and, of course, we have the
Women Techmakers episodes

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.530
already online from
the United States.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.310
So a good day to all
of you and goodbye!

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:21.800
MICHAL SEGALOV: Goodbye!

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.780
Thank you, Rony.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.250
RONY ROSS: OK.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:40.900
