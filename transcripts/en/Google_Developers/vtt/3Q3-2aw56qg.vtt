JON YOUSHAEI: So thank
you guys for joining us.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.807
We're here at the Distribute
space in the YouTube studio.

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:07.390
And we're so excited
to be joined here

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.399
by the founder of Startup
Grind, Derek Anderson.

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:11.940
Derek, thanks so
much for joining us.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.640
DEREK ANDERSON:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.556
JON YOUSHAEI: Awesome.

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:17.480
So just to get a little bit of a
preview of what to expect here,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.970
we'll be talking
about distribution.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.960
So the I/O space here's
divided into three main areas.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.410
We've got Design,
Develop, and Distribute.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.710
And we're here just to
answer one simple question

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.750
and get into it.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.466
Once you have a
great product, what

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.049
do you do with it
to get it out there?

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.094
How do you distribute it?

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:35.010
And how do you make sure
people know about it?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.134
And truthfully, I couldn't
think of a better person

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:38.902
to talk to about
this than Derek, who

00:00:38.902 --> 00:00:41.590
has created something really
special with Startup Grind.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.423
So why don't you go
ahead and talk about it.

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:45.080
And we'll dive into
all the details.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.538
DEREK ANDERSON:
Yeah, Startup Grind

00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:51.130
is a community of entrepreneurs
trying to educate and connect

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.720
founders across the world.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.970
So we have local events that
we hold in about 100 cities.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.530
Our whole program
is actually powered

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.440
by Google for Entrepreneurs.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.810
And we have about 300
volunteers around the world that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.540
help us run our events and
help build our community

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.384
and just help entrepreneurs.

00:01:13.384 --> 00:01:14.800
JON YOUSHAEI: And
take me through,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.310
Derek, for anybody who hasn't
been to a Startup Grind event.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.060
Take me through what
exactly happens.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.347
I walk in through the door.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:20.930
And then what?

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.590
What should I expect?

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.480
DEREK ANDERSON: The first thing
we do is we give you a watch.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.390
It's something we give
out at all of our events--

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.792
JON YOUSHAEI: I
thought you were going

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:26.350
to say you were
going to give me one.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.290
DEREK ANDERSON: --tablets,
shwag, lots of shirts,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.340
a lot of stickers.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.190
JON YOUSHAEI:
That's all you get.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.481
DEREK ANDERSON: Just like this.

00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.482
It's exactly like this.

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:38.000
Now, so we host
really well-known,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.990
legendary founders
and entrepreneurs

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.310
and venture capitalists.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.470
We hear their stories.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.740
We have them tell us about
the mistakes they've made

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.320
and the things that
they've done right.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.529
And that's part of the event.

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:51.903
And then the other
part is really

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.360
trying to help you make friends.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.600
So Startup Grind's
values are really simple.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.700
It's about giving
more than you take.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.170
It's about helping others
before you help yourself.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.420
And it's about making friends.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.960
You don't win an
award at Startup Grind

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.440
for getting the most
LinkedIn connections.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.020
There's no award for the person
with the most business cards.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.970
It's just, who can you help?

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.850
And what can you do for the
person sitting next to you

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.280
in a two or three
hour time period?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.570
JON YOUSHAEI: That's awesome.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.870
And any stories of people
who have met at Startup Grind

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.190
events that have gone to
develop products together?

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.215
Or--

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:27.090
DEREK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.590
Well, actually-- so we started
hosting events in my office

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.910
with a room of about
this many people.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.500
And one of the first
events, I actually

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.867
met a group of developers who
had just started an agency.

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:44.200
And we ended up working
together for the next two years.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.370
We ended up doing all of
our business together,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.540
was working together.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.940
And we had met at
a Startup Grind.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.380
We've had entrepreneurs
raise funding from speakers.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.770
We've had entrepreneurs,
obviously, join together

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.060
and found teams together.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.210
And then our community
of 300 people

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.235
who are really engaged
with each other-- and we

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:06.950
have very successful people
and people just starting out.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.092
And we host the events in
every city in the world.

00:03:10.092 --> 00:03:12.050
So if we don't have
Startup Grind in your city,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.820
then email me at
derek@startupgrind.com.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.170
Let's do it.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.459
But those people are
constantly working together.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.750
JON YOUSHAEI: That's fantastic.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.887
So a big reason why I'm
so excited to have you

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:26.220
is not just to hear about all
your experience with them.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.880
Because I feel you've spoken
to so many entrepreneurs

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.464
that you know about
how they've gotten

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:32.921
their products out there, how
they've shared their message,

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.640
and how they've gotten
users to sign up.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.980
So what's an example of a
startup that you're really

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.910
inspired by that you think has
done a good job of distributing

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.230
their product?

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.700
DEREK ANDERSON: I think I
love the story of Pinterest.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.600
Ben Silbermann told this
story about two years ago

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.389
where when they
launched the company,

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.180
it was basically like
every other startup--

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.721
like every startup
I've ever started,

00:03:56.721 --> 00:04:00.060
anyways-- that
when they launched,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.104
that it got so few users
that they were in stealth.

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:04.520
They didn't mean
to be in stealth.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.620
But it just was.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.590
And really no one
cared about it.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.970
And the first month,
they had 100 users.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.390
And then the second
month, they had 200 users.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.890
And the third month,
they had 400 users.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.589
And you think, well, that's
not growing very fast.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:25.260
But they doubled every
month for 18 months.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.070
And if you do the math,
by the 18th month,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.100
you're at about 500,000 users.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.180
And they've continued
to just grow

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.290
in that kind of
exponential growth.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.230
And some of the early
things that they did

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.840
were they seeded it a little
bit non-traditionally.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.870
They were based in Palo Alto
to start, at Silicon Valley.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.450
But they went to two
mommy blogger communities.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.600
They went to Iowa, which
is where Ben was from.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.250
And so he had a community there.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.470
He had connections there.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.106
They seeded it with
female bloggers.

00:05:00.106 --> 00:05:01.480
And then they went
to Utah, which

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.240
has this big female blogging
contingency, as well.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.897
And he spoke at blogging
conventions and conferences

00:05:07.897 --> 00:05:08.980
and met with these people.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.040
And you don't hear about
many high-tech Silicon Valley

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.970
companies going to
Utah and going to Iowa

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.270
to find early adopters
for their product.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.650
JON YOUSHAEI: Yeah, and really
interact with their users

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.210
from the onset--
and so can you talk

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.340
about how moving
away from the stories

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.400
of other entrepreneurs--
so take me

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.810
through Startup Grind Day One.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.620
You said it started off
as a very small group.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.720
How did it expand?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.440
And did it start out
as your main thing?

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.750
Did it start out
as a side project?

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.830
Tell us everything about
how it got off the ground.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.038
DEREK ANDERSON: Yeah, so I
worked at Electronic Arts.

00:05:41.038 --> 00:05:44.440
I quit my job, started
building products, and failing

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.160
more and more spectacularly
every six months.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.910
And while I was doing
that, a friend and I

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.180
started hosting these events.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.060
And there wasn't
really anything to it.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.130
It was just us getting together
and helping each other.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.630
But after a year
and a half, we were

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.900
getting 250 people
coming every month,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.830
and really with no effort.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.270
All of our effort
was in the companies

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.574
we were trying to run.

00:06:08.574 --> 00:06:09.990
And what had started
to happen was

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.390
I'd start have people
attending that would say, hey,

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.440
can I do this in my city?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.270
And I thought that
was a horrible idea.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.935
But I said, we have
nothing to lose.

00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:22.810
There's nothing here.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.379
It's just this thing that
we don't really care about.

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.920
But it seems to help
a lot of people.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.260
So just do it.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.480
And hopefully we won't
get sued or something.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.460
And what ended up happening
was it worked in L.A.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.044
It worked in New York.

00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:37.460
And a couple of the things
that we did very early in terms

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.220
of distribution-- today, we
get about 100 inbound requests

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.380
a month to start new chapters.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.580
In the beginning, no one cared.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.550
And so honestly, we
would do anything

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.680
that we could possibly do
to start a new chapter.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.620
Since Silicon Valley
is positioned as

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.710
like the melting
pot of the startup

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.842
world, every event that
we have in Silicon Valley,

00:07:02.842 --> 00:07:04.800
about half the audience
is from somewhere other

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.070
than Silicon Valley.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.820
And so we'd start to
pull from those people

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.550
and say, well, look
if you're here,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.930
you've seen the experience.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.690
You hopefully enjoyed it.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.860
You should do this in your city.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.270
And the first 20 chapters,
it was me finding people

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.100
at our events and
me convincing them

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.132
that this was a good idea for
them to spend their time doing.

00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:28.650
There was no reason to do it.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.310
We have someone here
today who started

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.680
our-- Brian Park has
started our DC chapter.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.650
And I met him at my event.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.610
I then saw him at
TechCrunch a few days later.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.495
I literally begged him.

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:40.370
He was a good person.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.782
He had the same values as me.

00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.990
He was really passionate
about helping entrepreneurs.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.600
I said, please, you
have to do this.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.800
This will help you.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.440
And he did it.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.600
And he, in the
last two years, has

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.100
built an amazing community
in Washington DC.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.260
But for the first 20
cities, it was really

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.840
blood, sweat, and tears,
begging, pleading, selling,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.940
people on that this was
something good for them.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.230
And we knew that it was.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.600
But we had to convince them.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.700
And once we hit 20
cities, the ball

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.700
started to roll to a
couple years later.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.460
We only approve about 10%
of the inbound requests

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.170
for new chapters.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.350
Used to be 100%.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.790
We would approve anyone.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.990
Anyone that would
touch it, we were in.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.640
JON YOUSHAEI: And how do you
make that process so selective?

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.460
Or how do you go
about making sure

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.330
that the person who evangelizes
Startup Grind is the right

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.230
fit so you know that the
users that they bring on

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.600
are the right ones for
the Startup Grind values?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.929
DEREK ANDERSON: Well,
like any good product,

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.900
you don't really know
what you're creating.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.899
This was a big accident.

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:46.840
A lot of the best products
are just complete accidents.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.740
And I don't know if we're in
the best product category.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.750
But this was not the startup.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.570
And so we tested.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:09:01.020
Every new city we had was a
new Petri dish for us to test.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.260
And we tried 100 different
things 100 different ways.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.690
And then once we had all that
data across 10 or 15 cities,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.130
we said, OK, here's
the road map.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.500
We have what we can
kind of cookie-cut out

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.620
and replicate this
across the world.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.200
And every six months, our
process completely changes.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.060
So we've now been doing it
for about two years full-time.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.160
And every couple of months,
we start all over again.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.282
And how do we do this?

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:28.240
How do we look at this?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240
How do we organize it?

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.765
How are we going
to motivate people?

00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:32.390
How are we going to
help entrepreneurs?

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.055
We rethink everything.

00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:37.230
And that's just a
very iterative process

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.862
that most entrepreneurs probably
experience in their companies.

00:09:39.862 --> 00:09:41.320
JON YOUSHAEI: Derek,
I love how you

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.775
call it an accident, the
start of Startup Grind.

00:09:44.775 --> 00:09:47.450
And I want to talk about what
entrepreneurs or developers

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.370
here today can do to maybe
take an online presence

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.700
or an online app and move
it into the offline world

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.520
so you could have people connect
in real-time like you did

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.461
in just starting this
community as an offshoot

00:09:57.461 --> 00:09:58.710
to the start of your work now.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.654
What would you recommend
for people here today

00:10:00.654 --> 00:10:02.320
who are developing
something and looking

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.270
to allow people to connect in
the real world in real-time?

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.665
DEREK ANDERSON: Well, if
you're not doing events,

00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:14.380
you becoming the event
person is probably

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.870
not a good use of your time.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.237
But there are a lot of
people doing things offline.

00:10:19.237 --> 00:10:20.570
There are a lot of great events.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.210
There are a lot of
great communities.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.760
All those people want
to work with companies

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.620
that have the same
values as them

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.970
and have the same
mindset as them.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.700
I think if you're
an entrepreneur,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.970
it's so important to get your
product in people's hands,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.480
to physically watch
them using your product.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.590
Film it.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.790
Talk to them.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.580
And one thing that
I found is I've

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.890
had products that
were my babies.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.485
And nothing could be
wrong with that child.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.430
It had six toes.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.840
But you'd better not
say anything about it.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.950
It was bald.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.192
But you know, it's beautiful.

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:01.150
It's the most amazing--

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:08.910
But with Startup Grind, for
me there's no personal agenda.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.840
It's all, what do
the users want?

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.020
What do entrepreneurs want?

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.456
How can I help
entrepreneurs more?

00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:15.330
And if that's something
completely different,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.200
we'll do it.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.480
And I think as you're
looking at, well,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.070
how do we get it
into people's hands?

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.600
How do we talk to
people about it?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.330
Look for companies.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.590
Look for groups that, A, you
want to aspire to be like,

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.060
so people that make you
look better, but also

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.950
that you can add value to.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.540
And that could be a sponsorship.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.730
That could be a partnership.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.440
That could be you bringing
your users to them.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.960
But go look for people
that are like you and that

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.560
make you look better.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.970
And then find ways to
make those people look

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.810
good through what you're doing.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.070
And if you can look at,
what's in it for this person?

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.357
I know what's in it for me.

00:11:52.357 --> 00:11:53.440
But what's in it for them?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.000
And how can I make
them look good?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.055
Then you may be able to do
some meaningful partnerships.

00:11:59.055 --> 00:12:00.930
JON YOUSHAEI: So let's
talk a little bit more

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.690
about partnerships.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.130
You've been able to put together
a terrific one with Google

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.880
for Entrepreneurs.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.101
It's obviously taken a
long time to develop.

00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:09.600
I know in catching
up the other day,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.430
you were talking
about a partnership

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.030
that Electronics
Arts developed when

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.450
you were working in the
digital space over there.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.370
Can you give a story about
how when an app was coming out

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.420
either that you were
working on or that you heard

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.210
about closely, how did they
distribute in their first days?

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.692
What partnerships did they get?

00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:29.400
And how did they get
their app out there?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.270
DEREK ANDERSON: So if you're
an early-stage startup,

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.300
you have nothing, a
lot of times, to give.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.010
There's not a lot of
value that you have.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.690
Because you have no users.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.370
You have limited traction.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.060
You have all these
things against you.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.560
And so one thing that you can
do is look at other startups

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.200
who are in the same position.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.360
And try to work with them.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.960
And you want 1 plus 1
should always equal 5.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.580
Or it's not worth doing.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.580
And so if 1 plus 1 equals 1.5 or
1 plus 1 equals 2, keep moving.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.280
Keep thinking.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.160
Keep looking.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.840
But one thing that-- this
was several years ago.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.880
This was right when the Facebook
marketplace became available.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.360
But this startup
emerged that was just

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.180
a kind of a toolbar at
the top of apps that

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.120
would market five or
10 different games.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.230
And basically, all of
those startups would opt in

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:27.710
and say, yes, we will add
this toolbar to our app.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.600
And then we'll all help each
other market our products.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.880
You could say, well, they
compete with each other.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.150
They compete for time.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.750
But they weren't the same game.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.440
But they were games.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.050
And so they had the same
kind of customer base.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.380
You later then saw people like
Zynga or EA or other people

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.160
create their own to cross
promote their own games.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.420
But that was, to me,
a very innovative way

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.650
for startups to
help each other who

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.430
didn't have any
sort of distribution

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.934
or didn't have any traction.

00:13:56.934 --> 00:13:59.350
When you start working with
bigger companies like a Google

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.220
or a Kauffman Foundation
or an Apple or a Facebook,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.360
it's a different position.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.940
Because you need
to make sure that,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.020
again, you have
something to offer.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:17.300
And so in our case with Google,
we had been going for two years

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.590
before we ever even approached
them-- 2 and 1/2 years.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.510
And when we approached
them, we said, look,

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.440
we've done hundreds of events.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.450
You're doing hundreds of events.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.974
This can really add
to your mission.

00:14:27.974 --> 00:14:29.890
And we're aligned in our
values and our goals.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.220
And we said, we can add
this to what you're doing.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.720
We know what Google
could add to us.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.610
It's pretty obvious that
there's lots of great things

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.568
Google could do for us.

00:14:36.568 --> 00:14:38.480
But what could we do for Google?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.630
And we can't help Google a lot.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.430
But we can do our own
little things and support.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.100
And so that conversation
was much easier.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.340
Because we were
thinking about them.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.000
And they were thinking about us.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.050
And then with that, you've
got to be thinking about,

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.750
do I have the time and energy
to fight this thing out?

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.210
And a deal with a big company
might take six months.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.854
It might take nine months, even
if you look great from day one.

00:15:03.854 --> 00:15:05.270
If you don't look
great, you might

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.960
be a year or year and a half.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.260
And so you have to be ready to
last that full length of time

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.550
and to be able to patiently
wait for those people

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.210
to come around.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.630
Or you might waste your time.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.880
Or you might waste their time.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.869
Or you might just run
out of juice on them.

00:15:23.869 --> 00:15:24.660
JON YOUSHAEI: Yeah.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.377
No, I love your note
about the patience

00:15:27.377 --> 00:15:28.960
of working with big
partners, but also

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.499
the scrappiness of bringing
little partners together

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:34.290
and creating your own
distribution network.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.830
I think so many
times with startups,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.210
you think, oh, we don't
have the leverage.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.040
There's all these
Goliaths our there.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.270
And we're just a bunch of
Davids here who can't distribute

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.690
and partner to help one another.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.564
But I think the example
you gave is beautiful

00:15:46.564 --> 00:15:49.240
and that you can approach other
products, other developers

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.791
and try to cross promote
to help one another out.

00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:54.290
So is there any other tips you
would give to an entrepreneur

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.200
starting at day one or anything
looking back at your career

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.620
as an entrepreneur?

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.500
Hey, I would do
this differently.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.220
Or here's a specific
piece of advice

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.190
that I would give to a developer
who may have been in my shoes

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:06.990
a few years ago.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.281
DEREK ANDERSON: Well, when
I started building products,

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:12.040
I wrongly just said
this is my vision.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.590
I know that people want this.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.715
I'm just going to build it.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.740
And I think, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.020
getting customer feedback,
developing hand in hand

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.030
with users, with people that
actually need the product--

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.325
But then also, as you're
thinking about the product

00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:29.020
and you're thinking
about your team,

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.420
are you also thinking about
your distribution strategy?

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.640
Do you have a
cohesive plan for, how

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.370
are we going to get to
a million page views?

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.850
Or how are we going to
get to 100 customers?

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.000
We just had this
great talk from Sean

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.970
from Tinder, who said the first
day when the product was ready,

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.770
he made everyone in the
room send a text message

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.310
to 100 people.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.930
That's a very simple,
tangible thing they could do.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.890
And then they went to colleges.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.830
And they got the key
influencer at each college

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.750
and had them share
with all their friends.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.819
That's a very simple,
easy way to grow

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.153
and to get to some
sort of critical mass.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.069
JON YOUSHAEI: Totally.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.710
DEREK ANDERSON: And
if you're a startup,

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.960
you don't need a lot of money.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.440
You don't need to
spend on AdWords yet.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.970
You just need to come up
with a simple, creative way

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.050
to get enough users
and customers to start

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.079
to get some traction and
show you have momentum.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.480
And then if you do that,
everything else will follow.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.290
Investors will follow.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.780
Cash will follow.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.782
Team will follow.

00:17:31.782 --> 00:17:33.240
All these other
things will follow.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.200
But if you have a great product,
which is pretty difficult,

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.500
and then on top of that, a
great distribution strategy,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.860
then people might
actually see your product.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.660
You might become noticeable.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.890
You might get out there.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:47.430
JON YOUSHAEI: That's awesome.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.360
So I want to close
with one last question.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.030
Then I want to open
it up to you guys

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.700
to be able to ask Derek any
questions about Startup Grind,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.800
distribution, et cetera.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.250
But Derek, as you
move into the future,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.130
how do you view Startup
Grind's expansion and growth

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.340
on a global basis?

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.200
Your numbers are astonishing,
over 75,000 entrepreneurs

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.360
impacted at your events at over
100 cities across the globe.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.752
How do you keep up
that growth rate?

00:18:13.752 --> 00:18:16.210
And what are your plans for
the future to continue growing?

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.335
DEREK ANDERSON: Well, I
got some really good advice

00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:20.015
from someone named
George Zachary, who

00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:22.223
was one of the first investors
in Yammer and Twitter.

00:18:22.223 --> 00:18:27.680
And he said, growth for
growth's sake is pointless.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.540
And so for us, getting to 100
more cities or 1,000 cities,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.140
what's the point?

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.064
I think for us, the question
that we ask ourselves

00:18:39.064 --> 00:18:40.480
just about more
than anything else

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.710
is, how can we help
entrepreneurs more today

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.750
than we did yesterday?

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.100
And there are 400
million entrepreneurs.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.770
So there's plenty to help.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.450
We've helped 75,000.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.714
That's like nothing.

00:18:54.714 --> 00:18:56.630
JON YOUSHAEI: That's a
good way to look at it.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.930
DEREK ANDERSON: So what can
we do to improve that help,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.700
to scale up that help, to really
make entrepreneurs successful.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.850
And that's what
we're trying to do.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:07.720
So--

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.636
JON YOUSHAEI: Awesome.

00:19:08.636 --> 00:19:11.400
So with that, we'll open it
up to Q&amp;A from the audience.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:18.810
If you guys have-- [INAUDIBLE]
We'll get you a mic.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.185
AUDIENCE: What's your
monetization of Startup Grind?

00:19:23.185 --> 00:19:26.955
Is it now or in the
future or a combination?

00:19:26.955 --> 00:19:27.830
DEREK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.640
So our monetization
model is very simple.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.220
And it's that all of our
events are paid events.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.740
And we have sponsors
and partners

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.490
that help support the events.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.070
So we're not an incubator.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.340
We're not an accelerator.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.380
In a world where everybody
asks you to give them

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.470
a piece of your
company, our goal

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:55.150
is just to help and to support
and to give you connections

00:19:55.150 --> 00:20:01.250
and give you education
and to do that

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:05.440
at a ticket price or
a sponsorship price.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.250
So it's as simple as that.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.980
AUDIENCE: Do you ask for
anything from the companies

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.220
that you help?

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.960
In the future once
they grow, do you

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.021
ask for a percentage of their
profits or anything like that?

00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:24.670
DEREK ANDERSON: Will you give
us a percentage of your profits?

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.550
We will take them if
you'll give them to us.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.050
We don't.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.040
So it's kind of
[? this-- ?] I don't

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.165
know if it's revolutionary.

00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:34.470
It just seemed like the
best thing to us to do.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.536
But we support.

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:38.910
But we think
entrepreneurs should

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.076
control their own companies.

00:20:40.076 --> 00:20:43.990
Most companies are
bootstrapped in the world,

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.560
not in Silicon
Valley, where we are.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.330
But most entrepreneurs
bootstrap their companies.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.470
They have to figure it out.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.330
They have to get friends
and family to help them.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.230
They have to save their money.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.950
They have to live
in their garage

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.690
or their-- I was going to
say their mom's garage,

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.015
but live in their
apartment and work out

00:21:02.015 --> 00:21:05.190
of their apartment for a long
time to get things going.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.750
So we think entrepreneurs
should keep their equity

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.420
and should spend it
on getting great teams

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.010
and getting great
people involved in it.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.330
And for us, it's about just
providing that education layer

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.240
and helping in that way.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.880
AUDIENCE: So when did you decide
to leave your full-time job

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:29.310
at EA and then go into
Startup Grind full-time?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.950
DEREK ANDERSON: So it kind
of took me about two years.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:34.640
I'm married.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.860
And I have an amazing wife.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.760
But it took me two
years to convince her

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.740
that quitting my
job was a good idea.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.855
And we did that six weeks after
we had our first son, which

00:21:45.855 --> 00:21:50.630
is probably the worst time you
could possibly quit your job.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:55.810
And then I built about five
or 10 different products

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.362
in the two years
before I started

00:21:57.362 --> 00:21:58.820
working on Startup
Grind full-time.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.435
So I did not quit
to do Startup Grind.

00:22:01.435 --> 00:22:03.280
I quit to do a number
of other things

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.310
that you've never
heard of, and which

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.150
I hope you won't
dig up from my past.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.970
But the Startup Grind,
it just was very natural.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.050
It was very evolutionary.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:20.100
And over two years,
it became the startup.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:27.050
And so if you're going to
quit your job, save your money

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.480
and get your wife as your
co-founder, or your husband.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.060
Because they're as important
as anything you do,

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.112
is getting your family
on-board that-- look,

00:22:37.112 --> 00:22:38.570
this is going to
be a long journey.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.653
This is going to be tough.

00:22:39.653 --> 00:22:42.420
This isn't going to be stable
like what I've been doing.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.230
You jump off the cliff and you
build a parachute on the way

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.470
down is a good
explanation of what

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.190
it felt like for me, I guess.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.262
What are the bars for
opening a chapter?

00:22:56.262 --> 00:22:57.720
For example, a
number of attendees,

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.595
something like that--
and how independent

00:22:59.595 --> 00:23:02.880
are these new chapters?

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.580
Do they have freedoms
over sponsors

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.240
or accepting sponsors,
something like that?

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.390
DEREK ANDERSON: So
the bars for starting

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.580
a new chapter are you have
to put a plan together.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.220
And the most important thing--
really, the only major bar

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.490
is that you have to share
the same values as us.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.630
And so if you share those values
and we think you can actually

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:28.676
execute it, the size of
the city doesn't matter.

00:23:28.676 --> 00:23:29.800
The country doesn't matter.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.070
We do it in 42 countries.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.230
We're going to have our first
even in Iran next month.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.000
We're in Georgia.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.820
We're in the Congo.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.045
We're in Nairobi.

00:23:38.045 --> 00:23:40.170
I just spoke with somebody
from our Nairobi chapter

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.820
that's here at Google
I/O. She was pretty cool.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.960
So but it's just, do you
have the same mindset as us?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.770
And can you lead a
community in a way

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.900
that we know it needs to
be led to be successful?

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.690
And what we've found is if
you get those people in place,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:01.208
everything else just works out.

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:04.410
JON YOUSHAEI: That's awesome.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.680
AUDIENCE: Two questions--
first, do you have competition?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.830
And if so, what
does that look like?

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.220
And the other
question is that you

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.670
have insight into many,
many companies, obviously.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.667
And I'm sure people
that you're connected

00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:19.750
with throughout this Startup
Grind say, oh, I just

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.035
saw something
really great, or, I

00:24:21.035 --> 00:24:22.840
know guys that are
looking for investment.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.631
Do you partner with
venture capital groups?

00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:25.960
Do you do your own investments?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.680
And also, are you still
pursuing your own products?

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.980
You seem like an idea guy.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.760
And do you see something
and go, oh, I can do it.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.300
So 'a couple questions.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.800
DEREK ANDERSON: OK.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.940
So on the competition
front, there

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.070
are other great
events or communities

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.349
that sometimes compete
a little bit for time

00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:50.140
with entrepreneurs.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.150
But I wouldn't look at
them as competitive to us.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.630
UP Global is a great example
of a great community that

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.080
helps entrepreneurs
all over the world.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.440
They're kind of similar to us.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.310
But we work together
and partner together.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.840
Google for
Entrepreneurs does lots

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.470
of things for entrepreneur.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.469
You could say, well,
that's kind of competitive.

00:25:09.469 --> 00:25:11.060
But really, this
space is interesting,

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.550
because it's very
socially driven,

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.780
people that have a
social-driven purpose.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.090
And so we're helping
100,000 entrepreneurs.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.281
And if you're helping
a million, then great.

00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:23.530
We're all just trying to help.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.310
There are so many entrepreneurs.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.642
So competition's maybe
not the right word.

00:25:29.642 --> 00:25:31.100
But there are other
people that are

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.130
helping entrepreneurs
in great ways.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:37.880
And then in terms of the--
what was the other question?

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.500
Oh, the VC's, yeah.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.000
Yeah, so I am not an investor.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.010
No, I am absolutely
not an investor.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.740
I'm just an entrepreneur.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.000
I hope I can be an
entrepreneur for 30 years.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.915
There's this really what I think
is a negative trend of, when

00:25:54.915 --> 00:25:56.290
I make it as an
entrepreneur, I'm

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.810
going to become an investor
so I can get more rich

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.370
and work less.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.621
And I hope I always
am an entrepreneur.

00:26:04.621 --> 00:26:06.870
I hope I always have the
energy to be an entrepreneur.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.002
I'm not sure I will.

00:26:08.002 --> 00:26:09.460
But I don't know
what else I'll do.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.840
But hopefully I can last 30
years as an entrepreneur.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.080
I can't lose any more hair.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.290
So at least I know that.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.140
And we do see great companies.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.420
And we love to
just connect them.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.690
We don't take a percentage.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.070
We're not brokers.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.240
We just try and support
great entrepreneurs.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.720
And we don't introduce
everyone to everyone.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.660
But when we see a great
company, we absolutely

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.790
will introduce some
of our speakers.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:41.059
And for me, I do have
ideas on things to do.

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:43.600
But the purpose of, at least
for me of being an entrepreneur,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.525
was always to find something
I could focus on and just do

00:26:46.525 --> 00:26:47.150
full-heartedly.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.694
So for several
years, it probably

00:26:48.694 --> 00:26:50.860
looked like I was very
sporadic and scatter-brained.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.651
And maybe some of you
are in this position.

00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:55.680
Because you don't want
to put all your chips

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.640
on black on that one bet.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.010
And so you spread a
little bit to make sure

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.230
you've got other doors.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.390
But at some point, you've
got to put all your chips

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.700
on the table on the right bet.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.070
And so for me, that
came about two years ago

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.380
with Startup Grind.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.560
And we had three chapters.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.510
It wasn't like, this is for
sure going to do something cool.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.430
It was, this seems like
the right thing to do.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.487
I'm finally going to
go all in on this.

00:27:21.487 --> 00:27:22.820
I'd gone all in on other things.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.770
But I'm just going
to go all in on this.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:29.600
And I hope I do this
for a really long time.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.087
I'm very focused on the
mission and the values

00:27:33.087 --> 00:27:33.920
of what we're doing.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.374
And so actually, I have ideas.

00:27:37.374 --> 00:27:38.540
But I kind of suppress them.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.910
Or I brainstorm
with entrepreneurs.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.102
And that's a way for me to
be creative outside of just

00:27:44.102 --> 00:27:45.560
being creative in
what we're doing.

00:27:47.954 --> 00:27:49.370
JON YOUSHAEI: So
with that, I just

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.480
want to thank Derek
for your time.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.130
Thank you so much.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:51.205
DEREK ANDERSON: Great.

00:27:51.205 --> 00:27:51.750
Thank you very much.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.350
Thanks for having me.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.766
JON YOUSHAEI: Thank
you very much.

00:27:53.766 --> 00:27:55.650
DEREK ANDERSON:
Thank you. [APPLAUSE]

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.200
JON YOUSHAEI: Cool.
