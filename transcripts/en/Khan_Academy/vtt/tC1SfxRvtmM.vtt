00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.170
Express 25 degrees
Celsius as a temperature

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.600
in degrees Fahrenheit using
the formula Fahrenheit, or F,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.510
is equal to 9/5 times the
Celsius degrees plus 32.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.160
So they're telling us that
we have 25 degrees Celsius.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.550
So we could put
that in for C here,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.132
and we'll get the temperature
in Fahrenheit degrees.

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:22.840
So let's do that.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.250
So we'll get F is equal
to 9/5-- now for C,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.490
we're going to put in
25-- times 25 plus 32.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.640
And now we can simplify this
before we multiply 25 times 9.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.350
Remember, this is the same
thing as 9/5 times 25/1.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.780
We can essentially divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.730
of our eventual product by 5.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.680
If we divide 25 by 5, we get 5.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.110
If we divide 5 by 5, we get 1.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.770
So this boils down
to 9 times 5 plus 32.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.320
So our Fahrenheit
degrees are going

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.790
to be 9 times 5 is
45 plus 32 degrees.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.190
Or it's equal to
45 plus 32 is 77,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.988
so this is 77
degrees Fahrenheit.
