00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.890
- [Evelina] Thanks very much for having me
here. So today I will tell you about the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.660
language system and some of its properties
that may bear in the question of how the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.620
system came about. I will begin by
defining the scope of my inquiry because

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.430
people mean many different things by
language. I will then present you some

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.950
evidence and suggesting that our language
system is highly specialized for language

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.070
and finally I will speculate a bit on the
evolutionary origins of language. So

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.000
linguistic input comes in through our ears
or our eyes and once it's been analyzed

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.060
perceptually, we interpret it by linking
the incoming representations to our

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.830
language knowledge and this knowledge, of
course, is also used for generating

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.980
utterances during language production. And
once we've generated an utterance in our

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.790
heads, we can send it down to our
articulation system and the part that I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.880
focus on is this kind of high level
component of language processing. This

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.920
cartoon shows you the approximate
locations of the brain regions that

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.610
support speech perception shown in yellow,
visual letter and word recognition in

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.240
green, this region is known as the visual
word form area, articulation in pink and

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.120
high level language processing in red.
And what differentiates the high level

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.830
language processing regions from the
perceptual and articulation regions, is

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.900
that they're sensitive to the
meaningfulness of the signal. So for

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.420
example, the speech regions will respond
just as strongly to foreign speech as they

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.100
respond to meaningful speech in our
language. The visual word form area

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.900
responds just as much to a string of
consonants as it does to real words, the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.690
articulation regions can be driven to a
full extent by people producing

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.580
meaningless sequences of syllables. But in
contrast, the high level language

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.290
processing system or network, or sometimes
I refer to it just as the language network

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.520
for short, cares deeply about whether the
linguistic signal is meaningful or not. In

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.000
fact, the easiest way to find the system
in the brain is to contrast responses to

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.140
meaningful language stimuli like words,
phrases or sentences and some control

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.490
conditions like linguistically degraded
stimuli. The contrast I've used most

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.000
frequently is between sentences and
sequences of non-words.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.100
A key methodological innovation that laid
the foundation for much of my work was the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.930
development of tools that enable us to
define the regions of the language network

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.200
functionally of the individual subject
level using contrasts like these, and here

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.930
I'm showing you sample language regions in
three individual brains. And this

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.500
so-called functional localization approach
has two advantages one, it circumvents the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.640
need to average brains together which is
what's done in the common approach and

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.810
it's a very difficult thing to do because
brains are quite different across people.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.420
And instead in this approach, we can just
average the signals that we extract from

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.460
these key regions of interest. And the
second advantage is that it allows us to

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.280
establish accumulative research
enterprise, which I think we all agree is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.360
important in science. Because comparing
results across studies in labs is quite

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.570
straight forward if we're confident that
we are referring to the same brain regions

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.530
across different studies. And this is just
hard or impossible to do in the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.640
traditional approach which relies on very
coarse anatomical landmarks like the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.110
inferior frontal gyrus or the superior
temporal sulcus which span many

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.320
centimeters of cortex and they're just not
at the right level of analysis.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.670
So what drives me in my work is the desire
to understand the nature of our language

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.170
knowledge and the computations that
mediate language comprehension and

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.920
production, however these questions are
hard specially given the lack of any

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.620
models for language. And so for now I
settle on more tractable questions for

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.530
example one, what is the relationship
between the language system and the rest

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.790
of human cognition? Language didn't evolve
and it doesn't exist in isolation from

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.460
other evolutionarily older systems, which
include the memory and attention

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.300
mechanisms, the visual and the motor
systems, the system that supports social

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.690
cognition and so on. And that means that
we just can't study language as an

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.950
isolated system. And a lot of my research
effort is aimed at trying to figure out

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.670
how language fits with the rest of our
mind and brain. And the second question

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.680
delves inside the language system asking,
what does its internal architecture look

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.640
like? And it encompasses questions like:
what are the component parts of the

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.180
language system and what is the division
of labor among them in space and time?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.320
And of course, both of those questions
ultimately should constrain the space of

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.760
possibilities for how language actually
works. So they place constraints on both

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.040
the data structures that underlie language
and the computations that are likely

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.800
performed by the regions of the system.
And today, I focus on the first of these

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.420
questions. Okay, so now onto some
evidence. So the relationship between

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.440
language and the rest of the mind and
brain has been long debated and the

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.390
literature actually is quite abundant with
claims that language makes use of the same

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.160
machinery that we use for performing other
cognitive tasks including arithmetic

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.390
processing, various kinds of executive
function tasks, perceiving music,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.980
perceiving actions, abstract conceptual
processing and so on. And I will argue

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.680
that these claims are not supported by the
evidence.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.640
Two kinds of evidence speak to the
relationship between language and other

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.470
cognitive systems, there is brain imaging
studies, brain imaging evidence and

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.910
investigations of patients with brain
damage. In fMRI studies, we do something

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.620
very simple we find our regions that seem
to respond a lot to language and then we

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.180
ask how do they respond to other various
none linguistic tasks. And if they don't

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.670
show much of a response, then we can
conclude that these regions are not

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.670
engaged during those tasks. And in the
patient studies we can evaluate

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.990
non-linguistic abilities in individuals
who don't have a functioning language

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.490
system and if they performed well, we can
conclude that the language system is not

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.250
necessary for performing those various
non-linguistic tasks. So starting with

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.990
fMRI evidence, I will show you responses
in the language regions to arithmetic,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.870
executive function tasks and music
perception today. So here are two simple

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.100
regions, a region in the inferior frontal
cortex around Broca's area and the region

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.870
in the posterior middle temporal gyrus,
but the rest of the regions of this

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:55.390
network look similar in their profiles.
And the region on the top is kind of in

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.720
and around this region knows as Broca's
area except I don't use that term because

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.020
I don't think it's a very useful term.
In black and gray I show you the responses

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.250
to the two localized condition sentences
and non-words, and these are estimated and

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.480
data that's not used for defining these
regions, so we divide the data in half,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.700
use half of the data to define the regions
and then the other half to quantify their

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.050
responses. I will now show you how these
regions respond when people are asked to

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.060
do some simple arithmetic additions,
perform a series of executive functions

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.240
tasks like for example hold a set of
locations in spatial memory, spatial

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:39.770
locations in working memory or perform
this classic flanker tasks, or listen to

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.940
various musical stimuli.
For arithmetic and various executive tasks

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.910
we, included a harder and an easier
condition because we wanted to make sure

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.480
that we can identify regions that are
classically associated with performing

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.060
these tasks, which is typically done by
contrasting a harder and an easier

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.120
condition of a tasks. So I'll show you now
in different colors responses to these

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:07.040
various tasks, starting with the region on
the lower part of the screen. So we find

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.980
that this region doesn't respond during
arithmetic processing, doesn't respond

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.680
during working memory, doesn't respond
during cognitive control tasks and doesn't

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.210
respond during music perception. And quite
strikingly to me at the time, a very

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.910
similar profile is observed around this
region which is smack in the middle of the

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.250
so-called Broca's area, which appears to
be incredibly selective in its response

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.610
for language.
And know that it's not just the case that

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.470
these, for example, demanding tasks fail
to show a hard versus an easy difference.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.160
They respond pretty much at or below
fixation base line when people are engaged

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.360
in these tasks, so that basically tells
you that these language regions work as

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.260
much when you're doing a bunch of math in
your head or hold information in working

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.700
memory as what you're doing when you're
looking at a blank screen, so they really

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.560
do not care. So of course, to interpret
the lack of the response in these language

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.930
regions, you want to make sure that these
tasks activate the brain somewhere else

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.100
otherwise you may have really bad tasks
that you don't want to use.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.780
So indeed they do. So here I'll show you
activations for the executive functions

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.850
tasks, but musical also robustly activates
the brain outside of the language system.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.390
So here are two sample regions one in the
right frontal cortex, one in the left

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.620
parietal cortex and you see the profiles
of response are quite different from the

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.380
language regions. For each task we see
robust responses, but also a stronger

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.750
response to the harder than the easier
condition across these various domains,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:37.130
and these regions turn out to be part of
this bilateral front to parietal network

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.520
which is known in the literature by many
names including the cognitive control

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.230
network or the multiple demand system, the
letter term advanced by John Duncan who

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.360
wanted to highlight the notion that these
regions are driven by many different kinds

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.890
of cognitive demands.
And so these regions appear to be

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.390
sensitive to effort across tasks and their
activity has been linked to a variety of

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.670
goal directed behaviors. Interestingly, if
you look at the responses of these regions

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.840
to our language localizer conditions, we
find exactly the opposite of what we find

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.760
in the language regions, they respond less
to sentences than sequences of non-words

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.740
presumably because processing sentences
requires less effort, but clearly this

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.920
highlights again the language and the
cognitive control system are clearly

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.980
functionally distinct. Moreover, damage to
the regions of the multiple demand network

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.300
has been shown to lit to decreases in
fluid intelligence. So Alex Woolgar and

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.270
colleagues have reported a strong
relationship between the amount of tissue

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.860
loss in frontal and parietal cortices and
a measure of IQ, and this is not true for

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.800
tissue loss in the temporal lobes. And
it's quite striking, you can actually

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.730
calculate for this many cubic centimeters
of loss in the MD system you lose so many

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.540
IQ points, it's a strong clear
relationship. So this system is clearly an

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.350
important part of the cognitive arsenal of
humans because the ability to think

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.110
flexibly and abstract and to solve a new
problems are exactly. . .these are the

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.790
kinds of abilities that IQ tests aim to
measure are considered kind of one of the

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.580
hallmarks of human cognition.
Okay, so as I mentioned the complimentary

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.440
approach for addressing questions about
language specificity and relationship to

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.100
other mental functions is to examine
cognitive abilities in individuals who

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.770
lack a properly functioning language
system. And most telling are cases of

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.800
global aphasia, so this is a severe
disorder which affects pretty much the

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.510
entire frontal temporal language system
typically due to a large stroke in the

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.780
middle cerebral artery and lead to
profound defecits in comprehension and

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.660
production. And Rosemary Varley at UCL has
been studying this population for a few

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.630
years now and with her colleagues, she has
shown that actually these patients seem to

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.630
have preserved abilities across many many
domain, so she showed that they have

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.220
intact arithmetic abilities they can
reason causally, they have good non-verbal

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.310
social skills, they can navigate in the
world, they can perceive music and so one

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.020
and so forth.
And of course, these findings are then

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.520
consistent with the kind of picture that
emerges in our work in fMRI. Let's

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.980
consider another important non-linguistic
capacity which a lot of people often bring

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.170
up when I tell them about this work. How
about the ability to extract meaning from

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.970
non-linguistic stimuli, right? So given
that our language regions are so sensitive

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.930
to meaning, we can ask how much of that
response is due to the activation of some

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.610
kind of abstract conceptual representation
that language may elicit rather than

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:30.580
something more language specific, semantic
representation type. So to ask these

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.760
questions, we can look at how language
regions respond to non-verbal meaningful

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.590
representations, in one study we had
people look at events like this or the

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.940
sentence level descriptions of them and
either we had them do kind of a high level

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.160
semantic judgment task like decide whether
watering a plant is plausible or do a very

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.590
demanding perceptual control task. And
basically what you find. . .here's again

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.940
the black and gray area responses to the
localizer conditions. So in red as you

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.340
would expect, you find strong responses to
the condition where people see sentences

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.550
and make semantic judgments on them. So
what happens when people make semantic

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.470
judgments on pictures?
We find that some regions don't care at

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.110
all about those conditions and other
regions show reliable responses, but

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:24.060
they're much weaker than those elicited by
the meaningful sentence condition. So

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.030
could it be that some of our language
regions are actually abstract semantic

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:32.350
regions? Perhaps. But for now, keep in
mind that the response to the sentence

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.340
meaning condition is twice stronger and it
is also possible that participants maybe

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.300
activating linguistic representations to
some extent when they encounter meaningful

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.360
visual stimuli. So to answer this question
more definitive, we are turning to the

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.540
patient evidence again. If parts of the
language system are critical for

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.950
processing meaning in non-linguistic
representations, then aphasic individuals

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.760
should have some difficulties with
non-verbal semantics. First, I want to

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:03.110
share a quote with you from Tom Lubbock, a
former art critic at The Independent, who

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.260
developed a tumor in the left temporal
lobe which eventually killed him.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.550
And as the tumor progressed and he was
losing his linguistic abilities he was

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:16.910
documenting his impressions of what it
feels like to lose the capacity to express

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:22.050
yourself using verbal means. So he wrote,
"My language to describe things in the

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.170
world is very small, limited. My thoughts
when I look at the world are vast,

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.050
limitless and normal, same as they ever
were. My experience of the world is not

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.240
made less by lack of language but is
essentially unchanged. " And I think this

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.010
quote quite powerfully highlights the
separability of language and thought. So

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.870
in work that I'm currently collaborating
on with Rosemary Varley and Nancy

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.920
Kanwisher, we are evaluating the global
aphasic's performance on a wide range of

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:54.050
tasks requiring you to process meaning in
a non-verbal stimuli. So for example, can

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.480
they distinguish between real objects and
novel objects that are matched for low

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:03.190
level visual properties? Can they make
plausibility judgments for visual events?

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:09.210
What about events were plausibility is
conveyed simply by prototypicality of the

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:14.350
roles? So you can't do this task by simply
inferring that a watering can doesn't

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.130
appear next to an egg very frequently,
right. And it seems like the data so far

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:24.730
are suggesting that they indeed seem fine
on all of these tasks and they laugh just

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.130
like we do when we see these pictures
because they are sometimes a little funny,

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:34.670
so they seem to process these just fine.
So this suggests to me that these kinds of

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.390
tasks can be performed without a
functioning language system. And so, even

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.850
if our language system stores some
abstract conceptual knowledge in some

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.700
parts of it, it tells me at least that
that code must live somewhere else as

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.120
well. So even though if we lose our
linguistic way to encode this information,

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.460
we can have access to it elsewhere.
So to conclude this part, fMRI and patient

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.910
studies converge and suggest that the
frontal temporal language system is not

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.540
engaged in and is not needed for
non-linguistic cognition. Instead, it

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.090
appears that these regions are highly
specialized for interpreting and

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.990
generating linguistic signals. So just a
couple minutes on what this means. So

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.830
given this highly selective response to
language stimuli that we observe, can we

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:21.320
make some guesses already about what these
regions actually do? I think so. I think a

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.080
plausible hypothesis is that this network
houses our linguistic knowledge, including

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.840
our knowledge of the sounds of the
language, the words, the constraints on

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.950
how sounds and words combine with one
another. And then essentially the process

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.530
of language interpretation is finding
matches between the pieces of the input

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.840
that are getting in to our language system
and our previously stored representations.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:45.340
And language production is just selecting
the relevant subset of the representations

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.970
to then convey to our communication
partner. And this-- And in the form that

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.300
this knowledge takes is a huge question in
linguistic psychology in neuroscience, so

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.450
one result I don't have time to discuss is
that contra some claims,

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.030
it doesn't seemed to be the case of
syntactic processing is localized to a

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.110
particular part of this language system.
It seems it's widely distributed across

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.530
and anywhere throughout the system you
find sensitivity to both word level

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.990
meanings and compositional aspects of
language which is much in line with Ulcher

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.580
and linguistic theorizing which doesn't
draw a sharp boundary between the lexicon

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.720
and grammar. So this way of thinking about
the language system as a store of our

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.200
language knowledge, makes it pretty clear
that the system is probably not innate. In

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:33.280
fact, it must arise via experience with
language as we accumulate this language

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.060
store. It's also presumably dynamic,
changing all the time as we get more and

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.820
more linguistic input through our
lifetimes. And I assume that our language

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.930
knowledge is plausibly acquired with
domain-general statistical learning

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:51.840
mechanisms just like much other knowledge.
So what changed in our brains that allowed

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:58.630
for the emergence of this system? So one
thing that changed is that our association

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.040
cortices expanded, so these are regions
that are not sensory and motor regions and

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.600
include frontal temporal and parietal
regions. Okay, so these people have noted

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.410
for a long time. And I think I'm kind of
in the camp of people who think that our

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.090
brains are not categorically different in
any way they're just scaled up versions of

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.300
other primate brains, I think there's
quite good evidence for that. And so, how

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.970
does the system emerge? So I think one
thing that was different between us and

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:30.930
chimps is that there is a protracted
course to the brain development in humans.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:35.500
So between birth and adulthood our brains
increase threefold compared to just

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.450
twofold in chimps it's a big difference.
And basically this just makes us

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:44.030
exceptionally susceptible to environmental
influences and we can soak stuff up for

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.890
the environment very very easily. So as
our brains grow we make more glial cells,

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.590
we make more synapses our axioms continue
to grow and become melanated and it's

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:58.010
basically tissue that's ready to soak up
the regularity that we see in the world.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.970
And of course, it comes at a cost that's
why we have totally useless babies that

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:06.600
can't do anything. But apparently somehow
it was worth-- the trade-offs were worth

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.000
it.
Okay, so the conclusions. As you know, we

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.800
have this system, it's highly selective in
its reposes. It presumably emerges over

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.320
the course of our development and what
enabled it is probably some combination of

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.630
the expansion of this association cortices
where we can store vast amounts of

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.360
symbolic information and this protracted
brain development which makes us great

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.047
learners early on. Thank you.
