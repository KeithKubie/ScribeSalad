00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington DC.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.530 position:64%
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone, my name is Kathy
[inaudible] from the Library of Congress.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.230 position:72%
Thank you for joining us today, we are pleased

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.330 position:58%
to be piloting a new outreach
endeavor for the Library of Congress.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.500 position:58%
Using webinars to convene subject
matter experts with you our audience.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.940 position:72%
This five part series will focus on our latest
exhibition entitled Echoes of The Great War

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.280 position:64%
with American Experiences of World War 1.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.420 position:67%
Cheryl if you would go down one screen, I
want to go through some housekeeping items.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.520
Once the session begins you'll
hear the presenter.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.480 position:70%
You will be able to communicate via chat and
we look forward to your active participation.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.600 position:64%
The session will be recorded and posted
to the library's website within the week.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.880
And this program will last
approximately 30 minutes with time

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880 position:58%
for questions and answers at the end.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.930 position:66%
So a little bit about our program, Cheryl
if I can have you go down one more screen.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.780 position:69%
Thousands of visitors to the library over
the last three months have taken a deep dive

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.790 position:63%
into the library's World War 1 resources
by attending a gallery [inaudible].

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.590
With this presentation by a library
specialist about the expedition.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.810 position:67%
Today's session is an overview to that
exhibition and our speaker is Cheryl Regan.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.570
Cheryl examined the making of the
library's World War 1 expedition

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.190 position:59%
and provides highlights from the show.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.900 position:70%
Cheryl Regan is a senior exhibition
director in the interpretive programs office.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.690
This is the office that started
the developing the Library

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.730 position:72%
of Congress's exhibition and related programs.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.090 position:75%
In her 25 years with the library she's developed
becoming exhibitions including those examining

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.700
the life and work of Sigmund Freud,
Lewis and Clark and 100 years

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.440
of western exploration and
many many more exhibitions.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.750
So without further ado I would
like to hand things over to Cheryl.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.680
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone and thank you
for joining us on this webinar.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.740
Just a word before we begin, about
this exhibition in particular,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.350 position:59%
I just want to talk a little bit about
exhibits at the Library of Congress.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.120 position:70%
We aim to develop and produce exhibitions
that showcase the holdings of the institution

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.770
and at the heart of every
exhibition is the firm commitment

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.810 position:69%
to show the visiting public what the
nations library holds and what it preserves.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.860 position:72%
The scale and approach can vary significantly,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.400
small displays can be drawn
from specific collections.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.630
But we also do big sweeping,
somatic or historical surveys

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.940 position:61%
and that's what we'll talk about today.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.860 position:69%
I hope that visitors leave here feeling
that they have made some personal connection

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.940
to what they have, to something
they have seen on view

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.780
and understand the importance
of preserving the past.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.930 position:59%
So I'm going to play just a brief clip
that was made inside the exhibition

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.660 position:63%
so that you have a sense of the grandeur
of the space and where the exhibition

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.970 position:66%
and what it specifically looks like if you
are unable to make it to Washington DC.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:48.740 position:70%
So at this point we opened on April 4th, 2017
and approximately 355,000 people have come

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.910 position:58%
through the doors to this exhibition.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.440 position:59%
It's on the 2nd floor of the Thomas
Jefferson building historic structure.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.120 position:70%
Its space is approximately 3,600 square feet.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.870
And it's important for me to
convey to you today is the breadth

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.530 position:72%
of the collections of the Library of Congress.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:25.450 position:61%
So we have posters, newspapers, we have
maps, we have photographs, sheet music.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.360 position:64%
These newspaper headlines, diaries,
documents that people that are well known

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.380
to you have written and those that
you would have never heard of.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.830 position:67%
And that's important I think in the sort
of historical sweep and it's also important

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.490 position:63%
for this exhibition because we literally
have the largest collection of material

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.950 position:58%
that is related to World War 1 and
the American experience in the world.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.310 position:59%
So when I'm talking about a collection
here I'm talking about collections

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.050
and those collections number
in the hundreds of thousands.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.550
Going back to the slides.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.790 position:64%
I will just move on to the next one here.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.820 position:61%
So you know there are things that we
think about with this every exhibition,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.080 position:66%
we assess our audience, what do they know.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.940 position:66%
In this case what do they know about World
War 1 and we know that audiences know,

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.950
especially in this country know
very little about World War 1.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.750 position:75%
They know some key events, they know it was bad,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.410
but they don't really know, you
know sort of the full scope.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:50.000 position:66%
The volume of material in this collection,
how do you decide what you show?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.030 position:58%
And it's important to display a
variety of media here at the library,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.000 position:66%
people don't know exactly what the Library
of Congress is, it's the nation library.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.100 position:73%
And it's more than a repository of books and so
the exhibits gives us a chance to examine that

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.230 position:56%
and to show the visiting public what
it is that we, what we do collect.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:23.500 position:67%
And the primary messaging, do the materials
on display really speak for themselves?

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.430
Do they speak to the message that
we want to convey about this war

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:37.630 position:63%
and this upheaval was important to the
American public in how we dealt with it.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:48.380 position:59%
So you could see that the space, 3,600
square feet sounds like a lot but,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.350
really when you're putting
together an exhibition you have

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.210
to think about the physical space.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.910 position:59%
And in our case we can't attach to the
walls, we can't attach to the ceiling,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.340
we can't drill into the floor,
it's a hard accoustic space meaning

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.170
that it's a marble space.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.180
And so the exhibit is divided
into four sections.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.710
It's framed by a prolog and a
epilog at the beginning and end.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:20.260 position:63%
But the two main rooms of the exhibition
you can see in the center of this plan.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.880
Which looks, is looking sort
of down on the exhibit space.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.350
And one of the things that we
knew that we wanted to do was

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.680 position:59%
to frame the exhibit with a time-line.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.840 position:58%
We get into the war as United States,
you know close to the end really.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.660 position:67%
We're only fighting in the last six months.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:51.550 position:59%
We don't enter the war, which starts
in 1914 but we don't enter until 1917.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:59.430 position:72%
And so a timeline with historical events
frames the exhibition and gives people a sense

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.490
of what was happening in the war
before the United States enters.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:11.750 position:72%
But the visual impact of the timeline is using
newspaper collection that was assembled here

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.490
or was assembled and is here, so
it's a 400 volumes of newspapers

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:25.350 position:64%
that document every single day of the war
from beginning to end starting in 1914.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:31.590 position:72%
And so we see better headlines that they would
have seen in the United States at the time.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.750
So it's, I liken it to the
Twitter feed of the era

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.170 position:75%
because this is information people were getting.

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:46.430 position:75%
And it adds in the immediacy to the war, I think
that you wouldn't really get any other way.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.350 position:70%
And so this is again a timeline on both sides

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:56.090
of the exhibition aisles
that's framed the exhibition.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.380 position:72%
And we begin with the section arguing over war

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:09.370
which again is essentially
a prolog to the exhibition.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:16.560 position:69%
The debates that was by no means clear that
everyone thought we should get into the war.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.520
So it was debated back and forth.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:26.740 position:72%
But there are touchstones that people do know,
they know about the sinking of the Lusitania

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:36.070 position:66%
and this poster enlist which was issued in
1915 didn't any other word except enlist.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:41.890 position:67%
You know we're not in the war at this point
but they want people to enlist overseas

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:47.340 position:59%
because of the horror of the Lusitania
when so many lost their lives.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:55.280 position:56%
We pair that with a newspaper, again
these banner headlines are amazing

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.350 position:67%
and really come into their own in this era.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.000
And we can see what people
were learning at the time,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.050 position:69%
the newspapers were issued many times a day,

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:12.830 position:59%
so that news as it was breaking people
were getting different headlines.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:19.910
This in itself did not can tell
us showing the war as belligerent,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:27.720 position:73%
although many people were volunteering to fight
overseas and engaging in humanitarian efforts.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:34.780
This is 1915 and again we
would not join until 1917.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:42.240
But when we do join it's really
full boar and the primary sections

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.940 position:69%
of the exhibit are over here and over there.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:57.060 position:67%
And over here which probably if we had
more space would be a larger space than the

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.900 position:73%
over there section because of the amount of
material we have about the mobilization of war.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.870
Talks about that and the
government agencies that sought

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.900 position:66%
to shape public opinion, private industry.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:15.770 position:58%
What was happening with labor unions
as they geared up for war production.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:22.640 position:56%
Home front volunteerism which serves
to unprecedented hype and bond drive

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.840
that were used to finance the war.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:34.510 position:75%
Ramping up for war, we had a very small standing
army before we entered the war and the ramp

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:44.700 position:70%
up was incredible, we were drafting forces
that would eventually number in the millions.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:52.530
This was a turbulent time for
this country domestically,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:59.250 position:59%
issues of the era will be
surprisingly familiar to people coming

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.470 position:67%
to visit the exhibition on site and online.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.120 position:75%
Americanization, we were a nation of immigrants.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:13.410 position:59%
In fact in 1917 one out of every
three citizens either was foreign born

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.820 position:59%
or had a parent that was foreign born.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:22.400 position:72%
Nearly 1/5th of the Army had been born abroad,
this is, this is a pamphlet that was issued

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.010 position:63%
by the Committee for Public Information,
the propaganda on the US government.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:33.950
And it was issued many many
languages and demonstrates clearly,

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:43.660 position:69%
you know that we were a nation of immigrants
this publication was in German, Spanish.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:49.420
In the next rotation of the exhibit
we'll have Italian, Portuguese,

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:55.940
I'm still trying to locate Swedish
in the general collection but,

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:02.180
again speaks very clearly
to the immigrant experience.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.440 position:64%
Censorship and surveillance, this was the
time that The Espionage Act was passed

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.990 position:58%
in 1917 and The Sedition Act in 1918.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:17.910 position:63%
It's the time of government surveillance
but also grass roots surveillance.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:24.300 position:75%
There was no centralized intelligence
gathering mechanisms, so the government depended

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:30.070
on the vigilance and in some
cases vigilantism of its citizens.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:36.480 position:72%
This is a photograph that was taken in Baraboo
Wisconsin and it's documenting the burning

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:45.620 position:59%
of German textbooks, high school
textbooks in the middle of the street.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.150
Women. During the war stepped
into roles that men had occupied.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:56.860 position:72%
And as they were, men were deploying overseas
they were taking jobs in the emissions factory

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:05.010 position:59%
and other types of factories and as
in the field, as agricultural workers.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.060
It was also a time of civil unrest.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.070 position:75%
This is still the period of the great migration.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:19.270 position:75%
African Americans served in record numbers in
what was originally, rigidly segregated military

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:24.830
and they experienced discrimination
and racial violence.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:31.460 position:61%
And there was racial violence as, as
people moved from the south taking jobs

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.590 position:72%
that again were vacated by soldiers deploying.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:44.610 position:73%
And this is the silent protests document of
photographs, documenting a parade that happened

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:51.100
in New York as a result of
the riots in East St. Louis.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:58.300 position:75%
So in the exhibition and actually in its online
component you can see not only these photographs

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:05.660 position:56%
but instructions from the NAACP, you
know issuing instructions to let,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:16.930 position:72%
to let participants know what to expect and
how to conduct themselves during this protest.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:24.760 position:69%
The other primary section is over there, you
can see we have this love of the word over

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.180 position:64%
and have used it throughout this exhibit.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.300
Over there looks at this great war
which it was termed at the time,

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:39.840 position:69%
great meaning vast and incredibly expansive.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.560 position:58%
The war was the first large scale
military struggle fought among highly

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.360
industrialized countries.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:54.910 position:73%
Mass production capabilities, networks of
railroads, new rapid firing weapons contributed

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.680 position:72%
to the deadlock on the European's front lines.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:04.770 position:67%
But it in comparison to the other nations
engaged in three years of grueling warfare.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.240
The United States faced combat
mostly during the last six months.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.850 position:73%
But we focused again on the American experience

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.780
because that's the story we can
best tell it in this exhibition.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.030 position:59%
And we devote a case in the exhibition

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:27.660
and considerable material to
moving the US Army overseas.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:36.500 position:66%
This was a massive effort, you know moving
two million men across, across the ocean.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.570
And it was really something
that had never been done before.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:48.810
This exhibition has given us the
opportunity to showcase the Library

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.590 position:56%
of Congress veteran history project.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:58.440 position:59%
An incredible project that the library
has undertaken for a number of years

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.620 position:56%
and they collect and preserve and
make accessible to personal accounts

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.780 position:67%
of American war veterans so that future
generations may hear directly from veterans

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.560 position:67%
and better understand the reality's of war.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.880
They begin their collections
with World War 1 and move

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.590
up into the present conflict,
conflicts that are going on.

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:29.580
But, they have approximately
1,000 collections as related

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.550 position:66%
to World War 1 and that number is growing.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:42.270 position:56%
So this is Vincent Cornelius Reed
we have his diary in the exhibition.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:49.040 position:58%
Another diary is the Veterans History
Project is Irving Greenwald's diary.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.760
He was a printer from New
York and drafted into service.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:00.930 position:70%
And private Greenwald really has captured our
imaginations and our hearts with his diary,

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:07.000 position:56%
which chronicles his experience from
the day of deployment to training,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:16.300 position:59%
to being on the front lines and he was

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.460
in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive
and suffered injuries there.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:25.300
So this is really the beginning
of that campaign,

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:31.880 position:70%
which was the deadliest battle in US history.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:39.150 position:73%
And the diaries really heart stopping because
you see at the end of September the pages start

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.760
to be blank, so what happens
to Private Greenwald.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:51.440 position:64%
He picks up again when he is in the
hospital recuperating in October of 1918.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.200
Close to the end of the war.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:04.930 position:69%
As I mentioned earlier there are names you
would completely recognize in the exhibition

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:11.950 position:58%
and so giving people touchstones of
what they recognize and the surprises

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.190
for what they don't recognize
and what they can learn

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.830
in the exhibit is something
we always strive to do.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:24.580 position:63%
But George Patton was a figure in this
war and lieutenant colonel at this time,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.330 position:66%
so we have his papers here at the library.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:32.410
And feature his diary, again
in the Meuse-Argonne campaign.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:38.840 position:63%
And then the names you don't know,
Dorothy Kitchen O'Neal was a hut worker.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:47.080 position:70%
And actually very helpfully she, she
identifies herself here in her own scrapbook.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.420 position:56%
There you can see that she's named
herself Dorothy Kitchen at the time.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:20:03.540 position:75%
A hut worker was, worked in entertainment and
recreation, these workers helped boast the moral

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.050 position:61%
of recovering patients in the hospital.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.580
And she was stationed in France.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:17.380 position:72%
Her letters home are amazing though she
contracts the Spanish Flu on the ship overseas

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:25.220 position:61%
and her, fellow nurses, nurses that
she's knows actually die on board ship.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:31.550
She recovers, but she again her
letters home are wonderful and sort

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:36.700
of describe what's happening
in the camps and in the wards.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:43.220 position:63%
I slipped this slide in here because
music was incredibly important and media

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.330 position:73%
in general incredibly important during the war.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.310
This was the last singing war.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.560 position:69%
This is before the advent of broadcast radio

00:20:52.560 --> 00:21:02.460 position:59%
and probably no other song captures
the spirit of the war like over there.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:11.300 position:63%
And the sheet music covers are wonderful
in this exhibition, as are the posters.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.150
Again going back to an immigrant
population where a lot

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.280 position:72%
of people could not read and write in English.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:28.830 position:69%
The visual was so important and conveyed
messages that, you know bolstered patriotism

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:36.000
and participation in a way that
only, only the visual could do.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.380
And so you see that in sheet
music covers and posters,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:47.610 position:75%
pamphlets across the board during the war years.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:54.560
And also footage which we include
a lot of in documentary footage,

00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.080 position:56%
news reel footage that would've been
shown in movie theaters at the time.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:09.300 position:64%
Also training footage that would have
been shown to soldiers preparing for war.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:17.260 position:66%
The exhibition closes with the section
World Overturned, there it is again, over.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:26.800 position:75%
The last section really asks questions, you know
what was the impact of we owe those veterans?

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:32.480
These questions will be addressed
in upcoming webinars in more depth.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:39.800 position:61%
But I do want to make the point that in
the current rotation and the exhibition

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:45.210 position:58%
because it is up until January 2019
and we are a paper repository we have

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:50.250
to rotate materials in and
out of the exhibition.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:55.530
That by the time exhibition closes,
600 items will have been on view

00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:01.740 position:63%
and we will put those materials and add
them to what is already existing online.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:09.850 position:69%
So you can see the full exhibition really
online, you will be able to access the films

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:17.870 position:70%
that are on exhibit, the impact film, again
with the scholars discussing different issues

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.850 position:70%
about how the war effected the United States.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:27.040
The timeline and exhibition
programing that's coming up,

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:37.920 position:69%
we have a wonderful program that's coming up
in November of this year for Veterans Day.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.260
And I am going to .

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.580 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Actually Cheryl we'll hold off on that slide.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:48.820
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.160 position:58%
&gt;&gt; Do that at the end of the program.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.860 position:61%
Thank you for an unbelievable whirlwind
tour of online of the exhibition.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.470
We had some brief questions came in

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.890 position:56%
and your colleague Naomi has been
answering some of them through text.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.490
But some that I want to bring
up to the forefront.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:08.700
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:14.510 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Matthew, Matthew asked the question
is the character writing on the.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:20.060
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:27.190 position:67%
&gt;&gt; It is. It is in fact we have that poster
in three iterations, one in Portuguese,

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:30.000
one in Chinese and one in English.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.730 position:66%
So Portuguese will make the next rotation.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:40.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.780 position:63%
That you may have and we'll get to them.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.510
Get them quickly as we can.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:51.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.530 position:61%
Kylie asks a question about newspapers.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:59.510 position:66%
And do we have newspapers that talk about
the Black Tom explosion in the collection.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:07.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.520 position:64%
&gt;&gt; I can in fact I have a colleague that
was very interested in that in particular

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.180 position:73%
because she comes from that area in New Jersey.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:25.510
We looked in the, I mentioned when
were talking about the timeline

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:32.810 position:70%
about this 400 volume collection that we have
where we, we've combed through it to look

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:40.600 position:69%
for newspaper headlines and she
illustrates events that are on the timeline.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:46.470 position:70%
And in fact the Black Tom explosion is one of
the events on our timeline and you can look

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.200 position:63%
at that on this timeline online as well.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.650
And so we were looking for
the big banner headlines

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:59.280 position:59%
because primarily the 400 volumes are
draw specifically from New York papers

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.040
and we thought this would be
big news in New York and it was,

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.140
it was but we didn't find you know
it was on like page four and five.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.630 position:59%
So that was the surprising thing
about looking through this collection.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:17.240 position:56%
Which was assembled Auto Spangler
for the New York Historical Society,

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:24.500 position:70%
so this is a one of kind assembly of
newspapers that are being digitized right now

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:32.500 position:64%
and will be added to chronicling America
before the exhibition comes down in 2019,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.540
hopefully by fall of 2018 they
may be digitized and online.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:43.490
But again a tremendous resource and
I think that the eye opening thing,

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:50.520 position:66%
looking through for particular events is
that this is what people knew at the time.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:57.330 position:58%
And so this isn't looking sort of
back with hindsight and saying ah yes

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.870 position:70%
so many people perished from the Spanish Flu.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.460 position:66%
There would be little pockets of, you
know describing what happened in this town

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.580 position:72%
or that town or in this camp or that camp, but
there wasn't sort of this big banner headline,

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:18.120 position:56%
millions die which you know, I think
I was naively expecting to happen.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.220
&gt;&gt; That's okay thank you for that.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:28.130 position:72%
A question came in from Janet and Naomi
answered it by pointing her to ask a librarian

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:36.310 position:66%
and so I'm going to take control for a
second just so I can show our audience how

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:42.470 position:64%
to get access to some of the answers that
they have in regards to the collection.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:47.590 position:75%
So bare with me one second while I bring up the,

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.380
Cheryl do you see my Library
of Congress homepage?

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.170
&gt;&gt; I do.

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.090
&gt;&gt; Terrific.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:58.310 position:70%
So for our audience I just want to point out
I went to the top navigation and I get a drop

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:04.990 position:75%
down menu, there is an option to ask a librarian
and verily you can get to ask a librarian

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:09.560 position:63%
from every page of the library's
website and you field through you'll see

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.190
at the top here in ask a librarian.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.910 position:66%
And you can get answers to specific topics

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:20.460
and services related specifically
through ask a librarian.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.750
So we do ask that if you have
a very topic specific question

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.490 position:61%
that we use the ask the librarian form.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:34.540 position:56%
The expectation is that you will get
a reply back in five business days.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.550
And then we also had a question
come in about how

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.620 position:73%
to access materials from the library's website.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:47.260
There is a [inaudible] of
resources available at loc.gov.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:54.790 position:75%
We have programs that we have conducted with our
[inaudible] about how to access specific formats

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:59.750
in relation to the collection and
I'll make sure that I get a link

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.590 position:59%
out to you before we end this program.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.730 position:70%
But you can do all sorts of kinds of research

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.610
through the digitized collections
of the library's website.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:14.510 position:66%
So I just want to point out not everything
that the library has is digitized

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:19.870 position:59%
and not everything is freely available
given constraints to copyright.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.590
But there are many of these listed.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:27.000 position:66%
The benefit of these kind of programs
that Cheryl can walk us through in talking

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.280 position:61%
about something that shows contents
with specifics and focus on exhibitions

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:37.290 position:61%
that we definitely need a deeper dive
in terms of the World War 1 collection.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:44.720 position:58%
So I am bringing up, there is a World
War 1 web page, it is a topic page

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.910
and you'll find a lot of resources.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.900
There was a question that
also came in about the,

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:56.460
the veteran history project
and access to the diaries.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:02.070
We do have a program coming up
with the veterans history project.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:06.580 position:58%
That's our next episode with the
September 25th, it's called over here

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.240 position:72%
over there [inaudible] veteran of World War 1.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.680
So we do invite you to go ahead and
[inaudible] that kind of program.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:23.980
So I am going to turn the
presentation back over to Cheryl.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:30.570 position:75%
If you would go under share Cheryl and collect
your PowerPoint's then we'll bring that back up.

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:33.260
&gt;&gt; Okay. I hope.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.850
&gt;&gt; You can do it.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.570
&gt;&gt; Application.

&gt;&gt; Go up to share you see

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.360 position:63%
Go to application and select PowerPoint.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.100
&gt;&gt; Naomi's here to save the day.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.200
&gt;&gt; Terrific, thank you very much.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:02.770 position:72%
So while she's pulling that together I do want
to get you some of the links that I promised

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:06.920
for what future upcoming webinars.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:13.560 position:75%
I have just added the links to that, in addition
to the September 25th over here over there,

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.130 position:73%
we have in October Woodrow Wilson's [inaudible]

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.650
which will become our presenter
from our manuscript division.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:30.510 position:69%
And then in November, on November 28th we'll
have somebody from our printing photographs.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:45.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.780 position:73%
And you guys are waiting for me to give you the
presenter back why it didn't work okay sorry

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.090
about that.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.630 position:64%
So now you should be able to go to share.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:32:01.250
So, let's see here, I'm just
going to get caught up.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:05.890 position:70%
So we have time for about two more questions.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:11.750
Let me see what happened
while I was sharing my screen.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.330
&gt;&gt; Can I add something.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah please do.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:31.200 position:75%
&gt;&gt; So the, we're the largest library in the
world and what happens with exhibits and I think

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.040 position:66%
that Cathy you really hit, the nail on the
head when you said that it was a deep dive

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.200
and gives you sort of this
curated look at a particular topic

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.480 position:56%
and that's why these big exhibitions
are so important to the institution.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.870 position:66%
But they also have grown the
collections two, two collections have come

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:54.040 position:59%
in just as a result of the exhibition.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.100 position:61%
People didn't really understand sort of
what it is that we were collecting here

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.850 position:73%
and there was a collection that came to the
Veterans History Project which will be featured

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:10.060 position:75%
in the next rotation of the exhibition, a really
wonderful collection, the Sumner Collection

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:18.600 position:73%
and then we just received from a generous donor
a collection of African American soldiers,

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:27.680 position:75%
images on postcards that you could, the soldiers
would contact with going to a photo studio

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.500
and get a small packet of
post cards to send home.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:37.550 position:67%
And so this was really, this was a key part
of the collection that or a key component

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:42.980 position:69%
that seemed to be missing in our collection,
these images of African American soldiers.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.180
So I'm hoping that there are
more collections that come

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.190 position:70%
to the library as a result of the exhibition.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:05.660
Hello.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.050
&gt;&gt; Okay I was speaking with
my microphone muted apologies.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:14.190 position:70%
We have another question that came in from JK

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:20.390 position:67%
and the question asked had the US entered
the war earlier would it have been possible

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:26.660 position:73%
that the other allied nations that have been
more willing to agree to [inaudible] 14 points.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:35.250 position:67%
&gt;&gt; That is a great question and I urge
this participant to tune in on October 24th

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:42.930 position:69%
to Sahr Conway-Lanz's talk on Woodrow
Wilson because I can't, I can't answer that.

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:48.760 position:59%
But he is the custodian of the Woodrow
Wilson papers here at the library

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.950
and one of the curators and his
[inaudible] for the exhibition.

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:58.050
And he has been doing a lot of
thinking about Wilson's 14 points

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:03.320 position:70%
and you know how and when we entered the war.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.570 position:66%
So October 24th, sign up for that webinar.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.860
