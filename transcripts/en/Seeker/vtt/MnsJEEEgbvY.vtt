00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.410
Gold fever wasn't just
a thing from DuckTales

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.830
or the California Gold Rush.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.380
It's real, and it's
still happening.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.960
Howdy, gold diggers.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.460
Trace here.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.320
Thanks for watching DNews today.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.121
Discovery's upcoming
new series Klondike

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.620
tells the story of
the men and women

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.300
who risked their lives to
strike gold in the Yukon.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.190
But gold isn't just used to make
coins and build governments.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.400
Gold resists corrosion.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.280
It's highly conductive,
and it's highly malleable.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.390
If I took pure gold, a
hammer, and an anvil,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.430
I could probably make gold leaf.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.920
It would feel like cloth,
but it would be gold.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.040
You'll also see
it, um, in space.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.860
Gold's reflective properties
and ability to be super thin

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.450
make it ideal to send
to space for protection

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.680
from the sun and the harsh
environment out there.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.630
The Hubble Telescope
contains layers of gold

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.920
to keep it from corroding.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.950
Photos of the astronauts
during spacewalks

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.700
have gold visors designed
to reflect cosmic rays.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.910
On the ground,
they use gold leaf

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.450
to cover the windows of
Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.080
because it reflects
light and heat

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.660
so well that it lowers
their cooling bills.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.519
Plus, you know, bling.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.750
Gold is biocompatible, so
you can actually eat it.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.340
My first shot in college
had gold flakes in it.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.840
It was really gross.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.720
Gold is used in
nanotechnology, because it

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.370
resits bacteria and
the body's defenses.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.530
At an atomic level, gold
isn't actually gold in color.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.620
It can be crimson or
light blue, and it

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.040
has predictable reactions
with certain proteins.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.350
Gold is already used
to detect cancer cells,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260
but a study in Proceedings
of the National

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.580
Academy of Sciences found if you
mix gold nanoparticles with tea

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.360
and then drink it,
the particles of each

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.750
combine and latch onto and
attack prostate cancer.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.980
What the what?

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.650
It's not just nanomedicine.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.520
Pure gold attached to the
underside of the eyelid

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.790
will ease problems with people
who have facial paralysis.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.640
The weight of the
gold is a big help.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.070
Plus, when injected into joints,
pure gold can ease arthritis.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.730
But we have no idea
why that works.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.190
The University of
Washington says

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.930
injected gold can reduce
swelling, damage, stiffness,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.100
and pain.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.770
Gold also protects
the air we breathe.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.539
If you own a car
purchased after 1975,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.570
it probably has a
catalytic converter.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.060
They're designed to convert
noxious gases into, well, less

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.220
noxious gases.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.350
In 2011, a partnership
with NASA and a company

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.450
called Nanostellar reduced
emissions by one fifth

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.220
by using gold in the
catalytic converters.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.540
Most cars use even
more expensive metals

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.940
in the converter, like
platinum, so this is a big step.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.330
This wonder material
detects and fights cancer.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.450
It protect astronauts
and satellites.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.310
It cleans the air.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.680
It eases arthritis.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.840
But it also brings you DNews.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.000
Gold is used to make
electronics better.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.100
Much like gold leaf, you
can stretch pure gold

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.290
into strands 10 to
200 microns thick.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.770
Microns!

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.040
Those strands are
used to bond materials

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.390
inside computer chips.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.540
That's small, you guys.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.300
It's used on the macro level to
protect conductors like copper

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.860
or silver from corrosion,
which is why those HDMI

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.300
cables that you can get
are super expensive.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.360
And that's stupid.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.730
Ugh, I buy the
cheap ones for $2.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.740
No difference-- unless my
TV was in space, maybe.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.930
This precious material
is so damn useful.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.720
Maybe the Gold Rush
was all worth it.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.200
You can watch the drama unfold
and decide for yourself.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.070
Klondike premieres this Monday,
January 20, at 9:00 PM Eastern,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.340
8:00 Central, on Discovery.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.590
Can you think of some
innovative new ways to use gold?

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.960
Tell us some stuff
from your brains

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.030
below in the comments, and
thanks a lot for watching,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.610
everybody.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.770
Stay classy, internet.
