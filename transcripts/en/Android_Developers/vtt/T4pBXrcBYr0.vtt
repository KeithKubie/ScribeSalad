&gt;&gt; GEMAN (ph): Hi. I’m Geman (ph), Interaction
Design on Android. And today, I’m going

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.910
to talk to you about my favorite Android feature.
Let me show how easy it is to switch applications.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.940
So for example, I might have to look something
up and maps while I’m answering an email,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.920
and I can just switch here without worrying
whether or not I quit the previous applications

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.610
or whether or not I still have enough memory
left. So, it gives me the power of a laptop

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.750
without the social awkwardness.
