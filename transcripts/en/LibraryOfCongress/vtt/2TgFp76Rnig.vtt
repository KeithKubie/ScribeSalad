&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.470
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening, everybody.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.000
Thank you so much for being
here at the next event

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.970
in our Video Discotheque Series,
which has already been a nice --

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.790
we've had a nice run of
events this week and actually

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.540
since April 12th was
when we started.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.320
I just wanted to let you know
about a couple of upcoming events

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.600
and then just a short
introduction about tonight's talk.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.730
We invite you to come
tomorrow at 12 p.m.,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.000
we have a Veterans History
Project talk at noon

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.300
in the Whittall Pavilion, that'll
be kind of a panel discussion.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.120
In the evening in this
same room is a screening

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.550
of House Party at seven o'clock.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.760
And then on Saturday we have a
Symposium that starts at one,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.350
and then we have the Gloria Gaynor
events that start in the evening.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.410
Now you may or may not have
tickets to those events,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.680
they sold out very quickly.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.880
If you don't have a ticket we do
have the possibility of getting in,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.170 position:56%
there will be a space-available line
that will start forming for each

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.770
of those events if you'd
like to still attend,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.520
and we'll try to get
everybody in that we can.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.990
Tonight I'm really pleased to
introduce Martin Scherzinger,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.570
he's a Professor of Media Culture

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.820
and Communications at
New York University.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.410
He's going to speak to us about
various issues of mathematics,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.840
of African dance rhythms.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.300
And one thing I wanted to
mention is what does this have

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.600
to do with Disco?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.160
One thing that we wanted to do
with some of these extra talks is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.430
to expand the context of what we're
talking about with different types

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.150
of dance musics and how they are
still relevant contemporaneously

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.770
and to Disco and to other cultures.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.740
So I'm really pleased
to introduce Martin.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.980
He's a fascinating person,
also a composer and performer,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.570
so it's great to welcome you.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.510
Thanks, Martin.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:09.510 --> 00:03:01.680
[ Music ]

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.980
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
Okay, hi, everybody.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.530
I'm going to let this roll visually
while I introduce the subject.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.810
What you have in front
of you is a performance,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.470
a reenactment from a scholar who is
doing some research in the region

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.400
from the upper Volta, and the dance

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.870
that you see is an ugbeckor
[Assumed Spelling] dance,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.890
which is traditionally
a war dance in Ghana.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.890
And I just want to talk a little
bit, just to introduce this,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.750
about how the rhythms that you hear
in the background are constructed.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.260
So we have a number of
different kinds of drums.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.720
We have a Kagan drum,
we have a Kidi drum,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.350
we have an atsemiru
[Assumed Spelling] drum,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.850
and as well as a gankogui,
which is the bell pattern

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.440
that you hear prominently.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.160
Just very briefly and
schematically all

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.930
of these rhythms are
a little more complex

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.890
than the way I'm going
to introduce them.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.810
They tend to be organized

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.640
in what Western people would
understand is different metrical

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.240
frameworks, okay?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.850
That means that the Kagan drum
would do something like this,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.570
and I'm just going to
ask you to take a look

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.500
up at the board if you can.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.530
You can think of this as a
short, long, short, long,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.830
short, long, short, long.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.130
So Kagan, Kagan, Kagan, Kagan.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.200
Sort of in sense organizing things
in threes, one, two, three, one,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.000
two three, one, two,
three, one, two, three.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.510
At least from the perspective
of a Western ear.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.420
A drum like Kidi would be doing
something like, dit, do, dit, dit,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:35.340
do, dit, do, which is
organized a bit more like, okay?

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.910
So something like that
before it repeats, right,

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.830
which is in the West says something
like that would be one, two, three,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.120
one, two, three, as opposed to one,
two, three, two, two, three, okay?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.410
So we layer these two different
drums more or less differently.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.460
Now again both patterns are
more complex in practice,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.780
but this is their signature sort
of placement in which they work.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.360
The bell pattern that you hear
is a very common bell pattern,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.700
a 12-8 bell pattern, which I'm just
going to play now in slow motion

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.200
so that you can hear that part of
the ensemble for special attention.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:20.240
[bells] It's a seven-stroke
bell pattern, one, two,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.410
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.730
It happens in a field or in what we
might call proct [Assumed Spelling]

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.800
time in a field of 12.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:41.260 position:56%
Subdivided as two plus two plus one,
two plus two plus two, plus one.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.800
Okay, so let me just
illustrate that this way, okay?

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.050
Um, bum, bum, ba, bum, bum, one,
two, one, two, one, one, two, one,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.110
two, one, two, one, one, two, one,
two, one, one, two, one, two, one,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.510
two, one, two, one, one,
that kind of thing, okay?

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.050
I want to just draw that one up
in notation to give you an example

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.370
of a striking, what we
might call a correlation

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.840
between an African practice and a
Western technical instrument, okay?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.650
We've got one, two, one, two,
one, one, two, one, two, one,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.160
two, one, two, one, okay?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.550
Everybody sort of get
the notation, right?

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.100
For those of you in the back
it's not crucial and try to work

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.050
with the ear, but visually
I put it this way

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.040
because what's striking
about it is two things.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.490
The first is that there's
two longs, a short,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.230 position:56%
then three longs and a short, right?

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.040
So there's something a little
asymmetric about this, right?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.430
In other words, when
you have a field of 12

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.960
and we have 12 pulses here.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.330
Why? Because we have that and then
there's a space, space, space.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.110
If I count up the dots
I get 12 micro pulses

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.900
against which seven are struck.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.780
So we have seven elements in a
field of 12, that's clock time

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.460
for which seven stand out
for special attention, okay?

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.330
The relationship of seven and
12, think of days of the week,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.130
think of the annual way
in which we organize time.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.580
This is something that is
contemplated a lot globally, okay?

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.550
But the thing that I want
to draw your attention to is

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.680
by being a little bit
asymmetrical we can sort

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.620
of split the pattern
into two halves.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.530
The first half, which is long,
long, short, and the second half,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.120
which has the three
longs and a short.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.610
In other words, the
boundaries happen

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.570
in a slightly asymmetrical
way, okay?

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.040
So with 12 you can multiply and
subdivide and so on into three

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.150
by four, four by three, six by two,
two by six, or which is important

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.560 position:56%
because it can do all those
things, but it can do another thing,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.510
which is common in African music
which is to say you take your 12,

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.490
you take your symmetry and then
you off center the symmetry by one.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.600
So you might call it N
minus one, N plus one.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.940
So if we've got 12, six plus
six, now we have six minus six,

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.140
six plus six, five
plus seven, right?

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.470
And if we count up the dots,
one, two, three, four, five,

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.180
and then one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven --

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.900
I should have put another dot
in here, ran out of paper --

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.040
we have exactly that structure.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.540
Now just something to
bear in mind here is

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.520
that this is not just a rhythmic
structure, but if you were

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.880
to put this into a pitch field,
in other words, A, B, C, D, E, F,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.120
like on a piano, we get
exactly the structure

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.530
of the modern piano, right?

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.870
Instead of long we have a
tone, so it's long, long,

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.530
short, long, long, long, short.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.860
We have a tone, tone,
half tone, half tone,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.510
tone, tone, tone, half tone.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.150
It's the white notes
on the piano, okay?

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.840 position:56%
If I were to fill in the green
notes, we'll confuse colors tonight,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.840
that is the black notes
on the piano, okay?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.580
Something to think about why?

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.220
Because the piano is designed in
such a way, in the 18th Century

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.520
when they sort of came

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.160 position:56%
to standardize the modern industrial
piano it's designed in such a way

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.050
that it's capable of
very easily modulating

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.550
from one pitch area
to another, okay?

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.100
So you can move from C major to,
say, G major with very little --

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.230
with tweaking the system
just a little bit.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.880
In time you can also
modulate from one place

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.950
to another place fairly easily, and
I'll explain that in more detail

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.800
as we get into this
lecture a little later.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.130
So that is an important sort of
feature and common characteristic

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.350
that it has as a mathematical
structure that incarnates

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.540
in African rhythmic practice
as a timeline pattern

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.260
and in Western practice as a
technical device for music making,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.630
which has been, you know,
had a great monopoly

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.830
of thinking and music in the West.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.490
Not an insignificant
instrument, the piano,

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.600
especially if we consider
its afterlife

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.930
in MIDI [Assumed Spelling],
which is a software

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.120
that basically incarnates the
assumptions of the piano into code.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.110 position:56%
Okay, so these are just some of the
features that I want you to remember

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.100
as we move on through this lecture.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.590
That we have here a sense
of staggered downbeats,

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.890
different rhythmic cycles

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.290
that we can say have a
different kind of downbeat.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:27.340 position:56%
We have the principle of N minus
one or N plus one, asymmetry, right?

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.150
And we have another
principle that I just want

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.950
to quickly draw your attention to,
which is that the rattle pattern,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.100 position:56%
the rattle player is doing something

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.270
that supplements the
gankogui in the following way.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.620
If your gankogui is doing this --
going to keep these pens nearby,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:49.310
I'll need them -- if your
gankogui is doing this, dum,

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.140
bum [beats] your upshashir
[Assumed Spelling] --

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.280
just using a [inaudible]
bottle here --

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.280
your upshashir player is
going to more or less for most

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.010
of the pattern inhabit the spaces

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.660
of what the gankogui
player has occupied.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.080
So if that is a space after the
beat, okay, so [beats] [rattle].

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:20.870
These are the black
notes of the piano, okay?

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:26.040 position:56%
One, two, one, two, three, one, two,
one, two, one, two, three, okay?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.050
One, two, one, two, three,
one, two, one, two, one,

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.800
two, one, two, three, okay?

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.620
I may have rushed a little
bit quickly through things

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.620
and I'll recap them again as we
move further into this lecture.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.430
But for now I want to jump to --

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.200
that was the northwestern
part of Africa --

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.190 position:56%
now I want to jump to the southeast.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.510
Take a look at this dance,
called Nyungwe, Mozambique.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:12:49.090
[ Music ]

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.480
Okay, very interesting piece
of music making, right?

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.140 position:56%
In South Africa before the days of
liberation, in the age of Apartheid,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.880
we used to say this was music
called for one man, one note.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.920
You had a set of pipes, maybe three
or four, with a different name

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.640
and you would play
one note at a time

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.110
in which other people would
play different notes, okay?

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.040
That particular piece is called
Uzungwa Gona [Assumed Spelling],

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.010
which means something
like White Man Sleeps,

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:23.030
and there's been an interesting
set of compositions based on it.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.580
This is an old transcription
from when I was still there,

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.080
so I apologize for
that, but what I want

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.940
to quickly do is show you how
this music is put together, okay?

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.610
Again, we're in Mozambique.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.020
The first part is called
korirambu [Assumed Spelling],

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.750
the second pakirakabambo
[Assumed Spelling],

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.050
and then enbitae [Assumed
Spelling], okay?

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.670
And the way this is put together is

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.960
that the first part
will sing something,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.980
blow something, and then breathe.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.730
So it's sing, blow, breathe, sing,
blow, breathe, sing, yahoo, yahoo,

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.540
yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.430
Okay, that's the first line,
yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo,

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.520
yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.370
The second part, pakira [Assumed
Spelling], yahoo, yahoo, yahoo,

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.510
yahoo, yahoo, yahoo,
yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.690 position:56%
And then kabambo [Assumed Spelling],
yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.420
yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.900
And enbitae, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo,
yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.300
Okay, for give my terrible
singing, but you get the point.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.590
So what happens here is that
what's interesting about this is

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.620 position:56%
if we design this in such a way that
we just call it that they sing, ya,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.280
and then this bland note fu, right?

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:44.110
And the second, the third
time point is a breath, okay?

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:50.170 position:56%
And we sort of line up our singing
and our blowing in that kind of way.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.890
We can say that korirambu
does this kind of thing,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.530
yafu, yafu, yafu, yafu, okay?

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.520
Pakira, you will notice,
starts with a breath, okay?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.990
Actually, you know what,
I'll keep it all in red.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:09.260
Starts with a breath and
then begins with a ya, okay?

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.070
So breath, ya, and so on.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:30.070
Okay, enbitae, down at the
bottom, begins with the fu.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.860
Et cetera, okay?

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.640
So again we have this notion
that each of them seems to start

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.430
at a different part of the
beat, that's on the first,

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.960
that would be on the second and
I put it in inverted commas,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.020
and this would be in some sense
on the third, two beats missing,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.180
and then on the third where
you start with your ya.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.920
Okay, what's fascinating
about that is that we've got

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.300
that same multi-metric situation.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.950
In other words, the down beat
for each performer would happen

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.780
at a different place, okay?

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.400
What's interesting musically is

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.670
that what you hear is not exactly
what's going on meteorically

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.020
because what comes to the
ear is a different thing,

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.830
it's a kind of phantom
baton that is designed

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.910
out of all the ya's being
put together, right?

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.980
So the ya gets thrown around
between different performers.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.440
So you're kind of going
ya, ha, ya, he, ha, ha,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.980
being thrown around two different
performers, and your flute part,

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.790
your pipes are doing the same thing
but within the spaces of that.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.630
Okay, so that's the first thing.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:41.040 position:56%
So you're generating melodies out of
this is the formic principle, right,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:47.970 position:56%
this is the zoetrope, where you spin
a photographic image fast enough

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.910
and the eye cannot not
see movement, right?

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.480
This is music of full
stops that becomes lines,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:58.330
but nobody is fully creating those
lines, they get passed around.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.600
This technique was used by various
composers in the '60s and '70s

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.850
when ethnographic recordings made
their way to the United States

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:08.340
and to Europe and very often
to great avant-garde effect.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.410 position:56%
Somebody like Luciano Bario [Assumed
Spelling] takes a very similar style

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.240
from horn music that was recorded
by Sinclair Arum [Assumed Spelling]

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.700
and rocks music in a heterophonic
style, which became very,

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.780
very interested -- people in
the West became very interested

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.190
in this and, in fact, philosophers
like Dulars [Assumed Spelling]

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.530
and Guatari [Assumed Spelling],

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.750
kind of left wing philosophers
thought this was a way

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:33.370
of organizing political life and
then that became a kind of metaphor

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.430
for organizing for political
life in many philosophies

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.360
and political philosophies to
follow, which is interesting,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.660
all the way up until today.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.500
It's kind of hidden genealogy
for this kind of thinking.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.770
How do you hold this
multi-metric situation together?

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.440
If I ask just this room to
go yafu, and we all start

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.970
at a different time we are really
not going to do a great job

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.590
and I can anticipate that.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:58.420
And the way you do it is to
organize your dance step in a way

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.470
that everybody is equally in
and not in on the beat, okay?

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.210 position:56%
So if it's going yafu, yafu, okay,
so one, two, three, one, two, three,

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.670
one, two, three, one, two, three,
one, two, three, one, two, three,

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.710
one, two, three, right, there's
three elements, yafu and breath.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:16.800
Your dance happens in four's, so
it's yafu, yafu, yafu, yafu, yafu,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.050
yafu, yafu, yafu, yafu,
yafu, yafu, yafu, okay?

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.400
You're on the beat and off the
beat at different times, right?

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.310
And because of that the beat floats
amongst the different performers

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.950
and is able to bring them all
to the same kind of place.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.820
Now as you saw from the actual
dance it's a lot more complicated

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.390
than that, but when you're
teaching a four year old

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.570
to get it right you make sure
that you're dancing in four's,

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.730
when the music is structured
in staggered three's.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.130
So everybody with me?

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.850
Okay, so that's more or less
another lesson we take away

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.670
because though the music sounds
very different it has some things

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:55.970
that are similar.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.270
What are the similar things?

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.370
Multiple entries, right?

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.790
Different metric downbeats,
if you like.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.140
Interlocking, which means be
in the spaces of each other

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.740
to create melodies
that float amongst you.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:14.010
In the case, remember the gankogui
upshashir in between the gankogui?

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.860
And the third principle, which
one might just call polyrhythm

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.690
because in a sense my feet are
moving in four's, one, two, three,

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.210
four, but this is moving in
three's even though the three's are

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.450
staggered, okay?

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.780 position:56%
So those are the three sort of
broadly speaking principles that I'd

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.280
like to introduce to you
to now before we change

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.510
to a completely different
time and place.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:54.040
[ Music ]

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.220
Okay, probably one of the most
famous samples in the history

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:02.040
of music or history of
popular music in America, okay?

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.930
The Amen Break, which was a
B-side tract called Amen Brother

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.230
by the Winston's.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.020
This is now 1969, this
was a short fragment

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.890
of what was called The Break, which
is when the music starts playing

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:18.490
and for moments the rhythm
is exposed and in the words

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.140
of Steinski the music takes
its coats off and you get down

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.810
and get funky and so
on and so forth, right?

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.300
That, in addition to James
Brown's Funky Drummer,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:35.460
was probably the most frequently
sampled music in the 1970s.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:40.610 position:56%
As I say, this particular moment
I'm going to try to tie back to some

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.080 position:56%
of these African principles, and
then I'm going to try to make a more

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.690
or less speculative argument
about how these things got here

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:53.180 position:56%
and what happened along the way, how
did we translate some of the values

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.180
from one place into
another place, right?

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.220 position:56%
And that's not always a happy story,
there's some, how shall we say,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.840
tragedy involved in this moment

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.930
of great transition
across the Atlantic.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.560
But let's just get straight into it

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.700
and ask some questions
of funk music, right?

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.520
What are some of the
techniques of funk?

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.550
And I want to introduce you
just to two very simple ones.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.210
The first one is sometimes called
shifting or pushing something

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.300
on to the metric offbeat, right?

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:27.390
Which is just a question of if my
beat is here I emphasize the space

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:32.150
between [beats] okay?

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:36.880
The second is shaping,
sometimes called shaping the beat

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.480
or extending it in time,
but extending it somewhat.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.830
So if the beat is here
[beats] I now go, okay?

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:49.530
We're going to get to how
that is actually sublimated

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.680
into that particular rhythm that
you heard, but for now I just want

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.150
to play some very obvious examples
of both so we can get this slowly.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:02.370 position:56%
Here is Rufus Chaka Khan, 1974, Tell
Me Something Good, shifting the beat

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:08.510
to the metric offbeat, okay?

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:28.670
[ Music ]

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.970
Okay, everybody get the point?

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.840
What makes this feel the way it
does is precisely this shifting the

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.140
on and the offbeat.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.940
You could actually step on both

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.980
and it would give you
decent movement, right?

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.990
It doesn't script you or conscript
you into one way of dancing,

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.780
you can be on or off the beat.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:52.290
Same year, 1974, here's
a way of shaping time.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.900
Actually, let me just
remind you what --

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:58.670
you know, what, we'll do another
shifting time, but to remind you

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.910
that this isn't just a question
of like pulses interlocking.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.690
You can have entire rhythmic
configurations kind of being pushed

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.760
over by half a beat, that sort of
classic 0.5 or something, right?

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.390
So the classic funk kind of
drumming often does this.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.280
So if you listen to the following
passage, this is Tower of Power,

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:21.090
Scrub Case 1974, you will hear a
short rhythmic motive that sort

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.900
of go dum, da, da, da, da,
dup, da, da, dup, da, da, da,

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.180
dum, ta, dum, dum, dem, dem.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.830
And then it will delay by 0.5
that same dup, da, da, da.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.660
Okay, so if you can hear that,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:37.510
four measures of funk
drumming, Tower of Power, 1974.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:48.220
[ Music ]

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.020
Everybody get the point?

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.410
[ Music ]

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.970
Okay, so the entire sort
of, as it were, the passage,

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.540
the rhythmic configuration,
dup, da, da, da, dum, ta, dum,

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.370
that gets pushed over by 0.5.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.090
Did anybody hear that?

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.510
Okay, let's do it one more time.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:20.100
[ Music ]

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.030
Okay, so I came down.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.040
[ Music ]

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.490
Where that little rhythmic
fragment started again,

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.360
but the drummer waited just half
a beat and that would lead us

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.450
into the rhythm of the one.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.670
Okay, it's as if it
came a little early,

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.140
came a half beat early, right?

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.530
And that is very sort of
more sophisticated way

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.530
of shifting the beat, okay?

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.750
In Disco music, of course,
this shifting became a kind

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.810
of dominant feature, it almost
became a characteristic sound

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.860
which was associated very
often with the high hat,

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.680
so think Donna Summer
and so on and so forth.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.540
The prominent high hat that
happened within the spaces.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.620
This is just a digital
audio workstation sort

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.470
of showing how you place the
high hat within the context

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:10.330
of an ongoing beat using
Disco as you're trying

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.510
to invoke Disco and stylistic.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.140
[ Music ]

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.940
Now we have it here.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.140
[ Music ]

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.510
Okay, now we've entered into
the reign of Donna Summer.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:33.260
[ Music ]

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:39.040
Okay, so we've sort of got the idea
of interlocking or shifting, right,

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.840
being in the space
of something else,

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.380
the shift of 0.15, 0.5 in a beat.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.910
What I want to now turn
to is the shaping sound,

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.530
which is to say instead of having
just the beat go you have another

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.360
beat going, but that's
like stretched.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:26:00.870
[beats] Okay, and this made its way
also both through funk into Disco

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.110
and then ultimately into the
mainstream sort of dance musics

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.340
of the late '80s and into the '90s.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.230
I want to give you one
example, this is from Tim Moss,

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.820
so we're now already in the
'90s of techno music just

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.680
to again get the conceptual
point across.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.140
It starts out with a symph

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.530
that is very prominently
giving you a slow beat

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.950
against which a quicker
one or the primary set

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.510
of beats is going to join.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.050
[ Music ]

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.640
What, we're musically doing this
I'd say one, two, three, one, two,

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.510
three, one, two, three, one,
two, three, one, two, three.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.510
Because the real beat is heavy.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.180
[ Music ]

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.510
Then the DJ will bring
in the underlying beat.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:27:03.080
[ Music ]

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.350
Okay, in the music world
people sometimes call this

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.650
grouping dissonance.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.310
As far as I'm concerned, we could
call it a metric dissonance.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.680
It's like two elements or two
parts of the layering are aspiring

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.600
to different ways of counting time,
right, but you do it simultaneously

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.260
and they go in and out
of phase with each other.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.350
Think about building a brick
house with different size bricks

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.060
or something, clearly they're going
to go out of phase and come back

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.540
into phase with one another.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.070
By the time we get to the late
'90s this becomes quite a refined

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.050
technique for the needle
droppers and the refined DJs.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.380
This is some IDM music, which began

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.930
or so-called intelligent dance
music coming out of Detroit,

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.850
but making its way through
to the UK and so on.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.600
Mark Butler has written a
remarkable book on this.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.040
I'd like to show you that what
we have here is both a shaping

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.500
and a shifting of the beat, okay?

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.510
So take a listen to
this passage of music.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:12.320
[ Music ]

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.820
Okay, now listen to the way he
drops the needle into this texture.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.030
We expect the beat.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.040
[ Music ]

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.510
That's where we expect the beat.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:42.210
[ Music ]

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.020
So it's both shifted the beat
or turned the beat around,

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.380 position:56%
as the saying goes, and it's shaping
the beat by de, dum, de, dum, de,

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.730
dum, which is the slower
beat within a beat.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.010
It's like having two cycles

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.770
of a different size rotating
simultaneously, you know,

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:03.280
a 24-hour day and a 28-hour day
somehow, simultaneously unfolding.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.280
Okay, and by 1999 -- I'm going
to give one more example,

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.790 position:56%
this had gone thoroughly mainstream,
so when people were dancing raves

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.320
and so on and so forth we often
had these kinds of techniques.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.110 position:56%
So I'm actually going to try to draw
this up on the board because it's --

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.190
try listening to the different
layers because it's shaping

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.930
and shifting on numerous levels.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:25.860
I'll draw it up and speak
across the actual track.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.510
So here we go, Almac Twins, Almac
Head [Assumed Spelling], sorry.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:37.040
[ Music ]

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.510
You've got the beat.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:46.060
[ Music ]

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:52.510
Okay, but the symph is prominently
off that beat in this phase.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:30:00.040
[ Music ]

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.960
Okay, I'm going to go back,
this is what happens next,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.050
so that we call shifting
of the effect.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.720
What was once just a gentle high
hat is living up to the beat

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.090
and Disco has now become
a prominent [inaudible].

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.170
[ Music ]

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.510
Listen to what happens now.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:37.110
[ Music ]

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.910
It's becoming more prominent.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:31:01.070
[ Music ]

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.370
Sort of doing its own thing,

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.510
and there's another layer
which is doing this.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:19.280
[ Music ]

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.360
Okay, in fact, the drum,
the main sort of beat

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.080
that hold it together they remove
so that you can hear all this.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.500
This is like that break that
you used to have in funk music,

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.820 position:56%
now you remove the basic element and
just allow all these rhythmic sort

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.280
of ambiguities to come
to the forefront

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.720
and then dancers often speak of
flowing and trancing, whatever.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.840
You know, the language there is
interesting how to describe this.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.580
But what I want to show
you just very quickly is

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.370
that the first thing
is that prominent symph

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.260
in the spaces happened in
the space of the beat, right?

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.020
It was somehow punching in between.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.950 position:56%
The second layer went across that in
three's, so this was all in two's,

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.730
and then this went
into three's, okay?

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.750
But this one went chun,
ja, chun, ja, chun, ja --

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.920
this one actually went into the
space of the space over here, okay?

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.430
So you have all these various
elements that are suddenly starting

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.290
to sound a little bit
like an African ensemble.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:22.310
Very little harmonic change and
all sorts of rhythmic complexity

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.540
that the DJs are bringing and
filtering and figured rounding

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.940
in ways that are attentive
to the audience's reactions.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.950
So how did we get there?

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:39.000
Well, let me start very
quickly by going back to Africa.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.510
This time just South Africa.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:46.680 position:56%
And again it's hard to measure
exactly how these things transferred

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.920
from one place to another, but
what I do want to say is --

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.880
and it's hard to map because
the place, South Africa,

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.100
for example I'm South
African and so on,

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.700
obviously a hybridized
South African,

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.380
hybridized African, if you like.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.900
And so, too, is the
music deeply hybridized.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.910
So it's quite difficult to
look at contemporary music

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.460
and find just this
irreducible stamp of Africanus

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.540
because it's become part of
the record industry, the radio,

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.850
emergence of radio, the
globalization of culture,

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.760 position:56%
very quickly hybridized all of this.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:19.210
So what I'm trying to get at
is some of the pre-hybrid forms

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:25.380
of music making which were
equally complex and non-static,

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.280
but there is a sense in
which they functioned

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.540 position:56%
across a different type of modality.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.660
But even in the hybrid
music of South Africa,

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.430
this is back to when I
grew up, turning the beat

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:37.900
around was a common thing.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.510
It is almost like even in
popular music it was modeled

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:43.190
on Western music you
hear this sort of ease

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.230
with which the beast
gets turned around.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.170
Here is Inzie Zamoya [Assumed
Spelling] playing a Marabi music,

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.320
in fact, this piece of music is
called Marabio [Assumed Spelling].

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.510
Sorry, attempt to hit that button.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:04.120
[ Music ]

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.920
That's where you can move.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:13.810
[ Music ]

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:20.680
Moving into all sorts
of dance things that are

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.600 position:56%
like MiteMite [Assumed Spelling],
which is associated with [inaudible]

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:31.670
and I'll talk about that when we
talk about [inaudible] next time,

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:37.740
but that's like to walk like
a duck and so on and so forth.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:44.060
So this is a sort of association
that goes along with this,

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.680
but it's clear that turning the
beat around is not a big deal

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:54.380
in the South African popular music
even of the modern hybridized sort.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.700
Okay, now a speculation,
how did this get here?

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:02.830
And I want to just take a sort of
detour through certain soundscapes,

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.870
such as the sites such as the Bronx

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:13.960
where arguably we can find the
origins of Hip-Hop and argue

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:19.380 position:56%
that the actual sounds that were out
there in the streets, in the parks,

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:25.530
in the dancehalls, on stairways
and so on and so forth,

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:31.730
actually carried an imprint of this
music by way of the Africarribean.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:37.170 position:56%
Okay, this is actually an argument
that's very well made by a colleague

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.470
of mine called Mark
Katz [Assumed Spelling].

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.360
If anybody wants to read up
about that exact connection.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.560
I think it's a compelling argument.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.010
I lived in New York for a
long time now and when I lived

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:52.390
up in Harlem it was clear that if
you left your apartment on a Sunday

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.970
or Saturday or a Friday,
maybe even a Thursday

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.700
in summer these soundscapes
are very prominent, right?

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.200
There's different competing groups

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.180
that still have traces
of all of this.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.420
And it seems to me that that sonic
geography has something to do

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:10.070
with what people felt was a
certain appropriate way of beating.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:13.590
So here's an example from a
novel, written by Allen Jones,

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:18.990
this is in the 1950s, the book
is called The Rat That Got Away,

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.990
and here he's describing
the soundscape

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:23.520
of a certain sort of
area in the projects.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.910
The Patterson Houses at night
were alive with activity,

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.210
he says, and alive with sound.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.910
Music was everywhere, coming
off people's apartments

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:32.630
and on project benches.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:36.480
One side of the street he
would have people who brought

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.810
out portable turntables
with two big speakers.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.440
That's already in the 1950s.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.070
Cool hoke [Assumed
Spelling] only starts,

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.710
you know, a good 10 years later.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:48.020 position:56%
And on the other side you could
hear some brothers singing a Frankie

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.320
Lymon song.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.300
But the one constant every
night without fail was the sound

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.020
of Puerto Ricans playing
their bongos

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.980
in local parks and playgrounds.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.650
The steady beat of those
drums was background music

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.100
to my living reality.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:08.010
Renee Scroggins, 1970s, describes
the Bronx in very similar terms.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:13.210
Every summer in St. Mary's Park
you would have some Latin gentleman

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.900
in the park with some Coke bottles,
a cowbell and a set of congos

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.450
and it was our summer sound.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:22.120
Okay, so that's by way of
speculation about one place

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.100
where something moved from the
African by way of the Africarribean

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:29.250
into the soundscapes of the United
States and then into popular music

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.400
of various sorts, from funk to
Hip-Hop through Disco and so on.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.890
That break beat was the most
sampled or played with on vinyl

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.650
on a certain kind of turntables.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.200
Of all sounds it's
probably the most popular.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.900
And the argument is that when
you make a recording this is the

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.410
phonograph effect, when
you make a recording

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.280
of something it's different
to being live.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.730 position:56%
If you're live you can adjust to
your audience, you can look at them,

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.590
you can slow down, speed
up, you can extend the break

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.160
if they're getting down and so on.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.360
How do you do that if
you've got it on vinyl

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.320
because on vinyl you always
keep things shorter, right,

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.320 position:56%
even if you're like recording Chopin
or something like that, you know,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.600
live I can do that, I can
really hold that silence,

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.900
right, and people will wait.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.050
A phonograph always
compresses it, you can't --

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:19.760
you don't see that silence
so, therefore, you shorten it.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.080
And so the break was
relatively short.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:27.270
Well, how do you extend that
if people are getting down?

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.720
And you're just basically
creating a party.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.140
Well, one thing you can do is have
two turntables and needle drop

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.830 position:56%
or pull it back, which is their way,

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.700
that particular technique
emerged from.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.900
So it was a kind of production,
creation, and then became a kind

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.080
of music stylistic of its own.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.610
In fact, Colverk [Assumed
Spelling] used to toast over this,

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.330
which is a Jamaican thing
to do, perhaps to cover

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.630
up some of the little mistakes.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:49.930
So it's an interesting story
about how this all comes

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:51.230
into the soundscapes
of our parks and so on.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.530
So I want to get a
little bit into this,

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.830
into the claves [Assumed Spelling].

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.130
Demonstrate, which is the
Africarribean that I'm referring

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.430
to here, and demonstrate
how these take up residency,

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.730
these patents take up residency
in various contemporary styles.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.030
And you should be able
to recognize them,

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.330
I'm trying to in some sense
give some irrefutable sort

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.630
of styles here.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.930
But here is the sound
of the 3-2 sound claves.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.230
And when you think of the claves
think of that gankogui [inaudible]

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.530
that we did a little bit of work
on, that looked like the piano,

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.830
that's the one I'd like you
to think of when you think

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.130
of the sound claves
and then we will talk

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.930
about the relationship it
takes to the African original.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:20.200
[ Music ]

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.280
Okay, it's three on one side
and two on the other, right?

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:32.000
So one, two, three, four [beats]
that kind of thing, right?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.720
Remember there's black
notes on the piano, right?

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.960
Five things happening in a field
of 12 or five things happening

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.570
in four big beats, five
beats in four, okay,

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:45.000
trying to make five things
happen in that space.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.260
This one happens in this particular
way, so it's one, two, three, one,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.320
two, one, two, three,
one, two, okay?

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.550
If I speed that up just a little
bit, so dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:00.510
dun, dun, dun, dun
-- I find it here.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:08.050
[ Music ]

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.360
This is the block party call to ...

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.190
[ Music ]

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:22.040
Okay, I hope we all know that
particular piece of music, okay?

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.640 position:56%
There were many variants of this
particular pattern and I'm not going

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.470
to have the time to
do it all, right?

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:30.560
But we have in a sense three on
one side and then two on the other.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.020
The beat falls sort of in
between all these things, right?

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.190
And then sometimes on these things.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:43.350
So there's the beat, dah, dah, dah,
dah, dun, dun, bum, bum, bum, okay?

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.400
That's kind of how
this pattern works.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:51.290
If I were to just to delay this one
just a little bit I get the rumba,

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.590
okay?

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:56.100
If I delay this one just a
little bit I get the bossa nova.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.380
I can also delay both a little bit

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.540
and I get also a very
interesting pattern.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.820
So the original song
pattern, something like this.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.120
Okay, here's the beat.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.100
[beats] Rumba, I'm going to
delay the third of those.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:15.140
[beats] Everybody hear
that subtle difference?

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:22.740
Okay, so instead of I'll play
them one after each other.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:31.520 position:56%
[beats] Okay, bossa nova, now I'm
going to delay the other side of it.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:35.130
[beats] Again, I'll play now
the sun [Assumed Spelling]

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.080
and then the bossa nova.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.410
[beats] Sorry, that was
the wrong way around.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:42.310
[beats] I could do both.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:51.040
[beats] Now I'm almost playing
exactly five equally spaced things

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:59.290
in the field of four, but we
are locked into four-four time,

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.940
which is undermining
that a little bit.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:09.630
If you slow down, for example,
the rumba pattern from [beats]

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:16.510
but slow it down [beats]
you get something like this.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:20.290
[ Music ]

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:22.090
So the bass drum.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:40.050
[ Music ]

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:45.180
Okay, I raise it because when
we look at Hip-Hop, you know,

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.330
often in the popular
media or at universities.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:50.920
You know, I teach at a university.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.890
We often look at the voice, the
importance of voice, politics,

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:56.020
culture, storytelling,
imagery, et cetera.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:59.070
What we don't often do is just
listen to the pure grammar

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.550
of how are these beats put together
and where do they come from, right?

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.530
This is clearly a slowed
down kind of rumba, right?

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:11.510
And the girding through the
bass drum, the feel of the song.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.760
It is essentially important
and throughout the first decade

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.750
of the 21st Century I
challenge anyone in the room

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:21.820 position:56%
to find me seriously sort of popular
Hip-Hop that didn't have a mark

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:25.880
of some of this kind of claves
pattern built into the underground

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:30.700
of that particular sound.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.620
So how would you render this
pattern in an African context?

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.260 position:56%
What is different about these to the
ones that we started with, right?

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.930
And I want to get into
this a little bit slowly,

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.420
but let's just first have
a demonstration of it.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.340
This is Mario Puchae
[Assumed Spelling] again.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.510
This is the African
Icefield [Assumed Spelling].

00:43:50.510 --> 00:44:00.040
[ Music ]

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.510
Okay, it's interesting because
the beat should really be here.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:13.350
[ Music ]

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.220
Okay, it's a slightly
different feel, right?

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:21.750
So consider the one goes like
this [beats] that's our song,

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.050
and this one goes [beats].

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:33.020
Okay, a little bit
different to [beats] subtle,

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:37.100
but it's a very different feel.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:44.770
And what makes them different
primarily is that the one is what

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:49.450 position:56%
in the West is called four-four
time or binary time and the other is

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.140
in a kind of ternary time.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.810
It's going one, two, three, two,
two, three, three, two, three,

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:54.110 position:56%
three, two, three, four, two, three.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.160
And the other is going one, two,
two, two, three, three, four, two.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.440 position:56%
And you're trying to fit the beats
on and off the beat in the same kind

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.430
of way, but in a different
metric framework.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:04.840
Is everybody with me?

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.520
And notice that this three-two
claves is exactly what we had

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.050
when we knocked off right
in the beginning the spaces

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.260
between the gankogui pattern.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.670
Here was that first
pattern you heard.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.320
This is now the bell
pattern, gankogui bell.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.620
[beats] [rattle] Africanized.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:39.510
[beats] [rattle] So I'm not
going to even try to make

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:45.140
that final translation,
but you get the point.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.590
It's entrained differently, the
way the placement of the beat is

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:53.320
in a slightly different spot
within the temporal spans

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.100
that are provided by the music.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:03.320
Okay, this manner of rendering that
three-two claves, quote-unquote,

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.910
and it's completely back formation
now because we're now going back

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:10.780
to the earliest music that we
have traces of, is part and parcel

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:15.020
of something that's been sort of at
work in African, how shall we say,

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.480
temporalities for a
very, very long time.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.780
I'm going to take you back

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.870
to a Bucker [Assumed Spelling]
ensemble, one might call it.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:27.510
Here's a string instrument called
the venaluma [Assumed Spelling].

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:31.830
This is now Central Africa,
and I want you to hear first

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:36.030
that particular three-two
and it's going to come

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.580
in the form of a rattle, okay?

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.290
And the string instrument
is going to double it,

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:45.660
so the string instrument will
feel that pattern in the same way.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.480
Listen carefully.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:47:15.130

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:17.590

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:22.510
by the stick pattern
that's in the foreground.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:35.040
[ Music ]

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.360
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.660
One, two, three, four, five.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.030
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:43.050
[ Music ]

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.420
Can everybody hear that?

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.220
Okay.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.040
[ Music ]

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.830
I think for the purposes of the
argument tonight I just want

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.370
to make two points about that.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.520
There's a third layer that
I wanted to introduce us to,

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.880
but for now I'm going
to suspend that.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.130
What we have is the simultaneous
unfolding of two patterns,

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.800
both of which are structured

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.440
through this N minus one,
N plus one technique.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:10.530
[sounds] Right, that's the
venaluma and the shaker.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.000
One, two, one, two, three, one,
two, one, two, one, two, three.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.940
So it's five plus seven.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.630
One, two, one, two, three, one,
two, one, two, one, two, three.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:22.400
[sounds] That's how you're
dividing up a field of 12.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.220 position:56%
But you also have the Dketo [Assumed
Spelling], which is the sticks

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.460
that you heard, not the clapping,
the sticks which went like this.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.270
They went down below,
short, long, long.

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:43.440
[beats] Okay, we need to be asking
a lot of questions right now

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:48.300
because this is now going
one, two, two, two, two, two.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.480
One, two, two, two, two, two, two.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.780
Six times.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.850
But what it's doing is
as it sets up one beat

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:58.960
for the first half it reverses
that for the second half, right?

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.250
And it does so in a way that
recapitulates the N minus one,

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.120
N plus one logic but on
a much longer time scale.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.220
In this case 24, okay, if
you add up all the three's

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.590
and two's here we get 24.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.830
So you have two cycles, both
organized through N minus 1,

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:15.920
N plus one, running
simultaneously and going

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.480
on a phase with each other.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.130
Okay, so you need to keep your
wits about you playing this music.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:25.940
There is no overriding beat
or if there is one it is music

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.270
to find the beat by or even
music to rotate the beat by,

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:32.320
which is something that
we will get to hopefully

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.810
at the end of this lecture.

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:37.650
How do Westerners hear this music?

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:41.640
Here's a fragment from Herbie
Hancock's album, Headhunters,

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.870
in which his drummer, Bill
Summers, takes a short fragment

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:50.510
of African music and begins a song
called Watermelon Man that way.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:50:16.040
[ Music ]

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.280
Okay, where did he find this?

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.340
He found this on a UNESCO
collection album that was recorded

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.160
by Simpha Har Aram [Assumed
Spelling], whom I mentioned

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.460
at the beginning who is an
Israeli ethnographer who went,

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.290
commissioned by the French
Government to go teach people

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:33.540
in Central Africa to play the horn.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.180
And he discovered, of course,
that people knew how to play horns

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.790
in some ways much better than he
did and he kind of found Jesus

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:42.190
and stayed there for a
number of years and made some

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:47.920 position:56%
of these fascinating recordings,
which we now have circulated, right?

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.630
This particular piece,
there's a very famous article

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:53.680
by Steven Feld [Assumed Spelling]
written about how it circulates

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.320
in a global frame, and
we can talk about that

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.760
as a slightly separate issue
about when things become monetized

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.960
and when they stay in a gift
economy but we'll leave that aside

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.660
for the purposes of tonight.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:08.170
What I want to draw attention
to is the original recording

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:12.510
which was listened to by
Bill Summers, here it is.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:28.070
[ Music ]

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:30.630
Okay, once again the one
note, one flute, et cetera.

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:32.860
These are by Bengali [Assumed
Spelling] singers or players.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.170
In this area the rain forest is
so thick that people often have

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:38.620
to find their way by
ear rather than by eye,

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.900 position:56%
so it's a very interesting
soundscape and we have a lot of sort

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:46.520
of intermediate linguistic coding
through sound that might be music,

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.220
as language might just be
spatial, location and so on.

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:52.730
So definitions of music
are challenged by this,

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.790
but nevertheless that's the sample.

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:57.380
If we went deep into it you'd hear
all the interlocking parts come

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.680
in and so on.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.090
But what I want you to
do is take a listen again

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:05.780
to what Bill Summers hears in this
music and how he feels the beat

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.310
and then compare it, okay?

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:12.020
And then I want to make a
point about that difference,

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.820
even with the same music.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:19.070
[ Music ]

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.370
Where is the beat?

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.340

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.040
[ Music ]

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.340
Anybody want to give it to me?

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.850
I'm giving it to you.

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.050
[ Music ]

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.850
That's the beat, right?

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.040
[ Music ]

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.850
Everything is conspiring
to that, right?

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:43.000
Okay, now again I don't sing
very well, but the way he more

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.780 position:56%
or less hears it in that band is
bah, bah, bah, beepa, bah, bah, bah,

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:56.640
bah, bah, beepa, dah, dah, dah,
dah, beepa, dah, dah, dah, okay?

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.180
The way it is entrained

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:01.840
in the original context would be
more something like bah, bum, ba,

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.150
beepa, bum, bum, ba,
ba, beepa, okay?

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:10.920 position:56%
Very different way in which it is
heard as a metric phenomenon, right?

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.860
And I think that difference
has something to do precisely

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:17.770
with this N minus one, N plus one
thing I've been talking about,

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:20.930
which is to say if you look
carefully how this melody is

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:26.330
structured, dah, de, dah, de,
dum, bum, bum, ba, beep, bum.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:30.500
Okay, something of
the ba, ba, bum, bum.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:36.470
[beats] Something of that claves
Africanized pattern is embedded

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:38.910 position:56%
in the way the melody is structured,

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:44.810
which makes it symmetrically
malleable, okay?

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:47.250
That is something now that I
want to turn to in more detail

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.670
and now this sort of
math game is going

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:51.230
to start a little bit
more intensely,

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:54.800
so far it's just been
like introduction.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.180
But let me draw your
attention to this, right?

00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.990
Here's our claves pattern,

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:03.250
here's our gankogui
pattern, excuse me, right?

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:06.560
And these are the time
points, zero, one, two.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:10.120 position:56%
In set theory in math you start,
you count from one to 12 by starting

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.000
with zero, so forgive me, that's
a convention, but it's zero, one,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.300
two because nothing
has happened yet,

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.770
like time 0.0, right,
we start at zero.

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.960
So zero, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.940
eight, nine, 10, 11, right?

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.260
That is 12 time points,
this is clock time,

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.470
it's as if it's going one
to 12, but zero is 12, okay?

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.370
so zero, one, two,
three, four, five --

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:29.310
well, where do the beats
fall on this, right?

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:33.790
I remind you now, dum, dah,
dah, dah, dah, dah, dum, right?

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:35.680
That is the pattern.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.710
The beat can fit anywhere
within that pattern.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:41.010
Why is that?

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.820
Let me play the pattern
and let me play you some

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.460
of the possible beats, okay?

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.760
[beats] Easy enough.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.950
Why? I align the first
two notes with the beat

00:54:48.950 --> 00:55:02.130
and then I keep the beat going and
this thing knocks on and then off,

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:06.450
just like we heard in that
music of Central Africa, right?

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.060
Or I can start by placing the beat

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.570
in between those notes,
the first two, right?

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:13.700
Now instead of starting
together I go [beats].

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.310
It's as easy to do.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:19.290
As many things are off the beat
and on the beat within the cycle.

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:25.980
I could also extend the beat,
quote-unquote, shape it,

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.250
have a longer beat instead
of having dong, dong, dong,

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:31.660
have it dum, dum, dum, okay?

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:36.770
[beats] I could take that
place and shift it over one

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:40.820
and have the longer beat
but one pulse later.

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:47.500
[beats] Basically, I'm giving you a
phenomenology of an algorithm here.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:52.660
No matter where I put the beat and
no matter how short or long I make

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:58.320
that beat the pattern has
the capacity to entrain

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.930
that beat with equal validity.

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:05.700
Now that might not have quite of
made sense and here's the sort

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:13.140
of formulation of it, but what
happens when you entrain --

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:19.100 position:56%
these are the binary times, on, off,
on, off, on, off or off, on, off,

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:23.300
on, off, on, on, off, off,
on, off, off, on, off, off,

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:35.650
or shifted one on,
off, off, et cetera,

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:37.780
and this is the third permutation.

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.620
Each of those coincides

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:43.340
and uncoincides the
same number of times.

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:49.550
So to design a pattern
like that takes some doing.

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:53.610
There are one or two within a span
of 12 where you have seven pulses,

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:57.380
where you can design a pattern
that entrains with equal validity

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:01.240
for every possible
time signature, okay?

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.540
There aren't that many.

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:03.840
It's actually kind
of a math problem,

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.910
which is why I'm absolutely
convinced this isn't just music

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.090
of the body, but music of the mind.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:12.290
That's probably the biggest
lesson to take away from today.

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:15.580
I won't explain this level except
very briefly for those of you

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.190
who are tuned into
this kind of talk.

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:25.020 position:56%
The zero, three, six, nine is moving
across the time steadily from zero,

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:28.830
to three, to six, to nine
in ternary time, okay?

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:30.250
That's what that means.

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:33.840
The bold on zero and nine is
when the beats are on and off.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.940
Two of them are on, two are off.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.100
If I shifted and rotate it to
four, seven, 10, one, two are on,

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:42.190
two are off, a different two.

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:45.040
And the same thing, there's three
on and one off in the lowest layer.

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:50.710 position:56%
If I go look down the columns I also
get it maximally distributed, okay?

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:54.630
So the on and offishness with
seven pulses within a field

00:57:54.630 --> 00:58:00.850
of 12 is maximally
metrically ambiguous, okay?

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:03.900
Remember that this is also
the structure of the piano,

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:06.820
which has the capacity to
modulate from one place to another

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.640
and for you to be able to position,
find yourself in the music,

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.750 position:56%
you know where you are in the music,
musically speaking, not the words.

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:18.410
Because of certain properties
that it has mathematically.

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:21.540
The colophony of the diatonic
system, which has to do

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:24.950
with every interval appearing
a different number of times.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:26.680
That's probably a little jargonish,

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.340
but for similar reasons this
particular mode of entrainment

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:35.420
or of patterning permits any
of many types of entrainment

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.490
or maximal metric ambiguity.

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:47.070
Okay, I'm going to go into a
slightly more speculative mode.

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:50.650
I'm hoping that I haven't
lost folks just yet.

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:53.790
What you see on the left is
Pingala's Metaprastar [Assumed

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:57.560
Spelling], which is the Mountain
of Jewels which he thought

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:02.440
up many thousands years ago which
is also known as Pascal's Triangle,

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:06.980
but it also emerged in the context
of a certain pneumonic device

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:11.650
for memorizing Sanskrit passages
that were opaque and so on

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:13.320
and so forth and you
didn't know the meaning

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.520
but you could memorize
through rhythm.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.590
And he designed this Metaprastar,

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:20.090
which gives you the
binomial coefficients.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:23.860
It also gives you the fubinache
[Assumed Spelling] series

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.310 position:56%
if you slice through it in different
ways and so on and so forth.

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:29.070
So that's India, you
know, what is it?

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.120
Is it 6,000 years ago, I can't
quite remember the date right now

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.420
for that.

00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:35.460
It's on my notes, but
I don't want to look.

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.510
Pascal, we don't know if
it's just a translation

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:41.850
or if he actually reinvented
it, could have reinvented it.

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:43.690
And what I want to draw your
attention to is this layer

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:47.950
over here, one, three, three,
one, just for the time being.

00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:52.550
There's a Sanskrit sort of
recitation [foreign language]

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:55.440
which was supposed to be a
way of memorizing that layer

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.860
of Pingala's Metaprastar.

00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:01.460
I want to compare it to the African
rhythmic patterns that you have

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:07.450
on the righthand side, but let
me go there in more detail.

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:09.660
One of the clapping
patterns that's associated

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.920
with enbitozamazima [Assumed
Spelling] music is very similar

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.770
to the gankogui pattern
that we listened to.

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:21.310
The gankogui remember had
seven in the field of 12

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:25.970
and they looked a little
bit like this.

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:40.520
Okay, the gankogui and I've rotated
it a bit, okay, started over here.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.460
Dum, bom, ba, bom, bom,
bom, bom, ba, bom, okay?

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.540
One of the clapping patterns
that holds an ensemble

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:54.540
in Zimbabwe together, which we will
get to, has this kind of character.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.260
It fills in exactly
that, but it fills in one

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.530
of the beats over there, okay?

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:02.200
So the pattern that you clap
while this ensemble is going

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.290
on sounds something like this.

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:14.200
[claps] Okay, why is
this pattern interesting?

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.940
The first thing is
we have in the mbira,

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:22.250
world of mbira an equal problematic
kind of way in which people are all

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.870
on potentially on different
downbeats

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:25.680
and they're interlocking like this.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.310
So when you're playing
the other person is quiet.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.860
It's a very difficult
scene to hold together.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.160
So having a pattern

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.470
that is maximally metrically
ambiguous helps.

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:39.110
But it's more, what if you
get lost in this ensemble?

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:41.450
What if for a minute
you're just one beat off?

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:43.780
Where is that beat when all
the sonic input that's coming

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.080
from the other members

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.870
of the ensemble is pointing
you in the wrong direction?

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.860
Well, here's one technique
for doing that and, again,

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.380
there are two possible
rotations here in math.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.130
This one is the one
that's used in Zimbabwe.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:02:02.430
If I ask the question,
which Pascal kind of asked,

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:08.580
about how many ways are there
of ordering say two elements

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.200
in a field of say three spaces?

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.850 position:56%
So binary, think zeroes and one's
or think dits and dahs, Morris code,

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:20.130
or think longs and
shorts, African patterns.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:25.950
How many ways are there of ordering
say two, zero and one elements

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:28.260
in a field of three spaces?

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:32.380
Okay, so what I mean is we've
got two elements, long and short.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.280
We've got three spaces to put them
in, and there's a number of ways,

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.970
a fixed number of ways that
those can be ordered, right?

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:43.070
We would call this two to the
N, right, two things binary

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:46.370
to the power of something,
in this case three, okay,

01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:47.990
two to the power of three.

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:50.470
Like this is what we would do.

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:54.410
How can you create a sonic
pattern that imprints

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:57.050
that mathematical value, okay?

01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:59.950
So that if you get lost
in the ensemble you know

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:02.420
in an instant where you are.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.580
You don't want to wait,
where is the beginning?

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.880
This whole beginning thing was
already problematized by the music,

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.560
itself, so how do you
position and find yourself?

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.750
Well, consider that the two ways,

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:20.080
the ways in which you can
order two elements in a field

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.530
of three would include, let's
say longs and shorts, okay?

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:28.430
We could have three longs,
we could have three shorts.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:30.120
Everybody with me?

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:36.290
You could have two longs and a
short and then we have to recognize

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:38.790
that there are three
ways of ordering that.

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:44.900
Long, short, long and
short, long, long, right?

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.600
So we have three longs over here.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.070
Here we have two longs and a
short, so we go long, long, short.

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:51.370
Long, short, long.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.670
Short, long, long.

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:53.970
Just spelling it out.

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:56.710
The other third permutation would
be having two shorts and a long.

01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:58.260
Let's just do the same thing.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.400
Short, short, long.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.070
And now we'll rotate
that in its threefold way

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.310
and we get long, short, short.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:07.930
So short, short, long.

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:09.230
Short, long, short.

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:11.540
Long, short, short, okay?

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:18.250
Notice that this is one, plus
three, plus three, plus one.

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:20.730
It's two to the power of three,
which equals one, two, three, four,

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:24.560
five, six, seven, eight, okay?

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.540
That's what's going on and these
are known as binomial coefficients.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.780
How would you encode that in sound?

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.210
Well, let's take a
look at this pattern,

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:37.430
let's just call it
off or three elements.

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:41.790
The first three we can
call them long, long, long.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:46.970 position:56%
The second three, long, long, short.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:53.100
The next one, next three
is long, short, long.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:05:00.120
Let's go up here, the next
one is short, long, short.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.450
Then we have long, short, short.

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:06.790
We have short, short, short.

01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:09.630
And then we have short, short,
and we've got to spin it

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:18.940
around this side, long, and
finally short, long, long.

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:23.830
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight groupings.

01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:26.030
And what are they?

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:27.670
Long, long, long is over here.

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.630
Short, short, short is over here.

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:31.580
Long, long, short.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:36.440
You can figure it out, but
they're distributed right

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.740
across that pattern.

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:44.840
This means that as soon as you hear
any three pulses you are exactly

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.790
precisely located within
that pattern.

01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:51.850
So your clappers are not just
sort of having fun and, you know,

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:54.700
they're actually guiding
in a sort of metronomic way

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.240
where you fit in to the pattern.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.010 position:56%
Given that a big conductor pulse
would just be absolutely disruptive,

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:04.180
it would simply pick out one part

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:11.230
of the performance that's
actually multi-metric.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:15.290
Let me skip this, but the composer,
Steve Rush [Assumed Spelling],

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:18.560
actually took one of these similar
related pattern and turned it

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.860
into minimalist -- it was one

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.300
of the founding moments
of minimalist music.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.790
I'd be happy to entertain that
in question time, but let's --

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:28.360
it circulates at this point
as an ethnographic text.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:32.010
He read a lot of transcriptions
through A.M. Jones,

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:35.110
the Reverend Jones who had done a
lot of work in Africa and so on.

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:38.200
There's a long story to be
told here about how things get.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.870
It's not just the Africarribean,
there's different stories,

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:43.810
and I haven't done
that justice but I want

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:46.330
to get you attuned to
some of the issues.

01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:49.460
In fact, he wrote that piece and
there's a sketch that he wrote

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.310
and he considered it
to be too African,

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:53.780 position:56%
he wanted it to sound more
original, but he nevertheless stayed

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.080
with the African pattern.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.330
Why? Because in a permutation
setting you can't mess

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:01.300
with these change of digit
and everything falls away

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.660
and the interest is
considerably less.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:08.050 position:56%
So briefly I want to just talk about
African mathematics in general.

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:10.540
I'm not an expert in
the entire field,

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:14.460 position:56%
but I do want to draw your attention
to it, just a couple of features

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.820
of current research in this.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:20.820
Such as that into the
archaeological sort of remnants

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:22.120
of mathematical practice.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.140
In other words, when did
we as a species begin

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:29.160
to think mathematically, like when
is the first baboon fibula not used

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.400
as a tool but used
as a counting device?

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:36.100
And the oldest ones emerge as
expected, in my view, from Africa.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.400 position:56%
This eshongo [Assumed Spelling] bone

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.090
that you see here is
8,000 years old.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.930
There's an argument about whether
it's 9,000 or 7,000, you know,

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:45.060
it's not my debate, but
it's a long time ago

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.210
and it predates a lot
of numeric thinking.

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:51.840
There's also the Lebombo [Assumed
Spelling] bone in South Africa.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.310
What I just want to draw
your attention to is not only

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:57.870
like if you look at the
markings that are on here,

01:07:57.870 --> 01:08:00.050
it's not just that we have
a prime quadrant on the left

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:04.670
which equals 60, we have certain
kinds of ratios in the middle,

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:06.020
and you can figure those out.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.330
But this one interests me
because it's 11, 21, 19 and nine.

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:13.450
This looks like decimalism in the
form of N minus one, N plus one,

01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:17.380
to me, but I can just speculate
at this point about how that kind

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:22.060
of thinking gets to be
amongst us as a species.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:27.580
Okay, so I want to end with two
more genres of music to really get

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:31.600
down more seriously into the way

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.690
in which African patterns
articulate very interesting

01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:37.070
mathematical worlds.

01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:40.350
Remember I talked about shifting
and shaping or being off the beat

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:43.610
or turning the beat around, and
the other one extending the beat.

01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:46.820
In Africa there are
considerable traditions

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.570
that do both of these things.

01:08:48.570 --> 01:08:53.030
I want to turn you now to
a kind of a region called,

01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:58.180
today called Uganda, that in
some sense is a tragic place

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:01.440
because when Motona Bota
[Assumed Spelling] came into power

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:08.870
in 1961 I think it is they
soon after, he had the cabaco

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:10.750
and the luberi [Assumed
Spelling] court sort

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:14.800
of destroyed and terminated, right?

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.220
The cabaco is the former
chief, as it were,

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.290
it's a terrible word,
but cabaco, okay?

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:25.940
And in this court there was
considerable music played, 24-7.

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.810
It was a semi-urbanized area,
said to be the source of the Nile,

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:32.350
there are competing
sources of the Nile,

01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:35.570
but it had a certain
kind of stature.

01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:38.190
It was in pre-Colonial times.

01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:42.450 position:56%
However, because of the way Colonial
rule works very often what you do is

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.640
politics, we're in
the politics capitol,

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.940
what you do is you amplify
some part of your enemy, right,

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.150
you separate and divide and rule.

01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:53.350
In direct rule you give your
chieftans a little more power

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:57.250
than they might have had and then
they become corrupted in some sense

01:09:57.250 --> 01:10:01.000
or are seen later by the resistance
fighters as complicit, right?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.540
We have this debate
constantly at play.

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:09.590
Unfortunately, this meant that
the complicit court was then ended

01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:12.480
and all the instruments were
burned and so on and so forth.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.410 position:56%
So it's a fairly tragic environment.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:18.500 position:56%
But, fortunately, there's some small
positive affects of Colonialism,

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.800
if one can say it that way.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.080
And Hugh Tracy [Assumed
Spelling], who was commissioned

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.410
to actually make recordings for the
Rhodesian Government at the time,

01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:28.000
kind of reeked out, a little bit

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.030
like [inaudible] and
really got into it.

01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:31.790
He wasn't just doing
it as a job anymore,

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:35.490
and discovered this great
universe of cultural making

01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:40.140
and made some recordings before
the luberi court was ended.

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:45.010
And so we have a few
fragments of Hugh Tracy asking

01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:47.210 position:56%
to demonstrate how this music works.

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:51.440
Now this is interlocking music, but
of a highly virtuosic character.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.010
What happens in this music is
that across a single xylophone,

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:57.180
known as the amadinda
[Assumed Spelling],

01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:00.010
a performer will play
a certan pattern.

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:03.460
Bong, bong, boo, be, bom, bom,
bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:10.800
Very simple, but with octaves,
not what you might expect.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.510
And the reason is because
on the other side

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:16.130
of the instrument another
performer is playing in the spaces

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:19.550
of that first performer, a
pattern of a different length.

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:24.260
So you're now nesting into
one pattern of another, right?

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:28.720 position:56%
And this happens at very high speed,
sometimes 600 pulses per minute.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.140
This is very seriously high speed.

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.080
And what happens as a
result is that because

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.460
of this interaction
notice this is actually

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.700
from Kubeka's [Assumed Spelling]
work, he made a depiction of this.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.400
Kubek is another interesting
Viennese scholar who went and moved

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.590
to Africa and so on, settled there.

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:48.100
He made this depiction
back I think it's in 1970s

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.990
around his research,
goes back to the '50s.

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:51.370
A very interesting guy.

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:53.340 position:56%
Here is umwawuzi [Assumed Spelling],

01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:56.440
here is umwanazi [Assumed
Spelling] playing on opposite ends

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.000
of this xylophone called the
amadinda [Assumed Spelling], right?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.350
And what happens, of course, if
you play piano, think of two people

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:09.680
on the opposite ends of a piano
playing within the same register

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.810
and never touching
each other, right?

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:14.150
You can't touch anyone because
technically you're going

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:15.800
to dampen the wood, right?

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.360
So you're always going to be off
when the other player is down,

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.350
but you're occupying the same what
in music is called the register

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:26.410
or the same area of
your keyboard, right?

01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:27.970
You're both coming
down in that same area.

01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:32.060
It's not like base and treble,
you're actually both in the middle.

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:35.010
The music that comes to the
ear is radically different

01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:37.510
to the music that's
actually being played.

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:42.550
The motor image of the performer
doing this is very different

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:46.800
from the audial image, which
is construing this again using

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.220
that phonic zelatrope
[Assumed Spelling] technique

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:52.690
by putting patterns together
that are like phantom patterns.

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:55.520
And these are taken out
by a third performer,

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.820
umaqanazi [Assumed Spelling],

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.240
and the part is called the
ookonira chunak [Assumed Spelling],

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.350
and pulled out for
special attention as a kind

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:04.620
of resultant or inherent pattern.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.560
So the concept of inherent
pattern or resultant pattern,

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.790
which emerges in a lot
of Western composition,

01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:11.250
again of the avant-garde sort.

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.200
I will not bore you
with those details,

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.590
but that is actually an
African concept of ookonira,

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:19.500
to bring something out that
nobody is playing, right?

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.170
Take a listen to a short fragment,

01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:24.070
as I say these are compromised
recordings, very short,

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:28.510 position:56%
didactic almost, at a long time ago.

01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:52.250
[ Music ]

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:56.510
Your ear cannot follow that line,
it can only hear the results.

01:13:56.510 --> 01:14:03.040
[ Music ]

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.710
And that's the knocking
brought out, the ookonira,

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:07.510
where he's doubling
the resulting pattern.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:11.040
[ Music ]

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.340
Okay, we'll stop that one there.

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:16.620
Very briefly, the music gets even
more virtuosic with the akadinda,

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:20.670
which is to say now you can
also sometimes place two beats

01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:23.420
within the space of one and so long

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.350
as you never touch
the other performer.

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:30.510
Take a listen to how this sounds
in its more virtuosic form.

01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:43.310
[ Music ]

01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:44.710
Second part will come in.

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:46.280
So far so good.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.510
Now the spaces of the
spaces will be filled.

01:14:49.510 --> 01:15:01.060
[ Music ]

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.860
Sometimes two beats, sometimes one.

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:20.610
[ Music ]

01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:22.870
Okay, one wants to continue, okay?

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:28.050
The very last music that
I want to introduce you

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:29.890
to is that of the [inaudible].

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.100
I've spent considerable
time with this music.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.610
I learned how to play this before
I learned how to play the piano,

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:37.800
which is why I find the piano
so fascinating as you can tell.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:42.130
But here it is and this is the last
of the points I'm going to make,

01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:44.610
because I want to get
into what's actually going

01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:45.910
on in those inherent patterns?

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:47.210
Right, where is the beat?

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.140
It's very, very difficult for a
Westerner to place a beat there

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:54.380
because in some ways the question
concerning the beat is itself put

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.050
to question, right?

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.190
And that's perhaps what's
at stake in this music,

01:15:58.190 --> 01:16:00.010
if you just hear water
flowing or something

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:05.760
like that you're not doing enough
with your ears to open them

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.900
to this field of possibility.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:13.300
Okay, here are what one might call
three keyboard interface designs,

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.600
right?

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.590
How is the technology designed?

01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:20.090
And the reason I take this as a
very interesting starting point

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:23.790
for thinking through history
and thinking through math is

01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:27.500
because in some ways once the
interface design gets settled

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.900
into a fixed structure it
carries a kind of history

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.130
and it doesn't get
changed as quickly.

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:36.540
When things become standardized
it tells you something

01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:39.270
about that culture and
how it standardizes,

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:44.510
how it construes the body,
right, as an interacting medium.

01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:48.170
So machine learning, all of
this, how is the body construed

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:52.330
in relation to the machines
with which it interacts.

01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:53.630
We will always [inaudible].

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:55.800
The point is not that there's
natural people over here

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:00.250
and technological -- no, we
are always technological.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:03.980
We automate fire, we're
technological, we sit back, okay?

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.910
We can watch things happen for us.

01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:08.210
So this is not the point.

01:17:08.210 --> 01:17:10.260
The point is how do
different machines,

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:15.940
how do different algorithms
comport the body in its behavior?

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:21.020
So take, for example, Qwerty, the
typewriter, right, Q-w-e-r-t-y,

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.320
where did that come from?

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.620
Why Qwerty?

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:27.060
This not how the piano is designed,
which is also a typewriter,

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.600
it's a typewriter for sound, it's a
music inscription device that works

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:35.850
like a phone, too, lots of
slices that make melodies.

01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:37.800
Why are typewriters
designed that way?

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.570
They seem both efficient
and inefficient, right?

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:42.480
They're inefficient
because you're kind

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.910
of going back and forward, right?

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.920
Why don't we just stroke through,
like t-h-e should be, you know,

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.570
it shouldn't be like ta, ta, ta.

01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:50.210
Why is it back and forth?

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:51.650
Why does that interlock?

01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:54.170
Because the hammers would
come flying into the same sort

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.560
of end point, same focal point,
and you didn't want them jamming.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.740
So you don't want people playing
like a piano because the piano is

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.770
in parallel hammers,
this is in hammers

01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:03.160
that all have the same destination.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.580
You didn't want that clogging up.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.610
So you build in an inefficiency

01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:08.800
and make sure you interlock
it a lot, right?

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.400
So we get Qwerty.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.670
And then what happens is the theory
of ergonomics or whatever it was

01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:17.720
that the engineers were
working with have to take

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:20.450
in account the 10 fingerishness
and then they have commitments

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:22.250
about what these fingers can do.

01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:26.150
And the commitments are
usually these four in the West,

01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:29.500 position:56%
these four are really good,
they're facile, and this one is kind

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.970
of bulky and stupid, maybe
it just has two, you know?

01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:36.040 position:56%
Whatever the reasons are, ergonomics
and so on, you construe these

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.080
as being more facile or quicker.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.420
And so early pianism, the
piano, actually didn't even --

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:44.400
eliminated the form, right,
you were supposed to do this.

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.970 position:56%
Plus it emphasized righthandishness.

01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:51.110
So we have in the piano high
notes on the righthand side,

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:52.720
low notes on the left-hand side.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:59.280
The very sort of, how should we
say, scalar way of organizing pitch

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.660
as well as time, but that's
a different issue, okay?

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.080
So instead of the circular one

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.990
or symmetrical one this
is a scalar one, right?

01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:10.660
So from left to right, it's
a kind of darkness over here.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.720 position:56%
And why did you put this slow stuff,

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.380
why did you put the base
notes in the left hand?

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.240
Because the argument was that
the left hands are slower

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.730
because we're all righthanded.

01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:21.160
Well, I mean that's the
sort of bias of technology.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.760
One needs to look at the values
built into technological designs

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.770
because if you happen to be
lefthanded it's tough luck, okay,

01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:28.600
because there ain't that
much music that really --

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.040
that's not entirely true,
but generally slow movement

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.950
in the left hand and
then faster up here.

01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:38.490
And plus on typewriters it was
like the space bar, which was huge

01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:42.090 position:56%
and bulky, and you really eliminated
one, you didn't even need it,

01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:44.790 position:56%
but there seemed to be so transient,
you know, you can just hit

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:47.060
that space bar easily
with the thumb, right?

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:50.390
Same thing with pianism, it
comports the body in a certain way

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:52.260
and then we respond
and we get really good

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.100
at typing and playing piano.

01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:56.330
And so the model is, the engineers

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.480
who are designing these systems
are flattered and they think, yes,

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.170
we must have been right
about the body.

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:02.560
So we are the order of complete

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.520
for the incomplete
algorithm in some funny way.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.570
But what I want to draw
your attention to is

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:12.860 position:56%
that that's not the only way of
designing music inscription devices.

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:15.690
So if you just take look at the
metepa [Assumed Spelling] over here

01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:17.980
or the [inaudible] over
here, the difference is

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:21.890 position:56%
that your low notes are more or
less in the middle of the instrument

01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:25.470
and the high notes fan
off to the side, right?

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.400
So it's kind of reflective
of the symmetry

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.890
or semi-symmetry of
the body, itself.

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:34.070
I'm not arguing this is better,
it's just a different way

01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:37.960 position:56%
of organizing your digitorum, right?

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.210
And what's interesting is,
I was going to bring it

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:43.210
but it's too complicated to
sort of play in the context

01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:46.980
of this environment, but if you
were to play like a scale on this,

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.180
because there's seven notes
before the octave recurs

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.480
in this instrument.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:54.010 position:56%
You'd do something very strange,
you'd have to start here, jump here,

01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:57.110
jump all the way across there,
back there, back there, back there,

01:20:57.110 --> 01:21:01.290 position:56%
back there, back there, back there
to play just da, da, da, da, da, da.

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:04.590
You'd be going -- it's
very cumbersome to play.

01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:06.100
However, jumping by a fifteenth

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:09.380
or by octave is very
easy to play, okay?

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.980
So it's construing the
sounding forms that come

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:15.050
out of this interaction with
the body are very different

01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:16.350
as a result of that.

01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:20.630
No less facile, no less
eloquent and so on and so forth.

01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:24.730
The other important thing
about the mbira [inaudible] is

01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:27.940
that there's a division of labor
between two performers, right?

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:33.140
So where one performer is playing
on the beat, the other player plays

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:35.850
in the spaces of that beat, right?

01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:38.370
So this is not -- it's
like the amadinda,

01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:41.620
you don't play simultaneously,
you play

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.630
and nest your performance
in this kind of way.

01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:48.050
So where you're on, the
other performer is off, okay?

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:49.860
Let's listen to actually
a solo performance

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.650
by Gwanzuto Gwenzie [Assumed
Spelling] just opening to hear some

01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:55.510
of the rhythmic complexity that
emerges within this environment.

01:21:55.510 --> 01:22:36.430
[ Music ]

01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:39.800
Okay, again, pretty
interesting patterns emerging

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.100
out of this instrument.

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:44.450
They say the mbira players that
there's more that comes back

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:47.960
from the instrument than what they
put in, okay, that something starts

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.180
to happen that's not under
their direct supervision

01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:54.050
and it's music associated
with the ancestral spirits

01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:57.680
and [inaudible] music of
the ancestral spirits.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.750
I want you just to focus in --
this is going to be the last point

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:05.170
for the night and I do appreciate
you staying the course --

01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:10.640
notice that the left-hand thumb
is the one that is charged

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.320
with two manuals, while the right
hand has only got one manual.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.840 position:56%
This is a reversal of the
psychology of asymmetry in the West,

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.140
that we're all righthanded

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:21.490
and our technology is designed
around righthandedness.

01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:23.920
This is in some sense
constraining the left hand

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.210
as being the dominant hand, okay?

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:29.420
That's the first thing to take into
account, there are different ways

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:32.460
of understanding the human body
and we can become just as virtuosic

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.540
in different arrangements.

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:39.450
But the second point is the final
point, is I want you to take note

01:23:39.450 --> 01:23:43.620
of just what could possibly
happen when you're only working

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:47.380 position:56%
with the left hand going up and down
between these two manuals, okay?

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.120
And remember that there's
a second player

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.300
in the spaces of the first player.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.110
And this is where I'm going
to ask you to take a look

01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:58.910
at one more diagram because it's
perhaps the most important point

01:23:58.910 --> 01:24:00.760
of the night, okay?

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:07.420
Which is if the first player,

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.960
the arrows up indicate what
one player is doing, okay,

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.610 position:56%
so the arrows up are when one player
is going ding, dong, ding, dong,

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:17.780
ding, dong, ding, dong,
ding, dong, ding, dong, okay?

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:23.110
So let's say that that is a blue
pattern over here, going up, down,

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:28.010
up, down, up, et cetera, okay?

01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:31.630
The other player -- so that's
arrows up, so I'll just make sure

01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:35.320
that that's the same as what
you see on the PowerPoint.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:40.110
The second player is playing in
the spaces of the first player,

01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:43.450
but let's say the second player is
doing something also very simple

01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:45.250
but a little different, okay?

01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:48.530
Instead of going ding, dong, ding,
dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding,

01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:53.450
dong, he's going dong, ding, dong,
dong, ding, dong, dong, dong, dong.

01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:56.560
We would call that two-four time,
dong, ding, dong, ding, dong,

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.860
one, two, one, two, one, two.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:02.130
And then this one, so one, two,
three, three-four time, okay?

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:04.610
So I'm going to do like a
three-four time in between

01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:08.260
and this one is going
to be in black,

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:10.980
happening in the spaces
so we'll start here.

01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:20.420
Okay, et cetera, okay?

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.870
So what happens is this player is
going down, up, down, down, down,

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:26.190
up, down, down, up -- and this
one up, down, up, down, down.

01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:33.290
But the ear is picking up that
layer, so you might be playing

01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:37.580
like this but the ear is only
picking out the bass line, okay?

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:40.660
Because the ear, this is the
film, this is the movie, right?

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.970
Where these are the slices of
sound that are coming to the ear.

01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:47.870
And so what happens is the pattern
-- I'm going to get a red pen,

01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:50.330
actually, I'm going to
have to redraw this diagram

01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:52.780
because I didn't give
myself enough space.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.670 position:56%
But what I do want to do is show you

01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:57.630
that this is what the
ear is listening to.

01:25:57.630 --> 01:26:00.440
First, that particular
configuration,

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.660
and in the top it's listening
to the other notes, okay?

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:12.220
So I'm going to do this
just one more time, okay?

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:21.840
So we're going up, down,
up, down, up, down.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:35.470
And the other one is going down,
up, down, down, up, down, down.

01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:38.920
Correct? Okay, everybody got that?

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.770 position:56%
This I claim is what we hear, right?

01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:51.980 position:56%
And this pattern could be written as
two beats absent, one beat absent,

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:57.450
two beats absent, none, okay?

01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:05.140
So what I hear is something like
dum, da, dum, da, dum, da, ta, dum,

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:09.210
ta, dum, ta, ta, dum, ta, dum.

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:13.220
So instead of hearing bing, bong,
bing, bong, bing, bong, bing, bong,

01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:18.310 position:56%
which is the first player or hearing
dum, da, dum, da, dum, da, dum, dum,

01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:24.550
dum, what I hear is -- put these
down, too many pens -- [beats].

01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:33.140
Even though each player is doing
something much simpler than that.

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.280
From the perspective
of Western theories

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.880
of meter what was binary time
before, dum, dum, dum, two-four

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.120
or one dum, dum, dum, dum,
three-four, becomes ternary,

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:51.430
becomes dum, da, dum, da, dum,
da, ta, dum, ta, ta, dum, ta, dum.

01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:55.140
Okay, that's the first thing, so
there's a transformation of time

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:59.420
that happens that neither
player is in, okay?

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:03.510
And that an emergent pattern
that appears out of this.

01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:05.290
Why is this fascinating?

01:28:05.290 --> 01:28:08.730
Because if you change
the smallest detail

01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:12.960
in your movement totally new
patterns emerge that are not

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.860
under your direct supervision.

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.700
So if you're doing up,
down, up, down, up,

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.750
down and now suddenly you do what
you teach people from the 101

01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:23.430 position:56%
of improvisation on this instrument,
not up, down, up, down, up, down,

01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:26.750
but down, up, down, up, down, up --

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:29.350
it transforms the pattern
completely.

01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:30.650
Why is that?

01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:32.190
Take a look at the second square.

01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:36.090
The first arrow down is doing
exactly like the diagram up here,

01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:39.210
it's down, up, down,
down, up, down, down.

01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:42.680
Again, down, up, down,
down, up, down, down.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.670
That player has not changed at all.

01:28:44.670 --> 01:28:48.060
The second player instead of
going up, down, up, down, up,

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:52.580
down is going down,
up, down, up, down, up.

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:56.940
The emergent pattern over
here, which that's the form,

01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:00.450
is very different to that form.

01:29:00.450 --> 01:29:03.340
And all I've done is
change my sticking.

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:05.740
So from a vertical
motion I've produced --

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:13.640
this is like typing into a system
and the code gets scrambled, right?

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:16.380
You're not typing what
you think you're typing.

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.490
This is ventriloquized
music, has something to do

01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:19.860
with ancestors appearing, okay?

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.900
This is not how you
would design a system

01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:25.440
for ancestors to appear, okay?

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.730
And the final point is the
very last point of the night,

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:32.230
is that the curious thing about
these patterns is that if you look

01:29:32.230 --> 01:29:36.920
at what emerges from here,
dum, ta, dum, ta, ta, dum,

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.360
and you were to look
at this pattern does

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.690
that appear anywhere
in this pattern?

01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:43.100
The answer is yes, but
six time points further,

01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:48.300
where you see the arrow here, dum,
ta, dum, ta, dum, ta, ta, dum.

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:53.820
So a pattern that is fixed has
managed to dislocate itself

01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:58.010
or be set adrift from the
meter and has shifted over

01:29:58.010 --> 01:30:05.610
or metrically modulated to a place
elsewhere in that pattern, right?

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:07.230
But not in a way that
you might expect.

01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:09.310
This isn't I'm going to start
a canon and then you're going

01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:12.350
to follow me like six beats
later with the same music.

01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:15.860
But rather I'm going to simply
change the smallest detail

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.850
in the way I'm moving my form.

01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:24.490
And suddenly it throws this new
voice into alignment, misalignment.

01:30:24.490 --> 01:30:27.240
In other words, it's not just
the transformation of pattern

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.380
that happens, but it's
transformation

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.560
that recoups similar to it, right?

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.210
A similar pattern reappears
as a phantom pattern,

01:30:35.210 --> 01:30:38.360
but dislocated from
its reigning beat.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.000
Small wonder that the
mbira players are going

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.900 position:56%
to say they hear something more
than what they are putting in, okay?

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:48.750
And what they hear,
what these patterns are,

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:51.720
just like in the ocarina [Assumed
Spelling] is when they start

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.240
to sound like a flute which has
to do something with the harmonics

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.390
and something to do with
these inherent patterns,

01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:58.320
the ancestors come.

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.600
Something is speaking
because now you're typing

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:06.500
into a typewriter making complete
sense, it scrambles the code

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.710
into a higher order coherence.

01:31:08.710 --> 01:31:12.150
It's talking in sentences
but they're not yours.

01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:14.610
And I'll end there.

01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:16.510
Thank you.

01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:24.960
[ Applause ]

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.070
It's eight-thirty so
technically we're at the end,

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:31.820 position:56%
but I'm happy to entertain questions
even if they don't make their way

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:36.650
into whatever the format
this gets delivered in.

01:31:36.650 --> 01:31:38.130
I think the first question
was there,

01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:39.460
so I'm just going to do this, okay?

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:44.520
I've seen five questions, I'm
going to go one, two, three,

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.820
four, five, is that okay?

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:49.330
All right, thanks.

01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:58.790
&gt;&gt; I think you skipped over, I
mean you skipped over a few slides,

01:31:58.790 --> 01:32:06.220
but there was one that
had like [inaudible].

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.520
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yes.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.820
&gt;&gt; So I was wondering?

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:11.250
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Okay,
those are symmetrical patterns

01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:14.730
that are drawn in sand in Angola,

01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:19.040
a tradition that barely exists
anymore, to sonar patterns

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:24.560
where you have to make your way
through a series or a gridded kind

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:29.970
of set of matrix and then find
your way and create patterns

01:32:29.970 --> 01:32:31.920
of imagination and
so on and so forth,

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.830
but they have to be
symmetrical in these ways.

01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:37.770
So it's a trick, it's a
trick, it's a math trick.

01:32:37.770 --> 01:32:41.480
This was actually a secret kind
of group, quite patriarchal,

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.600
and so this is one of the tragedies
though of African mathematics

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:49.910
because the way in which you got
important information was not

01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:52.390
necessarily through this
principle of copyright,

01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:57.290 position:56%
which is how one does it in the
West, but by abolishing all evidence

01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:58.830
so that you can retain authority

01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:00.650
within smaller kind
of secret societies.

01:33:00.650 --> 01:33:04.180
So it's one, it's an area
of great interest and also

01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:08.120
in some sense tragic because how
do we reconstruct these great

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.920
mathematical traditions
when part of the project was

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.760
to eliminate the archive?

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.490
And in the West we can talk
about copyright as a way

01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:20.280
of giving authority to
certain voices and that, too,

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:24.260
is a system that has great
affordance but also limits,

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.930
there are serious limits,
especially if we look at how some

01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:29.260
of the biographies of
these sounds work, right?

01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:33.190
We have this music from
Africa that is authored there,

01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:34.490
but then when it's taken

01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:39.830
up by Western musicians suddenly
it becomes copyright worthy, right?

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:43.060 position:56%
That's another very important
question, but I'll leave it at that.

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.360
That's where that's from, Angola.

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.830
Gerhart Kubek [Assumed Spelling]
writes about it beautifully.

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:50.770
Gergli Legetti [Assumed Spelling],
who is a Western composer,

01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:54.120
also part of the avant-garde, he
was like a highly funded composer

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:58.460
of Europe, drew great inspiration
from these diagrams, as well,

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:02.480
when he Africanized
his piano techniques

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.060
and that's a very interesting new
kind of piano sound that comes

01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:07.560
out of his because
of this encounter.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.860
Hi.

01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:11.520
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:16.570 position:56%
about South African inspiration
[inaudible] where did ancestors come

01:34:16.570 --> 01:34:22.420
up with these rhythms [inaudible]
and everything around them,

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:27.180
somewhere out in the bush,
an orchestra in itself.

01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:33.510
I'm just curious if there's things,
mathematical connection with things

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:39.330
that are in nature that sequence in
with these rhythms that are used?

01:34:39.330 --> 01:34:41.780
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
That's such a nice question,

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:44.540
but it really is too
big for me to engage.

01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.400
And I have to say that
my focus is quite narrow.

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.530
It's deliberately narrow
because of my own biography

01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:54.010
and my own biographical sort
of relationship to the land,

01:34:54.010 --> 01:34:59.190
which means I grew up in
Apartheid and one of the dangers

01:34:59.190 --> 01:35:04.060
of organizing people according
to cultural identities was

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:06.820
that it very quickly
becomes hierarchized.

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:11.720
So I felt very suspicious
about that from the beginning.

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:17.140 position:56%
I could see in some sense as a child
unfolding before me great injustice

01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:21.610
simply because of the way people
were being understood to be.

01:35:21.610 --> 01:35:26.310 position:56%
And so for me understanding Africans
as having very connected to dance

01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:31.260
and embodied and so on was a way
of disavowing the intellectual work

01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.940
that was built into this.

01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:38.550 position:56%
So when the question of
environment comes up I'm a little --

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:43.850 position:56%
I back off a little bit only because
of that, because it's the idea

01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:47.010
that people are more
natural or something.

01:35:47.010 --> 01:35:50.660
However, there's very
interesting work being done that.

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.110
I mean Steven Feld [Assumed
Spelling] has done some very

01:35:53.110 --> 01:35:55.240
interesting work, looking

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.320
at how soundscapes impact
how people organize time.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.880
And you know anybody
who has been to Africa,

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.060
I mean it's an incredible
soundscape,

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:09.530
and just the simple rhythms of
open space are something to behold.

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:12.950
So it wouldn't surprise me if
there's some kind of connection.

01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:17.740
The archaeology and all of those
kinds of questions are extensive,

01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:20.170
you know, how tuning
systems emerged.

01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:22.710
Most of my work that I've done
in this region has nothing to do

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:26.160
with rhythm, partly because
I shy away from the idea

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:30.880
that Africans have a special
endowment for rhythm or something,

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.770
and I use the pun intendedly

01:36:32.770 --> 01:36:35.680
because there's this
cliche that comes with it.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.040
In fact, [inaudible] music
is more noteworthy for me

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:44.260
because of its profound harmonies
and the way harmony works

01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:47.670
through space, which is
a kind of fractal logic,

01:36:47.670 --> 01:36:49.570
which would have just been
a little too difficult

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:51.220
for an open forum like this.

01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:53.470
It's a more strictly
mathematical set theoretical world

01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:56.950
and I would have had to start there
and I would have maybe got a point

01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:58.500
or two across in that time.

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:03.360
So I didn't do it, but imagine
there's no rhythm in African music,

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.510
imagine there's no dance,
and now you're just left

01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:11.590
with certain tuning practices
and harmonies and you get results

01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:15.790
that are even more
mathematically compelling.

01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:17.830
I'd be happy again to talk right

01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:20.570
after if you're interested
in that part.

01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:26.970 position:56%
So I was always drawn to how this
music is thought because the people,

01:37:26.970 --> 01:37:32.300
you know, we were raised in
interesting ways in South Africa.

01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:39.440
I was raised by partly by my
older sister and a maid, right,

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.660
so I didn't ever understand this
as being a kind of distinction,

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:50.470
that I was encouraged to in the
classroom, in our education system.

01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:55.200
Of course, I benefitted
from white education,

01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:01.560
but at the same time my cultural
wires got a little crossed.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.520
I forget who, was it you, sorry?

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.540
&gt;&gt; The last recording
that you played you had

01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:09.450
on the screen a picture of I
guess a finger piano, a kalimba,

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.630
and you called it a solo,
was that a single person?

01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:12.930
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yes.

01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:14.230
&gt;&gt; Playing a single instrument?

01:38:14.230 --> 01:38:15.530
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yes,

01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:19.320
so that's Gwanzuto Gwenzie [Assumed
Spelling], a remarkable player,

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:25.110 position:56%
absolutely remarkable player, who is
basically imitating how it would be

01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:26.800
to play with two players.

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.760 position:56%
So I mean he's just a virtuoso, but
if you put him together with someone

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.900
like Ford Kwinda [Assumed
Spelling] I mean things are really

01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:37.300
just unbelievable.

01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:46.380
You have to tune into it for a
long time before you really get

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:49.790
at what's going on there.

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:55.580
These are all night spirit
possession ceremonies and so on.

01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:58.370
After awhile it does feel

01:38:58.370 --> 01:39:01.040
like everything is just
sort of automated, right?

01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:12.060
It's other worldly in that sense,
but Gwanzuto is just a brilliant,

01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:18.680
brilliant, brilliant player and he
made this recording because he came

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.100
and took a visit to
the United States.

01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:23.660
And you know that's what you do,
you have your CD in your pocket

01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:24.960
and then you do your
concert and so on.

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.700
But traditionally you
never play with one player,

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.850 position:56%
I mean in the context of mbira or an
all-night ceremony you always play

01:39:30.850 --> 01:39:32.940
with a second player
who is locking in,

01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.920
so that the whole thing
becomes much more mysterious

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.570
and phantom patterns can emerge.

01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:38.690
But, yes, a great player.

01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:39.990
I think, yes, sorry?

01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:47.370
&gt;&gt; How are we spelling, if I heard
you correctly, the Angolan tusona?

01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:49.460
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
Yes, t-u-s-o-n-a.

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:50.760
So a short question.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:56.040
&gt;&gt; And also the mbira in that other
slide was I think on the right,

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.050
I wonder where the
other one [inaudible]?

01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:00.350
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yes, okay,

01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:04.830
that is called matepe,
m-a-t-e-p-e, matepe.

01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:09.550
Matepe is, in fact, from the
perspective of fractal logic

01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:11.780
that I've been working with,

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:15.920
an even more interesting
instrument than the [inaudible].

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:17.510
It is less played than
the [inaudible]

01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:21.870
because it's basically what was
once known as the Korekrre people,

01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:23.170
which is a dialect of
Shauna [Assumed Spelling].

01:40:23.170 --> 01:40:24.520
It's actually an independent
language,

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.820
but history has it that ...

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:27.120
&gt;&gt; Korikori?

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:28.420
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
K-o-r-e-k-r-r-e.

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.720
Very few matepe playing
families left in the world,

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.020
but that is I think the Korekrre
region is up in northeast

01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:32.320
of Zimbabwe or modern day Zimbabwe,

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:33.620
an area that once controlled
the salt pan,

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:34.920
which for a landlocked land
is gold, I mean you need salt.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.220
And it was once in my view a
very dominant area culturally

01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:37.520
and then became in some sense
impoverished through the forces

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:38.820 position:56%
of history, let's just call it that.

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.120
And as a result of that the
instrument is marginal today even

01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.420
in Zimbabwe, which is really
interesting and kind of problematic

01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:42.720
because it is I think the source
of much of the fractal reasoning

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.020
in harmonies, but that was
a different conversation

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:45.320
but it's a fascinating instrument.

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.620
Okay, one more question?

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:47.920
&gt;&gt; How different is the
matepe to the mbira?

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.220
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
The mbira [inaudible]?

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:50.520
&gt;&gt; Yes, because you said in the
center you have your low notes

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.820
and the high notes on the side?

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:53.120
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yes, so
that basic principle is the same,

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.420
but you'll see all of the
notes, the note configuration --

01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:55.720
there are many more notes here,
first of all, in most of them

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.020
and then they're organized
very differently.

01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:58.320
[ Inaudible ]

01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.620
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: If
you can play the matepe

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.350
that would be the place to go
because the mbira [inaudible],

01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:03.880
here's the tragedy, remember
I mentioned radio, too,

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:06.890
where they were recording made
for Africans to keep Africans

01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:09.570
in separate developed space,
you know, so radio, too?

01:41:09.570 --> 01:41:13.410
Well, the mbira [inaudible]
the one on the right happens

01:41:13.410 --> 01:41:16.170
to be the instrument
that was the most played

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:19.500 position:56%
in the Colonial center then called
Salzbury and the engineers didn't go

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:22.540
that far, and so there's a great
archive of mbira [inaudible]

01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:25.170
and the matepe sort of
gets written out of history

01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:27.390
because it's a little
too far away to travel

01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:30.510
so there's fewer historical
recordings.

01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:35.060
[ Inaudible ]

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:36.360
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yes, Stella
Chuwachi [Assumed Spelling].

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:37.660
&gt;&gt; Is she still playing?

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:40.690
Because I saw her here,
there was some program,

01:41:40.690 --> 01:41:45.250
and I can't remember the
name and it was all women.

01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:50.910
She and [inaudible] and others
and it was really extraordinary.

01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:56.430
And they say she had to fight
to be able to play the mbira

01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:58.470
because it's traditionally
played by a man.

01:41:58.470 --> 01:42:00.170
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yes, it's
a sort of patriarchal thing,

01:42:00.170 --> 01:42:01.980
but there have been some
great woman performers.

01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:05.430
I mean Beulah Dyoko, who died
recently, but she traveled

01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:08.870
with some really great
players in the '90s.

01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:12.930
Beulah D-y-o-k-o, she died
recently, but a magnificent player.

01:42:12.930 --> 01:42:14.590
I think perhaps better than Stella.

01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:17.430
Stella is kind of a
little more hybridized.

01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:21.430
But, yes, it's a constantly
evolving tradition.

01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:23.690 position:56%
But the one thing that's interesting
is that, as I said earlier,

01:42:23.690 --> 01:42:26.650
as a technology it didn't
change much, like the piano,

01:42:26.650 --> 01:42:29.810
it sort of settled down towards
the end of the 18th Century

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.360
and then it reached
its talus, right?

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.090
I mean it tweaked a little bit,
but the basic technical art lay,

01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:39.080
the interface design remained the
same and it's that that becomes

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.530
such an instructive
microscope into history.

01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:48.060
&gt;&gt; You talked about how
the music was created.

01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:52.780
My question is what did
the dancers do with this?

01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:55.490
Can you look at one
of these diagrams

01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:59.760
and know what the dancers
would be doing?

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.950
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Okay, so
the dancers do different things

01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:05.340
in different places, obviously,
but take for example --

01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:07.980
I'll just have to be
brief so I'm just going

01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.990
to give you an interesting
sort of schematic.

01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:12.500
Remember we started with the
gankogui pipes from Mozambique,

01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:17.940
which was the second thing we did,
but the dancers there remember move

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:20.870
in a way that the instrumentalists
are not playing, right?

01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:22.320
So they're going one,
two, three, one, two,

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.670
three, yafu, yafu, yafu, yafu.

01:43:24.670 --> 01:43:27.420
And then once that is locked in,
once that felt beat is locked in,

01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:29.440
then there are all sorts
of dancers with steps,

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:31.480
such as 50 Boro [Assumed
Spelling], which is a football.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:35.000
But you're feeling it in
four, so you're not doing --

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.430
it's a bit boring, but you
are feeling it in four.

01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:41.490
In the context of the mbira,
which is sort of on, off, on,

01:43:41.490 --> 01:43:43.400
off, on, off, binary, right?

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.820
Daka, daka, daka, daka,
daka, daka --

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.350
and that's kind of basic principle.

01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:50.220
I mean here's a diagram
that makes that apparent.

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:53.670
This is if everybody is
playing exactly the same thing.

01:43:53.670 --> 01:43:55.670
So ding, dong, ding,
dong, ding, dong.

01:43:55.670 --> 01:43:57.820
And the other one ding,
dong, and so but what comes

01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:00.460
to the ear is da, ta,
da, ta, da, ta.

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:03.840
Interestingly, what
the [inaudible] does,

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.200
which guides the dance step is not
going da, ta, da, ta, da, ta --

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.230
now the music is in four, one,
two, three, four, one, two, three,

01:44:11.230 --> 01:44:15.710 position:56%
four -- it's binary, that's why,
but the [inaudible] goes choo, choo,

01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:18.660
choo, choo, choo, choo, choo,
choo, it's in ternary, right?

01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:21.480
And the dancers are going
to move in ternary time.

01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:24.320
So it's kind of cutting across
that again and, of course,

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.760
the dancers become complex but
the basic felt pulse is at,

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.950
how should we say, at
a kind of cross-current

01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:34.130
with the dominant musical
input, okay?

01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:37.070
Again, I don't want to
generalize this Continent.

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:39.170
There are certain features,
you know, it's interesting

01:44:39.170 --> 01:44:42.670
because even just the Nyungwe,
which is close to the [inaudible].

01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:45.670
I mean we've just got a
simple Colonial border,

01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:49.110
almost a straight line
separating them, so they're related

01:44:49.110 --> 01:44:51.900
but they've inverted
that relationship

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:55.500 position:56%
of in the one we've got four against
three, in the other we've got three

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:58.740
against four, broadly speaking
when it comes to the dance.

01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:01.080
But the question of dance
is much bigger than this

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:04.470
and the choreographic supplement
is an important component

01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:06.950
of felt time, right?

01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:10.200
So I mentioned it sometimes and
not always just for time reasons,

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:12.500
but it's a great question.

01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:18.260
&gt;&gt; Is there anything I can
look at or read that talks more

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:19.560
about the dancing, any research?

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:20.860
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
Yes, so my colleague,

01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:22.160
Kafi Agawu [Assumed Spelling],
he's a [inaudible] musicologist,

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.390
he write about Mozart and he writes
about Africa, which is the way

01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:29.070
to do it because then you
understand more the affinities

01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:30.760
and not just all the differences.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:36.420
Kafi Agawu, A-g-a-w-u,
Princeton University,

01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:39.080
has written a book called
Representing African Music,

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:42.920
where he actually raises the
argument that we need to be looking

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.560
at the dance steps if we want

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:49.430
to really understand how
the felt metrics work.

01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:54.010
So, yes, what I was trying to
suggest is that there's a number

01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:59.960 position:56%
of possibilities and layers that vie
for syntax formation and, of course,

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:03.320
what the body is doing is
one layer within that sphere.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.730
Yes?

01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:14.150
&gt;&gt; Can you go back to
the slide [inaudible]?

01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:18.280
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Okay, this
one is interesting because ...

01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:19.930
&gt;&gt; Not that one.

01:46:19.930 --> 01:46:22.450
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
Oh, not that one.

01:46:22.450 --> 01:46:23.750
Oh, this?

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:26.490
&gt;&gt; No, no, the secret, you talked

01:46:26.490 --> 01:46:30.160
about a secret communication
pattern?

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:33.680
What are those?

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:36.930
I must have missed that sentence

01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:42.050
because when I look
at that I see animals.

01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:43.790
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yes,
yes, yes, that's interesting.

01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:49.180 position:56%
So but what they are is symmetrical,
they're sort of geometric shapes

01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:53.220 position:56%
that are uni-linear, you cannot lift
your stick or your pen if you like,

01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.730
as you create a symmetrical pattern

01:46:55.730 --> 01:47:00.400
through a series of
gridded dots, right?

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:04.430 position:56%
And you then emerge with a pattern
and, yes, of course, that's a lizard

01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:06.480
over there and so on
and so forth, yes.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.650
&gt;&gt; So the dots are rocks on
the ground or there's ...

01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:13.410
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Holes
in the sand, holes in the sand.

01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:14.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:47:14.710 --> 01:47:16.010
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: And then
you've got to step your way

01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:19.920
through it without lifting your
stick and come up with a design.

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:22.710
If you think about this
mathematically there's some tricks

01:47:22.710 --> 01:47:24.010
that you have to know.

01:47:24.010 --> 01:47:25.470
&gt;&gt; Okay, I understand that now.

01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:30.010
I wasn't sure if these were
dance steps or notes or what?

01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:32.050
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
No, this I didn't talk

01:47:32.050 --> 01:47:36.070
about because it's visual culture,
all this is is an introduction

01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:39.010
to look, here's that bone, the
ushango [Assumed Spelling] bone,

01:47:39.010 --> 01:47:41.730
and there's evidence that there's
a sort of numerocic thinking

01:47:41.730 --> 01:47:46.340
in the region that predates
most other regions of the world,

01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:48.550
at least in terms of
archaeological evidence.

01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:50.940
I have a softer theory
of this and that is

01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:54.600
that given certain problem
sets people in different parts

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.840
of the world might come
up with the same answer.

01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.870
So I'm not saying that
the piano, which came long

01:47:58.870 --> 01:48:01.940
after the gankogui pattern,
I'm not saying that it derived

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:05.910
from necessarily, I'm
saying thinking

01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:09.880
in a certain set theoretic way with
certain problems and aspirations

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:12.210
in mind might lead you
to the same conclusions,

01:48:12.210 --> 01:48:16.070
but I'm certainly not saying that
mathematics was invented in Europe.

01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:18.440
&gt;&gt; Now that I know what this is
I'm thinking [inaudible] part

01:48:24.490 --> 01:48:24.890
of the world.

01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:26.190
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:

01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:27.490
I think that's probably
the next talk that's coming

01:48:27.490 --> 01:48:30.620
up with The Library of
Congress, but, yes, so fantastic.

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:33.290
I think we should probably
close things up.

01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:36.510
Thank you for the great questions
and thank you for your time.

01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:40.050
