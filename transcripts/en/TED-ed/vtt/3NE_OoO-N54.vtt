00:00:07.038 --> 00:00:09.790
Have you ever been waiting in line
at the grocery store,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.506
innocently perusing the magazine rack,
when a song pops into your head?

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:18.652
Not the whole song, but a fragment of it
that plays and replays

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:23.890
until you find yourself unloading
the vegetables in time to the beat.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.750
You've been struck by an earworm,
and you're not alone.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.640
Over 90% of people are plagued
by earworms at least once a week,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.316
and about a quarter of people
experience them several times a day.

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:41.491
They tend to burrow in during tasks
that don't require much attention,

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:43.838
say, when waiting on water to boil

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:46.149
or a traffic light to change.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.259
This phenomenon is one 
of the mind's great mysteries.

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:52.831
Scientists don't know 
exactly why it's so easy

00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:55.498
for tunes to get stuck in our heads.

00:00:55.498 --> 00:00:57.814
From a psychological perspective,

00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:00.991
earworms are an example of mental imagery.

00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.829
This imagery can be visual,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.006
like when you close your eyes
and imagine a red wagon,

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:07.965
or it can be auditory,

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:10.789
like when you imagine
the sound of a baby screaming,

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.073
or oil sizzling in a pan.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:16.449
Earworms are a special form 
of auditory imagery

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:18.536
because they're involuntary.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:22.650
You don't plug your ears
and try to imagine "Who Let the Dogs Out,"

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.869
or, well, you probably don't.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.728
It just intrudes onto 
your mental soundscape

00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:31.352
and hangs around 
like an unwanted house guest.

00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:33.352
Earworms tend to be quite vivid

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:38.029
and they're normally made up of a tune,
rather than, say, harmonies.

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:42.724
A remarkable feature of earworms
is their tendency to get stuck in a loop,

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:46.678
repeating again and again
for minutes or hours.

00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:51.621
Also remarkable is the role
of repetition in sparking earworms.

00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:56.957
Songs tend to get stuck when 
we listen to them recently and repeatedly.

00:01:56.957 --> 00:01:59.627
If repetition is such a trigger,

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:04.054
then perhaps we can blame our earworms
on modern technology.

00:02:04.054 --> 00:02:07.435
The last hundred years have seen
an incredible proliferation

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:12.706
of devices that help you listen 
to the same thing again and again.

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:17.103
Records, cassettes, CDs, 
or streamed audio files.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:21.058
Have these technologies bread some
kind of unique, contemporary experience,

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:25.778
and are earworms just a product
of the late 20th century?

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.187
The answer comes from an unlikely source:

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:30.091
Mark Twain.

00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:34.457
In 1876, just one year 
before the phonograph was invented,

00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:38.273
he wrote a short story
imagining a sinister takeover

00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:41.972
of an entire town by a rhyming jingle.

00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:43.610
This reference, and others,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.847
show us that earworms seem 
to be a basic psychological phenomenon,

00:02:47.847 --> 00:02:50.911
perhaps exacerbated 
by recording technology

00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:53.219
but not new to this century.

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.471
So yes, every great historical figure,
from Shakespeare to Sacajawea,

00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:01.577
may well have wandered around
with a song stuck in their head.

00:03:01.577 --> 00:03:05.849
Besides music, it's hard to think
of another case of intrusive imagery

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.154
that's so widespread.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.473
Why music?

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:11.668
Why don't watercolors 
get stuck in our heads?

00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:14.236
Or the taste of cheesy taquitos?

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:19.442
One theory has to do with the way music
is represented in memory.

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:21.271
When we listen to a song we know,

00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:26.443
we're constantly hearing forward in time,
anticipating the next note.

00:03:26.443 --> 00:03:31.289
It's hard for us to think about one
particular musical moment in isolation.

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.924
If we want to think about the pitch
of the word "you" in "Happy Birthday,"

00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:36.912
we have to start back at "Happy,"

00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:39.325
and sing through until we get to "you."

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:42.798
In this way, a tune 
is sort of like a habit.

00:03:42.798 --> 00:03:45.436
Just like once you start tying your shoe,

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:48.237
you're on automatic 
until you tighten the bow,

00:03:48.237 --> 00:03:50.546
once a tune is suggested

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:54.362
because, for example, someone says,
"my umbrella,"

00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:58.179
we have to play through until it
reaches a natural stopping point,

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:00.751
"ella, ella, ella."

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:02.907
But this is largely speculation.

00:04:02.907 --> 00:04:08.075
The basic fact remains we don't know
exactly why we're susceptible to earworms.

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:11.131
But understanding them better 
could give us important clues

00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:13.345
to the workings of the human brain.

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:15.111
Maybe the next time we're plagued

00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:18.096
by a Taylor Swift tune 
that just won't go away,

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:22.078
we'll use it as the starting point
for a scientific odyssey

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:25.641
that will unlock important mysteries
about basic cognition.

00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:29.403
And if not, well, 
we can just shake it off.
