Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.380
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Hi,
I'm Gail Shirazi

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.900
of the Israel-Judaic Section
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.510
Welcome to our program
today, Reading Claudius,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.630
a book and author talk
by Caroline Heller.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.000
This event is being cosponsored
by the European Division,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.990
the Hebrew Language Table
at the Library of Congress,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.520
in cooperation with
the Czech Embassy.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.500
I would like to thank Grant
Harris and the European Division,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.250
Audrey Fisher in the
Public Affairs Office,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.600 position:56%
Galena Teverovski [assumed spelling]
and Heim Golchek [assumed spelling]

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.070
of the IJ section at the library,
and Mary Fetzko at the Embassy

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.430
of the Czech Republic, and I'd

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.020 position:56%
like to thank Mary Bisbee-Beek
Caroline's publisher, and of course,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.870
our speaker, Caroline Heller.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.860
Dr. Heller is Director of the
Interdisciplinary PhD Program

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.800
in Educational Studies
at Lesley University.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.000
She's also a professor the in
the Graduate School of Education.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.950
Dr. Heller, has a BA from
the University of Chicago,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.170
an MFA from Bennington College,
and a doctorate in education

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.400
from the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.740
One of her areas of interest is
the connection of reading, writing,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.470
and storytellling to selfhood,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.310
particularly for refugee
populations.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.740
Reading Claudius presents a
vivid and, for me, visual picture

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.170
of refugee life in Europe,
particularly Prague,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.840 position:56%
nd then following it to the Americas
where her family came as refugees.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.330
When I read her book, I felt like
I was sitting, as I told Caroline,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.300
right in the cafÃ©
next to these people.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.200
It let me enter the book,
and that happens so rarely

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.500
with Holocaust literature.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.070
Usually you're reading somebody
else's, but this really,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.300
thank you Caroline, for
making it so vivid and alive.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.510
So I would like to thank Caroline
again, and the floor's all yours.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.950
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: I
have no announcements.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.180
So thank you so much
for coming, and Gail,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.950
thank you for making this happen,
and of all the many sponsors.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.750
I particularly want to thank
Czech Embassy, and you will find

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.820
out very shortly, if you
haven't read Reading Claudius,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.670
what that country meant
to both my parents.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.350
It is crazy-wonderful to be
reading at the Library of Congress.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.320
It is unbelievable really,
and there are people

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.730
in the audience I haven't
seen in a long time,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.100
and I want to particularly
acknowledge Jody Bernstein,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.340 position:56%
who was my mother's -- you get to
know my mother in a moment, but she,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.460
Jody, was my mother's most
beloved American friend,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.020
and Jody that you're here means
that my dad and mom are here.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.320
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.430
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: And I don't
think it's a spoiler alert

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.190
to tell you that Washington DC
is a bit character in the book,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.400
because my brother and
I were both born here

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.630
at George Washington Hospital and
my father's first medical job was

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.620
at Group Health in Washington
DC, which was really the first,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.630
you know, quasi-socialist,
as some people like to say,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.870
medical world in this country.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.900 position:56%
So I just want to make a few remarks

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.120
about publishing one's
first major book

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.060 position:56%
when one is a little older, as I am.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.080
It's a period of incredible
joy and a sense of plentitude.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.390
That of all the people in the world
who have important stories to tell,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.940 position:56%
yours gets published and is found in
a beautiful cover and has a Library

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.820
of Congress ISBN number and
all of those wonderful things,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.780
but in addition, it was strangely
discombobulating, writing

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.690
and researching this
book for so long.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.990
Most people know that that
can be a very lonely time,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.980
but I was unprepared for the fact

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.460
that really publishing a book
is quite lonely, as well,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.980
in that you're alone with this
baby, whom you care so much about,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.190
and it's it and you, and then
suddenly, this beloved organism is

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.070
in the world, and you don't know
who it's with, and you don't know

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.920
if it's cared for properly
and loved, and so occasions

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.790
like this are -- really help a
great deal in that particular sense

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.860
of loneliness, because you're with
the people who have read the book

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.390
or will read the book and all

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.630
of that is really eased
in one's heart and soul.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:03.110
So all of which is to say
thank you again for coming.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.080
Well, my hope for writing
Reading Claudius, it is both small

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.410
and contained to share a
very personal family story.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:23.220
A kind of an elegy, a love letter
to my parents, but it's also big

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.850
and expansive in its own way to
inspire readers of Reading Claudius

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.200
to really think about how thought
and history have over all lives

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.920
in ways that we often don't
fully understand or recognize,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:48.260
and most particularly, for those
of us whose parents or grandparents

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.080
or great-grandparents have
experienced enormous political

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.980
upheavals and dislocations
and sometimes threatening

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.960
to destroy them, as
in my parents' case,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.770
and after which must somehow
re-create their coherence,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.700
their sense of themselves and
their sense of the future,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:17.780
and in the writing of Reading
Claudius, I also recognize so fully

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.810
that they must've, as Gail alluded,
to the next generation and refugees

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:28.490
in America, they must also figure
out how to imagine a future

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.920
for their children in a land

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.760
that they never anticipated raising
their children in because the land

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.170
that they did think would always
be theirs no longer existed.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:48.390
So I recognize that and
adored my parents all

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.790
over again with that recognition.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.670
In my own family's case,
the political trauma,

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.720
the historical crisis
was World War II,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.730
and what was destroyed was my
parents beloved Central Europe,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:14.210
Prague, in their lives at the heart
of that sense of Central Europe.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.800
So Reading Claudius,
as Gail mentioned,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.760
is very much about that
former world, that lost world,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.200
very much taking places in
the cafÃ©s, the coffee houses

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:37.350
that Gail alluded to, where in
that place and during that time,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.590
the sense of the political and
the intellectual and the creative

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.540
and the artistic and the literary
were all somehow one in the same,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:53.880 position:56%
and I think many of us long for that
kind of spirit in the United States,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.640
and in the coffee houses that my
parents and uncles frequented,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.450
it was always, there were day-long
and week-long, month-long debates,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.400
always to the intermingling
with the smell of coffee

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.620
and the abundant cigarette smoke,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.660
and I'm glad that Gail
mentioned how visual that was,

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.110
because I felt I was there, too.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.100
Reading Claudius is
also about memory.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:31.350
I had a kind of an epiphany
about that, about the story being

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.370
about memory, when my spouse

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:41.790
and I saw the Laurie Anderson
play Homeland some years ago,

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.200
just when I was in the throes
of finishing Reading Claudius,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.300 position:56%
and the play opens with birds in the
sky, and it's before there is land.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:58.360
It's before land exists, and the
father and the mother bird die,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.530
and because there's no land,
there's no place to bury them,

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:08.160
and so Laurie Anderson says,
"The daughter bird buries them

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.920
in the back of her head."

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.380
And she says that "This is
the beginning of memory,"

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.590
and I was just floored by
that because I realized

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.690
in writing the book that
I and probably many of us,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:29.430
perhaps most of us, bury our
parents in the backs of our heads.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.360
So Reading Claudius is about that,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.240
and it's about how
all those memories

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.560
and meanings get communicated and
bequeathed to the next generation

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.660
and all that gets lost
along the way,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.180
and in my case, that
was a great deal.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:56.800
So before I introduce the key
players and read a little bit,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.610
many people ask me, "Why
are you writing a book

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:05.790 position:56%
about the Emperor Claudius when this
book supposedly is about Prague?"

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:12.600
and I just want to clue you
in that it's not the Emperor.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.700
Claudius in the title
refers to Matthias Claudius,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.640
and old German poet,
an 18th century poet,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.810
who many Central European
children were weaned on.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.280
Everyone read Claudius's poems.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.470
They're very simple
and quite beautiful,

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.920
and I witnessed both
my mother and father

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.820
in the weeks before they died going
back to a little book of his poems

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.150
that my mother managed to
get out of Europe and read

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:54.750
to each other Claudius' poems, and
that's what inspired the title,

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.830
which my editor, for a long
time, wanted to change,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.540
because she thought everyone
will be looking for the emperor,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.420
and then in the end
Reading Claudius,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.750
it had been Reading Claudius
for so long that she just,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:13.120
she and I both said it's got
to stay Reading Claudius.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.700
So that's how the title came to be.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:23.110
Well, Reading Claudius has
three starring players.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:28.500
In part two of the book, my brother
and I become bit stars, as well,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:35.120
but the three starring players
are my mother Leise Florsheim,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.120
who came to Prague from
Frankfurt, Germany, in 1933,

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.910
just because Hitler
became Chancellor,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:50.450 position:56%
because she was no longer allowed to
go onto higher education in Germany,

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:57.600
and in Prague, she met a
fellow medical student,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.110
who would later become
my father Paul Heller,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:09.890
but while this fellow Paul Heller
developed a very quiet, shy,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:18.920
but very big on Leise, Leise gave
her heart to Paul's older brother,

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.170
Erich, who was already
kind of a literary figure

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:31.840
and philosophy figure among the
young Jewish students in Prague.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.830
He was an aspiring writer
already doing some publishing

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.380
and also the head of the
Socialist Student Movement.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:50.250
So Erich became quite
prominent on the Nazi's radar,

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:55.650
and thus began a combustible
romantic triangle

00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:01.240
that would last a lifetime and
show itself in various ways,

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.330
and that forms the core of the
personal story of Reading Claudius,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.240
and the war itself, of course,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.470
is the air that surrounds
that triangle.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.900
In late summer of 1938,
when the growing power

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.180
of the Nazis made it very dangerous
for German Jews to remain in Europe

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:28.940
at all, my mother got out and
made it to the United States.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.470
Some months later, my
uncle, who as I mentioned,

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:39.290
was quite a prominent
anti-Nazi, fled illegally

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:44.680
across the Polish border and made
it to safety in Cambridge, England,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.910
but a short time after that, and
it was really just a matter of days

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:55.420
after Paul's graduation from
medical school, war broke out,

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.150
and Paul was arrested in
the middle of the night

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:04.000
in the first public round up
in Prague and transported first

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.610
to Dachau then to Buchenwald,
with a year spent in Auschwitz

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:12.870
and then back to Buchenwald, and
all in all, remaining in the camps

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:19.540
for 6 years until they
were liberated in 1945.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.540
In doing research for the book,
I made many trips to Europe,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.530
and in one of those,
I interviewed one

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:33.360
of the remaining surviving friends
of my parents' European friends,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:41.740
and she told me in great detail
about the Sunday afternoon when she

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.310
and my uncle and everyone listening
to the radio that night found

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:53.300 position:56%
out that my father had survived, and
so I want to play a short broadcast

00:15:53.300 --> 00:16:00.740
that was part of a postscript for
the Sunday BBC News this evening

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.150
that no one in the group that was

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.190
with Eve Adler Road [assumed
spelling] knew that this was

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.530
to be aired that evening.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.960
They didn't yet know
that Paul had survived.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.700
&gt;&gt; April 15, 1945.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.040
&gt;&gt; Permit me to tell you
what you would have seen

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.180
and heard had you had
been with me on Thursday.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.360
It will not be pleasant listening.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.120
If you are at lunch, or
if you have no appetite

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.740
to hear what Germans have
done, now is a good time

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.040
to switch off the radio for I
propose to tell you of Buchenwald.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.240 position:56%
It is on a small hill about four
miles outside Weimar, and it was one

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.040
of the largest concentration
camps in Germany,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.090
and it was built to last.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.030
As we approached it, we saw about
a hundred men in civilian clothes

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.050
with rifles advancing in
open-order across the field.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.510
There were a few shots.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.810
We stopped to inquire.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.040
We're told that some of
the prisoners had a couple

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.820
of SS men cornered in there.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.220
We drove on, reached the main gate.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.270
The prisoners crowed
up behind the wire.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.040
We entered.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.530
And now, let me tell
this in the first-person,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.050
for I was the least important
person there, as you can hear.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.370
There surged around me
an evil-smelling stink.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:19.070
Men and boys reached
out to touch me.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.090
They were in rags and
the remnants of uniforms.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:27.060
Death had already had
marked many of them,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.360
but they were smiling
with their eyes.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.760
I looked out over that mass of
men to the green fields beyond,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.320
where well-fed Germans
were ploughing.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.160
A German, Fritz Kersheimer,
came up and said,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.170
"May I show you around the camp?

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.470
I've been here for ten years."

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.450
An Englishman stood to attention
saying, "May I introduce myself?

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.750
Delighted to see you.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.300
And can you tell me when some
of our folks will be along?"

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.040
I told him, "Soon," and asked
to see one of the barracks.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.680
It happened to be occupied
by Czechoslovakians.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.920 position:56%
When I entered, men crowded around,
tried to lift me to their shoulders.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.220
They were too weak.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.250
Many of them could
not get out of bed.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.680
I was told that this building
had once stabled 80 horses.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.000
There were 1200 men
in it, five to a bunk.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.860
The stink was beyond
all description.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.050
When I reached the center of the
barracks, a man came up and said,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.320
"You remember me, I am Patr
Zenkl, one time mayor of Prague."

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.150
I remembered him, but
did not recognize him.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.660
He asked about Benes
and Jan Masaryk.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:34.460 position:56%
I asked how many men had died in
that building during the last month.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.820
They called the doctor;
we inspected his records.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.140
There were only names in the
little black book, nothing more --

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.250
nothing of who had been where,
what they had done or hoped.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.040
Behind the names of those who
had died there was a cross.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.340
I counted them.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:54.160
They totaled 242; 242
out of 1200 in one month.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.120
As I walked down to the end of
the barracks, there was applause

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.230
from the men too weak
to get out of bed.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:07.050
It sounded like the hand-clapping
of babies, they were so weak.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.990
The doctor's name was Paul Heller.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.290
He had been there since '38.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.720
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Well I just
want to read a couple of sections,

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.130
short sections from the part
one and one from part two,

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.570
and then I hope very much
to engage in conversation

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.530
and invite you to ask questions.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:43.720
This first section takes
place in part one of the book,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.110
and it takes place right after
the infamous Munich Agreement,

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:55.440
which most of you know ceded the
Northwest part of Czechoslovakia

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:03.110
to Hitler in order to
appease his thirst for power.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.030 position:56%
Czechoslovakia was quite weakened
by the death of its first president,

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:15.250
and Hitler took that as a moment
to set his sights on new conquests,

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.160
and this was all done
without the permission

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.010
of the new Czech President.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.860
It was a deal that was
negotiated by Neville Chamberlain,

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:30.060
and people who lived, Jews
and anti-Nazis who lived

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.240
in the Northwest section of
Prague had to get out immediately,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.740
because it would be
Nazified within 24 hours.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.990
So my father, who had just
taken a day-long series

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.360
of medical examinations
and didn't know that all

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:50.020
of this was happening while he was
taking his exams, stoked himself

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:56.150
on coffee and rented a cab and
went to the Northwest section

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:02.170
of Czechoslovakia to bring his
mother and his and to safety,

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:07.810
which was presumed to be still a
safe destination to come to Prague,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:14.550 position:56%
and my father grew up in that
Northwest section of Czechoslovakia.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:19.680 position:56%
When Paul arrived at 16
Welmuhlstrasse just before midnight,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.870
the curtains of the Heller
family apartment were drawn.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:28.100
Else Heller was seated on the
sofa in the front sitting room,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.420
which was lit by candles.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.040
There were rumors of bombings, she
told Paul, and she'd been advised

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.770
to turn off all the electricity.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:43.080
She was dressed formally, her long
hair still jet black at 54 gathered

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.590
in a bun at the back of her neck.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.770
In front of her, the marble-top
coffee table was piled with books,

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.660
clothes, and open boxes of
photographs and letters.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.740
On the floor next to her sat
her suitcase and handbag.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:03.100 position:56%
She was clutching a small paper bowl
laminated with pictures of sea birds

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.550
that Erich had made for
her when he was a boy.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.950
"You have to put candy in it in
order for it to be balanced,"

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.250
she said as she looked up at Paul.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.990
Her face ashen.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.530 position:56%
"Kind of like me," Paul said, trying
to bring lightness to his voice

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.000
to avoid frightening
his mother any further.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.430
"I must tell you that
cousin Fanny had yesterday,

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.370
out of the blue, a
tonsils operation."

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.630
she went on, making
conversation, as she always did

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.880
when she was nervous and upset.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.040
Lana and Carl came by and told
me she was in the hospital.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.340
"The cab is waiting.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.830
Mother, we must go."

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.440
"Do you remember when Erich cut
his finger making this bowl?"

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.520
she asked, running her hand
across its bumpy, varnished edge.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.990
"He made a frightful fuss,
a most terrible fuss.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.760
Do you remember that?"

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.380
Else's eyes were cavernous.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.760
"Mother, you'll feel better
once you're in the cab."

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.460
"You must let me decide how
I feel," she said sharply.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.660
"I didn't have time
to withdraw money.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.790 position:56%
I haven't selected what I must take.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.430
I haven't sorted through
father's books.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.790
I cannot go.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.450
Perhaps tomorrow."

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:18.270
She sat stiff and delicate,
her coat draped over her lap.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.780 position:56%
"Mother, we can do that from Prague.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.270
Anny can help us.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.100
She can send things.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.180
Else's eyes roamed over the room,

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.100
turning to the open
boxes on the table.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.130
She fingered Erich's
paper bowl again.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.590
"Have you eaten?"

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.890
Paul nodded.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.710
"But you'll have a bite
of something with me, no?"

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.470
"We haven't the time, mother.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.350
We'll eat at Mina's."

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.370
He stood motionless in front of her

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.850
for several moments then
moved toward where she sat.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.830
"Mother, we must leave.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.220
We must go now.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.220
Please let me help you."

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:58.450
He spoke in a stern and unequivocal
he'd never used with her.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.410
He felt the blood go to
the back of his neck.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.810
Else Heller was a tiny
woman, standing under 5 feet,

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.850
but over that height,
she was solidly built.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.720
Paul put his had over her
forearm, but she rose on her own,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.820
went down the hall to the kitchen,

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.810
and came back carrying
the silver butter mold

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.230
that Alfred's parents had
given them at their wedding.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.990
She added it, along with the
bowl, to one of the boxes,

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:29.290
applied a few drops of cologne
from a bottle in her handbag,

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.080 position:56%
and stooped to blow out the candles.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.490
Without looking at Paul, she laced
her arm in his and let him lead her

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:41.630
down the steps and out the door
into the drizzly open night.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.960
The street, which rarely
saw traffic,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.750
was filled with cars and taxicabs.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.190
The route to Ida's
apartment took them past Paul

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.740
and Erich's gymnasium, and
the candle-lit apartment

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.970 position:56%
where the parents of Paul's
childhood friend, Camillo Fleischer,

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:03.440
the only other Jewish boy in
his gymnasium class, lived.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.100
He wondered what Camillo and
his family were planning to do.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.170
The taxi climbed the hill
past the Komatau Kino

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.460
and the music hall were Paul
and Erich had taken part

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.080
in the children's theater,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.040
and Dr. Fleishman had
conducted the Komatau Orchestra

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.580
and continued past Bobby Komisch's
haberdashery, Mendel's Bookstore,

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:30.400
then across the railroad bridge
and past the old iron ore quarry.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.970
All until that night,

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.460
the unquestioned constants
in Paul's life.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.660
Tante Ida was waiting in the
alcove doorway of her building,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.500
a small suitcase by her side.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.970
She was dressed warmly.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.660
The the tight-laced
collar she always wore

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.350
to Saturday services
visible under her jacket.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.780
"Du Bist so tuchtig, Pauli."

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.980
the diminutive 68-year-old
said in the authoritative tone

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.670
in which she issued
all her judgments.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.730
It was the highest accolade one
could receive from Tante Ida.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.870
Levelheaded, able to
get things done.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.930
Paul put her bag next to his
mother's on the front seat.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.730
The two women sat in back
on either side of Paul

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.080
in their rain-moist fur jackets,
their small spectacles glinting

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.100
in all directions as the cab
followed traffic toward the main

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:32.870
road for what was usually a
two hour ride back to Prague

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.720
but likely would take
far longer tonight.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.950
The windows were open just
enough to let the smells

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.800
of exhaust and wet pavement in.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.250
The honking and screeching
of brakes in the middle

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.400
of the night had a surreal quality.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.360
Else loosened the laces
on her shoes.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.540
Through the rear-view
mirror, Paul could see

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:58.010
in the distance the dim lights of
other [inaudible] towns nestled

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.110
at the foot of the mountains.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.920
No one exhaled a normal breath.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.800
The only words came from the taxi
driver, who talked about God.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.080
That day he'd become
convinced for an absolute fact

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.790
that there was none, he said.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.300
In the silence, he made
weak, worried jokes.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.060
"How can anyone take
the Nazis seriously?

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.730
They march too much."

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.970
Just before dawn, as
the rain was ending,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.390
they arrived at Walter
and Mina's apartment.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:35.440
Grandma Mina, whose sense of humor
was legendary, poured hot coffee

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.300
from a silver earn the
sputtered more than flowed.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.120
"My ribald friends
regard this coffee pot

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.210
as having prostate trouble.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.510
It has a problem.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.700
It has a problem."

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.250
she declared with a
great heave of a laugh,

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.250
pretending like the taxi driver and
like Paul to a sense of normalcy

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.380
that she surely did not feel.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:01.120
She poured thick, pulpy
orange juice, which Paul,

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.320
awakening to his body for the
first time since he'd walked

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.560
out of the examination
hall over 15 hours before,

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.440
drank with such voraciousness,
that it dribbled over his chin.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.220 position:56%
As the sun came up, Mina enlisted
Else and Ida's advice on the cooking

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:22.730
of eggs for their breakfast
and a debate, led by Tante Ida,

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:26.230
about the best way
to fry them followed.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:31.150
That night, instead of returning
to his dormitory, Paul collapsed

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:35.600
on the sofa in the room that his
mother and aunt now occupied,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.730
listening to their short,
shallow breaths as they slept.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.940
The world, which for so long
in his mind had looked one way,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.000 position:56%
had begun to look totally different.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.110
Well, I want to take you from
Prague to Riverside, Illinois,

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:05.310
which is jarring, believe me.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.040
[laughter] This is a
section from part two.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:14.470
Part two was called the Unthought
Known, which implies the degree

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.960
to which children know
what they don't know.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.850
They absorb something that
they don't realize they know,

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.180
and this little section
is called The Brick,

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:34.900 position:56%
and it is about that moment when I
knew something I didn't know I knew.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.750
I became a shark in
the summer of 1957,

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.710
just months after I'd been sick.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.030
I had encephalitis when I was
a little girl and it came right

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.250
after this, or I was
sick right before this.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.780
I'd begun that summer as
a minnow, and then along

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.510
with another 7-year-old girl,
having made the most progress

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.270
in the Riverside Summer
Swimming Program,

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.210
was promoted to the rank of shark.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:07.140
I walked through the
corridor of mandatory showers,

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.640
my bare feet slapping the puddles
gathering on the tiles and stood

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.200
for a moment in the arched entrance
to the pool where the still water

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.790
and the clean, cold
air felt otherworldly.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:23.630
Today, the last day of the
summer season, my mother would be

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.610
in the bleachers watching me.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.740
After the minnows, fish, and
flying fish performed their kicks

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:34.830
and strokes, wrapped themselves in
towels, and joined their families

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:40.040
in the bleachers, the sharks lined
up along the deep end and dived in,

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.250
swimming two lengths of the pool

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.800
in the hushed peacefulness
of the water.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:53.510 position:56%
The feel and sound of my sturdy,
rhythmic strokes filled me with joy.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.390
At the end of our laps, the
athletic director, Mr. Perkins,

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.240
his sports medallion shimmering
in his dark chest hair,

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.680
grabbed the microphone he
used for just to this day

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.730
and announced my name and that

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.590
of the other little girl whose
swimming had most improved.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.700
He knelt down between
us as he explained.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.140
The words amplified through
his microphone that both

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.870
of us would dive into the deep end

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:23.150
and whoever retrieved the 3-pound
rubber brick from the bottom

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:29.330 position:56%
of the pool would be the 1957 summer
champion and receive a trophy.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.880
After that moment, I have no
memory of the other little girl.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:39.030
I dived in, the cold water seeping
on the edge of my bathing cap

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.410
as my arms and hands pulled my body

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.620
down toward the shed
we dark object below.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:49.740
I took firm hold of the brick in my
left hand, allowing my stronger arm

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.710
and hand to power me to the
surface of the pool and my triumph.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.840 position:56%
Mr. Perkins pulled me from the water
and held up the black rubber brick

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.110
to the audience as the
emblem of my victory.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:06.490
To a loud current of applause
coming from the bleachers,

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.230
he then presented me with a trophy.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:12.160 position:56%
A small golden girl with a tiny face

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.960
of barely discernible
features standing

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.660
on a vanilla-white
pedestal poised to dive.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:22.640
My pride was so great
it was almost painful.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.050
Scrunching my eyes against the
light coming through the windows

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.860
above the bleachers, I
found my mother's face.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.740
She was glancing right, then
left, as if seeking confirmation

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.890
from the mothers sitting around her

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.850
that this great event
had really happened.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:44.830
When she looked toward me,
her face was awash in tears.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.820
Even as in a separate corner

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.200
of my mind I replayed
every thrilling stroke

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.530
that have propelled me from
the bottom of the pool, now,

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.060
seeing my mother's face,
I could scarcely breathe.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.570
Her tears seemed earthshaking,

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.410
as if my performance had
represented the clear condition

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.860
of everything she needed.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.490
Before my dive, I hadn't known
that I possessed the strength

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.830
that had won me this
prize, and now in a flash,

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:18.120
I felt my own realization taken
from me, engulfed by the intensity

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.650
of my mother's emotion before
I could claim it as my own.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.100
Trying to hold myself tall,

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:31.240
to step back into the exultation
I'd felt a moment before,

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.220
I smiled at her, but
what I'd felt was gone.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.590
Replacing my pride
came in anguish deeper

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.090
than anything I had words for.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.950
Achingly devoted to her, I did
not have it in my power to think,

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.790
much less to say, "I'm
not really the strong.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.440
I will not always be
able to do this.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.610
I will disappoint you."

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:58.230
It was the first time I
remember wanting to go backward

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:02.300
into tininess, into invisibility.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:07.360
On the drive home, my thighs damp
against the hot vinyl car seat,

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.110
my trophy lying on the seat
between my mother and me,

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.130
the responsibility I
felt to make her happy,

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:19.350
to make both my parents proud,
was too great for my body to hold.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:25.000
I started to cry so hard
that my nose began to bleed.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:39.040
Well, I know it's kind of hard
to come back from being in Prague

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.330
and in the high school swimming
pool with me to asking questions

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:49.780
and conversation, but I really
enjoy that part of this.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.940
So please do feel free
to comment or question.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.240
Gail?

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.800
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: You have to
first of all repeat the question

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.640
for the webcast, but my
question is how did --

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.720
did they talk about it at all?

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.860
In the book, you talk about
some of your research.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.320
Could you talk about how they
talked about the experiences

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.720
and how you filled
in the rest of it?

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.020
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Yes.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.320
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Repeat
the question.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.620
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller:
Gail asked how I --

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:23.470 position:56%
how my parents talked about the past
and how I filled in the rest of it.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:24.920
They didn't.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.750
As Jody knows, we grew
up, my brother and I grew

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:37.360
up in a very Christian Republican
suburban, and my parents,

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:42.650
like so many refugees, particularly
of that time in certainly now,

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:47.390
as well, were trying to
figure out how to assimilate,

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:53.410
and the whole idea of a melting
pot, although I don't think

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:58.840
that was the term in the
50s, was very appealing,

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.170
and they somehow felt they
really didn't need to talk

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.940
about being Jewish or
to talk about the past,

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.980
and that was the way to go forward.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:12.080
So they talked very rarely
what my brother and I knew

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:17.870
or what we were told was that
my father had been a prisoner,

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.360
and the implication was
that he'd been a soldier,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.230
and we just knew not
to ask questions.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.960 position:56%
We were told that our
grandparents, both our grandfathers,

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:36.520
had died of heart attacks, and we
were -- things were coated over.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.910
Tom, my brother and I, never
really knew if this was just sort

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:46.890
of a developing habit,
you know, that my parents,

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:51.390
just little by little things
didn't get talked about

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:57.860 position:56%
or whether it was a deeply conscious
decision to never talk about it,

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.580
but that is how we were raised
until a moment in the book

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.080
when my brother had already
gone to college and I was

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.710
in my later years of high school.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:12.460
One of my classmates
is here from Riverside.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.100
Things started to come out.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.570
There was a moment in
a high school class

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:21.210
when my teacher asked is there
anyone in the class who's Jewish,

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:25.230
because someone, some classmate
whom I was actually very fond of,

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:31.620
had made a virulent anti-somatic
remark, and I felt my blood boil,

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:35.490
and I was a very shy, quiet
kid, and I just wanted

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:39.790
to read him the riot act, and
we kind of started sparring,

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:44.500 position:56%
and my American history teacher
stopped it and said, "I need to know

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.740
if there's anyone in the
class who is Jewish."

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:51.760
and I had a total out
of body experience,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.910
in part because I was frightened,

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:58.770
and in part because I realized I
somehow didn't know the answer,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.140
but again, it was sort
of in unthought known

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.750
that I did know the answer to.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.850
So that was a pivotal
moment, as I remember it.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:12.230
Ironically, I don't remember what
happened after that, if I went home

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:16.220
and said to my parents, you
know, "What's going on here?"

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.830
Funny how the mind works.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:26.540
When they got older, as Jody knows,
more and more came out to the point

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:35.210
where a lot came out, and I was
lucky enough to have my father well

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:39.180
into his old age, and
everything started to pour out,

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.880
this whole scene with my
grandmother and my great aunt.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.660
He said he would have such a hunger
to talk about it that he would come

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.890
out again after he talked about it.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:54.210
He said, "I remember my
mother untied her shoes.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.400
I don't know why she
untied her shoes."

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:03.680 position:56%
and what the cab driver said, and my
mother, who died of a brain tumor,

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.430
and we knew it was
a terminal illness,

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:14.410 position:56%
I taped her stories before she died,
and I have about 12 audio tapes,

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:20.280
but Gail, much of the early
story, I have to imagine.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:26.490 position:56%
I did an enormous amount of research
and have everything kind of down

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:31.030
about what happened, but of
course, what you said about feeling

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:35.310
like you are in the coffeehouse
is one has to add dialogue.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.680
One has to do a bit of imagining
to bring all the textures

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.770
in to make it a story,
and I did some of that.

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:51.460
Although so many of the details
were from my mother and father

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.470
and from someone's
here, Susie Cowan-Evans,

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.780
who knew my uncle very well.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:01.050
He has an archive at
Northwestern University.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:04.820
So there were many
archival records, as well.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.410
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: What did
you do with those tapes?

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:12.130
Did you copy them and give
them to the Holocaust Museum?

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:17.360
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: No, I'm slowly
becoming willing to give things up.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.810
I've given a lot of things

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.800
to my brother's children,
and I will do that.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.630
That's an excellent suggestion.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.420
Other comments and -- yes, sir?

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.530
&gt;&gt; How did you get started
in writing the book?

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:38.010
What was the inspiration
to put it into a book form?

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.400
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: This gentlemen
asked what was the inspiration

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.220
to put it in book form.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.520
Well --

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:49.570
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: I'm just going to
identify who's raising their hand.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.440
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Got it.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:59.550
Yes. There was a pivotal scene when
my mother was dying where my uncle,

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:04.130
and I'd never really -- I knew.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.800
My mother told me when I was
a teenager, late in my teens

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:12.790
that Erich had been her
sweetheart before my father was,

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:18.340
but I had never seen sparks
between my mother and my uncle.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.870
I more felt combustion.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:25.680
You know, not that kind of spark,
but more like anger almost,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.620
that kind of energy, but when
my mother was dying, Erich,

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.510
who lived in Evanston, my mother
died at Evanston Hospital,

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:39.320
came to her room almost
every day and read to her

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.620
from the Claudius book, and that
was a moment when I thought,

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:50.940
where I really registered, there
was this life that was kind

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.880
of the real life, and
I wasn't there,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.440 position:56%
and I registered their relationship,
and I think that I thought

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:03.900
that I need to one
day write their story.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:10.630
Then I went, and one of my
upper-class people, I went,

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:13.550
I always loved to write,
and I really wanted

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:18.120
to develop my writing
chops, and I went to an MFA.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.700
I got a grant to do some research,
and I used the money to get an MFA

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.420
at Bennington, and at
Bennington, I've met Sven Birkerts,

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:32.400
a very fine literary critic,
who was my first teacher there,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.870
and I didn't know who he was, and
so I went to the Bennington Library

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.570
because I thought I should
brush up on my teachers,

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.410
and what do I find the book
that contains, by Sven,

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.890
that contains an essay
about Erich Heller.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:50.730
So I had an enormous
transference with Sven.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:55.700
I could barely speak with him
for the first week at Bennington,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.540
but he was a great admirer
of Erich, of Erich's work,

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:05.940
and he basically said, "You've
got to write this story."

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:11.490
and that's when I really
started in on it.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:17.130
&gt;&gt; I don't know how to
articulate this, but in the book,

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:21.740 position:56%
the letters that were written at the
same time from Erich to your mother

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:26.270
and from Paul really showed
the characters so completely

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:30.810
of the two different men, and I
wondered how you felt about that

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:36.420
when you got privy to that,
because I felt that Erich was

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:41.550
so superficial, even though he
was brilliant, and here's Paul,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.300
suffering and trying to survive.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.020
I was very moved by those
letters, and I wondered,

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:51.970
could letters be sent out of
these concentration camps?

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:53.270
How did they arrive?

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.240
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Repeat
the question.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.540
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Phyllis?

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.840
&gt;&gt; Phyllis.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.530
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Phyllis
asked about the sort of central,

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:03.170
one of the center chapters

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:07.550
in the book that's pretty
much all letters juxtaposed,

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:12.200
my uncle's letters to his
amour, who was a soldier

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:18.350
and my father's diary entries,
and how I came upon those letters.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:22.460
First my -- let me say first

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:27.080
that that was an incredibly
difficult chapter to write

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:33.870
because number one, I didn't feel
as the next generation and I think

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.040
so many people feel that way,

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.080
what right do I have
to write about the war?

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.260
I felt like I could manage
to write about before the war

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.050
and after the war, but
the war is so not mine,

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:51.020
and who on Earth is able
to write well about it?

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:56.530
I also had, from being
my parents' daughter

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:58.390
and not my uncle's daughter.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:03.400 position:56%
So I had, you know, I was very close
to my uncle in certain ways but not

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.860
in the ways I was to my parents,
and I didn't admire him as much

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:12.790
as many people did because of what
I found out, and because of that,

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:16.460
I don't know if I would call
it superficiality, Phyllis,

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.470 position:56%
although that's an interesting term.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:22.260
I would more kind of
a above it all(ness).

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.500
Maybe that is what
superficiality is.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:29.390
He doesn't sort of need to
be like all the rest of us.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:30.690
So I was trying.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:34.480
Of course, when one writes a book,
one has to be fair to everybody.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.440 position:56%
It's not interesting to write a book

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.950
about the difficulty
Caroline has with her uncle.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:45.900
So I decided I needed
to just let my --

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:51.400
let the documentation of those
years come from the people.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.240
Those letters from my
uncle to Graham Story,

00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:01.710
who was his first boyfriend,
spoiler alert [laughter],

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.990
are in the archive at Northwestern.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:13.400
Why the letters from my uncle to
Graham are there, I don't know,

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.310
because one would think Graham's
letters to my uncle would be there.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.880
I think I don't know
why they are there.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:25.030 position:56%
I think in their breakup Graham must
have sent my uncle all the letters.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:29.680
I don't know, but I used
excerpts from those letters.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:35.110 position:56%
My father was on a death march, as
those of you who read the book know,

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:41.440
from Auschwitz back to Buchenwald,
when the Nazis had the delusion

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.190
that they could cover their tracks

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:49.380
and have these horrifying
death marches, and that somehow

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:55.040
that would mask what was going
on in the concentration camps,

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:59.380
and my father obviously
survived that death march,

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.710
but he didn't anticipate that
he would and with great reason.

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:06.750
So toward the end of
the death march,

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:12.720
as the prisoners were being
herded into a barn, my father laid

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:19.530
down under a farmer's calendar with
a pencil tied to it on the wall,

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.680
and he thought at that moment,
"They're going to kill me anyway.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.000
I am going to stuff this
in my pocket and write."

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.300
and he did.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:37.390
I have that calendar, and my
father wrote those notes down,

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:43.760 position:56%
and after Reading Claudius came out,
I got an email from a young woman.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:50.860
Well, my age, very young
woman, in Portland who said,

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.770 position:56%
"You're the daughter of Paul Heller.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:58.550
My father (Mary's father) was
the chaplain," the Army chaplain

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.580
in Bayreuth which is one the --

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:05.340 position:56%
which is the the first place my
father kind of stayed for any length

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.470
of time as he was getting
out of Europe,

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:16.440
and that chaplain had a very lovely
person who was working with him,

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:21.390
and she offered to, you know,
write up, sit with my dad,

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:25.940
and write up those notes,
and I didn't know about that.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.540
Mary told me the genesis
of how they became clearer.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:36.220
Then he translated them and
actually published that diary

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.990
in Midstream Magazine in mid 80s.

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:43.680
&gt;&gt; I mean, it's the kind
of thing that you could say

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.530
that you could only read in a book.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:49.150
When you mentioned the pencil
hanging and the calendar.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.040
You know, I felt it
too, as Gail does.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.740
I thought, "My God, how he
disappeared is like just a miracle

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.730
that he could do that
and that he kept his wits

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:01.590
and wrote all of that."

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:06.770
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, he was not the easiest dad,

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:11.300
as some people in the room know,
but he was an extraordinary --

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:15.450
I mean, of all the
survivors I've met, I can't --

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:19.920
my father was really
quite a healthy,

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.360 position:56%
healthy emotionally in so many ways.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.690
I mean, in some ways, he wasn't.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:30.730
Of course, that experience damaged
him, but he was extraordinary.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:32.030
&gt;&gt; He was.

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:36.610
Very rational and passionate
at the same time.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:38.770
I love that [inaudible].

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.070
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Yes, Marcia.

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.580
&gt;&gt; First, congratulations
on the book.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:43.880
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Thank you.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.860
&gt;&gt; And second it's so
intensely personal.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.990
I'm wondering whether
there were times

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:54.800
when you found it very difficult
to continue writing it, and if so,

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.990
how did you overcome
that and just keep going?

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.430
In addition to Sven's encouragement

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.410
and also the memories
of your parents.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.590
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: I wrote
an essay about my father.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:10.960
It's now -- a version of it is
now the last chapter of the book.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.340
It's called Opti-Lens, when he
was kind of getting diminished,

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:20.530
in part because he was losing his
sight, and my stepmother had gone

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:25.750
on a trip, and so I was alone with
my father, sort of tending to him

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:30.790
for a couple of weeks, and he
was driving me absolutely crazy,

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:36.790
and so I wrote little notes about
his experience trying to learn how

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:42.940
to use a reading machine that would
help him to see, and at Bennington,

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:49.830 position:56%
I was encouraged to really work that
piece because it was quite good,

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:53.380
and when my father
was on his deathbed,

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:57.380
my older brother said,
"Read him that piece."

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.350
And I thought, "Absolutely not."

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.610
It's the sort of warts and all.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:04.800
I don't want this to
be my parting gift,

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.990
but I always do what my
brother tells me to do.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.420
So I did, and in the middle of
it, I thought, "This is awful."

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.500 position:56%
because my father had no expression,
but I sort of couldn't stop.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:21.940
I was in it, and toward the end he
got a little just mischievous grin

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:25.810
that Jody knows so well,
and said, "Caroline,

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:27.550
you should submit this somewhere."

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.990
[ Laughter ]

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:36.230
And I did after he died, and it
was published, and an agent read it

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:41.780
and contacted me, and I got
a contract within a few days

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.890
from Random House,
crazy good fortune.

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:51.680
So I had to write the book,
but that certainly doesn't mean

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.450
that it was in any way easy.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:58.350
I alluded to it with Phyllis's
question about how difficult

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:03.150
that center portion was, and
the whole thing, you know,

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:07.010
the center portion, when I read
my father's death march diary,

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:12.150
and I had read it many times,
it was as though someone were,

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:16.030
for the first time, telling
me this is what your dad --

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.800
it was as though I never
knew anything about it,

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:24.510
the degree to which it absolutely
undid me, what he went through,

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:29.660
and I just -- I thought there
was something wrong with me

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.670
that I would be, you know, be
willing to go into that darkness,

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:40.030
but it was also so
compelling to do so.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.670
So it was very hard.

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:45.720
It was very hard to
write about myself.

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.020
This is something.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:50.580
Part two is all the
idea of my editor.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:55.250
I thought I was done about five
years, four years before I was done

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:59.470
because it's like here's the
story of my parents, and no.

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:00.770
You have to be in it.

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.690
I think it makes it
a much better book,

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:07.020
but I never anticipated
telling my story.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.820
I never anticipated
coming out to the world.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:18.000
It's just the things one does
that the sort of the momentum

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.450
of the words just suddenly you're
in a position where you have

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.580
to do something that you
didn't anticipate doing

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.890
because the story matters
suddenly so much to you.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:35.940
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Anything else?

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.270
&gt;&gt; I have one.

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:39.930
Did your parents ever
visit Czechoslovakia?

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:43.510
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: Yes, they
did, and I was with them.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:45.820
It was in 1982.

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:50.510
It was still under communist
rule, and it was very emotional.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:58.230
My father crazily was detained in
the airport because in that myopia

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:03.100
of the new regime, the
communist regime basically,

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.400
Hitler never happened.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:11.260
It was never -- and he, according
to the police, the airport police,

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:18.230
they had no reasonable record of
why my father left Czechoslovakia,

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:26.370
and he was so pale when
he came out of that room.

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:36.100 position:56%
It was so difficult, so strange, but
that was the worst part of the trip.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:40.000
Then it was just incredible
to be with my parents,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.460
and my mother took me
to the coffeehouses.

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.800
Many of them are gone.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.660
Some aren't, and to be able to do

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.170
that with my parents
was just amazing,

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:53.130
and my mother got sick
shortly thereafter.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.320
So it was such a gift.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.620
&gt;&gt; The house survived?

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.660
They visit that place
where used to live?

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.660
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller: My
father visited his house,

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.330
and there was still his apartment.

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:07.030
There was still a little -- you
could see the imprint of the plaque

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:11.690
that had said -- his Dr.
Alfred Heller, and it was --

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:13.790
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:19.260
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Well, I'd
like to thank you for coming.

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:21.060
&gt;&gt; Caroline Heller:
Thank you so much.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:34.960
[ Applause ]

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.050
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: And if anybody
wants to buy copies of the book,

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:41.160
they're being sold outside,
and Caroline, I'm sure,

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.780
would love to sign them,
and it's really a treat

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:48.250
to have an author come
and talk about her book,

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:49.800
and it was a wonderful book.

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.100
Thank you.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.790
Thank you for writing it.

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:54.590
Thank you.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.830
