00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.625
I'm Julia, and I'm 17.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:10.191
My parents are from Argentina,

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:13.195
and I've grown up in Manhattan my whole life

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.843
and go to school in the Bronx.

00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:17.865
I think a lot of high schools

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.674
are trying to get their students

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:21.138
into the best colleges.

00:00:21.138 --> 00:00:23.778
And because the way students are being measured

00:00:23.778 --> 00:00:25.978
is through numbers that are so harsh,

00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:28.752
I think public schools are killing creativity.

00:00:28.752 --> 00:00:31.620
They're quantifying students.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.459
Students are only given an incentive

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:35.090
to learn for a good grade,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.122
but nothing more.

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.927
I probably just skim the surface

00:00:38.927 --> 00:00:42.193
just to pass exams a lot of the time.

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:44.176
'Cause what you hear mostly in the hallways

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.266
are what projects are due,

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.197
what grades you got,

00:00:46.197 --> 00:00:48.203
how you're going to fit it all in your day.

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:51.440
And, in class, half the students have their head down sleeping

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.447
because they've been up all night

00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:56.419
trying to study for their exams.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:00:59.429
The only support we really get

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.433
is from our guidance counselors

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:02.764
about which college to apply to,

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:04.183
what classes to take.

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:07.182
"You need an AP science if you want to go to nahdahdah."

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:09.158
But that's not me.

00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:15.350
I'm very, very much engaged in art history

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.284
and 'mic/mac', which is micro/macroeconomics.

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:20.312
Both the teachers are extremely intelligent,

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:26.321
and they like to talk about what they know about the subject.

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:28.584
My 'mic/mac' teacher, he sits at his desk,

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:30.660
and he gives not only all his opinions,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.095
but all the videos he's watched,

00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:33.495
all the articles he's read,

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:35.098
everything that's going on right now

00:01:35.098 --> 00:01:36.265
that's somehow related,

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:37.934
and pulls everything out of the air

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.876
and brings it all in to the topic that we're talking about,

00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:42.639
which will not be tested on

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.984
but makes the topic something real.

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:48.742
I never imagined myself to enjoy economics.

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:53.812
The best way I learn is in an actual, hands-on experience,

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:57.124
something that can bring me out of the classroom.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.047
I think the best kind of education

00:02:02.047 --> 00:02:03.857
is one that teaches you how to speak

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.321
and think for yourself.

00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:07.392
That's much more valuable

00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:10.601
than just passing your exams.
