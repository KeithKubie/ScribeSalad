00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.984
- [Voiceover] So we've
got a rectangle here,

00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:03.711
it's five-ninths of a meter tall,

00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:05.438
and seven-eighths of a meter wide.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.597
What is its area?

00:00:06.597 --> 00:00:07.571
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:09.340
to think about that.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.436
Well one way to think about it,

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:12.368
is you can say our area,

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:16.061
our area is just going to be
the width times the height.

00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:18.235
We're just going to multiply
these two dimensions.

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:21.708
And so the width is
seven-eighths of a meter.

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:25.568
So it's going to be
seven-eighths of a meter

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:29.267
times the height, times the height

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:32.680
which is five-ninths of a meter.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.178
Times five-ninths of a meter.

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:36.621
And what's that going to get us?

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.835
Well, that's just going
to be equal to the meters

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:43.630
times the meters give us square
meters, so meters squared.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.911
We could write it like that.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.287
And then we're going have,
and then we're going to have

00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:50.497
seven times, this in a new color,

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:55.497
we're going to have seven
times five in the numerator

00:00:55.578 --> 00:00:59.702
to get us 35, and then in the denominator,

00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:04.702
in the denominator we are
going to have eight times nine

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.710
to give us 72.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.503
And we'd be done.

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:09.494
This is the area of this rectangle here.

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:13.497
It's 35-72nds of a square meter.

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:15.102
What I want to do now is
think a little bit deeper

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:16.910
about why that actually makes sense.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.044
Or just really another
way of thinking about it.

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.770
And to do that, what I'm going to do

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.770
is I'm going to split this
region into equal rectangles.

00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:28.612
So let's split it into equal rectangles.

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:32.980
And we see that we have seven,
if we go in the horizontal

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.479
direction we have one,
two, three, four, five,

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.674
six, seven or you could say
in each row we have seven

00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:39.137
of these rectangles.

00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:42.367
In each column you have
one, two, three, four, five

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.810
of these rectangles.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.512
So you can see we have
five times one, two, three,

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:48.605
four, five, six, seven.

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:51.470
So we have five times
seven of these rectangles.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.470
So, we have--so 35, we have 35 rectangles.

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:00.996
I'll just write this, 35 rectangles.

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:04.354
And what's the area of
each of those rectangles?

00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:07.707
Well, if this is
seven-eighths meters wide,

00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:10.165
and this is divided into
seven equal sections

00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:14.614
in the horizontal direction,
that means that each of these

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:18.515
is exactly one-eighth of a meter wide.

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.645
And by that same logic, each of these,

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:23.371
if this whole thing is five-ninths,

00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:26.033
and the height of each
of these is one-fifth

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:29.873
because we have five
rectangles per column,

00:02:29.873 --> 00:02:32.107
then the height of each
of these is going to be

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:34.179
one-ninth of a meter.

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:39.077
So what's the area of just
this character right over here?

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:40.661
Well, it's going to be
one-ninth of a meter

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.814
times one-eighth of a meter.

00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:46.879
So this area, this area right
over there is just going to be

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.836
one-ninth of a meter times
one-eighth of a meter

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:54.396
which is equal to one times one is one,

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:57.443
nine times eight is 72,
and meters times meters

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.088
is square meters.

00:02:59.088 --> 00:03:01.079
So the area of each of these 35

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.092
is one-72nd of a square meter.

00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:05.753
So, if I say 35, so the
area of all of them combined

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:08.637
is going to be 35 times
the area of each of them.

00:03:08.637 --> 00:03:11.706
35 times one-72nd of a square meter.

00:03:11.706 --> 00:03:13.066
And what's that going to be?

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.667
Well, that's going to be
exactly what we got up here.

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:19.182
35 times one-72nd of a
square meter is going to be

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:24.182
35, 35-72nds of a square meter.

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:31.474
And this 35 is the same
one that we had in yellow.

00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:33.302
That's this one right over there.

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:35.293
So once again, you can
just multiply five-ninths

00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:37.792
times seven-eighths to
get what we have got here.

00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:39.947
But hopefully when we
thought about the area

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:41.511
of each of these rectangles,

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:43.095
it might make a little
bit more intuitive sense

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:45.478
where this number came from.
