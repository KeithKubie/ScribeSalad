00:00:01.168 --> 00:00:03.570
And the Internet has been
teeming with fresh allegations

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:04.972
of ties
between the Russian government

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.641
and Ziploc bag full of pee,
Donald Trump.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.210
Rumors are swirling about
everything from Russian servers

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.379
communicating with the Trump
Organization to allegations

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.181
that the Kremlin
is blackmailing him with

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.384
a secretly-recorded sex tape
of him in a Russian orgy.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.752
-(audience groaning)
-Yuck! Well, to be fair...

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.787
To be fair, he didn't know
it would be an orgy.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.023
He was just having sex
with one Russian woman,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.925
and then, there ended up being
four other women inside of her,

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.027
-so it's not really...
-(laughter)

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.062
-(cheers and applause)
-Easy mistake.

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.864
Totally easy mistake.

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:33.634
But... but
as deliciously scandalous

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.502
as these rumors sound,
as of right now,

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.171
the FBI has found
no clear connection

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:38.572
between Trump and Russia.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.241
The rumors have no hard proof,
and it kind of feels like

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.776
a last-ditch effort
to throw anything imaginable

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.411
at him to see what sticks.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.879
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:47.514
He's still
a glowering hemorrhoid.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.750
But all of this is distracting

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.986
from the stuff he actually does
and also the upcoming election.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.788
So, comedians,
since we're not verifying

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.757
our sources here
and throwing out wild things

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.492
that have no basis in anything,

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.161
what have you heard about Donald
Trump's connections to Russia?

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.797
-Janet. -Um, I heard
they have these totally crazy

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.000
slumber parties where Putin,
like, braids his comb-over,

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:09.837
and then they, like, eat ice
cream right out of the carton!

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.238
-(screaming)
-HARDWICK: Oh, my God,

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.006
they're the best of friends.
Points. Points.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.541
Dana Gould.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.878
He loves Russia so much
that once at The Comedy Store,

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.479
he offered
to Yack-off Smirnoff.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:21.548
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.683
Very well played.

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.585
-VARNEY: Poor man.
-Nate.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.453
Putin gave him a tour
of his submarine,

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:26.553
-and Trump said it's "huge."
-HARDWICK: Yeah. Points.
