00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.023
- [Voiceover] We're told
that each square below

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:03.533
represents one whole.

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.622
So this square is a whole,
this is another whole,

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:07.179
so together that's two.

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:09.663
And then we have
something less than whole.

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:13.146
And they say what decimal is
represented by the shaded area?

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.677
So it's going to be
two and then something.

00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:18.626
So it's going to be two point something.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:20.042
And let's think about
what we have over here.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.946
This is one whole, two wholes.

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:24.059
And then over here, we've taken a whole

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.032
and we've divided it into one, two,

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:29.330
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.791
nine, ten equal sections.

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:33.927
So we've divided it into tenths.

00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:36.689
Each of these bars is equal to a tenth

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:38.571
and we have seven of them shaded in.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.474
One, two, three, four,

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.029
five, six, seven.

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:45.699
So this right over here is seven tenths.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.650
So this is going to be one, two,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.786
and seven tenths.

00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:52.108
So, if we wanted to
write it as mixed number

00:00:52.108 --> 00:00:54.057
we'd write it as two and seven tenths,

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:56.026
but they say what decimal is represented

00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:57.418
by the shaded area?

00:00:57.418 --> 00:00:59.671
So instead of writing
two and seven tenths,

00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:02.109
we could write 2.7.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.384
Because the space immediately to the right

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:07.216
of the decimal points,
that's the tenths place.

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:10.538
So we have two ones, two
wholes right over here.

00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:14.322
And then we have seven tenths,
this is the tenths place.

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:15.623
And we could check out answer.

00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:16.714
We got it right.

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:18.804
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:18.804 --> 00:01:19.709
So the same thing.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.008
What decimal is represented
by the shaded area?

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:23.726
So we have three wholes,

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:26.489
and then this whole is
divided into tenths,

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:28.440
now it's divided into these vertical bars.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.739
We have one, two, three, four,

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:33.780
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.709
vertical bars.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.985
They're equal, so they're
divided into tenths,

00:01:36.985 --> 00:01:38.587
and we've shaded in five of them.

00:01:38.587 --> 00:01:40.652
So this one over here is five tenths.

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:43.556
So it is three wholes and five tenths.

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:45.715
So it's going to be three wholes

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:48.756
and in the tenths place we would put five.

00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:53.075
3.5, three wholes and five tenths.

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:54.445
We can check our answer.

00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:55.467
Got it right.

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:57.008
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.936
What decimal is being
represented by the shaded area?

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:03.770
So over here, let's see,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.139
I have a hundred squares.

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.691
You see I have 10 columns

00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:11.874
and each of them has 10 squares in it,

00:02:11.874 --> 00:02:13.963
so 10 times 10 is 100.

00:02:13.963 --> 00:02:16.262
So I have 100 squares here, equal squares,

00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:18.096
so I've divided it into hundredths,

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.722
and I've shaded in one, two, three, four,

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:25.134
five, six, seven, eight,
nine of the hundredths.

00:02:25.134 --> 00:02:26.387
Hundredths.

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.152
So how do I represent that?

00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:30.404
So zero, that's the ones place.

00:02:30.404 --> 00:02:32.841
That's the tenths place.

00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:35.025
And now I'm in the hundredths place.

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:38.787
And so we have nine of
the hundredths shaded in.

00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:42.060
So this right over here
would be nine hundredths,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.150
which is exactly what we have there.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.590
Alright, let's do,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.641
let's do one more of these.

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:50.642
Alright, well it's the same thing.

00:02:50.642 --> 00:02:53.358
We have two of the hundredths filled in.

00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:54.984
So I'll write zero point,

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:56.725
if I did that that would be two tenths.

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:57.793
That's not what we have filled in.

00:02:57.793 --> 00:02:59.535
We have two hundredths.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:01.624
Hundredths filled in.

00:03:01.624 --> 00:03:04.756
So this is 0.02 and we're done.
