00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.210
Fortune Cookies Were Invented in Japan, Not
China

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.149
The commonly held notion that Fortune Cookies
were invented in China typically comes from

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.000
the fact that they are primarily served in
Americanized Chinese restaurants.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.510
However, you will not find fortune cookies
in actual Chinese restaurants, nor will you

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.050
find historical records of a similar food
item in China.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.740
The largest manufacturer of fortune cookies,
Wonton Food, based in New York, even once

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.980
tried to introduce fortune cookies to the
Chinese in the late 1980s.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.189
After three years, they gave up, as they simply
weren’t a popular food item there.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.710
Most people, who know they were not invented
in China, typically think they were invented

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.859
in America, which is reasonable enough, considering
they are primarily consumed in America.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.859
This is closer to the truth, but still not
quite there.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.850
The various people who are often credited
as having invented fortune cookies, in almost

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.120
all credible cases, were Japanese immigrants
to America.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
Thus, fortune cookies are sometimes humorously
referred to as “A Chinese food invented

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.700
by the Japanese in America”.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.739
As it turns out though, fortune cookies were
actually invented in Japan, which is probably

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.470
why there are so many credible stories of
Japanese immigrants in the early 20th century

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.159
supposedly “inventing” fortune cookies.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.729
In fact, they simply brought them over from
Japan.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.420
This fact was only proven a couple decades
ago in a discovery by researcher, Yasuko Nakamachi,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.210
who encountered a fortune cookie-shaped cracker,
called a Tsujiura Senbei, made by hand in

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.560
a family bakery (Sohonke Hogyokudo), near
a Shinto shrine outside of Kyoto, Japan.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.219
This “cracker”, not only looked like a
fortune cookie, it also contained a fortune,

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.800
called an “omikuji” (fortune slip), and
was traditionally sold in shrines and temples.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.650
These crackers are cooked by pouring batter
into waffle-iron-like molds and then holding

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.010
the irons over coals.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.170
While the cracker is still warm, little pieces
of paper containing a message are folded within.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.020
This all lead to research on exactly when
these crackers first started being made, to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.320
see if they predated when the fortune cookies
first started showing up in America.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.810
One of the earliest documented definitive
references can be found in an 1878 image of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.960
an apprentice baker making these fortune cookies
in a bakery.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.080
Not only was the apprentice baker depicted
making these cookies, but he was making them

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.010
exactly as they were being made by the bakery
Nakamachi observed them being baked at outside

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.230
of Kyoto.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.430
This image was found in the 19th century book
of stories, “Moshiogusa Kinsei Kidan”,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.670
and pre-dates fortune cookies popping up in
America by about two to three decades.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.730
Going back even further than that, there is
a reference in a book, from the early 19th

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.959
century, where a woman tries to placate two
other women with a cracker that contains a

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.340
fortune inside.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.410
Interestingly, descendants of two of the first
bakeries to make fortune cookies, including

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.080
one that has been in operation for about a
century in America, still possess the original

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.709
black iron “kata” grills their ancestors
used.

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.780
These grills are nearly identical to the ones
being used by the bakeries outside of Kyoto

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.599
and which also mirror the one depicted in
the 1878 image of the apprentice baker.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.560
So fortune cookies were brought to America
from Japan by Japanese immigrants.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.560
How then did they end up in Americanized Chinese
food restaurants?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.770
There are a few plausible theories out there,
but nobody knows for sure.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.560
After World War II, it is well documented
that fortune cookies were almost exclusively

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.629
being served in Chinese restaurants in California.

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.580
From there, they spread to nearly all Chinese
restaurants in America and a few others in

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.260
Europe and South America.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.220
According to fortune cookie makers from that
era, the spread from California to the rest

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.390
of America was instigated largely by soldiers
returning home from Pacific Theater of Operations

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.700
(PTO).

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.810
When soldiers went home, they requested fortune
cookies from their local Chinese restaurants,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.840
like they had found in California, and thus
the spread.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.230
Further, during WWII, over 100,000 people
who were of Japanese decent were locked up

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.940
in internment camps; among them were many
of the Japanese bakers who made fortune cookies.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.519
Also, things associated with Japan, such as
Japanese restaurants, weren’t too favorably

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.599
thought of at the time.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.269
So a combination of many of the Japanese restaurant
and bakery owners and workers being locked

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.489
up and the unpopularity of things associated
with Japan left fortune cookies to be primarily

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.430
found in Chinese restaurants by the soldiers.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.360
This also created a vacuum in the manufacturing
of fortune cookies, as many of the Japanese

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.660
manufacturers of fortune cookies were in internment
camps.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.680
Thus, many Chinese bakeries took over in the
production of fortune cookies.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.500
Another theory is simply that the Japanese
bakers themselves were perfectly willing to

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.910
sell to any restaurant that wanted to buy.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.130
Chinese cuisine typically doesn’t have any
dessert items, thus it is plausible that the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.110
fortune cookie caught on more with Chinese
restaurants because it made for a nice cheap

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.800
dessert to add to the menu.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.870
Also, in the early 19th century, many Japanese
immigrants opened Americanized-Chinese restaurants

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.640
as Americanized-Chinese cuisine tended to
be more popular than traditional and even

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.370
Americanized-Japanese cuisine to Americans.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.290
Bonus Facts:
• Fortune cookies are typically made primarily

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.390
from flour, sugar, vanilla, butter, and oil.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.690
The original Japanese version was made from
the same basic ingredients except they substituted

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.620
sesame for vanilla and miso for butter.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.870
They were also traditionally much larger than
we see them today, even among the early versions

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.690
presented in America.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.190
• The popular claimants to have been the
supposed “inventors” of the fortune cookie

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.880
include: Makoto Hagiwara, who was a Japanese
immigrant who oversaw the construction of

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.320
the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.720
Visitors to this garden were served fortune
cookies made by Benkyodo, a Japanese bakery,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.420
as early as 1907.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.910
Despite the fact that he purchased them from
the Benkyodo bakery, Makoto Hagiwara is often

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.990
given credit for inventing them.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.220
Another claimant is Chinese immigrant David
Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.460
in Los Angeles.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.790
He said he created them in 1918.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.270
Unfortunately for him, there are documented
cases, such as Makoto Hagiwara, serving them

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.100
before that date, even besides the documented
instances in Japan before this.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.960
In his story, he said he was concerned about
the plight of the poor he saw wondering near

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.240
his shop, so created the cookie with inspirational
messages, such as scripture, embedded inside

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.220
and gave them away to these poor for free,
to both feed them and help lift their spirits.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.490
Probably the most credible claimant to be
the first to introduce fortune cookies to

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.570
America was Seiichi Kito, the founder of the
Fugetsu-do bakery, which is still in operation

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.570
today.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.260
Kito said that he got the idea from the cookies
sold in Japanese temples which contained fortunes

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.510
and that he very slightly modified the Japanese
recipe to fit American tastes better.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.480
He then proceeded to sell them to restaurants
and they caught on best among Chinese restaurants

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.240
in LA and San Francisco.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.660
His story closely matches the results of the
recent research done by Nakamachi, which was

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.180
done after Kito’s death.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.270
• The practice of putting paper with messages
on it inside food was actually fairly common

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.380
in certain regions in Japan at one time, particularly
in candies.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.990
This practice was later abandoned as many
people would eat the candy or baked product

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.330
without knowing there was a piece of paper
with a message inside the food item.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.800
• Until the 1940s, fortune cookies were
known as “fortune tea cakes”.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.610
• Edward Louie invented the world’s first
fortune cookie folding machine, which allowed

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.650
fortune cookies to be massed produced for
the first time.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.320
Before his invention, fortune cookies were
all folded by hand.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.190
In the 1980s, Dr. Yongsik Lee invented the
world’s first fully automated fortune cookie

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.190
machine.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.320
This machine works by pumping the batter into
small heated grills.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.960
After a few minutes of baking the batter,
a fortune message is laid on top of the baked

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960
batter.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.840
Clamps then close the cookies and form the
shape of the fortune cookie.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.380
After this, the cookies are cooled and then
packaged.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.200
• Chop suey, which translates to “break
into many pieces”, is commonly held to be

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.550
a “Chinese” food invented in America.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.040
However, this is incorrect.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.100
It was invented in Taishan, which is a district
of Guangdong Province, China.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:53.440
So it is a Chinese food invented in China…
oddly enough.
