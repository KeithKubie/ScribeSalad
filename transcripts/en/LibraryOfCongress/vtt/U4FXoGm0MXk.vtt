00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.090
my first meeting right after the
swearing-in was a briefing on the Book

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.180
Festival and i felt like i was at the
command center

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:45.150
it was something and it was filmed by
CNN so you might see it this weekend the

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.580
beautiful image you see behind me is our
festival poster it was designed by yuko

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.360
shimizu and she wanted to convey the
idea that books take us on journeys they

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.550
open up a world of possibilities they
make us ask questions and encourage us

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.150
to look for answers they are essential
to the human experience and I remember

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.240
my parents giving me books when I was a
little girl and i remember vividly the

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.350
moment when I realized those symbols on
a page or words words that translated

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.800
into ideas and stories and I was hooked
reading and a love of reading literally

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.050
changed my life and as Frederick
Douglass said once you learn to read you

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.260
will be forever free you will be free to
explore to dream and make your own

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:48.240
history are wonderful festival
co-chairman the patriotic philanthropist

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.820
david rubenstein was also touched by the
powerbooks when he was growing up in

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.320
Baltimore his dad would send him to the
any prep free library I know a little

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.560
something about that place

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:07.580
where he would check out the maximum
number of books aloud each week 12 he

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.280
finished before the week was out and he
has said that the ability to read and

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.470
the love of reading quote got me where I
am today and he's called reading one of

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:25.970
the joys of my life and david i do
second that emotion but celebrating

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.350
reading as you Nate has enabled us to do
with his extraordinary support of the

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.590
national book festival is only a part of
his mission

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.250
he's also troubled as many of us are by
the persistent struggles in our country

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.950
and around the world with the literacy
his dedication to make sure every child

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.560
and adult shares the opportunity and
experience of reading moved him to

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.870

United States and the world

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.430
I think there's a video

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.940
here at the library of congress it's our
mission

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.090
to provide the American people with the
wrench diverse enduring source of

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:15.400
knowledge and the ability to read and
write is critical to fulfilling that

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.850
mission

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.320
it's why we support the thousands of
organizations around the world

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.330
care and less likely to go to an
emergency global women and girls were

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.320
educated at fewer children

do have are twice as likely to survive
everyone benefits from literacy for

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.240
every one percent increase in the
country's literacy rate there's a

domestic product

thank you very much my mother did not
make that movie I i I'm going to I just

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.910
express on behalf of all Americans are
delight that carl hayden is now the

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.910
library of congress

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.190
obviously we've had a lot of great
librarian of Congress but somehow we've

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.610
never had a woman be library Congress
we've never had a person of color the

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:40.050
library Congress library of congress and
now we have a perfect combination so I

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.920
think it's long overdue and we have a
person who is extraordinarily interested

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.700
in books

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.980
she has also some other features that i
can't resist mentioning she came from

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.980
Baltimore where I'm from

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.750
she was the head of the Enoch Pratt
library which gave me my first library

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:04.920
card she has a graduate degree from the
university of chicago as do i and she

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.720
loves to read books and encourage other
people to read books and no quality

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.960
could be more important in the library
of congress so Carla we're very much

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.210
indebted to your for taking this job at
a salary decrease from what you had in

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:23.160
in Baltimore but the public service is
very important and you will be rewarded

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:32.820
in heaven no doubt for having done this
I realize all of you came to hear about

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.580
the National Book Festival and it's
spectacular

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.270
it's an incredible event it was
conceived of 16 years ago really with an

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:45.360
idea that Laura Bush at the at the
inauguration inaugural events is Jim

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.270
Billington the library of congress if
you have a national book festival she

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:53.370
had one of Texas and he said no but
we'll get one and laura bush and he put

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.150
it together

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.990
it's now incredible event with more than
a hundred thousand people will be there

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.890
tomorrow

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.940
more than a hundred twenty-five authors
Maria has lined up spectacular groups of

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.320
authors many of you were here just as an
American I want to thank you for taking

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.310
the time to come here because you can't
imagine how many people are delighted to

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.840
meet the authors to hear them read from
the book still have questions of them

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.740
and to get autographs from them it's a
spectacular event and as and as the

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.720
library and said it's free and so it's
going to be a great event for those who

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.060
haven't been there yet you will never
really forget this event we normally do

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.840
right go right into her talking to have
some authors and they will you hear them

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.560
in a moment but we just thought tonight
would be a good idea just to remind all

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.250
of you who love books and everybody here
loves clocks and loves reading books

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.090
and loves making certain that other
people are encouraged to read books that

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:51.420
we are a majority but not as much a
majority as we should be

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:56.730
it's hard to believe this but roughly
fourteen percent of americans in our

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.430
country the richest country in the world
cannot read they're illiterate

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.000
functionally illiterate maybe they can
read a stop sign maybe they can sign

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.990
their name a bit but they can't really
read past the third grade level that's

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:11.070
fourteen percent of americans
one-seventh of Americans if you are

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:16.440
illiterate you have a very modest chance
of joining life so many people who

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.670
cannot read earn much less on average
about forty percent less than people who

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.060
are literate but there are other
problems if you cannot read you have a

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.880
much greater chance of going into our
criminal justice system

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.600
eighty-five percent of juvenile
delinquents are illiterate and roughly

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.260
two-thirds of all the people in our
federal prisons and state prisons are

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.760
illiterate so obviously if you cannot
read is a big disadvantage in our

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.440
country's his country's ability to give
people the joy of living that they

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.890
should get and the end and live up to
all the freedoms that this country is

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.570
supposed to be about

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.470
so it's a sad situation but it's another
situation is just as important to me and

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.700
that's something called a literacy
literacy which means people can read but

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.960
she was not to do so this is hard to
believe but roughly thirty percent of

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.630
people who graduate from college never
read another book hard to believe and

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.560
it's also hard to believe but it's also
true that roughly fifty percent of

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.370
americans have not been in a bookstore
or bought a book in the last five years

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:19.320
also hard to believe that roughly
twenty-five percent of americans all

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.810
Americans have not read a book in the
last year now this is sad because all of

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.200
us know that the pleasure of books is
that it brings you in a different world

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.100
it can take you as it did for me from a
modest background into somebody who

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.520
really enjoys books can be people all
over the world can have a much richer

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.980
life so as tomorrow you are at the
National Book Festival and as you hear

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.940
the authors tonight I just like
everybody to think for a moment what can

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.560
you do to help improve literacy in this
country illiteracy and all the other

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.500
receipt to just think about it in
addition to writing books reading books

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:59.020
and and encouraging people to do so just
think about what event what event you

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.870
could be involved with or what
organization you could be involved with

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.069
so the organizations that are going to
be honored tonight are terrific

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:10.240
organizations and I appreciate all of
them coming here this evening but they

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.689
are really just representing a small
section of the people doing outstanding

00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:17.410
work they did outstanding work and we're
going to recognize them but we should

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.189
all realize that all of these
organizations need additional financial

00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:25.420
support they need your help your ideas
and really if you take take anything

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.380
away from this evening and tomorrow it
is that while books are wonderful

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.340
we need to encourage people to learn how
to read books and also once they learn

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.630
how to read to actually read the books
so I like you're gonna have an enjoyable

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.710

muscala hayden is phenomenal

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:34.950
it's also wonderful to be here in
washington DC on the same weekend that

the National Museum of african-american
history and culture will be officially

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:53.100
opened the ancestors must be rejoicing
just a little bit about this weekend

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.730
speaking of ancestors I'm glad that
tonight theme links journeys and

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:05.190
literacy because it gives me an
opportunity to kick off with a line from

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:10.380
our librarian of Congress at her
swearing-in ceremony miss Hayden you

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:16.080
said people of my race were once
punished with lashes and worse for

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:24.090
learning to read my people too and this
is why I often call myself an accident

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:32.160
of literacy i am an accident of literacy
because I risk not existing at all my

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.720
parents grew up doing the father-son do
value the cheater ship and Haiti which

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.970
lasted from the 1952 the nineteen
eighties the first 12 years of my life

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:47.190
were spent living under that
dictatorship going up in Haiti and your

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:52.200
many children who had a parent killed
sometimes a father before they were born

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:58.020
this often took away the possibility of
their gone being able to go to school in

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:04.020
getting an education i am an accident of
literacy because I might not have been

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:09.240
able to attend school at all had my
parents not journey here to the US like

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:15.090
thousands of immigrants some of whom are
being deported today parents who have no

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.450
choice but to leave their countries
their family

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:25.290
and even their children behind for the
possibility of a better life elsewhere i

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:30.270
am an accident of literacy because it is
the money earned from my parents working

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:35.550
sometimes two jobs sometimes around the
clock in New York sweatshops factories

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:40.770
kitchens and car washes their salaries
from these jobs paid for me to start on

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.190
my journey to learning to read and write

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:48.780
I am an accident of literacy because
when i was able to join my parents here

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:54.360
in the United States at age 12 if we
were undocumented I might have been shut

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.810
out of the public schools that
eventually allowed me to learn English

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:04.530
and put me on a path towards reading and
writing and my adopted tongue I am an

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:09.150
accident of literacy become some
libraries might have refused me entry or

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:13.590
access or library card they might have
put up a wall between me and those

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:18.570
hundreds and hundreds of books that i
didn't know i needed wanted to help me

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:23.280
imagine a better journey and a life
beyond the barred windows of my family's

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.100
cram two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.600
I am an accident of literacy because
even though I was new to the United

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.070
States and you to english some of my
teachers refrained from telling me that

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:41.370
certain words thoughts ideas and dreams
were unavailable to me i'm an accident

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.970
of literacy because all those things
that could have happened to me did not

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:50.160
and part because of struggles that
others have fought and continue to fight

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:55.860
today I always tell people when they ask
my best writing teachers were that they

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.840
were the storytellers of my childhood my
grandmother's and odds who are not all

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.000
readers some of them were not even
literate but they carried stories like

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.100
treasures inside of them and every once
in a while on a dark night when the

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:16.380
lights were out or even when they were
on their would tell me stories because

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.580
there were some things that they did not
want me to forget that did not want me

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.100
to forget what it is like to laugh to be
afraid to feel sadness and to feel joy

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:32.070
or sometimes within the scope of a
single-story to these great stories

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:38.070
sellers videos contours or downstairs
every story was a gift that you carry

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.100
with you until it was your turn to pass
it on

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.990
and even if you did not understand the
story fully as it was being told to you

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.550
one day it would become clearer when
some event will show up in your life

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:56.580
when you would need a story most on your
path on your journey and that story

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:03.120
would appear again like an ancestor or
an air someone yet to be born which is

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.350
why this wonderful celebration of
literacy also makes me think of so many

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.450
both here in the US as mr. Rubenstein
said and around the world for him

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:17.790
literacy is still beyond reach either
for political or socio-economic reasons

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:22.980
many are not allowed to read and write
or can't afford to learn to read and

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.000
write

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.250
there's is one of the shadows that dims
some of our joy as we celebrate literacy

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:35.280
and the individuals writers librarians
and institutions like this one that

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:42.600
nurtures and supports literacy as which
would write wrote and is 1945 more black

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.580
boy after borrowing a white men's
library card and forging his handwriting

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.230
so he could borrow books from the
library right wrote that quote reading

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:58.260
can be a passion a hunger too great to
be contained words can also be used as

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.420
weapons or counter weapons words help us
experience the deaths of what is

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:09.180
possible for us and others which is why
literacy is so often closely monitored

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:15.690
suppress or forbidden by oppressors
bigots dictators tyrants and they're

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:21.750
like and maybe this is why our ancestors
might be a little bit please tonight in

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:26.520
this entire weekend because not only are
we celebrating reading and writing

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:33.300
literacy in the word but we are also
celebrating some like a wonderful new

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:39.420
librarian of Congress who have become
living stories as well thank you

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:45.299
yeah

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:57.980
ladies and gentlemen please welcome
science writer James click

00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:10.090
thank you thank you I'm so happy to be
here I'm honored to be here especially

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:15.369
at at the very beginning of what's going
to be called the Hayden era

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:21.220
I've just been i've been working on a
book about time travel for a while and

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.690
when it when I told people I was working
on a book about time travel i got all

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:31.179
kinds of different reactions but i think
my favorite was a woman who said cool

00:29:31.179 --> 00:29:38.080
have you ever done it and I have a
feeling that she was disappointed by my

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:45.759
answer because of course nobody actually
gets to hop into a DeLorean and speed

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:52.210
into the past and meet our parents as
teenagers we can't plug ourselves down

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:57.369
in the saddle of a time machine and turn
the lever that sends us to the 31st

00:29:57.369 --> 00:30:03.549
century much as we might want to meet
them there aren't actually time

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:05.619
travelers from the future

00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:13.389
walking in our midst still nowadays time
machines are a great cultural totem the

00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:18.369
time machine is a well-known movie
actually all slew of movies and TV shows

00:30:18.369 --> 00:30:24.159
and comics and everything else but of
course first and foremost before all of

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:31.749
that the time machine is a book it was a
little book the american edition was

00:30:31.749 --> 00:30:35.799
sold in New York by the publisher Henry
hold for 75 cents

00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:41.859
eventually the young man who wrote it hg
wells became an international celebrity

00:30:41.859 --> 00:30:51.759
historian a visionary champion of world
government but in 1895 he was just a son

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:57.700
of shopkeepers fresh out of school
desperately hoping to make a living as a

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:04.899
writer he wrote The Time Machine and
rewrote it again and again working late

00:31:04.899 --> 00:31:07.420
at night by the light of a paraffin lamp

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.810
and finally found a publisher who paid
him a hundred pounds for it

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:19.840
it wasn't easy to make a career out of
writing books in Victorian England but

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.980
it was possible Wells wrote to a friend

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:34.270
someday I shall succeed i really believe
but it is a weary game in 21st century

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:39.400
America it's possible to make a career
out of writing books but it isn't easy

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:45.910
and forces of technology and commerce
are combined and can make it harder

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:51.970
every year for Young Writers I think we
all know that our commitment to literacy

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:58.510
and our commitment to the writing life
have to be inseparable one and the same

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:09.790
I have time traveled by the way and so
have you all readers and writers there

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:19.060
was a massacre in haiti in 1937 all but
forgotten head we don t car takes us

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.060
there

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:32.320
in 1914 Theodore Roosevelt hauled and
paddled dugout canoes down the river of

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.419
gout in the Amazon rainforest Candace
Maillard takes us there

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:50.240
we can leave our busy electric present
and turn the clock back 60 years to a

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:57.650
small iowa town where a dying pastor is
preserving his memories and reconnecting

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:08.750
with his own past and the clock Turner
is Marilynne Robinson and of course a

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.260
lot of writers aren't busy recreating
the past instead they're trying to

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:19.340
invent the future our best sense of the
future and and maybe our worst since the

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:26.720
future we can hope for the future we
should fear they both come from the

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:34.280
imaginations of writers you want to take
a journey we are all time travelers

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:39.380
nowadays and the book is our time
machine and the library is time travel

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.390
headquarters which I guess makes the
library of congress the time-travel

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:48.290
Pentagon and I mean that in the nicest
possible way

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:58.160
the great Ursula K Le Guin put it this
way story is our only boat for sailing

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.590
on the river of time

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.590
thank you

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:18.090
ladies and gentlemen please welcome
historian Candice Miller

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:33.499
thank you i can't tell you what an
incredible honor it is for me to be here

00:34:33.499 --> 00:34:40.039
among so many distinguished authors and
I had just the unbelievable privilege of

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:43.789
meeting dr. Hayden earlier tonight and i
will never forget it

00:34:44.299 --> 00:34:50.839
so thank you so much for allowing me to
be here and I grew up in a small town in

00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:55.099
Ohio and it was a great place to grow up
it was safe that people were nice

00:34:55.909 --> 00:35:00.799
there are a lot of woods and streams and
ponds that froze over in the winter so

00:35:00.799 --> 00:35:06.259
we could skate on them but if I look
back at my childhood the happiest

00:35:06.259 --> 00:35:11.180
moments I had were spent in the library
and it was a great library

00:35:11.989 --> 00:35:18.170
it was in this old two-story red brick
building with wide front steps and add a

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:23.809
small room in the front for children's
books and had high ceilings and creaky

00:35:23.809 --> 00:35:29.299
wood floors and it smelled like old
books if it was a nice day or even a

00:35:29.299 --> 00:35:34.759
cold one I used to sit outside on the
front steps and I would dangle my legs

00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:39.259
over the side and I would feel the Sun
on my face and I would read the books

00:35:39.259 --> 00:35:46.430
that i just picked out and I was never
happier than in those moments then one

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.839
day when I was about 9 years old I went
to the library who walk there from my

00:35:50.839 --> 00:35:57.920
house and I saw this small vertical
revolving rack of paperback books and

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.259
there's this handwritten paper sign on
top of them with just one word and it

00:36:03.259 --> 00:36:09.619
said free and we had always had books in
my house because we always went to the

00:36:09.619 --> 00:36:14.239
library but i didn't have very many
books that were mine that actually

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:20.869
belong to me so i stood in front of that
revolving rack and i turned it and i

00:36:20.869 --> 00:36:26.539
turned it around and around and these
weren't children's books so I didn't

00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:32.180
know any of them but one finally caught
my eye and it was called i know why the

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.220
caged bird sings and again I was just
this

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:41.500
kid from this little working-class town
in Ohio so I had never heard of this

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.230
book I had no idea what was about

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:51.040
I had no idea who my angela was I just
like the title on the cover so i pulled

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.440
it off the rack and I slipped in my
pocket and I brought it home and I

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:01.990
didn't know it at the time but that walk
that small journey from the library back

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:09.070
to my house passed a hardware store and
the elementary school and JB's we're

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:15.160
used to stop to get deep fried mushrooms
that walk I had made a thousand times

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.650
before would be different this time
because I began to read i know why the

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:27.369
caged bird sings of course at nine a lot
of it confused me and some of it scared

00:37:27.369 --> 00:37:32.080
me but for the first time I realized
that books could be more than just

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.500
entertaining or educational they could
be beautiful and they could be moving

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:45.070
and they cannot just teach me that they
could transport me as I grew older books

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:50.680
became not less important to me but even
more i turned the books when i went to

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.300
Ethiopia on assignment for National
Geographic for the first time and I was

00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:00.310
scared I wasn't scared because I was an
Ethiopian I loved it there I was scared

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.500
because I was new at this

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:09.130
this was my big chance and I knew that I
was gonna mess up so every night tired

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:14.109
and worried I would climb into my
sleeping bag under my mosquito net and I

00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:19.060
would reach from my book and instantly I
would be in another world a world in

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:24.790
which whatever happened it wasn't my
fault and I didn't have to worry about

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:30.910
it the next day I could just be whisked
away i also turned the books when my

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:36.430
husband and I had a child who was born
with cancer and every night in the

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:41.349
hospital when she fell asleep i would
sit in a corner of her room with a

00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:43.130
bottle of water

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:48.530
and I'm some beef jerky from the vending
machine and a little book light and

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:56.090
harry potter and in a flash I would be
in hogwarts far away from all the tears

00:38:56.090 --> 00:39:02.660
of the day so all that I can hope from
the books that i right is that they

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:08.870
might be a comfort to someone somewhere
at some time I know that there are

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:15.320
people who think the idea of a book
being your friend is ridiculous but i

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.000
think that there's absolutely nothing
wrong with that on the contrary I think

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.920
it's a shame not to have books that are
your friends and when I think of

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:30.500
literacy when I think of what it must
mean to not be able to read i think that

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:35.330
it is a deprivation not just of
knowledge minh knowledge enlightenment

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:40.460
and opportunity although it is all of
those things but it also denies a

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.940
powerful source of refuge and friendship

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:49.250
Winston Churchill who was not only a
voracious reader but an extraordinarily

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:55.070
talented writer who supported himself
for 70 years with his writing who won

00:39:55.070 --> 00:40:01.550
the nobel prize for literature said that
if you cannot read all of your books at

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:06.800
any rate . to them let them fall open
where they will read from the first

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.080
sentence that arrest see I set them back
in their shows with your own hands

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.420
arrange them on your own plan so that if
you do not know what is in them

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:23.510
you at least know where they are let
them be your friends i still have my

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:28.940
first copy of i know why the caged bird
sings I brought it with me tonight

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:34.760
it's coming a long journey with me over
many decades and too many places and it

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:39.590
will always be one of my most treasured
possessions but more than that it will

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.570
always be my friend

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:44.570
thank you

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:58.120
ladies and gentlemen please welcome
novelist and winner of the 2016 library

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.880
of congress prize for American fiction

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:20.350
Marilynne Robinson good evening it's a
wonderful honor to be here

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:28.060
sometimes you know this this building is
a celebration much more than a monument

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.670
and to be included in an event of this
kind and to be among the people that

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:42.760
sustain it didn't love it is a very very
moving thing I taught writing for a long

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:50.290
time to gifted writers and very whoo-hoo
enriched my life for many years with

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:59.800
their brilliance and grace and while i
tought i talked about experiences of my

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:05.740
own that made me feel the importance of
the qualitative significance of of

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:13.330
reading these are some a couple of
not-quite anecdotes that i often

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:21.640
mentioned with my students and in any
case I remember quite distinctly what it

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:27.130
was like when the difficulties of my new
literacy my marginal literacy somehow

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:31.930
became the utter trance of childhood
book business when the resistance

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:37.210
offered by unknown words and complicated
sentences fell away before my absorption

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:43.480
in almost any book that fell into my
hands when children love book the

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:49.720
experience they find in them is one side
and engrossing like a dream I realize

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:54.280
how important it is to me now to have
been haunted and enchanted by it ground

00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:01.270
pole to have left myself to tears over
the lesser works of Mark Twain to have

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.859
been given the collected poems of Emily
Dickinson by

00:43:04.859 --> 00:43:11.730
my big brother the sense of progressive
initiation has been part of it all

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:16.710
through my whole life together with an
impulse and desire to speak into that

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:22.589
great conversation and experience like
this has been the privilege of very few

00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:28.920
people historically very few human
beings it waited on the technology of

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:34.829
printing and publishing on public
libraries and on the historically recent

00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:41.880
assumption that literacy should be the
Norman society now it is hard to

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:47.460
remember that it is individually and
achievement and collectively a privilege

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:52.829
and that the modern world is unique in
the extraordinary degree that it is

00:43:52.829 --> 00:44:00.210
structured by and permeated by written
language we tend to think of things that

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:06.390
are fruitful as if they are to be valued
for their utility we forget how

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:14.670
objectively wonderful they are i have
had a few opportunities to speak with

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:18.299
people who are or who have been
incarcerated

00:44:19.499 --> 00:44:24.900
typically they have come to reading late
or at least from marginal literacy to

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.859
actual literacy for reasons that are
familiar to all of us

00:44:30.029 --> 00:44:33.779
they have been brought to books by
boredom and loneliness and restlessness

00:44:33.779 --> 00:44:38.099
with the thought that they are excluded
from knowledge of another life

00:44:38.789 --> 00:44:44.670
one man told me that he had been
drifting from bad to worse and then i

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:50.039
read a book he said that was the first
time I realized that the world was

00:44:50.039 --> 00:44:57.299
something i could be interested in the
fruitfulness I've spoke of is the change

00:44:57.299 --> 00:45:03.420
in this man's life in his mind without
reference to potential contributions to

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:09.480
society which might very well be modest
as these things are conventionally

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:15.569
reckoned anyone who remembers being
struck and moved by a book knows

00:45:15.569 --> 00:45:16.549
something of

00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:22.009
this experience and knows that it is an
excellent thing in itself a real

00:45:22.009 --> 00:45:29.209
liberation without any reference to
practical consequences i mentioned these

00:45:29.209 --> 00:45:34.579
conversations because they have made me
particularly aware of what we as a

00:45:34.579 --> 00:45:40.099
community give people or deny them when
we make them fully literate or leave

00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:46.729
them in a state of exclusion most of us
cannot imagine remind me also that the

00:45:46.729 --> 00:45:52.160
written word is unaccountably rich and
powerful applications in the matter of

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:58.849
food and drink and the light of the Sun
and here we are the wealthiest country

00:45:58.849 --> 00:46:02.989
in history wondering darkly about the
wisdom of our investment in the

00:46:02.989 --> 00:46:10.309
humanities well our children enhance a
corporate profit margin as a result of

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:13.039
reading even studying leaves of grass

00:46:13.039 --> 00:46:16.039
quite possibly

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:23.990
I think the question being mulled really
is whether we should invest so much

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:30.230
social wealth in providing a great part
of our population with an acquaintance

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:38.510
at least with their human heritage sting
genus creeps it finds its own logic in

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:47.570
irrefutable increasingly public assets
are spoken of as public burdens why

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:52.580
after all locked up so much exploitable
welcome national parks do we really need

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:58.640
all these great universities we the
public could be impoverished radically

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:06.020
before we understood the nature of the
Los an incarcerated woman said to me

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:14.030
tell your students to write good books
they're all we live for what would it

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:21.410
matter if that sustenance were denied to
her who would even know this is a

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:28.520
metaphysical question so is the disputed
value of the astonishing the astonishing

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:36.530
communion we have among ourselves
mediated by books how we value her

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:42.320
solitary obscure human life how much
well we are honored to share with her

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:48.980
will speak directly to the kind of
civilization we are and will become this

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:55.220
great library is a proof of the value I
society has placed in the world of in

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.670
the world civilization of readers
writers in books

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:03.080
I cannot begin to reckon the pure good i
have taken from American fiction

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:09.830
american libraries American education
the prizes at this price that i will

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:13.280
