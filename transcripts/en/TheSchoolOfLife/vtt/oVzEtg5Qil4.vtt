00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.460
From a young age we're talked it's a
terrible thing, so when we feel it

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.460
As we all do, we're inclined not to examine it.
We just feel ashamed and guilty.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.340
But that's a pity. Because envy, like fear, is an
important emotion that exists in all of

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.020
us for some good reasons.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.029
It's there to
help us know what we want.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:40.120
It's a call to action that should be
heeded containing garbled but important

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.330
messages about what we should be doing
with the rest of our lives. If we can get

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.830
past the humiliation of envious feelings
we can start to see them as a set of

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.440
clues about what we might do next.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.250
We should study and maybe even record on
paper the situation and people that make

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.890
us envious. We might learn to keep an envy
diary, it will contain a fragment of a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.889
future self trying to break through. We
often forget that the things we admire

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.280
don't just belong to one specific very attractive
life.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.330
They can be pursued in lesser, weaker, but
still very real doses in countless

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.660
other places.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.930
Opening up the possibility of creating
many smaller, more manageable and more

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.490
realistic versions of the lives we are
drawn to. Let's no longer just think

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.310
we're bad people just for envying. Let's do
something far more productive, become

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.360
diligent and careful students of our
most persistent envious feelings.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.220
They're trying to tell us something, and we
should listen.
