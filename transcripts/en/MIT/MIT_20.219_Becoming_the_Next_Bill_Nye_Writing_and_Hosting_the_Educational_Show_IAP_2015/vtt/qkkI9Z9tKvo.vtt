ELIZABETH CHOE: Well
thanks everyone for coming.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.330
I know that this is kind
of a funky time of day.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.580
So I really appreciate
everyone coming out

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.420
to support the students of 2219.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.890
This is the very first time
we ever offered this class.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.820
This is the very first
time I've ever taught,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.816
so I-- it was an awesome
experience for me.

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:41.440
And hopefully it was
a great experience

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.572
for all the students.

00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:44.780
I am going to pull you guys
up on stage at some point

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.071
to talk about what it was like.

00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:49.330
Just as a heads up.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.386
So this class was
initially called,

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:52.510
Becoming the Next Bill Nye.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.300
But as many of the
students might tell you,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.270
it's not exactly about
becoming the next Bill Nye.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.340
What it is about is
trying to figure out

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.099
how to occupy the space
that's in between education

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.140
and entertainment-- a space
that's not very well defined,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.440
a space that doesn't have very
good best practices or best

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.290
practices at all.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.690
But the things that are
important in this space

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.760
are to create
materials that leave

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.960
a door open to the world
of science, technology,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.630
engineering and
math to everyone,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.830
to create materials that foster
a lifelong love of learning,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.840
and to create materials
that promote stem literacy

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.140
within the public.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.480
And these are all super
broad sweeping ideas,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.540
but that is sort of
what I think at least

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.710
defines the space that's
in between education

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.640
and entertainment.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.639
These were the four
class values that we had.

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:49.680
And sorry guys, I know
you've heard this already.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.450
But this is for people who
have never been to the class.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.150
Because we couldn't
really grade things

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.130
like is this scene well
lit, because honestly we

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.590
were asking them to do so much
within the span of two or three

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.140
weeks, these were the values
that were important to us.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.070
Do the materials
that the students

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.030
make exhibit a sense of spark?

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.240
Is their enthusiasm for the
topic matter very evident?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.710
And this doesn't
mean that they're

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.970
talking with their hands,
waving all the time.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.370
It doesn't mean that they're
acting like Hank Green

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.330
with like super
hyper personality.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.290
It just means that their
genuine love of the material

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.940
is evident.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.710
Is it clear-- "kill
your darlings"

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.410
is the phrase I used over
and over again-- but are you

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.340
able to really determine
and distill what

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.385
your message is very clearly?

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:37.580
Are you thoughtful?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.510
Is every decision that
you go into making--

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.620
what your scene looks
like, what your line is,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.620
what your location
is-- is that clear?

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.380
And then are you
pushing yourself

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.314
outside of your comfort zones?

00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:50.730
I think there was
only one student

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880
in this class who'd
ever had experience

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.310
with cameras or film.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.350
And I think most of the
students were a little nervous

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.410
about being on camera, which
is totally understandable.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.300
It's very, very intimidating
to be in front of the camera.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.530
And I think that over
the course of the two,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.540
three weeks, all these
projects exhibit these values

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.070
which I'm very happy about.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.890
So what exactly happened
in the last month?

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.280
Well, we basically
took production,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.729
which is all of the
stuff, which I think

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.270
is actually structured
the wrong way.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.840
This is really
what production is.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.450
And they had to learn all of
it, in basically two weeks,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.390
because they spent the last
week making their videos.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.860
And this isn't just how
to turn on a camera.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.290
It's how to write an effective
script, how to engage people

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.080
with your texts and
your body language,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.996
and the way you're
presenting things.

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:47.370
And then on top
of that, they had

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.953
to learn how to use
all the equipment.

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:52.490
And then they had to learn how
to edit sort of on their own,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.250
and learn how to plan
things, and learn

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.250
how all of these things
interact with each other.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.240
So what you're about to see
are things that they basically

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.020
put together in
like two or three

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.130
days, which is kind of
nuts, and with very, very

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.100
limited resources.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.570
We had these crappy
little canon camcorders.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.400
So it's pretty impressive when
you think about the constraints

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.370
that they had.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.370
One of the things that we
talked about was storyboarding.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.810
So I storyboarded the
class for you guys.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.440
Day one, if you don't
remember, we talked about intro

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.990
to the class.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.050
Chris Babel gave a guest
lecture on sort of introduction

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.260
to using the camera.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.270
Then on day two, I made
the terrible decision

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.960
of not telling
people that we were

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.590
going to have 20 sixth
graders come to the classroom.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.360
But luckily Jamie took care
of that before I got there.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.230
And they basically had
to pitch ideas for videos

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.060
to 20 sixth graders
from Winthrop.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.440
And then Natalie
Kuldell came and talked

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.470
a bit about her experiences
launching BioBuilder, which

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.440
is this educational nonprofit.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.757
And then George came in
and did a hosting workshop,

00:05:02.757 --> 00:05:03.840
if you guys remember this.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.510
This is only like two
weeks ago, which is crazy.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.550
And then Josh and John
from Planet Nutshell

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.420
gave a workshop
on storyboarding.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.750
And then we had our table read.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.930
And then you guys shot
for the first time.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.913
And then you had
another table read.

00:05:24.913 --> 00:05:27.080
Wow, did I mess up my pictures?

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.150
Sorry.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.940
And then we talked
about post production.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.460
You guys literally learned
the philosophy of editing

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.270
in two hours.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.680
And then you went off
to film your episodes.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.640
And then we had one screening.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.320
And then what-- two
more days passed.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.280
One day passed.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.980
And then we're here at today.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.000
So it was a very condensed,
very expedited version

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.590
of all that stuff in the
web that I showed earlier.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.520
And so speaking of storyboards,
we are at our first project.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.600
This was Yuliya's
first storyboard.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.380
And yes, I combed
through the Tumblr,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.080
and I'm pulling up all the
embarrassing first drafts

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.670
of everything that
people posted.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.289
Yuliya's first
storyboard-- and I'm

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.830
bummed because the text is super
small and you can't see it--

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.950
but it's her first
version of her script.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.830
And it's basically
her first attempt

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.570
at planning what her
video was going to be.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.450
And the intro was what do a
snowflake and cellphone have

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.990
in common.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.660
And her plan was to
go out by the Charles,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.834
maybe while it was snowing.

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:34.375
And then she's going to have
all these things about fractals,

00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:36.600
and how fractals are everywhere.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.670
Fractals are crazy.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.960
They're in broccoli.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.300
Oh my gosh, so many fractals!

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.140
And then she starts
talking about fractals.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.650
Yuliya, do you mind
coming on up here?

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.940
Pin this to yourself.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.900
What was the process
like-- hang on,

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.880
I'm going to give
this to you too--

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.200
what was the process like
going from this storyboard

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.310
to the video that
we're about to see?

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.470
YULIYA: Well I mostly
changed the script

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.270
since this storyboard.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.660
But this kind of helped
me think through what

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.430
are some possible locations
I'm going to film at,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.710
what animations I can use.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.230
So this was very
important for me

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.590
to kind of imagine
what was happening,

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.820
but not just in my script, but
also how it would look on film.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.610
And then I noticed
that there were

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.720
some issues with the
storyboard, and then

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.260
changed the script afterwards.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.801
ELIZABETH CHOE: And
how-- your script

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.160
probably changed the most.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.240
Well, there were some drastic
changes that happened.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.640
But from your very
first idea from day one,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.775
your thought what to do
something about math,

00:07:59.775 --> 00:08:02.110
but how math wasn't real.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.000
It was like this very
philosophical idea.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.415
And it was awesome.

00:08:05.415 --> 00:08:09.210
But we had no idea how she
would tell it in five minutes.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.260
So how did it evolve
over the course

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
or what were some
of the challenges

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.850
that you had revising it?

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.660
YULIYA: So I
started with talking

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.050
about Godel's incompleteness
theorem, which asks

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.590
the question of is math real?

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.070
And then I pitched that
idea to sixth graders.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.390
And I came back, and
I was really shocked

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.120
that I ever thought that I could
explain that to sixth graders.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.730
So then I have to think,
well what else can I

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.330
tell about math?

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.482
And I like theoretical
math, so all

00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:39.940
of the concepts
that I line in math

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.610
are abstract, and don't really
have a concrete application.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.520
So I start freaking out.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.460
And then eventually I
came up with this idea

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.770
of fractals which
were doodles, and they

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.370
were present everywhere nature.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.750
So it could be made relatable.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.100
It could be made concrete,
even though it was this very

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.230
abstract math concept.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.280
So that was the third
script that I wrote.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.150
That was about fractals
and chaos theory.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.240
Then I wrote another one, which
didn't talk about chaos theory,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.580
because that was also complex.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.410
So the issue for me was
coming up with a topic

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.020
that I could enjoy
talking about,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.350
but also sixth graders
would enjoy hearing about.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.880
And in the process
I also realized

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.796
that I need more
help than I thought,

00:09:31.796 --> 00:09:33.170
and more practice
than I thought.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.050
So it was a very
humbling experience,

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.380
especially the table reads.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.690
ELIZABETH CHOE: And how do you
feel about your final video?

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.560
Again, what they're working
with are these small cameras.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.770
Most of them had never touched
a camera really before.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.660
None of them had
used editing software

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.770
except for maybe one or two.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.910
So how do you feel
about the final product

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.520
that we're about to see?

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.300
YULIYA: Well, I'm not very happy
with the quality of the video.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.520
And I think part of it is I had
to transfer between computers,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.110
and work with software.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.990
There are definitely
some scenes I

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.960
would re-film if I had
more time to get better

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.830
lighting and better sound.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.190
And it's only three and
a half minutes long.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.740
So I could definitely
add more math to it.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.940
But I think that yesterday
when I uploaded it,

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.536
I was pretty happy with what
I got in the time that I had.

00:10:30.536 --> 00:10:31.535
ELIZABETH CHOE: Awesome.

00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:34.639
OK, well we'll watch your video.

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:35.305
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:40.390
-What do snowflakes and
cell phones have in common?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.170
The answer is never ending
patterns called fractals.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.970
To explain, let me start
by drawing a snowflake.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.416
First, I draw an
equilateral triangle,

00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:55.092
divide each side
into three parts.

00:10:55.092 --> 00:10:59.870
I draw another equilateral
triangle on top of each one.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.792
Then take out the middle
and repeat the process,

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:05.175
this time with one,
two, three, four,

00:11:05.175 --> 00:11:08.150
times three, which is 12 sides.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.030
Eventually, the shape will start
looking something like this.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.370
In mathematics, this is
called a cox snowflake.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.316
If I repeated my
process again and again,

00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:21.244
I would see this same
pattern anywhere I looked.

00:11:21.244 --> 00:11:24.380
This is a cox snowflake, this
time drawn on your computer.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.260
Such neverending patterns
that are under any scale,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.660
on any level of zoom,
look roughly the same,

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.100
are called fractals.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.980
Computer scientists can
program these patterns

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.800
by repeating an often
simple mathematical process

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.147
over and over.

00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:40.580
And in 1990s, a
regular astronomer,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.973
by the name of Nathan
Cohen, used fractals

00:11:43.973 --> 00:11:46.596
to revolutionize
wireless communications.

00:11:46.596 --> 00:11:50.307
At the time, Cohen was having
troubles with his landlord.

00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:52.712
The man wouldn't let him
put an antenna on his roof.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:57.260
So Cohen designed a more
compact, fractal radio antenna

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.238
instead.

00:11:58.238 --> 00:11:59.705
The landlord didn't notice it.

00:11:59.705 --> 00:12:03.130
And it worked better
than the ones before.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.450
Working further, Cohen
designed a new antenna,

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.767
this time using a fractal
called the menger sponge.

00:12:10.767 --> 00:12:12.478
The menger sponge
is not the name

00:12:12.478 --> 00:12:14.679
of the sponge you'd be
scrubbing your back with.

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:16.635
But you can still
think of it like that.

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:19.569
Imagine with water and soap
getting through the sponge's

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:24.870
holes, except the water is Wi-Fi
and soap is safe Bluetooth.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.410
The fractal's
infinite sponginess

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.076
allows it to receive many
different frequencies

00:12:29.076 --> 00:12:30.042
simultaneously.

00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:32.457
Before Cohen's
invention, antennas

00:12:32.457 --> 00:12:34.389
had to be cut for one frequency.

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:36.804
And that was the only
frequency they could offer.

00:12:36.804 --> 00:12:39.530
Alcon sponge, your
cellphone would

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.660
have to look something
like a hedgehog

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.152
to receive multiple
signals, including

00:12:44.152 --> 00:12:46.948
the one your friends
use when they call.

00:12:46.948 --> 00:12:49.390
Cohen later proved that
only fractal shapes

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.756
could work in such a wide
range of frequencies.

00:12:51.756 --> 00:12:54.000
Today millions of
wireless devices,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.437
such as laptops and
barcode scanners,

00:12:56.437 --> 00:12:59.359
use Cohen's fractal antenna.

00:12:59.359 --> 00:13:01.307
Cohen's genius
invention, however,

00:13:01.307 --> 00:13:04.229
was not the first application
of fractals in the world.

00:13:04.229 --> 00:13:06.664
Nature has been doing it
the whole time, and not

00:13:06.664 --> 00:13:07.638
just with snowflakes.

00:13:07.638 --> 00:13:10.560
Natural selection gave us
the most efficient systems

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.898
of organisms, all
in the fractal form.

00:13:12.898 --> 00:13:15.056
The spiral fractal,
for example, is

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:18.376
present in sea shells,
broccoli and hurricanes.

00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:20.970
The fractal tree is
relatively easy to program,

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.816
and can be used to study
river systems, blood vessels

00:13:23.816 --> 00:13:25.706
and lightning holes.

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.570
So many natural systems,
previously thought off

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.120
limits to
mathematicians, can now

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.995
be understood in
terms of fractals.

00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:35.941
Mathematics allows us to
learn each of those practices,

00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:39.378
and then apply them to
solve real-world problems.

00:13:39.378 --> 00:13:42.170
Much like Cohen's
antenna, revolutionized

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.480
telecommunications, on
the fractal research,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.540
is changing medicine,
weather prediction and art,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.000
here at MIT and
everywhere in the world.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.890
Look around you.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.842
What beautiful
patterns do you see?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:08.200
ELIZABETH CHOE: I
forgot to mention--

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.940
so obviously, if a
student's on screen hosting,

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.330
they are not filming
their own project.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.560
So what we did was paired
people up into groups,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.700
and they filmed each other.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.247
So that piece was filmed
by Kenneth and PJ,

00:14:23.247 --> 00:14:25.830
and they all worked together to
help each other out and direct

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.940
each other, and it was awesome.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.520
Next up, we have PJ.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.436
Now PJ, for you--
you can come on up.

00:14:35.436 --> 00:14:40.815
I took your second pitch
from the Tumblr posts--

00:14:40.815 --> 00:14:43.006
PJ: All right.

00:14:43.006 --> 00:14:44.630
ELIZABETH CHOE:
--where you had come up

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.970
with the idea of
talking about ships.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.240
His first-- yes?

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.880
Oh, thank you, sorry.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.160
You had come up with
the idea of talking

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.661
about the science
behind poached eggs?

00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:00.160
PJ: Yeah.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.035
ELIZABETH CHOE: And--

00:15:01.035 --> 00:15:03.522
PJ: Yeah, you shouldn't
show that one.

00:15:03.522 --> 00:15:04.563
ELIZABETH CHOE: How did--

00:15:04.563 --> 00:15:05.490
PJ: I don't even know
how to poach an egg, so--

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.865
ELIZABETH CHOE:
How did that turn

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:11.170
from the science of
poached eggs to what

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:16.360
ended up being a video about
how ships basically don't sink?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.320
PJ: Well, honestly I was trying
to look for something easy.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.600
And poaching eggs isn't
actually that easy.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.080
So I wanted to
learn how to do it.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.620
And I thought it'd
be some where I'd

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.210
be able to present on something,
and also learn something myself

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.970
but-- also I could just do
it in my kitchen at home.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.290
So it seemed very accessible.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.300
But yeah, I decided to ditch
that because it's a lot harder

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.460
than people-- or I think people
know it's hard to poach an egg

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:44.960
so--

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.990
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK, so
let's watch your pitch

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.622
and then we can talk
about it, and how

00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:51.440
it changed to your final video.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.376
Oh, woops.

00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:55.312
Can everyone see that OK?

00:15:55.312 --> 00:15:57.732
Can I leave the back light on?

00:15:57.732 --> 00:16:01.592
PJ: Let us assume for a second
that this cardboard box I

00:16:01.592 --> 00:16:04.692
hold in front of you is a ship.

00:16:04.692 --> 00:16:06.474
Let's say it's a box barge.

00:16:06.474 --> 00:16:08.710
It kind of looks like a barge.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.165
Now what I've done for you
is drawn the water line.

00:16:12.165 --> 00:16:16.575
And what that is is that is the
level at which the barge would

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:18.708
float on top of
the water, assuming

00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:21.690
that it's going to float.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.666
Now if I take these
scissors, and create damage

00:16:25.666 --> 00:16:28.660
to the bow section
of this barge,

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.766
what do you think would happen?

00:16:30.766 --> 00:16:32.758
You'd probably be
right in saying

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:34.750
that water is going to
go through this hole

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.410
that I created, fill
up in the barge,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.910
and that the barge
is going to sink.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:49.529
Now let's take that same
scenario and do it again.

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:53.930
So you want to damage this
bow portion right here.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.680
Now what do you
think would happen?

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.936
You'd probably say
that well, you just did

00:16:57.936 --> 00:16:59.525
that so it's going to sink.

00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:01.025
Water's going to
climb in that hole,

00:17:01.025 --> 00:17:02.600
and it's going to sink the ship.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.889
But you'd be wrong.

00:17:04.889 --> 00:17:09.060
What I did is I took these
cardboard pieces right here,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.672
and subdivided the vessel.

00:17:11.672 --> 00:17:14.622
And what that means is
that when water comes in

00:17:14.622 --> 00:17:16.240
through this hole,
it's just going

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.610
to fill up this compartment.

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.353
Now what that's
going to do, it's

00:17:19.353 --> 00:17:22.170
going to cause a trim
condition in the barge,

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.500
but it's not going sink.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.094
And people on
board are not going

00:17:26.094 --> 00:17:29.607
to be injured as a result
of the vessel sinking.

00:17:29.607 --> 00:17:32.650
Now I show you this
example as a segway

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.330
into what naval architects do.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.266
One of the most important
features of designing a ship

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:42.300
is making sure it's not going
to sink, as easy as it sounds.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:48.645
And the way that we do that
it through subdivision.

00:17:48.645 --> 00:17:52.130
ELIZABETH CHOE: So I showed
that because basically

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.540
the difference between this
and the video that you're

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.630
about to see in terms of content
isn't super, super different.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.810
The science, the basic
science behind it

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.920
isn't incredibly different.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.900
So what happened
between you making this

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.630
to you making your final video?

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.500
PJ: Well I kind of
knew the resources

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.480
that I had at MIT to do a pretty
decent job trying to show it.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.640
So that was tough
trying to organize

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.162
that, like getting
the labs I had

00:18:19.162 --> 00:18:21.370
to go to because I don't
actually work in these labs.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.310
So it's-- it was tough
to schedule that.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.920
But I knew it would be possible.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.890
So I just tried to do it,
and had lot of fun int

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.890
he process so--

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.370
ELIZABETH CHOE: I don't
think that this is actually

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.190
a bad video at all.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:32.606
I think that you'll
go on YouTube,

00:18:32.606 --> 00:18:35.640
and you'll find a ton of
videos just like this one where

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.290
it's someone that just set
up their camera back at home,

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.720
and they're talking a little
bit about a physics concept.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.810
Which one do you like
better-- this one or the one

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.296
that you made for the project?

00:18:46.296 --> 00:18:49.160
PJ: I liked the
first one better.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.120
No, the second one's definitely
a little bit more in depth,

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.740
and kind of goes into the
science a little bit more so--

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.580
ELIZABETH CHOE: What was the
hardest part about getting

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.470
to this final video?

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.620
PJ: I'd say-- I think it was
probably organizing all of it

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.649
because just the different
shots that had to take

00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:13.190
and everything-- it
was pretty tough.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.860
But it was good having
Kenneth and Yuliya.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.476
They definitely helped to--
I think my storyboard was

00:19:19.476 --> 00:19:20.600
kind of all over the place.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.320
But they were like, no, you
should do it from this angle

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.940
and you should try
it from this angle.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.517
So I got a lot good
stuff that I could edit.

00:19:26.517 --> 00:19:28.100
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah,
and you actually

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.276
said that it was easier
for you to be on camera

00:19:30.276 --> 00:19:31.769
when you were
around other people

00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:33.060
than when you were by yourself.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.610
PJ: Yeah.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.750
ELIZABETH CHOE: Well, let's have
a look at your final project.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.916
PJ: You want me to sit down?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.350
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:03.925 --> 00:20:06.152
-When we take complex
things, and break them

00:20:06.152 --> 00:20:09.370
into smaller pieces, we find
out that we know a lot more

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.330
about things than we think.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.300
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.735
Now let's this box
Orca One, and create

00:20:22.735 --> 00:20:26.695
damage below the waterline
which I've indicated right here.

00:20:26.695 --> 00:20:30.160
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:31.645 --> 00:20:34.615
Now let's take Orca One on the
water and see what happens.

00:20:34.615 --> 00:20:37.585
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:44.515 --> 00:20:47.980
The Orca One sank due to the
weight of the added water.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.900
What if the Orca One contained
cargo or oil or even people?

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.740
Now let's take Orca Two,
and do the same thing.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.710
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.135
[BELL RINGING]

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:10.610
So we can see that
Orca Two did not sink,

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.580
although it is sitting at
an angle towards the bow.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.065
So why didn't Orca Two sink?

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:17.540
As easy as it sounds,
this simple demonstration

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.005
is essential to the design
of huge, complex ships--

00:21:21.005 --> 00:21:23.975
ships that are responsible
for carrying about 90%

00:21:23.975 --> 00:21:25.460
of all our stuff.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.935
If [INAUDIBLE], how do
we [INAUDIBLE] ships

00:21:27.935 --> 00:21:31.666
carrying our stuff to make
into ports safely and not sink?

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:35.152
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:41.626 --> 00:21:44.600
He we have Orca One and
Orca Two from before.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.885
Although Orca One
and Orca Two don't

00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:48.600
engage in international
trade, they

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.540
behave just as 1,000 foot
container ship would.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.990
Now let's take a
look into Orca One.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.950
We can see that
there's nothing in it.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.920
It's just a box.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.752
But if you look at
Orca Two, we can

00:22:01.752 --> 00:22:04.812
see that it's subdivided into
these watertight compartments

00:22:04.812 --> 00:22:07.272
by these tranverse
watertight bulkheads.

00:22:07.272 --> 00:22:09.568
Now what that
means is that if we

00:22:09.568 --> 00:22:11.910
were to damage a
ship right here,

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.904
water would only flow
into this compartment.

00:22:13.904 --> 00:22:16.736
It would not go into this
one, this one or this one.

00:22:16.736 --> 00:22:20.413
That would cause the ship to be
angled or trimmed in the water,

00:22:20.413 --> 00:22:22.970
but it would not cause the
ship to sink completely.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.232
We refer to Orca Two
as being subdivided.

00:22:26.232 --> 00:22:28.982
And we can see subdivision in
many of these ships' plans.

00:22:28.982 --> 00:22:31.290
It is unclear when
subdivision first

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.884
started being used in ships,
but accounts of fifth century

00:22:34.884 --> 00:22:36.550
Chinese trade ships
indicated that water

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.668
would be able to enter the
vessel without sinking.

00:22:39.668 --> 00:22:41.960
So let's find out
why this happens.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.270
Let's imagine a barge divided
into ten equal compartments.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.640
One of them springs
a leak from damage.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.373
Since the ship is subdivided,
only the first compartment

00:22:51.373 --> 00:22:53.590
floats and the
ship remains afloat

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.130
protecting both its
people and cargo.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.900
Although the added water causes
the ship to trim, is still

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.944
has enough buoyancy to
return to port for repairs.

00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:06.768
Ships still sink, though.

00:23:06.768 --> 00:23:08.226
It's both expensive
and impractical

00:23:08.226 --> 00:23:10.872
to try to design
an unsinkable ship,

00:23:10.872 --> 00:23:12.690
especially when these
ships will never

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.848
see that amount of damage.

00:23:13.848 --> 00:23:15.931
That's why, as
naval architects, we

00:23:15.931 --> 00:23:18.808
use computer programs to
help us out with subdivision.

00:23:18.808 --> 00:23:21.680
Computers make it easy
to see certain damage

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.470
cases in practically no time.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.660
With different software, we
can damage certain compartments

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.010
and see how the
ship responds to it.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.420
This gives the naval
architect a good idea

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.310
of what parts to improve
on the ship, if any.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.760
So even though ships seem
like these intricate, complex

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.320
things, they're really
just based on principles

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.160
that we all already know.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:24:02.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.490
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.500
ELIZABETH CHOE: All
right, so [INAUDIBLE],

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.160
I don't know if you saw me
mess up, but you're up next.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.900
I accidentally fast forwarded
through all the slides.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:25.410
So I'm also going to
show-- that's this just

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.750
the sound that's there.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.470
You can't see?

00:24:34.399 --> 00:24:35.440
Shouldn't have done that.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.720
Here we go.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.580
So Andrea, you can come on up.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:47.080
So I'm going to show the
second pitch that you did.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.521
I guess my question for you is,
you knew pretty early on where

00:24:50.521 --> 00:24:51.770
you were going to write about.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.890
I think your topic stayed
pretty much the same,

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.550
but the way that
you were saying it

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.300
changed a lot over the
course of the class.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.520
So, I guess, what was the
most important thing that you

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.020
learned in the past few weeks?

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.770
ANDREA: Oh gosh, the
most important thing.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.025
ELIZABETH CHOE: Or maybe
the most practical thing.

00:25:11.025 --> 00:25:13.170
Here you go, sorry.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.463
ANDREA: OK, two things--
persistence and iteration.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.020
And the persistence was
by far the harder thing

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.960
to really do, because
I'd experience

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.030
a block at something.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:37.070
My first one was that I was too
much in, like, businesswoman

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:42.140
presenting information mode,
and it wasn't very authentic.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.260
And I didn't think--
I was like, I'm not

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.310
trying to sell orthodontics
to the sixth graders.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.100
That's kind of ridiculous.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.610
ELIZABETH CHOE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.180
ANDREA: I'm trying to
teach them about science.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.730
So it was just a
series of blocks

00:25:55.730 --> 00:26:00.722
that I really just had to
work through, much like life.

00:26:00.722 --> 00:26:02.180
ELIZABETH CHOE:
What type of advice

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.830
would you give anyone who's
going to give a talk, who's

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:07.980
going to make a video?

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.090
Just anyone who's
trying to communicate

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:14.254
their technical ideas
to lay audience.

00:26:14.254 --> 00:26:16.420
Because you come from a
very interesting background.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.860
So, Andrea is a
Sloan fellow, so she

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.361
has a sense of presentation and
communication minus the video.

00:26:23.361 --> 00:26:25.630
So, I guess drawing on
all these experiences,

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.065
what type of advice
would you give to folks?

00:26:28.065 --> 00:26:29.940
ANDREA: Well, I think
the first time you ever

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.120
try to present
information, you think

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.480
you're going to get through
a lot more information

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.710
than you actually will, and
that was the first thing

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.420
that I learned when I taught.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.520
I went with a lesson
plan of like 20 things,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.280
and I only got through,
like, maybe four.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.130
So I think that that's
your first lesson

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.870
is, keep it simple initially.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.600
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Awesome, do you-- well,

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.940
let's watch your pitch first.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.232
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:00.232 --> 00:27:04.350
-My name's Andrea [INAUDIBLE],
and I'm a Sloan fellow,

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.470
as I mentioned earlier.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.920
And my pitch idea
is actually having

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.110
to do with something
that I actually

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.430
know something a
little bit about,

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:16.370
that many middle schoolers
also struggle with.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.040
And that is having braces.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.080
I just recently
got my braces off,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.120
and I also worked for
an orthodontics company

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.010
before I came here to MIT.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:31.760
So it's something that's both
near and dear to my heart,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.790
and also I think I've seen a
lot of high schoolers and middle

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.365
schoolers struggle with
this whole process.

00:27:38.365 --> 00:27:40.740
I know I didn't know
a whole lot about it.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.890
So basically, that
would be my pitch.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.560
To teach kids about what's
happening with their teeth

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.520
as they're having braces on.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.240
How the teeth move, how
osteoblasts and osteoclasts

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.130
work, and to deposit and
dissolve some of their bone,

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:59.488
which is actually one of the
reasons why it hurts so much.

00:27:59.488 --> 00:28:02.554
And also why your mouth
gets dry-- all those kinds

00:28:02.554 --> 00:28:03.970
of scientific
aspects of something

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:08.370
that these kids really
deal with on a daily basis

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.630
during a very awkward
time of their life.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.055
So that's my main pitch.

00:28:13.055 --> 00:28:14.360
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.006
ELIZABETH CHOE: So
before we see your video,

00:28:17.006 --> 00:28:18.880
what's one thing that
you're really proud of,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.125
and one thing that you
want to change if you had

00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:22.605
more time or more resources?

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.450
ANDREA: OK, that's a
really hard question.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.680
I'd change the whole thing.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.110
But the one thing
that I liked about it

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.870
is that I tried to
keep my sense of humor

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:44.445
in the video, and the one thing
that I wish I could change

00:28:44.445 --> 00:28:46.950
is learning more about
lighting and editing,

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:51.812
and just more of the
technical details.

00:28:51.812 --> 00:28:52.812
ELIZABETH CHOE: Awesome.

00:28:52.812 --> 00:28:56.555
Well, let's go
ahead and watch it.

00:28:56.555 --> 00:28:58.180
ANDREA: Do you want
me to stay up here?

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.596
ELIZABETH CHOE:
You can move down.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:08.916
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:08.916 --> 00:29:12.038
-Eating is one of the great
pleasures and necessities

00:29:12.038 --> 00:29:17.098
of life, and to enjoy everything
from energy bars to apples,

00:29:17.098 --> 00:29:19.815
we rely on one
part of our bodies

00:29:19.815 --> 00:29:23.337
to do an important
job, our teeth.

00:29:23.337 --> 00:29:26.211
Teeth are the hardest
substances in our bodies.

00:29:26.211 --> 00:29:28.752
They are harder than
our bones, and they're

00:29:28.752 --> 00:29:30.043
even harder than iron or steel.

00:29:30.043 --> 00:29:32.917
So, why doesn't our
jaw just crumble

00:29:32.917 --> 00:29:34.240
under all of those forces?

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.350
Between your tooth
and your jawbone,

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.458
there's a specialized
piece of tissue

00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:42.362
called the periodontal
ligament, or PDL for short.

00:29:42.362 --> 00:29:45.290
The PDL can easily
absorb the normal forces

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.706
that a tooth experiences when we
chew, say, an apple, cushioning

00:29:48.706 --> 00:29:51.146
or protecting our
jawbone from our teeth.

00:29:51.146 --> 00:29:54.074
Teeth sound like they're
already perfectly designed,

00:29:54.074 --> 00:29:56.850
but sometimes we really
need to force them

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.340
in a certain direction,
like with braces.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.622
As the braces slowly
force the teeth to move,

00:30:02.622 --> 00:30:04.550
the PDL is squeezed
in one direction

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.230
and stretched in the other.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.260
To make room, the
mechanoreceptors

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.260
in the PDL trigger
cells called osteoclasts

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.757
that actually come in
and dissolve part of jaw

00:30:14.757 --> 00:30:15.679
to make extra room.

00:30:15.679 --> 00:30:18.022
The mechanoreceptors
also trigger another kind

00:30:18.022 --> 00:30:21.135
of cell called and osteoblast,
which comes in and builds up

00:30:21.135 --> 00:30:22.140
part of the jaw bone.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.556
This allows the PDL to get back
into its regular, cushioning

00:30:25.556 --> 00:30:28.980
shape, thus, holding the
tooth securely in position.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.290
So if braces use osteoblasts
to physically reposition teeth

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.240
for cosmetic reasons,
what if wanted

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.900
to use them to replace
things in our bodies?

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.141
Dental implants
replace teeth that

00:30:39.141 --> 00:30:41.592
are damaged or missing to
restore chewing function.

00:30:41.592 --> 00:30:43.050
Your jaw isn't the
only place where

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.980
these osteoblasts
and osteoclasts are

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.400
altering your bone structure.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.910
In fact, this bony
remodeling process

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.878
is happening throughout
your entire body.

00:30:50.878 --> 00:30:53.890
And these implants aren't
just limited to teeth.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.087
Doctors can replace knees,
hips, even spinal discs,

00:30:58.087 --> 00:31:01.660
and MIT engineers are using
the properties of osteoblasts

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.576
and osteoclasts that are
already in our bodies

00:31:03.576 --> 00:31:06.570
to create a chemical
coding for these implants.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.067
Just like in a
mouth with braces,

00:31:08.067 --> 00:31:10.562
this coding helps
create natural bone

00:31:10.562 --> 00:31:12.558
to help lock the
implant into place.

00:31:12.558 --> 00:31:16.051
Right now, these
implants are designed

00:31:16.051 --> 00:31:18.213
to have the exact same
functionality as the parts

00:31:18.213 --> 00:31:19.171
that they're replacing.

00:31:22.039 --> 00:31:24.534
But scientists are already
developing implants

00:31:24.534 --> 00:31:27.910
to improve the performance
of our bodies and brains.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:34.278
So at that point, will we
be more machine than human?

00:31:34.278 --> 00:31:36.254
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:36.254 --> 00:31:37.736
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:52.908
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right,
so Nathan, why don't you

00:31:52.908 --> 00:31:56.170
come on up.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.650
Every day, the students had
to write a daily reflection

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.540
on our class blog,
which is open to anyone.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.004
Any one of you guys can
go see it, if you want.

00:32:05.004 --> 00:32:07.170
And this is in addition to
doing all the assignments

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.180
that they had to do.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.730
But they would just
talk about what

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:13.030
the day was like, what they
learned, what was challenging--

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.410
just any thoughts.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.300
And they could either post
pictures, or write things,

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.840
or make video blogs.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.970
And Nathan, by far, had the
most entertaining blogs.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:27.240
And I'm just going to show you
it, and then we talk about it.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.120
NATHAN: All right,
second day down.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.460
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh wait,
Nathan, can you scoot over?

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:33.960
Whoops.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.820
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.504
-All right, second day down.

00:32:40.504 --> 00:32:48.936
No, third-- third day--
so, third day-- all right,

00:32:48.936 --> 00:32:51.912
so, third day reflection.

00:32:51.912 --> 00:32:54.545
A lot happening.

00:32:54.545 --> 00:32:57.800
So much that's
good, actually, so I

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.832
guess I'll start with
the first thing that pops

00:32:59.832 --> 00:33:04.225
into mind, which is shooting.

00:33:04.225 --> 00:33:08.680
I've just got done finally
finishing my trailer pitch

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.165
thing.

00:33:10.165 --> 00:33:14.590
And one thing I guess you always
know, but you don't appreciate,

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.610
is how many tries at
shooting something

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.090
it takes to get something
you're satisfied with.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.685
Because, oh my
gosh, I don't still

00:33:23.685 --> 00:33:26.110
really like what
I've come out with,

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.970
but I spent a good
hour and a half

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.324
repeating the same thing
over and over again,

00:33:33.324 --> 00:33:36.726
and I don't know.

00:33:36.726 --> 00:33:40.265
I am OK with what
came of it, because I

00:33:40.265 --> 00:33:43.030
know it's still
very, very rough,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.720
and that's the point of it.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.596
So--

00:33:45.596 --> 00:33:46.472
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:46.472 --> 00:33:51.580
ELIZABETH CHOE: So that's
part of his day three blog.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.960
So the reason why I said sort
of becoming the next Bill Nye

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.430
is that what I
didn't want to end up

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.840
happening was people
thinking that this class was

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.533
about molding them into
some science celebrity that

00:34:05.533 --> 00:34:08.199
was becoming a next Bill Nye, or
becoming the next Neil deGrasse

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.610
Tyson, or becoming
the Hank Green,

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.810
because what I think is so
awesome about what is here

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.530
in the student body, and what
everyone in this class brought,

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.429
was their own individual
personalities.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:23.159
And I would have
hated it if Nathan

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.489
was trying to be Bill
Nye, because he's

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.360
so much better as Nathan.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.020
And that's why his
blogs are so great.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.230
So Nathan, what
was-- I know that you

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.980
had said that it was
hard to be on camera,

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.354
and it was hard
to do production,

00:34:36.354 --> 00:34:37.770
but your blogs
are so effortless,

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.630
and your video blogs--
they're very you.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.360
So what was so hard
about doing something

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.909
when you had a line to say?

00:34:48.325 --> 00:34:52.230
You can just clip it to
yourself if you want.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:56.850
NATHAN: I think we
made it so hard was,

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.080
if I'm just doing a
blog sort of thing,

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.300
I think of it in a way of, like,
I'm just talking to someone.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.860
But when I'm trying
to go with the script

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.220
it becomes a lot more
formal in my mind,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.090
and I just get nervous.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:15.820
ELIZABETH CHOE: How do feel
about how the video that we're

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.112
about to watch turned out?

00:35:17.112 --> 00:35:18.570
How do you feel
about your hosting?

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:21.810
What was it like shooting that?

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.810
NATHAN: I think there's
still a lot that I think

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:27.400
could be better about
it, but if I look back

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:32.610
at the very first pitch video
I did, and the second one,

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.350
and even the rough cut,
it's definitely improved.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:36.775
So, I'll take what I can.

00:35:36.775 --> 00:35:38.150
ELIZABETH CHOE:
What are you most

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.118
proud of in your final project?

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.060
NATHAN: Probably
that, I remember

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:55.510
when we did the [INAUDIBLE], the
first table reads as scripts,

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.740
mine was, one, a lot
different from what it is

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.040
now, but also very, very long.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.520
And now, it took like about
a little over five minutes

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.410
to read through just
on the table, which

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:10.520
is, in theory, faster than
it would be in a video.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.605
And the whole kill your
darlings thing happened,

00:36:13.605 --> 00:36:16.580
and I ended up with about two
and a half minute long video.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.846
So I think that's
what I like most.

00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:25.238
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK, well,
let's see what you got.

00:36:38.134 --> 00:36:40.150
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.844
-Why does a fridge
start to smell,

00:36:41.844 --> 00:36:44.500
and where does that icky
black liquid come from?

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.590
Wouldn't it just be easier
if things didn't rot?

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.420
If things lasted forever?

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.994
Well maybe, but probably not.

00:36:51.994 --> 00:36:55.727
The average American household
wasts about 25% of its food,

00:36:55.727 --> 00:36:57.310
and lot of restaurants
are even worse.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.850
So if we didn't
have decomposition,

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.250
what would happen to all
of the food we throw away?

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.938
Food and microbes usually get
settled by bacteria, protists,

00:37:03.938 --> 00:37:06.050
and fungi that allow
nutrients in the food

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.460
to return to the soil and,
eventually, other living

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:08.960
things.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.490
These decomposers also
break down other dead stuff,

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.575
like trees.

00:37:12.575 --> 00:37:16.357
In fact, they're pretty much the
only thing that can eat wood.

00:37:16.357 --> 00:37:17.786
So even if in a
world without rot,

00:37:17.786 --> 00:37:20.285
where you don't have to worry
about your house getting eaten

00:37:20.285 --> 00:37:22.249
by termites, who align
protists in their stomachs,

00:37:22.249 --> 00:37:23.722
pretty soon forests
and landfills

00:37:23.722 --> 00:37:26.180
would be flooded with
a lot of dead stuff.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.540
How do we avoid this problem?

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.870
Well, basically in your
fridge, on the forest floor,

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.102
in the dumpster,
almost anywhere there

00:37:33.102 --> 00:37:35.268
are fungi, bacteria, and
protists that live entirely

00:37:35.268 --> 00:37:36.765
by eating dead stuff.

00:37:36.765 --> 00:37:38.640
These dead things can
be more or less divided

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.020
into three categories.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.560
Carbohydrates-- sugar
and starches-- lipids--

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.131
think fats-- and
proteins like meats.

00:37:45.131 --> 00:37:46.714
All of these are
chemically different,

00:37:46.714 --> 00:37:48.954
so they each get broken
down by different enzymes

00:37:48.954 --> 00:37:51.911
in different ways before
being absorbed by decomposers.

00:37:51.911 --> 00:37:54.730
For example, proteases
break down proteins

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.290
into amino acids, the
cells building blocks.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.740
Lipids rely on lipases,
and carbohydrates on things

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.400
like amylase and cellulases.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.220
So how does a perfectly
nice broccoli floret

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.100
start giving off this
foul black liquid?

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.440
Fruits and vegetables are
almost entirely made of water,

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.906
so on the most
basic level you can

00:38:10.906 --> 00:38:14.214
see the cells are like extremely
complex water balloons.

00:38:14.214 --> 00:38:16.490
The exterior of the
cell wall is made

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.606
of cellulose, a complex
carbohydrate that

00:38:18.606 --> 00:38:21.802
gets broken down by enzymes that
the smaller cell can get energy

00:38:21.802 --> 00:38:22.302
from.

00:38:22.302 --> 00:38:24.835
The bacteria or fungi
uses cellulase to eat

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:25.876
the exterior of the cell.

00:38:25.876 --> 00:38:28.690
It's like if I were
to pop the balloon.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.340
That's the muck you
see in your fridge.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.580
What about that stink?

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.310
For fruits and vegetables,
a lot of times the smell

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.400
happens after the icky
black liquid forms.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.941
Other bacterial that
weren't involved

00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:40.738
in the initial
colonization move in,

00:38:40.738 --> 00:38:42.666
and start to stink
everything up.

00:38:42.666 --> 00:38:45.640
Meat gets smelly when lipases
break down fat in the meat

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.844
into glycerol and fatty
acids, two energy sources,

00:38:48.844 --> 00:38:50.970
and fatty acids
are kind of gross.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:54.459
And so while your food rotting
may smell absolutely terrible,

00:38:54.459 --> 00:38:57.110
because of it the
environment's able to recycle

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:58.950
crucial nutrients it needs.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:03.562
And, well, that's
why we have all this.

00:39:03.562 --> 00:39:06.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:15.514 --> 00:39:21.490
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:24.450
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right,
so David, you can come on up.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:27.760
As I was saying, the students
all have to post daily blogs,

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.330
and after the first
day I was really

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.980
curious to read what everyone
thought about the class, how

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.090
they were feeling,
and David's was

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.327
one of the first ones I read.

00:39:38.327 --> 00:39:39.910
I don't know if you
can see it, but it

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:43.730
says, "Today was the first
day in the class of MIT 219.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.780
I felt pretty much
overwhelmed with the amount

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.980
of course work required
from the get go,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.992
but also pleasantly surprised
by the amount of enthusiasm

00:39:50.992 --> 00:39:52.950
from students and teachers
alike in the course.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.972
This will be a day
of many firsts, then.

00:39:54.972 --> 00:39:56.890
First time making
a blog, first time

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.070
using Tumblr, first
time making a video

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.140
describing something myself.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.320
Previously, we had
done in a group setting

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.910
and it wasn't such
a good experience."

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:12.180
So I read that and I was like,
oh no, I totally miss-gauged

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.850
everyone's starting level.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:19.280
I gave too much to do.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.220
This is going to be
an interesting month.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.200
How do you feel now that you
not only have mastered Tumblr,

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.900
but you're uploading
videos, you're

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.050
making videos on
your own-- was it

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:34.620
as bad of an experience
as the first one?

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:37.684
DAVID: Actually, I felt
it was much better.

00:40:37.684 --> 00:40:39.100
Really, a lot much
better, and I'm

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.110
very grateful for all the
help that we've been getting

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.160
from all the teaching staff.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.120
And at first I was really--
because the first three times

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.340
that we made video I was quite
demoralized, because the video

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.346
came out quite badly.

00:40:52.346 --> 00:40:53.970
And then when I
watched it I was, like,

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.640
cringing at the videos.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.230
So because of-- but I
feel it is because when

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.210
we did the video
shoot most of the time

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.820
I was doing it by myself, so
I couldn't have another person

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.920
to shoot it against, to let a
person tell me what is good,

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.510
what it bad about a video.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.490
However, in this
class, every day

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.670
we have opinions given to us
as to what we can improve,

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.600
what we can take out, what
is better, what to cut.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.430
And so I think
through this process

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:24.214
we improve our videos much
more than we could have alone.

00:41:24.214 --> 00:41:25.880
ELIZABETH CHOE: And
I forgot to mention,

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.890
so the last three videos
that I'm going to show

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.180
are from SUTD students.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:34.130
So we got to host a few students
who are from the Singapore

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.180
University of
Technology and Design,

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.490
and it was super
interesting having

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.350
all of your guys' perspectives.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.380
I was thinking before
the class started, like,

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.650
how's this going to work?

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:47.080
Culturally, are people
going to have the same sort

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.000
of digital media literacy?

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.630
And I feel like you
guys were like, oh

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.256
yeah, we've seen Slideshow,
we've seen Veritasium.

00:41:53.256 --> 00:41:55.130
We already know about
these YouTube channels.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:42:00.790
So I was like, OK, this is
going to be totally fine.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.510
But David, you
guys are going back

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.800
to Singapore tomorrow morning.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.530
Do you think that you will
take any of the things

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.140
that we did in class?

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:14.440
Either maybe making more
videos, on in your talks,

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.896
or what types of things
were most useful to you?

00:42:18.896 --> 00:42:23.135
DAVID: I don't think that I'll
be making more videos because I

00:42:23.135 --> 00:42:24.880
think it's really quite hard.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.950
And to do it, really
you need a lot of people

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.280
to do it with you.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.710
But one thing I
will take back is

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.640
how to give effective feedback.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.740
Because I actually feel
that in this class,

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.080
many times the feedback
was very effective,

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.220
and it came across
very pleasantly.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.909
So I'm very thankful for that.

00:42:39.909 --> 00:42:42.450
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right, well
let's see your final project.

00:42:53.241 --> 00:42:57.169
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:57.169 --> 00:43:00.162
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:09.517 --> 00:43:11.600
-If I went out front right
now, dressed like this,

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.912
you'd probably call
me nuts, right?

00:43:13.912 --> 00:43:15.850
Because it's so
cold outside that

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.610
I'd probably die of hypothermia.

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.790
However, in 2009,
Wim Hof managed

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.830
to run a full marathon in -20
degrees Celsius wearing nothing

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:24.409
but shorts.

00:43:24.409 --> 00:43:25.950
While most people
would probably die,

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:28.740
Wim Hof has managed to survive.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.030
So, what makes Wim Hof able
to survive while others can't?

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:37.365
The research team [INAUDIBLE]
icy bath for almost two hours.

00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:39.627
Well, most people who
had their core body temp

00:43:39.627 --> 00:43:41.730
to below 35 degrees
causing hypothermia

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:44.838
to kick in, Wim Hof's
body temperature dropped

00:43:44.838 --> 00:43:48.528
to nearly 37.4 degrees
Celsius, staying slightly warm.

00:43:48.528 --> 00:43:51.480
And the funny thing is that
the researchers couldn't

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.956
find exactly what had happened.

00:43:52.956 --> 00:43:55.908
Maybe it's a genetic adaptation.

00:43:55.908 --> 00:43:57.630
In a separate
study, studies have

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:59.844
found that individuals
with [INAUDIBLE] ancestry

00:43:59.844 --> 00:44:01.320
have mitochondria
that can produce

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.288
more heat and lactic energy.

00:44:03.288 --> 00:44:05.256
Mitochondria is
like a mini furnace

00:44:05.256 --> 00:44:09.184
that burns the sugars from food
we eat into chemical and heat

00:44:09.184 --> 00:44:09.684
energy.

00:44:09.684 --> 00:44:13.128
Individuals like get better
able to survive the cold.

00:44:13.128 --> 00:44:16.120
However, scientists haven't
fully studied Wim Hof's genome,

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.244
so we don't really know.

00:44:18.244 --> 00:44:21.468
Wim Hof practices g-tummo
as a form of meditation

00:44:21.468 --> 00:44:24.692
and [INAUDIBLE] which allows
him to double his metabolism.

00:44:24.692 --> 00:44:26.660
Regardless of condition
before, Wim Hof

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.660
can produce enough heat
through his mitochondria

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.991
with specific breathing
and muscle contractions.

00:44:31.991 --> 00:44:34.116
They can produce enough
heat to keep his body warm.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.920
Well, you might believe
that this is not scientific.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.400
However, studies
at NUS have shown

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.376
that diversity increase the core
temp of the individual using

00:44:45.376 --> 00:44:48.261
g-tummo, and the inner
prior medication experience.

00:44:48.261 --> 00:44:49.344
Now, why could this be so?

00:44:49.344 --> 00:44:51.824
Increases in alpha and
beta waves are notices,

00:44:51.824 --> 00:44:54.304
and many have theorized that
this has enabled the body

00:44:54.304 --> 00:44:59.264
to effectively heat the center
as far as the and the knees.

00:44:59.264 --> 00:45:01.645
We do not fully understand
Wim Hof's methods,

00:45:01.645 --> 00:45:03.728
and while some have tried
following his footsteps,

00:45:03.728 --> 00:45:05.712
it would be unwise
to do the same.

00:45:05.712 --> 00:45:07.643
And Wim Hof, you
don't hear him saying

00:45:07.643 --> 00:45:09.184
he can control all
parts of his body.

00:45:09.184 --> 00:45:11.664
Now, if this were true,
and scientifically backed,

00:45:11.664 --> 00:45:13.648
who knows what doors could open?

00:45:13.648 --> 00:45:16.241
While science has already
audited and I myself

00:45:16.241 --> 00:45:17.616
don't practice
Wim Hof's methods,

00:45:17.616 --> 00:45:21.088
maybe I better be
off only one jacket.

did I cut it off too early?

00:45:45.919 --> 00:45:47.460
Actually, I'll show
your pitch first,

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.440
then we can talk about it.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.106
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:49.106 --> 00:45:51.970
-Everyone has pretty much seen
a science fiction movie in this

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:55.920
day in age, and I'm pretty sure
everyone has seen at least one

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.550
that involves time travelling.

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:00.950
Maybe it's Star Trek,
Interstellar, or more recently,

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:02.800
Predestination.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.281
And it's such a widely
[INAUDIBLE] topic in science

00:46:07.281 --> 00:46:10.350
fiction, the whole genre
of time travelling.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.572
But many times,
Hollywood films always

00:46:13.572 --> 00:46:15.030
have these little,
little loopholes

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.995
in their storyline
and their plot lines,

00:46:17.995 --> 00:46:22.696
and they often use theories and
science to explain themselves,

00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:24.196
which are just like
got from machine

00:46:24.196 --> 00:46:26.636
solutions-- totally
not efficient.

00:46:26.636 --> 00:46:29.280
However, scientists have
actually put forward three main

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.030
theories when it comes
to time travelling.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.980
First theory-- the
fixed timeline theory.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:36.404
Say, for example, you're
trying to prevent World War II,

00:46:36.404 --> 00:46:38.862
and you travel back in time
after inventing a time machine.

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:42.667
And after killing the baby
that was supposed to be Hitler,

00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:45.936
you put-- I don't know, some
other baby from an orphanage,

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:47.640
and put it in the same cot.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.118
However, when you travel
back in the future,

00:46:50.118 --> 00:46:52.810
you realize that the baby
that you had replaced it with

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.240
was the one that turn
out to be Hitler,

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.710
and there is no changing
of the past, effectively,

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:00.222
or the future, or the present.

00:47:00.222 --> 00:47:01.430
It's all in a fixed timeline.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:05.675
And this particular motions
are actually often seen

00:47:05.675 --> 00:47:08.640
in movies such as Harry Potter.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.704
It was seen in
Interstellar as well.

00:47:12.704 --> 00:47:15.124
It was also seen
in Predestination.

00:47:15.124 --> 00:47:16.092
It's a good film.

00:47:16.092 --> 00:47:17.060
You have to catch it.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.021
The second theory is
the multiverse theory,

00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:21.020
which states that every
time you go back in time

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.076
and you alter the
history-- for example,

00:47:23.076 --> 00:47:26.960
you step on a butterfly and that
butterfly could actually maybe

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.672
be the prevention
of, I don't know,

00:47:29.672 --> 00:47:31.927
a hurricane that sweeps
through Orlando right

00:47:31.927 --> 00:47:36.552
now-- you spawn a new
set of events which

00:47:36.552 --> 00:47:39.042
happens in a separate universe.

00:47:39.042 --> 00:47:42.402
Which, in other words means
that you have actually

00:47:42.402 --> 00:47:45.096
got infinite number
of universes after you

00:47:45.096 --> 00:47:46.512
have all these
different decisions

00:47:46.512 --> 00:47:48.504
and different chain
of events occurring

00:47:48.504 --> 00:47:50.994
And this particular
timeline concept

00:47:50.994 --> 00:47:52.986
has legitimately explored
many times as well.

00:47:52.986 --> 00:47:56.721
It's been featured in the
recent regular Star Trek movies.

00:47:56.721 --> 00:48:01.180
It's also been featured
in recent Fringe series,

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.380
which kind of I hate because
JJ Abrams right now remind me

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.020
of something.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.860
And yeah, this multiverse
series is actually quite popular

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.625
because it's the easiest
for producers to just show

00:48:11.625 --> 00:48:13.230
the solution, and
then they'll say,

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:15.354
oh, we actually spawned
off a new timeline.

00:48:15.354 --> 00:48:18.246
So that's when you
get sloppy and lazy.

00:48:18.246 --> 00:48:20.656
The third theory you
have is what we call

00:48:20.656 --> 00:48:22.102
the dynamic timeline theory.

00:48:22.102 --> 00:48:24.893
It's also the theory which
induces all the paradoxes.

00:48:24.893 --> 00:48:26.865
Which, you often hear
about these paradoxes,

00:48:26.865 --> 00:48:29.823
such as the grandfather paradox,
where you go back in time

00:48:29.823 --> 00:48:32.041
and you kill the
grandfather, and because you

00:48:32.041 --> 00:48:33.767
kill the grandfather,
you won't exist.

00:48:33.767 --> 00:48:35.985
And because you won't exist
you can't go back in time

00:48:35.985 --> 00:48:37.711
and save the
grandfather, and that's

00:48:37.711 --> 00:48:39.683
where the whole
paradox comes in.

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:40.669
Who kills who?

00:48:40.669 --> 00:48:43.627
God knows.

00:48:43.627 --> 00:48:45.919
The third theory we have is
called the dynamic timeline

00:48:45.919 --> 00:48:48.335
theory, which is also where
all your grandfather paradoxes

00:48:48.335 --> 00:48:49.211
come in.

00:48:49.211 --> 00:48:51.586
Let's say your grandfather is
a really, really evil man--

00:48:51.586 --> 00:48:54.222
Hitler-- and you have to go
back in time to kill him.

00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:56.198
And you go back,
you do the deed,

00:48:56.198 --> 00:48:59.424
and then you realize that,
oh no, after I kill him

00:48:59.424 --> 00:49:00.008
I can't exist.

00:49:00.008 --> 00:49:02.257
And because you can't exist,
you can't go back in time

00:49:02.257 --> 00:49:03.233
to kill him.

00:49:03.233 --> 00:49:05.114
And because of
that, he comes back.

00:49:05.114 --> 00:49:06.655
And then after you
have to come back,

00:49:06.655 --> 00:49:09.080
and you have to go back
in time again [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.030
That's where the paradox starts.

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.955
It's an infinite circle
of never ending events,

00:49:13.955 --> 00:49:16.740
and that's how the
grandfather paradox came

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.547
about to be in the first place.

00:49:19.547 --> 00:49:23.948
And I think you may have seen
it in Back to the Future.

00:49:23.948 --> 00:49:28.360
And I can't really think of
any other film right now.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.328
So, this is a brief
history of time travel

00:49:30.328 --> 00:49:32.078
and the three theories
associated with it,

00:49:32.078 --> 00:49:35.674
as well as a quick touch
on the grandfather paradox.

00:49:35.674 --> 00:49:36.650
[END PLAYBACK]

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:40.840
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right,
come on up, Kenneth.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.510
So of the four values-- I
don't know if you all remember,

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.250
but there's spark,
there's clarity,

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.900
there is thoughtfulness, and
there's challenge, right?

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.350
Kenneth obviously is not
lacking in spark whatsoever,

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:56.367
which is awesome.

00:49:56.367 --> 00:49:58.200
As soon as you see this
video-- and this was

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.182
the very first thing
you did-- and you have

00:50:00.182 --> 00:50:01.390
some video experience, right?

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.424
KENNETH: Yeah, I have.

00:50:02.424 --> 00:50:04.090
And if I had known
this would be shown I

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:07.460
would have put on more clothes.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.480
Yeah, I have had some.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.780
ELIZABETH CHOE: So the
video technique was there,

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.640
and the enthusiasm
for the subject matter

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.570
was definitely there.

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:20.960
So how did you go from this
pitch, which is basically

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.250
it's own video-- it's kind
of like a mini SciShow video,

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:27.380
basically, on all the
theories of time travel.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.130
How did you go from this to
the video we're about to see?

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:34.020
KENNETH: So this was talking
about the three main theories

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.960
of time travel, and
this happened right

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.790
before we saw the sixth graders.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.500
And when I started talking
to the six graders,

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.090
I realized that
most of them haven't

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:45.770
seen Interstellar or all of
these new Star Trek movies.

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:47.920
Funnily enough, they have
seen Back to the Future.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.520
So yeah, I realized
what really intrigued

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.180
them about time travel wasn't
all these paradoxes, or all

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.930
these theories, or the timeline.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:02.010
They were more interested in
how is it possible-- is it

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.640
even possible, and
other questions.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.910
So it wasn't-- they were
interested in time travel,

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.940
just not my scope that
I initially planned.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.441
So I decided to
change it up a bit.

00:51:12.441 --> 00:51:14.440
Maybe talk more about the
science of time travel

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.729
itself, which is where
I went to at the end.

00:51:17.729 --> 00:51:20.020
ELIZABETH CHOE: I mean,
something to emphasize too-- we

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.019
talked about on the first
day that this space is

00:51:22.019 --> 00:51:24.260
so hard to work in
because what is good

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.570
is not defined by anyone.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.950
So just because
the sixth graders

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:30.470
wanted you to talk about the
exact science of time travel,

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.210
and we encourage you to do
that, that doesn't necessarily

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.940
mean that this video is bad,
or that people wouldn't really

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:40.220
be into a video about the
science behind Interstellar.

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.150
That's not true at all.

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:44.250
So part of the challenge
of working in this space

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.470
is knowing who to sacrifice--
what audience to sacrifice when

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.560
you decide to make your video.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.170
What were some of the
new or unexpected things

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:58.020
that you had learned that you
didn't know about production?

00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.430
KENNETH: Sound is important.

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.440
Sound is really,
really important.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.630
Yeah, if I had more time I would
re-shoot some of the scenes

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:09.990
because the sound
was just so bad.

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:13.000
Other things-- I realize
my writing and my speaking

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.580
is really, really,
very different.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.020
My initial script when
we first wrote it out,

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.950
I think it was about seven--
six to seven minutes long.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:22.970
My final cut is short
of four minutes.

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:25.440
So I think while
filming it's really

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.340
a big difference to
how we bring things--

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.790
how I brought things across.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.010
It feels a lot more
natural to speak just ad

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.944
lib to the camera.

00:52:33.944 --> 00:52:34.944
ELIZABETH CHOE: Awesome.

00:52:34.944 --> 00:52:38.014
Any final thoughts
before we show yours?

00:52:38.014 --> 00:52:38.930
KENNETH: Be forgiving.

00:52:41.592 --> 00:52:42.925
ELIZABETH CHOE: Thanks, Kenneth.

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.900
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:59.108
-Imagine holding a party
and then sending out

00:52:59.108 --> 00:53:01.130
invitations after the party.

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:04.021
Wait a minute, that
doesn't make any sense.

00:53:04.021 --> 00:53:06.292
Are my friends going to
be able to time travel

00:53:06.292 --> 00:53:07.500
back just to attend my party?

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.476
In 2009, Steven Hawking actually
conducted such an experiment

00:53:11.476 --> 00:53:13.464
to disprove time travel.

00:53:13.464 --> 00:53:16.943
But what exactly is time
travel, and how does it work?

00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:20.422
It actually has a
lot to do with speed.

00:53:20.422 --> 00:53:22.658
A lot of what we know about
time traveling actually

00:53:22.658 --> 00:53:25.392
comes from Einstein's theory of
special and general relativity.

00:53:25.392 --> 00:53:27.877
We are actually time
travelling right now,

00:53:27.877 --> 00:53:30.600
but not in the manner that
sci-fi films have depicted it.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.210
We are, in fact, time travelling
at a pace of one hour per hour.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:38.050
In other words, every hour I
experience, the world around me

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:39.870
experiences a
singular hour, too.

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.830
Now, it may sound simple and
trivial, but stay with me.

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:46.305
This is where it
gets interesting.

00:53:46.305 --> 00:53:49.605
Now, a [INAUDIBLE] of Einstein's
theory of special relativity

00:53:49.605 --> 00:53:52.740
is actually a phenomenon
known as time dilation.

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.710
Effectively, this means that
the faster you travel the slower

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.195
time passes around you.

00:53:57.195 --> 00:53:59.550
It potentially
means that I could

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:03.086
travel at maybe more
than one hour per hour.

00:54:03.086 --> 00:54:06.020
This phenomenon, however, is
only noticeable at really,

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:09.190
really high speeds-- speeds
near the speed of light.

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:13.400
This rocket here,
not even close.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.773
Say I do have a
spaceship now that

00:54:15.773 --> 00:54:17.737
travels at 90% the
speed of light,

00:54:17.737 --> 00:54:19.930
and I have a pair
of newborn twins.

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:23.740
I bring one of them with me
on this journey for 10 years.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:27.830
When I return, one of them
will have turned 23 years old,

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:30.320
while the one will me will
have only tuned 10 years old.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.486
While we have experienced
10 years on the spaceship,

00:54:32.486 --> 00:54:34.590
23 years have actually
passed on earth.

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.100
This amount of time actually
increases exponentially

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:41.060
as we get closer to
the speed of light.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:45.020
So, we could have potentially
travelled forward in time,

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.485
but what about
backwards in time?

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:51.455
That's a loaded issue.

00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:53.930
Now, remember our
previous draft.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:56.510
The time that it
took [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:58.500
to the speed of light.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.658
Some scientists think
maybe the secret to time

00:55:00.658 --> 00:55:03.730
travel lies on the
other side of the line.

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:06.263
In other words, we may
have to travel faster

00:55:06.263 --> 00:55:09.490
than the speed of light just to
be able to travel back in time.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:12.860
Now, when you do travel at
speeds near the speed of light,

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:16.180
something called relativistic
mass comes into play.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.498
In other words, as your speed
goes up your mass increases.

00:55:19.498 --> 00:55:22.778
As your masses increases,
you require more energy

00:55:22.778 --> 00:55:23.930
to move the same object.

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:27.620
This might mean that we need
an infinite amount of energy

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.995
just to move [INAUDIBLE]
beyond the speed of light.

00:55:29.995 --> 00:55:32.845
However, the more energy you put
into an object, the more likely

00:55:32.845 --> 00:55:35.530
you are to increase
its mass rather than

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:36.930
to increase its speed.

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:40.608
Therefore, to gather
[INAUDIBLE] quite impossible

00:55:40.608 --> 00:55:43.100
at this point in time.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.818
So, why are we still so
obsessed with time travel?

00:55:46.818 --> 00:55:51.255
Time travel does come with
it's own set of problems.

00:55:51.255 --> 00:55:53.720
Take, for example,
my party before.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.185
If I were to send out my
invitations after the party,

00:55:56.185 --> 00:55:58.650
my friends would have come
back in time to attend.

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:00.622
And if they did come
back in time to attend,

00:56:00.622 --> 00:56:03.087
I wouldn't have to have
sent out my invitations.

00:56:03.087 --> 00:56:05.552
And if I didn't send
out my invitations

00:56:05.552 --> 00:56:07.524
they wouldn't be at my party.

00:56:07.524 --> 00:56:10.482
Doesn't make any sense at all
that they are both at my party

00:56:10.482 --> 00:56:11.961
and not at my party.

00:56:11.961 --> 00:56:14.690
This is what we call
the grandfather paradox.

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:16.404
It's one of three
time travel theories

00:56:16.404 --> 00:56:18.192
that we currently have.

00:56:18.192 --> 00:56:21.642
Now, so it seems that we may
not be able to time travel

00:56:21.642 --> 00:56:25.120
yet, based on what
physics tells us at least.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.682
For now, if you are
planning a party,

00:56:27.682 --> 00:56:30.590
be sure to send out
the invites first.

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:33.441
Your friends can't
time travel yet.

ELIZABETH CHOE: We
have one more video.

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.710
Joshua, I'm going to
show your day three blog.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:55.770
This was the day after that
we had our hosting and script

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:57.348
writing workshop.

00:56:57.348 --> 00:56:58.306
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:56:58.306 --> 00:57:00.222
-I thought what really
stood out for me

00:57:00.222 --> 00:57:06.450
was the one of looking at
a member of your audience

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:10.880
like your family member or a
professor behind the camera,

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.310
so it's not just a camera.

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:17.547
So yeah, but the funny thing
is, speaking of this tip,

00:57:17.547 --> 00:57:19.838
I kind of forgot it and I've
been looking at the camera

00:57:19.838 --> 00:57:21.230
thinking of the camera.

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.130
So it's a bit ironic.

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:25.550
I guess many if these things
require a lot of practice,

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:29.066
and that's kind of like
why you do, and get out

00:57:29.066 --> 00:57:32.514
of the zone of thinking
I'm in front of a camera.

00:57:32.514 --> 00:57:35.430
Usually, every time you press a
camera there's this red button.

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:37.180
Sometimes I think maybe
if that red button

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:42.400
was eliminated that a lot of
things would be different.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.877
Yeah, so I guess
one of my questions

00:57:46.877 --> 00:57:50.050
I would like to ask as well
is, what kind of face-- what

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.490
would be a perfect
member of the audience

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:54.558
that I would like to put there?

00:57:54.558 --> 00:57:56.893
I mean, if I put someone
who is very respectable,

00:57:56.893 --> 00:58:01.590
like my professor, then I
guess that the whole tonality

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.478
in my voice, the whole
choice of my vocabulary

00:58:04.478 --> 00:58:08.900
would try to be more serious.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.295
By the same time, I
guess if I put someone

00:58:11.295 --> 00:58:13.720
like a two-year-old
in my imagination

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.590
in front of the camera,
I'll probably not

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:19.110
talk in the same tonality.

00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:24.356
So I guess, what would
an appropriate member

00:58:24.356 --> 00:58:30.297
of the audience be in front
of the camera, or some of--

00:58:30.297 --> 00:58:30.880
[END PLAYBACK]

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.240
ELIZABETH CHOE: So that's
a very hard question.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.850
You can come on up.

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:37.960
And the thing that's
hard when you're hosting

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.931
is that there's a
difference between talking

00:58:39.931 --> 00:58:42.180
to and for your audience,
which is a point that George

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:44.180
brought up during the workshop.

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:45.740
But being able to
actually implement

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.590
that, as you mentioned,
it's really hard.

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:52.500
So what did you think of
when you were hosting?

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.930
Because I think that the
way you talk in this blog

00:58:54.930 --> 00:59:00.440
is totally appropriate for sixth
grader, for your professor.

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:04.270
But being able to distill like
who you are as an individual,

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.250
and having the
self-awareness to process,

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:09.260
like, this is how I really--
this is who I am at my core.

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.100
That's actually a
really hard thing to do.

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.640
So how are you able to
do in your final video?

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.180
JOSHUA: I guess the
most important thing

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:22.670
is remembering a script.

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:25.530
So you at least you know
what you're going to speak,

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:29.980
and then you probably just want
to focus on being yourself.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:34.380
Because at the end of the day,
we don't want to be Bill Nye.

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:38.370
Still we want to be ourselves,
but we must be clear.

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:44.460
So you have to balance
those two objectives.

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:48.740
And this is just me just
talking off my head,

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:55.224
but I had no objective coming
into these reflections.

00:59:55.224 --> 00:59:56.640
Yeah the question
was interesting,

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.835
because it was
just-- it was the day

00:59:59.835 --> 01:00:04.580
after-- am I right to say it was
the day after the students came

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.080
in?

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.485
And if you saw my
first day picture

01:00:07.485 --> 01:00:09.440
it was extremely embarrassing.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.250
Thank God for not showing it.

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:13.583
ELIZABETH CHOE: It's not bad--
it's really not that bad.

01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:15.340
JOSHUA: I was
explaining like hashing,

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:20.594
and it was like some security
concept that's so hazy that--

01:00:20.594 --> 01:00:23.010
ELIZABETH CHOE: It's actually--
it was quite a good video.

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:24.300
Very clear and succinct.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.866
I now know that my password
is safe on Facebook

01:00:26.866 --> 01:00:28.960
just as long as I update
it every now and then.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.050
JOSHUA: Yeah, but I've now
understood my audience.

01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:35.290
And so the point of this
video-- and hopefully

01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:38.460
what I wanted to show was
something very accessible,

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.980
something you use everyday.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.800
And it goes deeper and deeper
until it goes to a concept

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.310
that you're not
very familiar with.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:49.010
But because you started off
at the very familiar point,

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:50.230
it lead you there.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.750
And so I guess that's the
exciting part of the K-12

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.220
videos.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.220
ELIZABETH CHOE: Awesome.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.386
That was a point Chris
[? Babel ?] brought up a lot,

01:00:58.386 --> 01:01:01.720
was taking the familiar
and making it unfamiliar,

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.890
or taking the unfamiliar
and making it familiar.

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.600
And I think this video
that we're about to see

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.391
does a great job of
taking something that's

01:01:07.391 --> 01:01:09.480
familiar to all of
us and showing sort

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.880
of the unfamiliar side of it.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.846
Any other final thoughts
before we show it?

01:01:15.846 --> 01:01:16.346
JOSHUA: Ugh.

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:24.130
Don't cringe, but I better
hide under the table.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.190
ELIZABETH CHOE: No, no.

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.689
JOSHUA: OK.

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:38.470
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.970
-Hi.

01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:40.511
Do you find it
particularly difficult

01:01:40.511 --> 01:01:42.863
to find a specific
item in your house?

01:01:42.863 --> 01:01:45.308
Let's say you're looking
for a pair of gloves,

01:01:45.308 --> 01:01:48.731
but you just can't find it and
you spend your entire afternoon

01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:50.198
looking for it.

01:01:50.198 --> 01:01:53.295
Well, you've just
encountered the same problem

01:01:53.295 --> 01:01:55.577
that companies like
Google or Microsoft

01:01:55.577 --> 01:02:00.460
encounter every single day, and
that's the problem of search.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.745
Just like your house,
which stores a thousand

01:02:02.745 --> 01:02:06.424
different items, Google
stores 45 billion index pages

01:02:06.424 --> 01:02:07.915
of information.

01:02:07.915 --> 01:02:10.648
What if every page
was a sheet of paper,

01:02:10.648 --> 01:02:12.400
and we stacked
them up real high?

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.022
We would create
a tower 600 times

01:02:15.022 --> 01:02:17.402
taller than Mount Everest.

01:02:17.402 --> 01:02:19.782
Well, how can
Google find a result

01:02:19.782 --> 01:02:22.210
so quickly when I
find it so difficult

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:24.776
to find a pair of gloves.

01:02:24.776 --> 01:02:26.465
Well, searching
on Google is kind

01:02:26.465 --> 01:02:30.540
of like looking for a
person in a big school.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.450
Let's say I'm looking for
James in a row of classrooms.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.542
One of the easiest
method would be

01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:40.170
to go to every classroom next
to you until you find James.

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:44.525
There is a better method
called binary search.

01:02:44.525 --> 01:02:47.365
Now, let's say the students
were arranges from A

01:02:47.365 --> 01:02:50.024
to Z, one in each classroom.

01:02:50.024 --> 01:02:51.640
We would then go
to the middle room

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.614
first and see if James is
there, and if James isn't there

01:02:55.614 --> 01:02:57.530
we would look at the
first letter in the name,

01:02:57.530 --> 01:03:01.940
and if the letter is before
J, we head to the right.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.390
If not, we head to the left.

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:06.350
We would then approach
the middle room

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.310
in the newly sectioned area.

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:12.120
Eventually, we will repeat the
process over and over again

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.426
until we find James.

01:03:14.426 --> 01:03:18.820
Now, this is just the first
method, but it's at a much,

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.898
much faster rate.

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:23.170
How much faster will that be?

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:26.630
Well, that depends on the number
of students in the school.

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:29.618
Let's say there are 500 students
and we are looking for one.

01:03:29.618 --> 01:03:32.120
It will take about 80
minutes in the first method,

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.500
but one and a half minutes
with binary search.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.418
But let's say there are
1,000 students in the school.

01:03:38.418 --> 01:03:42.082
It will take 160 minutes
with the first method,

01:03:42.082 --> 01:03:46.190
but 1.6 minutes with
the second method.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.030
Now, that's a whole
lot of difference.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:50.960
So a name is just
a word, but Google

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.520
searches a combination of words,
making it a little bit more

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.456
complicated.

01:03:56.456 --> 01:03:59.264
So just like how we
identified the first letter

01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:01.870
of each alphabet
of the name, Google

01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:07.416
identifies 200 unique factors
making the search terms faster.

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:10.797
Well, if you recall, the
effectiveness of binary search

01:04:10.797 --> 01:04:13.212
depends on the
pre-arrangement of data,

01:04:13.212 --> 01:04:16.110
and that's why computer
scientists are actively

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:19.884
looking for ways to sort,
manage, and eventually retrieve

01:04:19.884 --> 01:04:23.080
data faster and better.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.520
In the same way, the TV
remote goes near the TV,

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.020
the shoes go to the shoe rack,
the coats go into the cupboard,

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:34.280
and the winter gloves go
into the winter jacket.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:34.780
Aha!

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.554
So that's where my gloves are.

01:04:38.554 --> 01:04:42.012
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:51.410
[END PLAYBACK]

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:54.710
ELIZABETH CHOE:
OK, so like I said,

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:58.190
given the incredibly
small amount of time

01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:00.580
and the small amount
of resources they had,

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.530
I think that these videos
are pretty impressive.

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:05.280
It's pretty impressive
what they were all

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.920
able to achieve in such
a short amount of time.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.260
We didn't even really
hit music, which

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:15.720
is like an entirely separate,
time consuming thing.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.580
But well done everyone.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.940
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.740
I wanted to thank all
the teaching staff who

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.544
made this class possible.

01:05:26.544 --> 01:05:27.710
Sarah, you're an awesome TA.

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.010
Jamie, the co-instructor.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:31.960
We had George [? Ziden ?]
come and teach hosting.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.370
We had the guys from Planet
Nutshell, Josh and John,

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:37.080
come and teach script writing.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.040
Chris [? Babel ?]
taught a lot of how

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.730
to make the camera techniques
advance your narrative,

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:43.590
so it was really a
collaborative effort

01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.310
to make this class happen.

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:47.544
Just like hopefully
you guys realize

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:48.960
how much of a
collaborative effort

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.190
it takes to make a video.

01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:56.020
So big thank you to everywhere
who made this class possible.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.730
So all of these videos
and everyone's stuff

01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:00.930
is up on our Tumblr if
you guys are interested.

01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:03.590
I don't know when we're going
to offer this class again.

01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:05.410
We'll see what happens.

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:08.809
But in the meantime, best
wishes to all the students

01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:10.600
from Singapore who are
going back tomorrow,

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.990
and then the
remaining students--

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:17.260
I've talked to most of you
guys but waiting to hear back

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:21.450
from one person-- we'll
be producing their videos

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:24.000
for Science Out Loud
season three next week,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.810
in addition to a few more
that we've been developing

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:28.500
in parallel to this class.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.720
So maybe when the spring
semester rolls out

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.330
you'll not only be able to
see their progress from pitch,

01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:38.520
to script, to second
script, to rough cut,

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.370
to final project, you'll also be
able to see their final product

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:45.200
in the videos that
we produce for them,

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.860
which is going to
be really exciting.

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.720
And that big thanks
to Opencourseware too,

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.125
for helping document this class.

01:06:51.125 --> 01:06:53.460
It will be interesting to
see that roll out this summer

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:54.660
as well.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:57.100
But feel free to take--
if there's food left,

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.990
feel free to take it.

01:06:57.990 --> 01:07:00.156
There's plenty of salad
left, which is unsurprising.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.675
But other than that, thanks
so much for coming out.

01:07:05.675 --> 01:07:07.800
Feel free to-- I'm going
to volunteer the students,

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.910
if you want to ask them about
their experiences, you can.

01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:11.660
But other than that,
have a great evening,

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.790
and thanks again, everyone.
