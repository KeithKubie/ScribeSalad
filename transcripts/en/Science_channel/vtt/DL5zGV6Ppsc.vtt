00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.534
Narrator:
A CRAFTSMAN PREPARES TO CARVE.

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:10.901
HE STARTS BY USING
A MASONRY COMPASS

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:13.868
AND A LIQUID CALLED CHINESE INK
TO DRAW THE MORTAR'S

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:16.868
INNER AND OUTER CIRCUMFERENCE.

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:20.801
HE CAN EASILY REMOVE THE INK
IF THERE ARE ANY ERRORS.

00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:26.934
HE ROUGHS OUT THE SHAPE
WITH A HAMMER AND CHISEL.

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.501
HE THEN WORKS WITH A GRINDER
WHICH IS EQUIPPED

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:32.234
WITH AN EXTREMELY HARD
DIAMOND-TIPPED BLADE,

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.100
MAKING IT POSSIBLE
TO CUT THROUGH SOLID STONE.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.100
ONCE'S HE'S DEFINED
THE OUTSIDE EDGE,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.400
HE BEGINS TO WORK
THE INNER BOWL,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.367
CARVING OUT THE PERIMETER
BEFORE CUTTING A GRID.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.701
HE TURNS AGAIN
TO HIS HAMMERS AND CHISELS

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:55.167
TO REMOVE MATERIAL
FROM THE INSIDE OF THE MORTAR.

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:58.300
WITH THE GRINDER, HE WORKS AWAY
AT ALL OF THE SURFACES,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.434
SMOOTHING THEM
TO A CONSISTENT FINISH.

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:05.868
A MORTAR ISN'T MUCH GOOD
WITHOUT A PESTLE.

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:07.367
ONCE AGAIN WORKING WITH

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.501
THE CONFIDENT SWIFTNESS
OF AN EXPERT,

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:13.000
THE ARTISAN USES HIS GRINDER
TO HONE A CHUNK OF GRANITE

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.634
DOWN TO THE SHAPE
OF A WELL-BALANCED PESTLE.

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:19.200
WIDE AND BLUNT ON ONE END

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.467
AND NARROW ENOUGH
TO EASILY GRASP ON THE OTHER,

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.634
THE STONE IS PERFECTLY
CALIBRATED TO DO ITS JOB.

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:33.767
IN THE DAYS BEFORE POWER TOOLS,

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:35.767
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN
A CRAFTSMAN A FULL DAY

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.100
TO CARVE A MORTAR AND PESTLE.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.133
BUT A CARVED MORTAR AND PESTLE

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.067
ISN'T NECESSARILY
A FINISHED ONE.

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:49.601
HERE, A PAINTER
ADDS THE FINAL TOUCHES.

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:52.000
USING A SMALL BRUSH
AND SPECIAL VARNISH,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.634
HE PAINTS A LOTUS FLOWER DESIGN
ON THE LIP OF THE MORTAR.

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:58.968
HE LEAVES THE BOWL ITSELF
UNTOUCHED

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:00.367
SO THAT NO FOOD PRODUCTS

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:02.667
WILL MIX WITH THE VARNISH
WHEN CRUSHED.

00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:10.167
HE THEN VARNISHES THE EXTERIOR
OF THE MORTAR.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:13.701
THE VARNISHING PROCESS
IS PURELY DECORATIVE.

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.234
HARD STONE LIKE GRANITE
NEEDS NO PROTECTIVE COATING

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:17.667
TO HELP IT ENDURE.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:22.000
AFTER ALL, SOME GRANITE HAS BEEN
AROUND FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.

00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:29.467
IT TAKES JUST 15 TO 20 MINUTES
FOR THE VARNISH TO DRY.

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:33.567
AND WITH THAT, THE MORTAR
IS COMPLETELY FINISHED.

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:37.434
THE LOTUS FLOWER DESIGN
ISN'T THE ONLY ONE AVAILABLE.

00:02:37.434 --> 00:02:39.534
THIS FACILITY
PRODUCES A WIDE RANGE

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:42.467
OF MORTARS AND PESTLES.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:45.067
THESE MORTARS AND PESTLES
MAY BE ATTRACTIVE.

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:48.667
BUT THEIR APPEARANCE
IS SECONDARY TO THEIR FUNCTION.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:52.033
THERE ARE FEW TOOLS IN A KITCHEN
MORE DURABLE OR MORE USEFUL

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.467
THAN A GOOD MORTAR AND PESTLE.
