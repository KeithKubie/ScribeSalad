00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.520
Whether you're going for bling, swagger, or
just looking for a different way to decorate,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.719
you might be surprised at what you can do
with the tabs from your soda cans. In this

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.359
project we're up-cycling these marvels of
engineering, into lightweight aluminum chains.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.640
For this project, I swung by a local recycling
depot, and picked a whole load of soda can

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.150
tabs, for free. Now let's get started by breaking
off the rivet mounts for each of the tabs

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.660
we want to use, then stack five of them together
so they're all aligned. This will be the first

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.480
link in our chain, and you can see I turned
the smooth shiny surfaces so they're facing

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.600
outward. Now if we take a pair of scissors
and carefully cut a slit through the thinner

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.280
end, this gives us the ability to gently pry
it open, creating a small gap. Now all you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.830
have to do is push the hook through the thicker
end of our chain link, and bend the metal

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.510
back to close the gap. It's as easy as that.
Just repeat the process again until you've

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.420
got 5 tabs secured in place, and double check
the sides to make sure they're smooth. If

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.780
you want a longer chain, just continue the
process by cutting 5 tabs at a time, and linking

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.410
them on to the end. Once you get the hang
of it, there's so much you can do with the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.010
idea. For example, you could try making yourself
a custom key chain, or maybe even a wallet

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.810
chain. That's pretty awesome. How about a
metallic wrist band like this? You can see

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.250
I linked the chain to itself so the piece
is completely seamless. Now because our chain

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.030
is aluminum, it's amazingly lightweight, but
still strong enough to replace my belt. How's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.550
that for swagger? If you're feeling especially
adventurous, try closing your chain off with

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.390
a padlock and throwing it around your neck.
I ended up using this one as a picture frame,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.979
and I bet you could use the same idea for
framing a license plate as well. By the way,

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.530
make sure you hang onto your colored tabs.
They can add a lot of variety to pump up your

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.770
style. Well now you know how to engineer these
common soda tabs, into lightweight metallic

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.360
chains. Now what they're used for is completely
up to you. That's it for now. If you liked

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.920
this project, perhaps you'll like some of
my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
