00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; Becky Clark: Good morning.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.970
Welcome to the 2018
National Book Festival.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.520
We're so glad to
see you here today.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.330
My name is Becky Brasington
Clark, and I'm the director

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.090
of publishing at the
Library of Congress.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.220
Before we get started,
we're going to take a moment

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.520
to ask you to silence the
device of your choice,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.750
whether it's your watch or
your phone or your iPad,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.580
anything that makes a noise,
just take a second and flip it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.110
to whatever mode makes it
stop, that would be great.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.500
You're going to have
a fantastic day today.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.670
You're going to have the
opportunity to hear from some

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000
of the authors of your
favorite books or books

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.860
that you don't know are going
to become your favorite books.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.010
And it's just a pleasure to open
the genre fiction stage this

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.660
morning with Brad Meltzer.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.820
But speaking of favorite books,
did you know that the Library

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.800
of Congress is partnering
with PBS

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.160
to promote The Great
American Read?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.100
This multiplatform outreach
campaign is designed

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.420
to get the country reading
and talking about books.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.990
Don't miss the fall kickoff

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.630
with Meredith Vieira premiering
Tuesday, September 11th

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.990
on PBS stations nationwide.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.390
And make sure to visit The
Great American Read website

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.030
on PBS.gov before October
18th so you can cast your vote

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.470
for America's best-loved book.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.990
Now Brad Meltzer is certainly
one of America's most popular,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.990
successful, and multifaceted
contemporary authors.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.700
He's not only written 11
best-selling thrillers,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.810
but he's also found great
success as an author

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.240
of nonfiction books,
advice books,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.450
children's books,
and comic books.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.380
But don't let Brad's
incredible success make you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.020
feel inadequate.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.750
He has a wonderful quote on
his website that speaks both

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.900
to his humility and
his humanity.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.220
And it reads, "We
are all ordinary.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.020
We are all boring.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.260
We are all spectacular.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.040
We are all shy.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.930
We are all bold.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.220
We are all heroes.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.990
We are all helpless.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.770
It just depends on the day."

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.120
Please join me in
extending a warm welcome

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.510
to best-selling author and
super nice person Brad Meltzer.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:26.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.290
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: So let me
identify this crowd right now.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.000
If you are here, you have
chosen to come here as opposed

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.810
to go see Dave Eggers, as
opposed to go see John le CarrÃ©,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.030
as opposed to see Andy Prowell.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.330
I mean, what are you doing here?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.630
[ Laughter ]

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.420
Right? Plus, it's
10:00 in the morning.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.050
These are the diehards, right?

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.230
Afterwards, it's people who
are, like, the bored in the city

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.970
and it maybe rains
and they come in.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.470
This is the best crowd in the
world, as far as I'm concerned.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.270
This is it, right?

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.730
[ Applause ]

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.660
And I want to recognize
one person

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.300
who couldn't be here today.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.290
I have a high school friend
who lives in Washington, D.C.,

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.520
my friend Jamie Axelrod
[phonetic].

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.710
And Jamie and I went to
high school together.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.630
We met in -- you know,
we were in ninth grade.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.930
I had hair.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.230
[ Laughter ]

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.100
One of my oldest friends
in the whole world.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.120
She was in our wedding party,
and she is right now sitting

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.000
in Dave Eggers's room.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.960
And so her husband and
daughters are here,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.500
and I just publicly
want to embarrass her.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.920
And so thank you for
letting me do that.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.370
And I told her, you have to go!

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.370
It's Dave Eggers, go!

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.670
And she did.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.470
And I was like, what
are you going for?

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.050
[ Laughter ]

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.700
And that's Jewish guilt, by
the way, that I just did on,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.400
like, another level, right?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.300
And that Jewish joke does
not work in Ohio does here.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.800
I'm just telling you.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.100
So I want to tell
you a little bit

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.330
about how I got here,
truly got here today.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.640
Because this is really my life.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.700
We were honoring First Lady
Barbara Bush two days ago

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.280
in Kennebunkport.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.460
And we got to Kennebunkport,
my wife and I, we got to go

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.330
and honor this amazing woman who
has given so much to literacy

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.780
and has become a dear friend of
mine over the years and a reader

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.170
of mine, and just
one of the really --

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.940
just gave her whole
life, post-White House

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.580
and in the White House, to that
most amazing art of all, right?

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.000
To at least one of the
most powerful thing

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.710
of all, books and ideas.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.740
An honor to go do that.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.980
And we were there
with David Rubenstein

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.680
and with Cokie Roberts, and
we did this great thing.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.330
And then we got to -- we
knew we were coming here.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.800
And this is where
I want to mention

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.100
and make my biggest thank
you is we knew we were coming

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.230
to the Library of Congress and
to the National Book Festival.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.390
And so I was like --
it was like asking --

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.570
kind of, like, an Uber when
you ask David Rubenstein,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.890
can I come on your
private plane?

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.170
And he was -- just like an
Uber was like, sure, jump in.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.470
And so we flew here
on the private jet,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.770
which is always how I fly.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.070
[ Laughter ]

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.570
All authors, we always
fly like that.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.870
And we get here.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.170
We're just having
this amazing day.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.170
When we were in Kennebunkport,
I got to read my new book

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.980
to former President
George H.W. Bush.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.280
One of the most amazing,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.580
rewarding experiences
in my life.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.360
We fly on the private jet,
we land in Washington.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.640
We go to our friends' house
and we're staying with them.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.940
And it's, like, 1:00 in
the morning at this point

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.460
because we're catching up the
whole day and telling them

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.780
about everything that happened.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.550
And we go downstairs to their
basement in Virginia, you know,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.350
the little room in the basement,
and the toilet's broken.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.900
And at 1:00 in the morning,
my wife and I have our hands

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.710
in the toilet -- because you
can't wake up your friends

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.010
and tell them that your
their toilet's broken,

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.310
you got to fix it yourself.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.010
And I realized, this is my life.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.310
[ Laughter ]

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.390
This is the perfect
metaphor for everything I am.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.690
I am proud here.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.160
And I mentioned Mr. Rubenstein,
and I have to say a thank you

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.650
to him for hosting
us here today.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.300
And more important, thank you
to the Library of Congress

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.480
and to all of our friends, to
the librarian Carla Hayden,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.550
to my friend Sara Duke,
and all the hard --

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.590
just so many people in
those blue shirts today,

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.890
please thank them
when you see them.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.190
It takes so much hard
work to put them on.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.510
So let's hear it for everyone
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.650
[ Applause ]

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.080
And what I want to talk about is

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.090
of course this book,
The Escape Artist.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.150
And The Escape Artist,
for me is --

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.030
this is my 20th year
of writing books.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.100
20 years. If you were
there the from the start

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.010
and you read The Tenth Justice
when it came out, you are old.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.310
[ Laughter ]

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.320
You are an old person.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.530
And if you're laughing,
you are old.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.250
And [laughs] for
me, this book --

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.010
at 20 years, I know how
to do a thriller, right?

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.410
If you give me the plot and
I got the first chapter,

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.680
I know at this point, I've
done enough of these books

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.070
that I know how to build the
boat as I'm sailing the boat.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.340
I'll figure it out as I go.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.960
But I was like, you
know, it's 20 years.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.190
And the question is, it's
not just can you do it again,

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.490
but can you get better?

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.660
How to get better 20
years into something?

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.200
And you don't really
even have to --

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.500
like, listen, I could
just write the book.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.800
I know how to do it.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.100
I'm going to do it again.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.400
But I was like, don't do it.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.700
And I took a hard look.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.000
Because I knew the 20th
anniversary was coming.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.300
It was like my own
little midlife crisis.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.990
And I said, take a look
at the other books,

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.170
and which ones were
actually the best ones?

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.910
And every time I
come out with a book,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.700
I do think it's the best
one I've ever written.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.520
Why would I put it
out if I didn't?

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.100
But you have to have
some humility

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.090
and realize they can't
all be the very best one.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.920
All right, you can look
at your work and say,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.890
all of them are great, or you
can again, have a little bit

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.010
of a soul and realize,
I can get better.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.130
And I took this hard look
at myself and realized

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.980
that the books that I identified
as the best ones, for me,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.290
were those ones that
had that character.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.690
That character.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.990
So I'm like, don't
start the book

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.370
until you fully have
the characters.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.670
Forget the plot.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.970
You're getting too
heavy on plot.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.450
Let's just try and
find the characters.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.810
And the truth is, this book
started when I was with the USO.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.880
Every year for a while -- now
they skip a couple years --

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.570
but the USO brings six thriller
writers to go to the Middle East

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.400
to entertain our troops.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.460
And the best part
of it is, you know,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.080
they bring the Dallas
Cowboy Cheerleaders,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.810
they bring the MMA fighters.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.360
And my friend was like, can
you tape the audible sigh

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.660
when you walk in the room --

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.040
[ Laughter ]

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.890
-- and they realize that
-- and this truly --

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.890
after the Dallas Cowboy
Cheerleaders that Brad

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.430
and the literary people walk in?

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.790
And that was literally how it --

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.750
it was literally the Dallas
Cowboy Cheerleaders and then us.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.390
And I thought it was
going to be a disaster.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.770
But what I loved is obviously --

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.640
listen, they love
the country singers.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.500
That's who gets the big crowds.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.610
But it's all the people
-- and they're smaller --

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.580
come up afterwards, and they
say, listen, we love when,

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.270
you know, the country
singer comes

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.570
and we love the cheerleaders,
too.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.830
But I'm a reader, and you're the
first person who's here for me.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.230
And that's how you find
your fellow nerds, right?

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.530
That's how you know your people.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.830
It's people who come
at 10:00 in the morning

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.130
to come to this room, right?

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.430
Let's be friends.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:44.840
Like, you know immediately
anyone who comes

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.620
out today you appreciate
has this love

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.000
of books that you have.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.740
And so I'm there, and
I found out when I was

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.340
in the Middle East
when I was in Kuwait

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.390
about this place called
Dover Air Force Base.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.690
And most of us know Dover.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.700
We certainly know
the images of it.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.090
Those flag-covered coffins
that come off the planes

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.480
as our fallen soldiers
are laid to rest.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.580
I believe John McCain's
body we were looking

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.830
up right before here
went through Dover.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.760
They do the work on some
of the most amazing cases.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.150
When the Space Shuttle went
down, the bodies went to Dover.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.910
When the Pentagon
flight on 9/11 went down,

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.210
the bodies went to Dover.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.150
Dover's also the place where all
of our spies across the country,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.450
when they die, and they're

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.490
on secret missions,
their bodies go, too.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.790
And no one knows
their real names,

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.800
but the people at Dover do.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.730
And that means that Dover
is a place that's filled

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.650
with secrets and mysteries.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.070
And I realized right there,

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.610
this is a place I
need to write about.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.500
And the honest truth was,
it was a transaction to me.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.520
I've written about the
White House and Congress,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.900
and I've written about
the Supreme Court,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.390
even the Library of Congress.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.690
And I thought, I'm
going to go in,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.490
I'm going to meet some really
nice people, and we're going

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.350
to talk, and I'm going
to write my book.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.180
And it is a basic transaction.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.420
And sometimes you
make friends, right?

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.690
Like, my friend Sara who
has a love of comics here

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.990
at the Library of Congress.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.430
There are people you remember
and you know and you talk about.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.210
But for the most part,
it's a lot of just research

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.510
and you do the writing.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.250
But what I wasn't
prepared for is when I got

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.380
to Dover how utterly
humbled I was.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.600
Because when I got there, I
saw the work that they had put

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.210
into our fallen soldiers.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.320
Spending 12 hours to rewire
someone's jaw with modeling clay

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.930
to out so a family could
get one last good look

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.460
at their fallen son.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.970
Building, rebuilding
someone's hand from scratch

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.440
because a mother
specifically says she wants

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.520
to hold her son's
hand one last time.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.550
We are a country right now
that is starving for heroes.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.770
I realized right there
these are our real heroes.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.370
These are the best of the
best of us working on the best

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.130
of the best of us, and I knew
I had to write about them.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.600
And that's where I
got my main character,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.900
Zig [assumed spelling].

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.200
And I had the plot of the book.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.630
You know, anytime I do research,
I go to people that I meet

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.930
and I kind of give
them the plot.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.390
And I said, here's
the plot I want.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.990
I want to have a body
that comes through

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.510
and has a hidden message on it.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.640
And they were telling
me there, oh --

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.370
you know, I think they've seen
enough bodies that come through.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.580
I was like, maybe someone had a
tattoo or something they found.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.590
And I said, I just want
some kind of hidden message.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.760
And they said, oh,
we got a story.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.060
There was one time that --

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.940
if you are on a plane and
your plane is going down,

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.950
and you know about it with
it enough advance notice,

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.980
depending on your height,
you can actually take a sheet

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.430
of paper, write a
note, swallow the note,

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.740
and when the plane crashes,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.970
the liquids in your stomach
will actually protect the note.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.400
And I'm like, that's the
craziest story I've ever heard.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.130
They said, but it's not
a story, it happened.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.960
And I said, what are
you talking about?

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.970
And they explained to me
that it really happened.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.690
It was a body that came in, and
the stomach when they opened it

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.010
up had a secret note in it.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.650
And my first thought is, of
course, who would even think

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.670
as your plane is going
down to eat a note?

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.940
It's like, only Batman
thinks of that, right?

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.570
I mean, who -- and so it
has to be, in my head,

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.930
someone in the military,
of course.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.360
But I was also thinking that
when you think about that,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.470
you know, it made me
wonder, of course who it was.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.940
And they wouldn't
tell me who it was,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.190
and I respect the
privacy of that.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.610
But what I realized when I
looked back on that note,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.620
what that note is, is it's
looking for what we all look

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.260
for every day: connection,
right?

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.800
We all want to love
and be loved.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.030
And I know when my parents
passed away, one of the gifts

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.000
that I got is I got
to say goodbye.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.430
And that's what that note was.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.950
It was someone trying
to say goodbye.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.540
Someone reaching out,
reaching out in the universe.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.990
In that moment, when that
note was found saying

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.690
that when we reach out,
we all will be heard.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.550
I love that story.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.730
And I love what it tells
me about the universe.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.290
It also guarantees that the
next time you're on a plane

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.510
and you hit turbulence, you are
going to think of me, right?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.070
[ Laughter ]

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.780
Address your notes
to me so I know.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.200
They should come right to me.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.500
I want them.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.800
I don't want it to be in doubt.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.100
I want to know.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.400
Just write, "Dear Brad".

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.700
They'll get it.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.000
It'll come to me.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.300
Forwarded messages.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.600
And you will think about me.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.900
You will. I promise you.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.200
The moment that plane
goes like that,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.500
you're like, Meltzer, dammit.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.040
[ Laughter ]

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.600
And I got the plot.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.910
There's the plot.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.640
Easy as pie, right?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.910
The book opens up, I have
Zig who's my mortician

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.400
at Dover, and a body comes in.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.170
The body is a woman who
he used to actually --

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.900
when she was a little girl,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.760
was in Girl Scouts
with his daughter.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.060
It's this character Nola.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.360
I love my character Nola.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.060
She's this mysterious figure.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.630
I had this great idea for her.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.960
And the body comes inside into
Dover, he opens up the stomach,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.450
and he sees a secret
note inside.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.380
And the note says,
"Nola, you were right.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.700
Keep running."

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.760
And he realizes that this body
on the table isn't Nola at all.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.920
Nola's not dead, Nola's
alive, and she's on the run.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.280
She's the escape artist.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.010
And I just ruined chapter one
of the book for you, right?

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.310
[ Laughter ]

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.250
There's chapter one.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.950
But I can start it there.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.250
That's it.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.550
I know what I'm doing.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.850
Give me that, I'll
figure out the rest.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.150
I can go. I'll call
my friends --

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.450
like, I'll call Matt
[assumed spelling]

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.750
and I'll call other
friends and, you know,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.050
when I get to stuck parts.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.350
We'll figure it out.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.760
But what I did is I
said, don't do it.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.680
Don't start this book.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.320
Learn something after 20 years.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.660
Don't start this book
until you have Nola.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.170
Don't make her up
as you go along.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.740
It will be far better when
you have the character.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.870
And around that time, we were
doing a TV show called Lost

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.270
History, and we were
searching for the 9/11 flag.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.570
And we were actually here

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.980
in Virginia filming
the very first episode.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.110
And it was out of Fort
Belvoir in Virginia.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.720
And they're giving me a
tour of their museum there.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.900
They have this beautiful
Army Museum.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.850
And at the museum,
they have all this art

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.160
from the military on the walls.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.480
And they have a whole
collection, I mean,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.030
a massive collection of all
this military art painted

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.090
by top military figures,
painted in the field.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.700
I'm like, why does the
government have all this art?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.170
They have art by Adolf Hitler.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.220
Like, why does the
government have all this art?

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.610
And they explained to me
-- and this is true --

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.910
that since World War I,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.130
the US government has had an
actual painter on staff --

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:17.200
a painter -- who is painting
disasters as they happen.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.810
So whether it's storming
the beaches of Normandy,

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.860
whether it's Vietnam,
whether it's 9/11.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.870
The person who got through on
9/11 -- got through security --

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.560
was actually our
painter, our war painter.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.460
And I said, you're telling me

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.320
that while everyone else is
racing in with guns blazing,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.850
we have someone who's
racing in with nothing

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.950
but paintbrushes
in their pockets?

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.060
I'm like, that's the craziest
person I've ever heard of.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.360
I'm like, I got to meet him.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.660
I want to meet him.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.420
And they said to me, you
mean, you want to meet her.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.310
Her. Her. And I was like,
yeah, exactly right, yeah.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.610
And I knew in that moment,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.710
the moment they said the
word her, I said, I got Nola.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.840
I know who she is now.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.120
This woman who races
into disaster.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.100
And we all know anyone who
races into disaster is running

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.390
from their own disaster
in their lives.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.010
I do a lot of comic books,

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.510
and I was doing a book called
Justice League of America.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.060
And if you do a book called
Justice League of America,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.360
you're the nerdiest
person on the earth.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.660
[ Laughter ]

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.400
And I was doing it, and
I was so happy doing it.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.440
And I had a dinner with the
artist of the book, Gene Ha,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.680
who is a beautiful,
elegant artist,

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.940
just one of the best artist in
comics as far as I'm concerned.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.390
We did this issue together.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.010
And he came to Florida where
I live, and we went to dinner.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.120
And at the end of dinner, she
said to me, Brad, you know,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.460
when I spend time with you
now, I know so much more

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.450
about you than just seeing you.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.580
And I'm like, wait, we've been
working together for, you know,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.040
over a year now,
what do you mean?

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.620
And I realized in that moment,

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.510
he then rattles off all
these physical things I do.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.450
And not the obvious ones, but
all these things that I do

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.460
that I never realize
I'm ever doing.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:55.050
He sees the world as an
artist differently than I do.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.110
My friend, Chip Kidd,
the graphic designer,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.440
who did my first and second
book covers, he sees the world

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.870
as a graphic designer
differently

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.280
than the rest of us do.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.290
The rest of us see a big,
red stop sign, right?

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.290
We see it every single day.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.260
Chip Kidd sees the
greatest representation

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.720
of graphic design ever created,
something that can be read

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.080
in any language by any
level of education,

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.700
and everyone knows
what it means.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.280
He sees the world
differently than we do.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.420
And I said, that's what
Nola is as an artist:

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.030
she sees the world
differently than they do.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.740
Nola sees the way your belt
buckle is facing, the little pin

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.380
on it, so she knows
whether you're right-handed

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.890
or left-handed because
of the way you pull it.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.850
Nola sees that when you walk
past a reflective surface

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.660
that you always check
your reflection.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.220
You're vain.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.490
Nola sees that you have crow's
feet, but only on this side

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.620
because you're a hunter
and that's your aiming eye.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.190
Nola sees -- what she
sees are your weaknesses,

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.590
and she finds them instantly.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.150
And I knew my character
right there.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.500
I had Zig, this mortician
who surrounds himself

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.620
with death every day, his own
disasters in his own life.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.060
I had Nola running

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.920
from disasters every
day in her own life.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.690
And then I had this detail.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.840
In 1898, a man named John
Albert Wilkie was put in charge

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.770
of the US Secret Service.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.070
He was actually a magician.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.760
He was a friend of
Harry Houdini,

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.440
and he loved doing
magic tricks himself.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.040
It is the only time in history
that a magician was in control

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.530
of the Secret Service.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.550
I freaking love that
idea, right?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.490
For almost a decade, I was
holding onto that nugget.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.790
I'm like, I'm using that.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.400
That is going somewhere.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.530
And I didn't know
where to put it, right?

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.820
You can put it in any book and
say, look, I have knowledge,

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.490
I threw it in my chapter 24.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.220
But that's not how a
good book is written.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.910
You don't just show up -- you
know, it's not an encyclopedia.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.040
It has to make sense
thematically.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.110
It has to fit into your
story, it has to, you know,

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.480
make the whole story flesh out.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.130
And finally, I had it
because I found out this,

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.150
is that Harry Houdini had
his own Secret Service.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.110
His Secret Service was made
up of family and friends.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.530
And when Harry Houdini -- we all
know, the great escape artist --

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.580
would go to town and he would
come to, let's say, Washington,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.310
D.C., his Secret Service
would come here days earlier

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.060
and they would scout the place.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.880
And they would scout the local
jails and the local police.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.530
They would see what kind
of handcuffs they're using,

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.390
figure out what kind of
locks are on the jail cells.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.690
And Harry Houdini would come
to town and say, I'm here,

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.270
lock me up in your jails,
put me on your handcuffs,

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.570
and I will escape them all.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.850
How? Because he had the key.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.800
Because his Secret Service
figured it all out for him.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.000
I was like, I need to get my
own Secret Service, right?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.300
I want one.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.600
And it's great idea.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.560
But I also found out this: Harry
Houdini was obsessed with death.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.140
He never got over the death
of his mom, one of the cores

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.820
of who he was was exactly that.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.070
And we all know that he was
the great escape artist.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.400
That was half of
his act, though.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.700
It wasn't his whole act.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.000
We all think of --
you know, they put him

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.300
in the water torture
and, bah-bah,

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.950
I'm out, you know, ta-dah.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.050
But that was only
half of his act.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.440
The other half of his act was he
was obsessed with spiritualism.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.190
Back then, after World War I,
we lost so many young people

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.470
in the war, so many
young men in the war,

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.810
that there were spiritualists --
what we'd consider people just

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.700
who were doing sÃ©ances
and fortunetellers --

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.790
who were telling people,
it sounds so silly now --

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.180
but it was just rampant
back then,

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.760
it was like another religion.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.060
They would say, if
you're looking

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.360
for your son, I can
speak to him.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.750
He's sending me a message.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.990
I have a message for you,
and for 5 more dollars,

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.290
I'll tell you what
that message is.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:34.520
And you laugh, but we had Miss
Cleo not too long ago, right?

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.760
In Florida, I say
proudly, my home state.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.060
Naturally.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.910
Where else are we going
to have Miss Cleo?

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.320
But Harry Houdini hated that.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.350
He hated that those
spiritualists were taking

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:49.360
advantage of families' love of
their fallen sons and daughters.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.030
How could you do that?

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.070
So he used to debunk them.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.630
Bring them up on
stage, figure them out,

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.350
show them what frauds they were.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.040
But Harry Houdini was
so obsessed with it also

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.380
that he gave all of his
Secret Service but also all

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.260
of his close family and
friends secret passwords,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.690
secret codewords
that if they died,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.990
they could have a code
word in the sÃ©ance

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.840
that only you and he would know.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.720
So if you came back to life,
he would know it's really you.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.320
And what I love about that
is that Harry Houdini's like,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.310
I don't believe any of this
nonsense, it's all fake.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.280
But in case I'm wrong...

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.550
[ Laughter ]

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.920
Right? So he gives his friend
Matt, here's your code word.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.220
You and I know this codeword.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.710
If you come back after death,

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.310
you say the codeword,
I know it's you.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.090
No one's pulling my leg.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.230
But the word, the
secret codeword

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.860
that Harry Houdini
supposedly gave to his mother,

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.780
the woman whose death
he never got over,

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.870
was this simple word: forgive.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.960
Forgive. One of the most
powerful words in the universe.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.210
And I had Zig, again this
mortician surrounded by death

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.510
who has the holes in his life.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.920
I had Nola, this artist,
who runs into disaster

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.300
because of the holes
in her life.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.880
I had Harry Houdini filled
with holes in his life

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.180
that will never be filled.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.680
And all of us, every person
in this room here today,

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.740
we all have holes in our
lives, different sizes,

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.870
different shapes, caused by,
you know, all different things.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.990
Whether it's the passing of
a loved one, the betrayal

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.640
of a friend, something
that's lost to us.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.610
Addiction, abuse,
whatever it might be,

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.190
we have holes in our lives.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.950
We have holes that
we're thrown down into.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.140
But we must get out.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.400
We have to climb out.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.330
And the best way always, the
first step out of that hole is

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.370
to forgive; especially,
to forgive yourself.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.090
And that's the escape artist.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.970
That's what it was to me.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.310
I'll tell you one last thing,

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.610
and then I love answering
questions

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.990
because that always takes into
different worlds and universes.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.900
But when I look back I can say,
OK, what do I learn by that?

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.900
Now I'm at 20 years
and, you know,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.040
what do you take
back away from that?

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.080
Do you say, OK, I got it,
you know, I wrote this book,

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.380
and I'm proud of
it, and here we are?

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.380
But I have to take
something else from it.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.040
I'll tell you my magic
trick to explain it.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.160
And that is, you know, I started
writing here in Washington,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.630
D.C. this is where I wrote The
Tenth Justice when I was here.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.040
And right before The Tenth
Justice was published,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.780
my first actual book that
I ever wrote was a book

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.080
about college life.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.950
It got me 24 rejection letters.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.300
There were only 20 publishers.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.940
I got 24 rejection
letters, right?

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.240
Which means some
people wrote me twice

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.540
to make sure I got the point.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:36.920
But I can tell you -- and
I rarely tell this story.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.850
But the first 22 rejection
letters came quickly.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.300
Number 23 and 24 were actually
supposed to -- we thought --

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.370
were going to be
acceptance letters.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.290
My editor had told me
that the last two people,

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:51.680
23 and 24, love your book.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.800
They really love
your first book.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.020
And I went to New York
and I met with them.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.550
I had these big meetings
with publishers.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.020
It was a big deal to me.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.770
And then she said to
me, wait by the phone.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.860
Because it was back in the day
when you waited by the phone.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.680
And I was living right here
in the city on L Street.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.610
And I'm waiting by the phone,
and I'm waiting truly for her

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.620
to tell me -- I was in college
debt and law school debt

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.300
at that point to pay off.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.670
In so much debt that I'm waiting
to pick up the phone and for her

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:21.720
to tell me the deal and
the offer and the money

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.020
that we're going to
get for this book

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.850
so I can start paying
my debt off.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.700
I'm waiting to pick up the phone
and tell me the victory we're

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.680
about to have that they
both love this book so much.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.980
And the phone rings,
and I picked

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.280
up the phone, I'll never forget.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.460
She said, sorry, kiddo.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.980
And my stomach just
bottomed out right there.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.280
I was devastated.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.580
It was gone.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.880
That was 23 and 24.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.180
They passed.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.570
And to this day -- we all
have our rituals in our lives.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.420
We don't think we do, but we
do, even if it's what you eat

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.790
for breakfast, we
all have our rituals.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.690
And I'm going to tell you
my ritual, my magic trick.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:58.350
It's that since that day
every single day that I sit

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.940
down to write -- every day
that I sit down to write --

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.930
I re-create that exact
moment perfectly in my head.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.060
I picture the exact
phone I was holding.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.880
It was one of those
clear, see through ones

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.160
where you could see the
wires running through it.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.390
If you're laughing at that,
you're old, too, right?

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.570
That was, like, high
tech at the time, right?

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:18.030
Oh, it's see-through.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.330
We can see how it works, right?

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.120
On my left, there was a
Formica desk that everyone has

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.620
when they're in college.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.580
On my right was a box spring
and a mattress; no headboard,

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.920
just exactly what you have.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.220
That was the decor.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.730
I picture the terrace
that I was looking over,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.110
the concrete parking lot,
and this fire station

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.060
that has these three
doors, one, two, three.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.880
I picture them in my head
and I count them every day,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.180
just like I did this morning.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.480
One, two, three.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.650
And then I close and I
say those words to myself.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.230
Sorry, kiddo.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.070
For 20 years, I've
been saying that.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.200
Because I never, ever
want to believe I made it.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.620
At the moment I think I
made it, I'm finished.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.840
And I always want to
be as hungry as I was

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.190
when I was 24 years
old living in the city.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:03.280
I never, ever want to take
what I have for granted

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.580
because the moment
I do, I'm done.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.110
I always want to be that hungry.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.770
I want to sit down every day
like I'm a 24-year-old kid

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.810
in debt, and I want
to write this book

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.550
because it's the only thing
that's going to save me

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.610
if I can tell this story.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.470
And for 20 years, I've
never missed a working day.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.810
Sorry, kiddo.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.120
Sorry, kiddo.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.790
Sorry, kiddo.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.660
I am the escape artist, right?

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.590
And that's what we
all need to be.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.360
Not to escape and run away,
but all of us have those things

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.640
in our lives that we've been
doing for years and years.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.420
Ask yourself, challenge
yourself, how do you get better?

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.600
Look back at who you
were and change it up.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.050
You'll never regret it.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.260
And don't beat yourself
up for what you do

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.810
when you get in your ruts.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.960
Forgive. Forgive,
starting with yourself.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.250
And you, too, will
be the escape artist.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.910
So that is the book.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.210
I'd love to talk more.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.510
We'll talk about
the kids' books,

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.410
we'll talk about anything
you want to ask about.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.240
I see there's microphones here,
but you can also raise your hand

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.260
and yell it out and I'll
repeat the question, I promise.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.560
But you can ask about anything.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.350
You can ask about the TV shows,
the comics, the kids' books.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.870
I know there are some people
who -- I can see kids here,

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.560
and I love that you
brought your child to hear

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.010
about the gruesome
detail of death.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.310
[ Laughter ]

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.670
You are indeed the greatest
parents of all time in the D.C.,

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.760
Maryland, and Virginia area.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.240
OK, here comes some
first brave souls.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.900
&gt;&gt; You're almost as good a
speaker as you are a writer.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.200
Thank you very much
for being here.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.500
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer:
I appreciate that.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.800
That's a good question.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.100
You can go sit down now.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.400
[ Laughter ]

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.700
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you
about your kids' books.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.000
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: Yes, please.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.300
&gt;&gt; What's the age
that you're targeting?

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.600
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: Yeah.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.900
So let's talk about it.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.200
So for those who don't know --
and thank you for asking that,

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.540
sir, because it lets me
shill like nobody's business.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.840
So for those who don't
know, I also do kids' books.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.040
When my sons and daughter
were born, I was just tired

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.190
of them looking at reality
TV show stars and people

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.090
who were famous for
being famous.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.590
And I said, you know what,
I have so many better heroes

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.950
that we can give them.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.080
And we started with
I am Amelia Earhart

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.450
and I am Abraham Lincoln.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:01.110
We did I am Rosa Parks, Albert
Einstein, Jackie Robinson.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:02.850
Because my son loves sports.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.590
And I was like, don't look
at this athlete, you know,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.350
who all that person does
is score a lot of points.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.210
It doesn't change
the world in any way.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.510
Meet Jackie Robinson.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:12.860
This is how you change
the world.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.090
This is what a leader
looks like.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.720
We did George Washington.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.110
We did Lucille Ball -- I did for
my daughter because I wanted her

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.400
to have a female entertainment
hero who wasn't just famous

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.300
for being thin and pretty.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.260
That Lucille Ball stood for
the idea that it's not just OK

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.080
to be different, it's
spectacular to be different.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.900
The only thing that connects
us in this room completely

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.410
that is true for all of us
is we are all different.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.610
It is something that
we just frown on today,

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.390
but it is the most
celebrated thing

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.510
that we should hold
up is our difference.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.670
And I love that I am
Lucille Ball stood for that.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.030
We did Helen Keller,
I am Dr. King.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.570
We did I am Jane Goodall,
also for my daughter

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.970
because she loves our dog.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.520
And I wanted to show her what
your love of something can do.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.900
Jane Goodall used
her love of animals

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.310
to just have breakthroughs
in science and make us look

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.520
and study animals in a way
that has changed since.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.890
And we did for my youngest
son, who's our creative one,

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.000
I did I am Jim Henson.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.300
Because I can tell you

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.720
when I was five years old
watching Sesame Street

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.920
and Mr. Rogers that
they taught me

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.370
that you could use
your creativity

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.530
to put good into this world.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.010
And when we did I am Jim Henson,

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.440
that's all I hope I'm doing here
today is using my creativity

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.380
to try and put good
into this world.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.170
And I love that we
get to do that book,

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.140
got to work with Jim Henson's
family to put that book out.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.500
And we've done Harriet
Tubman, we've done Gandhi --

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.050
which again, we need
right now, right?

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.900
Just think about how much
were slaughtering each other

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.200
every day.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.730
Hate, hate hating each other.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.440
Whatever your side is,
you hate the other.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.280
And we need to actually
find peace.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.360
We need to actually
be able to calm down

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.860
and communicate in
a peaceful way.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.970
That's what inspired Dr.
King, and there's a reason.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.800
And it actually leads
me to the two newest --

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.780
this one comes out in 11 days.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.320
This is I am Neil Armstrong.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.600
And I brought -- and we're going
to have -- this is a democracy.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.070
I also brought the one after
that, I am Sonja Sotomayor.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.550
So yeah, that's right.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.510
Let's see Sonja Sotomayor
do this.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.040
[ Laughter ]

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.340
Wait, she's doing this today?

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.900
Crap. We actually have
the same publisher.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.360
And the publisher was
like, we're coming

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.340
out with kids' books about
her at the exact same time?

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.370
And they're like, Brad,
can you wait one month

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.670
for her book to come out?

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.010
And I'm like, no.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:28.230
And then we're like, well,
we'll wait, thank you very much.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.830
And we're going to
have a show of hands.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.810
I'm going to read
from one of the books.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.640
It's either the one Neil
Armstrong you can raise your

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.340
hand -- not yet!

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.860
Or you raise your hand
for Sonja Sotomayor.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.160
So are you ready to vote?

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.460
Are you ready to vote?

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.760
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.060
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer:
It's a democracy.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.770
We're in Washington, D.C.
Raise your hand if you want

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.580
to hear from Neil Armstrong.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.880
OK, woo hoo.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.180
Sonja Sotomayor?

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.480
&gt;&gt; Woo!

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.780
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: I knew it!

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.080
That's why I brought that one.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.380
OK, here we go.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.730
And I'll tell you that what
the fun of this book is

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.220
when you have a person
who's alive --

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.830
like, if I screw up Neil
Armstrong or George Washington

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.130
or Abraham Lincoln,
they don't care.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.060
[ Laughter ]

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.490
They're not coming to my house.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.520
If you screw up Sonja
Sotomayor --

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.110
there's a scene in here when she
gets into a fight in the Bronx.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:18.020
Do not screw up Sonja Sotomayor.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.940
But her office was so nice.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.270
They were so nice in
helping us get this right,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.830
and embarrassing
me with the details

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.540
that I got wrong, of course.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.940
So this is -- I'm
going to read from one

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.220
of my favorite parts
of the book.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.570
And I also by the way, this
book is also the best use

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.810
of Jewish guilt ever because
someone in my family --

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.190
what we call in my family
Jewban, it's a Jewish Cuban.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.670
So she's Latina, and she's
like, if you don't do a book,

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:45.700
I'm going to murder you because
I have my little Latina niece

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.000
and nephew.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.300
So this is it.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.760
It says, "In my life, I was
the aji, the hot pepper,

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.930
the one who wouldn't slow down.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:57.900
Because of where I was from,
because I was poor and Latina,

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.420
some people didn't
think I would go far.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.460
But there were others who
helped my dreams come to life.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.030
They gave me opportunities
and reminded me to keep going.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.620
Those are the people
you need to listen to.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.270
Pay attention to the
ones who believe in you.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.830
The more you learn,
the farther you'll go.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.240
Education is a rocket ship.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.150
It can take you anywhere.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.910
But no matter how high you fly,
never forget where you started."

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:24.210
And here's the final
page of the book.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:26.350
It says, "Whether it's
in English, Spanish,

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:30.260
or any other language, our
dreams are often the same:

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:34.830
a loving family, kind friends,
a safe place to call home,

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.450
and the chance to
reach our potential.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.050
The world outside your
window is a starting point,

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.100
but there's so much
more beyond that.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.400
Read, study, do right by people.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.270
No matter where you're
born, there's no limit

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.920
to what you can accomplish.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.950
I am Sonja Sotomayor.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:55.400
I am proud that with
opportunity comes justice."

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.700
And there's the end of the book.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.500
I just ruined the
ending, by the way.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.160
[ Applause ]

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.660
That is the first time
anyone's heard the book.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.960
This is actually,
like, a proof copy.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.260
It's not even bound.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.560
You can, like, pull it apart.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.560
But I felt like I knew what
you we're going to vote for.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.760
Like, I'm from D.C. I'm like,
there's no way they're going

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.290
to be suckers and take the
book they can get in ten days.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.290
Like, this isn't coming
out until November.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.060
And plus, it's D.C., man.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.360
Supreme Court.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.660
OK, other questions, yes?

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.960
&gt;&gt; What's the age?

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.260
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: Oh, sorry,

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.560
I never answered
your question, right.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.860
[ Laughter ]

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.160
Oh, screw your question.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.460
[ Laughter ]

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.610
The age. So we are --
everyone is buying them

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.370
as baby gifts now, which
is fascinating to me.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.580
They're building libraries of
real heroes for their kids,

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.290
their grandkids, their
nieces and nephews.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:40.830
But our sweet spot is
actually 5 to 9 years old.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.220
If your kid's an early
reader, it's 4 to 9.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.160
But 5 to 9 is our sweet spot.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.460
But thanks to everyone who's
bought all the baby gifts.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.760
It's amazing.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.230
All these people now come to me
in line and they'll be pregnant

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.610
or they'll say, my
granddaughter's pregnant,

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.580
and they'll say, you can't
tell anyone the name,

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.920
and they whisper it to me.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.520
So I know everyone's
baby's first names before,

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.820
like, the husbands do.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.120
[ Laughter ]

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.210
It's fantastic.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.510
Yes?

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.180
&gt;&gt; So I'm also a college student
and I want to be a writer,

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.720
and I'm particularly interested
mysteries and thrillers.

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:14.010
So I was wondering if you
had any advice for, like,

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.340
balancing college life
or post-college life

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.520
and being a writer
at the same time?

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.820
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: Yeah.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.120
The question is, is how do
I publish my book, Brad?

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.420
[ Laughter ]

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.560
No. So it's a good question,
is after college if you want

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.810
to pursue a lifestyle as a
writer, what kind of best path,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:30.110
any advice, is that right?

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.430
And I can tell you --
I'll tell you mine.

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:33.730
That's the only story I have.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.230
And the beautiful part of
writing is there are no rules.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:39.150
Everything that anyone tells
you about how to write,

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.510
there's someone that
does the exact opposite.

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.930
There's people who plot their
books and do it by outline form,

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:44.790
there's people who
say, I'm going to see

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.090
where the day takes me.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.390
And both work.

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:48.690
It's best for you.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.990
And so the short
answer is you have

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:51.290
to find what works best for you.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.820
But for me, I couldn't
afford to go wait tables

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.020
and then write my,
you know, dream novel.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.000
I had no money.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.570
I had to figure out
how to pay for it.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.490
So I wound up just
getting a job.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.210
I worked here in D.C.
I worked at a law firm,

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.010
I was in law school,
I worked at night.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:10.490
I just always gave
every single night --

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.680
I would come home from
work, I would eat dinner,

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.090
and my rule was is by 8:00,

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.120
no matter what, I
had to be writing.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.030
I wrote from 8:00 to
11:00 every night.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.400
I took off Friday nights always,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.930
and then I wrote
all day Saturday,

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.990
all day Sunday, the whole days.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.630
And I did that for a year.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.010
And that's how you
build a novel.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:29.310
A novel is like a sand castle

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.590
that you build a grain
of sand at a time.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.790
You put the first grain
down, you got nothing.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.090
Chapter one.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:36.390
The second grain
down, you got nothing.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.690
But you sit there for a year.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:39.930
You write a page
every day for a year,

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.230
you will have a novel
by the end.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.530
It may not be good,
it may not be great,

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:43.830
but you're going
to have a novel.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.550
So keep going, keep
going, keep going.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.440
The answer is, is
I had 24 people

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.800
who told me to give it up.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.790
It doesn't mean they're
right and I was wrong.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.810
Or I can look back and say,
you know, I was right and wrong

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.170
and ha-ha on them,
look what happened.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:58.470
Life is subjective.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:59.770
Keep going.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.970
Don't let anyone
no, just keep going.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:03.270
And I can't wait
until you're up here

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.800
and we get to cheer for you.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.030
[ Laughter ]

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.330
Yes, sir?

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.640
&gt;&gt; What's your writing
process like?

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.480
Do you do it in the
mornings, you work at a desk?

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.780
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: Yeah.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.040
In terms of process, you know,
for me, I treat it like a job.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.490
I think I write better
at night, but I have kids

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:20.790
and I don't want to miss them.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.990
So I'm usually sitting
down by 9:00, 9:30,

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.370
futzing around on the Internet.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:29.900
And then I tend to be by 10:00
at least try to be writing.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.880
I write straight
through until 2:30.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.240
I don't take lunch until 2:30.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.090
Because the moment I take
lunch, I just get tired

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.390
and I kind of lose it.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.970
So I want to just starve myself
into, you know, going as long

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.550
as I can and getting that
long block of writing.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.250
And then sometimes
I can come back.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:46.050
When I was in my 20s, I would
aim for eight pages a day.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.360
When I was in my 30s, I aimed
for about six pages a day.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.840
When I hit my 40s, I was like,

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.070
four pages a day
will be awesome.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.990
And now I'm like, I'm writing
the best two pages every day

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.540
that anyone has ever
seen, or if I can.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.020
So the truth is, is I sit down

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.940
and I read what I wrote the
day before and then I take off

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.240
from there and then
start writing again.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.540
And I can see my
friend Hank is nodding.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.070
I'm sure many of us do the same.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.370
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.670
I like your haircut, by the way.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.970
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: I was
going to say, I like yours.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.680
Tip your barbar.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.130
&gt;&gt; Hi, Brad Meltzer.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.490
So my question is, I
discovered you in middle school

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.470
through your Ted Talks.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.030
Well, also through the
History Channel and also

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.380
through your Ted Talks.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:30.800
And you mention in your Ted
Talks anyone can enjoy history.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.990
The person -- you mentioned
if you do a lemonade stand,

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.990
that person can make history.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.630
And so the idea of --
I love history, too.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.380
And so the idea of
constantly loving history

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.910
and embracing yourself
in it is so simple,

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.280
but also some students
hate history.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.410
So how do you, like, balance the
fact that history can be amazing

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.610
but it's also kind
of hard and complex?

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:55.910
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: Yeah,
no, great question.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.230
Because I would fail those
students who hate a history.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.240
[ Laughter ]

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.680
But the real answer is,

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.740
is anyone who hates history
just hasn't found the story

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.040
they love.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.340
It's like a good book.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.640
When people say, I don't like
to read, it's like, no, no,

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.660
you just haven't
found your story.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.960
Let's find it together.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.300
My friend John Meacham yesterday
said this beautiful idea

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.990
about history is he said, you
know, history is how we learn

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.630
so much about ourselves, but
not by looking down on it

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.670
and hating it, and not by
looking up at it and thinking

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.960
that it's perfect in every way,
some kind of concrete statue

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.690
that we must admire and revere.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.520
The best way to look at history
is dead in the eye, right?

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.820
And that's what it is.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.380
To me, you show me that kid who
doesn't like it, and let's find

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.680
out the story that they love.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.560
Tell me their story,
and I'll tell you

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.860
who their hero will be, right?

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.420
You tell me who you are
and -- when you were a kid,

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.340
and I'll tell you who you are.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.640
You tell me who you want to be,

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.390
and I'll tell you
who your hero is.

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:48.990
And you just got to find
the right story for them.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.290
So don't give up on them.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.590
Stick with them.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.890
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:54.190
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: And if
they continue that way,

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.490
totally give up on them.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:56.790
[ Laughter ]

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.090
&gt;&gt; I'll never give up on them.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.390
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: OK, good.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.690
Thank you.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.990
We've got a couple more minutes,
but I want to get all --

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.290
these last two questions.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.590
Yes?

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:05.890
&gt;&gt; Who do you read
for pleasure and why?

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:07.190
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: Yeah.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.490
Who do I read for pleasure?

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:09.790
You know, sometimes --

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.090
my favorite author is actually
this guy named Brad Meltzer.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.390
[ Laughter ]

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:13.690
And sometimes I just put
on his TV show and I sit

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.990
with his books, and
I go, oh, Meltzer,

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.290
you've done it again [laughs].

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:21.100
The reality is -- and
the funny part is --

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.700
actually, that's true.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.000
I do do that.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.450
I mean, again our
TV show is called --

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.750
it's not even Lost History.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.980
It's called Brad
Meltzer's Lost History.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.500
It's called Brad
Meltzer's Decoded, right?

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.280
Those are the greatest
titles of all time.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.600
I was like, I said to my wife
the other day, I'm like, honey,

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.550
what are we having for Brad
Meltzer's dinner tonight?

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.890
Because yesterday we had
Brad Meltzer's chicken

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.660
and tonight I'd like to
have Brad Meltzer's pasta.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.510
And she was like, you can go
sleep on Brad Meltzer's couch.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.070
[ Laughter ]

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.860
And that's not even a joke.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:58.280
So I can tell you that
for me, what do I read?

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.060
I read a lot of nonfiction,

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.190
just because of the
nature of work now.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.490
And I absorb it.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.240
I mean, I'm just trying
to think right now, OK,

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.610
what were the last books
that I've been reading?

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.020
And they were -- I
can't say who it is

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.350
because we don't have
the clearance on it yet,

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.210
but they were the biographies
of the hero that we're doing

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:17.130
at the end of 2019,
just consuming them.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.710
On the fiction side, I don't
read thrillers anymore.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.010
I almost never read thrillers

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.540
because all I'm doing
is taking them apart.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.570
I'm like a mechanic
in a rental car.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.970
I'm just trying to figure out
what's wrong with it, right?

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.960
And it's ruining
the ride for me.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.040
And, you know, even when I watch
a movie, if it's a thriller

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.780
in any way -- I was
watching the movie Looper,

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.570
which is a great movie,
Rian Johnson's movie.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.600
And I'm sitting there with
my wife, and we're, like,

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.550
a half hour into it,
and I'm like, I got it.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:43.190
And she's like, do not
ruin this ending for me.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.910
Do not ruin this ending.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.890
And the movie finishes,
and she turns to me,

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:48.190
she's like, were you right?

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.010
And I go, my way
is so much better.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.690
[ Laughter ]

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.630
And that's all I do in a
thriller is I'm just trying

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.930
to figure out the tricks.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.380
I enjoy it for about
50 pages to 100 pages,

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.890
and then I'm just
taking it apart.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.060
But what I do read
nonstop and what I have

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.830
in my bag right now
are comic books.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:04.260
That's what I'm always reading.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.950
Whether it's Brian Michael
Bendis or Jason Aaron

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.770
or Neil Gaiman or anyone
else that's out there.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:14.040
That's what I consume on
truly almost a daily basis.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.440
And for me that's
-- it's what I love.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.330
And again, I think, you know,

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.800
local writer Tom King is
doing the best Batman stories

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.340
that we've seen in a decade.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.120
And they're still amazing
because they're not

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.700
about fighting crime
or anything else,

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.720
but they're about that great
thing that every book has,

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.020
or at least that I
think is a good book --

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.830
but they say something
about us, right?

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.400
That idea that Batman is Batman

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.800
because of the death
of his parents.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.980
And every day that
Batman goes out to fight,

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.170
he knows he's going to fail.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.050
He knows he's going
out to stop crime.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.000
He's got to stop, but
he's always going to fail.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.300
He's never going to stop crime.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.600
There's going to be
another crime tomorrow.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.310
And every day he goes out,
he knows he's going to fail,

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.110
but the next day he's got
to try and do it again.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.410
Or Superman.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.880
To me, the most important part
of the story is not Superman;

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.420
the most important part
of the story's Clark Kent.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.470
Because we're all Clark Kent.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.510
We all know what it's like
to be boring and ordinary

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.300
and wish we could do something
incredibly beyond ourselves.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.100
Those are the stories I
love, and that's what I read.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.400
OK, she's telling
me two minutes.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.700
And we got last question.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.000
We're going to land
the plane on time.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.300
&gt;&gt; What are your taboos, if any?

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.640
What would you never
write about?

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.940
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer: What
when I never about?

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.240
I mean, gosh, wow.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.630
I want to give you
a real answer.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:21.930
Yeah, run that up.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:23.230
We'll do it real quick.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:24.710
What would I never write about?

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.660
Nothing. I'm just
that much of a --

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.280
I mean, to me, there's
nothing that couldn't --

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.660
you know, I think that --
the only thing I won't write

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.140
about is something
I don't care about.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.970
As long as I care about
it, I'll write about it.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.670
And I feel like it can bring --
you know, to me I have that --

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.190
the X factor in every book is,

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.720
does the writer love
what they're doing?

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.450
And if they do, it
will show on the page.

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:45.750
Yeah. Last question.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.050
This better be good.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.350
The whole room is
waiting on you.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:49.650
No pressure.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.330
Just make sure this is
the best question, yes.

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:52.630
&gt;&gt; In reference to
your new book,

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.540
where did you acquire the
knowledge to write realistically

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.900
from a perspective of a woman?

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.200
&gt;&gt; Brad Meltzer:
Ah, good question.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.770
No, the question is,
you have one of --

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.420
the two main characters of
the book are Zig and Nola,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.320
and where did you get the
perspective of a woman

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.620
to try and write that?

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.180
And obviously, it is hard.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.290
The first time I ever
wrote a woman protagonist,

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.020
I had her go into the bathroom.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.400
And she was going into court
and she was all nervous,

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.210
so she splashed water
on her face.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.820
And then she goes
back into the thing.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.120
All the women are
laughing now, right?

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.080
And my wife said, you clearly
have never worn makeup.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.140
[ Laughter ]

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.910
And don't even ask when I had
to write the scene and had

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:28.810
to figure out what women do
with pantyhose when they go

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.110
to the bathroom, right?

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.410
Like, had no idea.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:34.720
Like, it was a foreign
language to me.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.270
What I do is I rely on
my wife and I rely on --

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:38.820
Sergeant Amy Brown [assumed
spelling] was really helpful

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.120
for this book.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.460
And she's the actual --
not current, just finished,

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.220
artist in residence for the
military and for the Army.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.560
And she told me her life story.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.470
And her life story is
obviously very different

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.380
from the I made up, but
it was her perspective

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.970
that I felt like kept me right.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.490
She was my true north,
and I wrote toward her.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:57.790
And it's hard, right?

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.090
Because I didn't live that.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.390
I didn't have that experience.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:01.690
I'm trying my best.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.710
OK, with that, as I get
the one-minute sign.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.340
The most important thing is
what I said at the beginning.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.400
Thank you, thank you, thank you

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.040
for saying screw you
to Dave Eggers today.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.060
[ Laughter ]

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.050
And thank you for -- seriously,
thank you for coming out here.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.380
This is the hometown
crowd for me.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.190
This is where I started writing,

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.510
this is where I love
coming back to.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.660
And anyone who comes out
at 10:00 in the morning

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.280
on a Saturday and
wakes up early,

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.850
you're my kind of
people for books.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.810
So the next writer is my friend,

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:29.110
Hank [assumed spelling],
who's coming up.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.190
Please stick around, please
stay in this room all day.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.490
We have sleeping
bags in the back.

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:33.790
[ Laughter ]

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:35.740
But thank you for coming here
and for supporting the Library

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.160
of Congress and the
National Book Festival.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.460
Thanks very much.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.000
