JEREMY: Just say that we're
delighted to welcome back

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.080
to Google, David Peterson,
linguist, language creator.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.259
And his new book is "The
Art of Language Invention."

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.231
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:17.175
DAVID PETERSON: Grab this.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:18.050
All right, all right.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.160
By the way, Jeremy, I just
want to mention beforehand,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.480
you have a great one of
those teacher stares,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.231
the "I can wait just
as long as you."

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:31.730
Wonderful.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.450
All right.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.022
So anyway, thank you.

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:35.230
Thank you all for coming out.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.640
I'm delighted to be here again.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.440
This is my first
time in this room,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.830
and I absolutely love the
color of the chairs, which

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.370
of course, nobody watching
this on YouTube can see.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.230
But they're randomly colorful.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.850
I would definitely be
sitting in an orange chair.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.140
Anyway, so as we're
getting started,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.300
let me get out of the way
my fancy little animation.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.510
Check this out.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.500
Ooh, sparkly.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.890
All right, so that's
the title of the book.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.024
Anyway, so yeah, my
name is David Peterson,

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:06.690
as he mentioned.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.850
This is a picture of me.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.690
That's my mother buttoning
my top button there

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.420
the morning of my wedding
because I couldn't do it.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.140
Anyway, so I've created
a number of languages

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.187
for television and film.

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:21.270
Some of them, you'll know.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.853
So for example, for
"Game of Thrones,"

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:24.960
I created the Dothraki
and Valyrian languages.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.760
And this bottom one is Mag Nuk.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.399
That was a language I created
for the giant for last season.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.190
I kind of thought that
he was going to have

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.480
more lines than just one.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.565
Probably didn't merit an
entire language, but you know.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.942
Hey, now there's a possibility
for a great big giant monologue

00:01:41.942 --> 00:01:42.900
sometime in the future.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.858
I'd look forward to it.

00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:47.030
Anyway, so I've also
created languages

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.370
for "Defiance," specifically
these languages.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.110
And I got the
opportunity to create

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.590
these fancy scripts for them.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.010
I love that I was
able to do that.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.890
Creating scripts is one
of my favorite things

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.460
to do as a language creator.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.906
And you can't always
convince the production

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:01.780
that it's worthwhile,
but sometimes, you can.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.380
So "Defiance," and then I
did that for "Star Crossed"

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.320
as well, where I created a
language and a writing system.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320
This was a show that
was on the CW last year

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.640
and had a one season run.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.110
After that, I created a language
for Thor's "The Dark World"--

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.662
it was the sequel to
Thor-- called Shivaisith.

00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:19.370
And I did create a
writing system for it.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.180
But this was actually--
it's a bizarre-- it is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.620
a fan-created writing system.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.760
So I created it for a
fan of the language.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.450
It wasn't actually
used in the film.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.605
But there's basically one
real big fan of this language,

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:34.896
and I thought, well, all right.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.410
I also created a language
for "Dominion" on Syfy

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.350
called Lishepus.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.641
It's the one that the angels
and the Eight-Balls speak,

00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:44.750
if you watch that show.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.930
I created a language for the
second season on for "The 100."

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.640
The language that
the Grounders speak,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.290
it's called Trigedasleng.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.600
And then for "Penny Dreadful,"
which is an amazing show,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.140
I created a language
for season two.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.700
It's basically the
demonic language

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.430
that you hear Vanessa and the
witches speaking periodically.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.870
And it's pretty cool.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.130
And I'm also happy
to announce that I'm

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.380
working on a new show
called "Emerald City"

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.170
that's going to be
on NBC next year.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.550
And all the episodes
are directed

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.121
by Tarsem, which is just crazy.

00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:13.870
He did "The Fall."

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.820
He's so good.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.070
I'm really excited about it.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.340
And so the two languages
that I've created are called

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.775
Munja'kin and Inha.

00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:23.090
You can look forward to that.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.130
But I am not here
today to talk to you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.002
about any of those
languages at all,

00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:28.210
any of those fancy languages.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.390
I'm here to talk to you
about this language, Megdevi.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.220
How many people have
heard of this language?

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.330
Are you serious?

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.130
Wow.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.130
I really did not expect
to see any hands.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.140
All right, so this is the
first language I ever created.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.840
I created it as kind of
a freshman, sophomore,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.370
over-the-summer type of
thing at UC Berkeley.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.490
And if you're wondering why
the language is called this,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.260
I had a girlfriend at
the time named Megan.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.380
My name is David.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.340
And then you've seen,
fantasy languages

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.480
sometimes have names like this--
Cheysuli, Dothraki, Ferengi,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.540
Pakuni.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.500
And so that was how
you got the name

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.820
of that embarrassing language.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.230
So this was my very
first take at it.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.850
I had never heard
of anybody creating

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.660
a language for any
purpose other than

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.459
international communication
prior to doing this.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.240
So I truly believed I was the
first person ever to do it.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.540
And in fact, at the
time, I thought, oh, wow.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.201
I could create a language
for myself and that maybe me

00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:32.450
and my girlfriend could speak.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.990
And maybe there's actually
marketability in this

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.990
since nobody's ever thought
of this idea before.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.990
This is what I believed.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.830
This is 2000, bear in mind.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.510
It's just that conlanging wasn't
very much in the public eye.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.340
Anyway, as for how
this language worked,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.357
I need to take a sidetrack
and introduce you

00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:50.440
to a little bit of Arabic.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.606
I'm sure there are some
people here who know Arabic,

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:55.300
but for those that don't, I took
a year of Arabic at UC Berkeley

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.810
and absolutely fell in
love with the language.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.020
It's a wonderful language.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.020
I never imagined a language
that, grammatically,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.880
could work in that way.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.780
And one of the unique
features of Arabic

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.279
is that it has something
called a root system,

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.070
usually a triconsonantal
root system, where

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.420
you have something like these
three consonants-- K, T, and B.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.660
And by the way, Arabic is
written from right to left.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.900
So notice how each
consonant matches up

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.900
with the orthographic
form there.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.580
And what happens is that
this root has something

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.855
to do with books and writing.

00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:33.740
But the way that
it is transformed

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.670
into words in the language
is that you actually arrange

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.770
vowels inside and without
these consonants, and also

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.320
suffixes and prefixes, to
form different types of words.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.910
And the only thing
that remains constant

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.290
is the linear order of
these three consonants.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.420
So for example, these are all
verbs in different tenses.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.310
At the top, we have "naktub,"
which means "we write."

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.620
Then on the lower left, we have
"aktub," which means "I write."

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.364
And then in the past, "katabat,"
which means "she wrote."

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.530
And notice that the only
thing that's happening here

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.030
is K, T, and B are always
in the exact same order.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.300
Sometimes, they're right
next to each other.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.936
Sometimes, there are
vowels in between.

00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:13.310
And you can make
even more words.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.000
So for example, "kaatib,"
"writer." "Maktab," "office."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.020
And "kitaab," "book,"
just like that.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.151
So I thought that was a really,
really cool way for a language

00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:23.650
to work.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.420
And I never heard of it before.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.600
And so basically,
when I was creating

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.140
my own language, Megdevi,
I just copied it wholesale.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.970
And I also created
this terrible font,

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.680
which I included
just so that you

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.930
could see how terrible it is.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.951
Actually, when you're
standing that far back,

00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.450
it actually looks
better than it is.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.860
But there are just so
many little shaky lines

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.290
and everything, just god awful.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.720
Anyway, so that you could
have a root like this-- ja,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.850
su, fe-- and have
jaesif-- these are

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.940
real words from the
language-- "flame thrower."

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.290
Jisfe, "flame-colored."

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.330
And jasif, "flame," like that.

00:07:00.196 --> 00:07:02.360
Hm, flame thrower, whatever.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.450
And you can also see that
with the writing system,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.750
I was heavily
inspired by Arabic.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.292
So if you were to
spell something

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:10.500
that would be roughly
equivalent to the pronunciation

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.440
of "writer" in Arabic, "kaatib,"
it would look like this.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.070
And so you can see the K,
it's got that thing on it.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.780
And it just has a little
bubble on the top.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.024
And the B has one dot
except it's above.

00:07:23.024 --> 00:07:24.440
And there's another
little bubble.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.280
And the T looks more T-like.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.570
It was clearly just derivative.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.940
The worst part about it
though, was, in my mind,

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.250
the way that I
understood language

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.800
to work, and specifically,
how I created words

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.550
for this language.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.600
So grammatically,
it's a neat system.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.200
But I just want you to look
at some of these [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.330
In order to be able
to appreciate this,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.930
you have to know these
three patterns right here.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.250
So the 1, 2, and 3 are for the
consonants that will change

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.170
root to root.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.150
And then pay attention
to the vowels on top.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.210
If it has an "ae" as the
first vowel and an "i"

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.140
as the second vowel, that's
more or less a thing.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.720
If it has an "ay" as the first
vowel and an "i" as the second,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.920
that's a person.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.115
And then if it has an
"ee" as the first vowel

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.960
and "eh" as the second
vowel, that is a place.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.590
All right, so our
first word, there

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.810
wasn't a place one for it,
but "jaelif" is a sailboat,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.850
"jelif" is "sailor."

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.210
All right, fine.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.510
That makes more or less sense.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.480
Next, W, V, D.
"Wived" is "marina.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.210
"Wevid" is "mariner."

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.549
And what the difference is
between "sailor" and "mariner,"

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.071
hm, I'm not sure there.

00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:38.820
We know what the
difference is in English.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.620
Basically, they came from
two different languages,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.786
and that's why we have them.

00:08:41.786 --> 00:08:44.590
But yeah, so now we have both
of these words in this language.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.170
So I'm like, all right,
all right, fine, whatever.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.320
Then we have "thaenis," which
was vessel, specifically,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.270
an aquatic vessel.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.390
So now we have a word for
"sailboat" and "vessel."

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.660
And "thenis,"
which is "captain."

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.516
Next, "boat," which is
different from "sailboat," which

00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:00.640
is different from "vessel."

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.740
That was "chaesich."

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.050
And we also have "chisich,"
"boathouse," which

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.500
is different from "marina."

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.134
And "chesich," "boater," which
is different from "sailor,"

00:09:08.134 --> 00:09:09.800
which is different
from "captain," which

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.060
is different from "mariner."

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.030
Then it goes even further.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.270
We have a very special root
that's just for clipper ships,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.440
"baelil."

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.766
Presumably, "belil"
is somebody who sails

00:09:22.766 --> 00:09:24.650
a clipper ship or something.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.470
But I think that the
reason that we even

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.730
have this word for clipper
ship is just because I

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.370
was a fan of the Clippers.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.940
And so why not?

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.110
I wonder, actually, if that
B-L-L root has something

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.430
to do with the Clippers.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.790
All I'm thinking
of is Bison Dele.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.330
Somebody remember him?

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.350
Anybody remember
his original name?

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.740
Because I literally don't.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.100
All right, anyway, moving on.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.540
Anyway, so there are a
bunch of other crazy things

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.740
about this language.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.630
For example, I had
taken Esperanto.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.926
So the case system for
this language was identical

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:55.550
to Esperanto's.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.820
The number suffixes.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.840
So looking at number systems
for natural languages

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.320
is a fascinating thing.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.080
But this language literally
had separate suffixes

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.450
for number words that were in
the tens, hundreds, thousands,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.720
hundred thousands, millions,
billions, trillions,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.370
up to the quadrillions.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.630
So that you could take
the root for 1 and make 1,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.010
10, 100, 1,000, 10,000,
so on, all the way up

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.829
to 1 quadrillion.

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:29.870
I don't think that there
are other languages that

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.740
do things like that.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.500
There is a special
word pattern just

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.560
for colors, which is weird.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.660
I kind of like it.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.520
The tenses were
identical to Esperanto's.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.478
It had this correlative
system that was, again,

00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:42.040
identical to Esperanto's.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.840
All of it was purely lifted.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.160
And in the beginning,
when I'd just started out,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.060
I actually started to translate
Shakespeare's "The Tempest"

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.730
into this language.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.370
And it just keeps going like
that, which sounds impressive

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.030
until you know how palely
derivative the language is.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.290
In fact, I get
this question a lot

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.880
about, oh, wow, how do you
create a full language that's

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.740
functional?

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.490
That's actually not hard.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.340
It's not hard to create a
language that is completely

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.620
and fully functional, can
do everything you want.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.790
It's fairly easy if
you're going to copy

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.990
a lot of things wholesale
from other languages

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.810
and just basically recode them.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.600
Then all it takes is the simple
matter of just coding it over.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.314
It's like if you're
talking about drawing

00:11:27.314 --> 00:11:29.730
a human, it's like, wow, it
must be tough to draw a human.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.840
It's not hard.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.150
There you go.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.880
It's a human.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.379
We all recognize it's
basically a human.

00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:37.920
I don't know.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.840
He's rubbing his belly while
he's pointing, I guess.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.959
But of course, what
you mean when you say,

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:45.375
oh, it's hard to
draw a human, you

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:48.314
mean it's hard to draw a
human that looks realistic.

00:11:48.314 --> 00:11:49.730
It's easy enough
to draw something

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.140
that's basically a human.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.490
Kids get it by the time
they're three or four.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.870
Same is true of a language.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.820
Easy to create a fully
functional language.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.680
Difficult to create
a language that

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.530
actually looks like
a real language

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.620
that we speak here on Earth.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.210
And so for me, the
real watershed moment

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.790
was when I found other
language creators online,

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.020
the early conlang community,
the conlang listserv.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.978
This is an early photo.

00:12:11.978 --> 00:12:13.600
And I'm sorry this
can't blow up more.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.060
It was taken with an old camera.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.790
From the first Language
Creation Conference in 2006,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.190
where a lot of language creators
met for the very first time

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.800
in person.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.840
Before that, it was
all online interaction.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.560
But basically, I found
this listserv in late 2000.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.206
I joined up.

00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:31.580
I started reading some messages,
people talking about all

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.410
these different languages.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.010
And I was like, what do you
mean Tolkien created languages?

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:35.759
The "Hobbit" guy?

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:36.550
I didn't know that.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.216
Didn't know that
Klingon was a language.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.700
I didn't know any of that.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.940
And so at first,
of course, which

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.970
is what naturally
happens when you

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.940
think you've been doing
something really great

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.650
and you see something
vastly different,

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.030
you think, well, they're just
doing it wrong, of course.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.120
I'm the one who's
really the cool person.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.620
And I thought that
at the beginning.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.360
But as I started to really
look at other people's work,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.920
and study their work, and
follow all these conversations,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.580
and see what was going
on, that was when I said,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.070
oh, I think I understand
what I've done here.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.414
And this literally
225-page dictionary

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:12.830
and reference grammar that
I've created for this language,

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.580
Megdevi, is total garbage.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.785
And so it was then
on that it was

00:13:17.785 --> 00:13:19.450
like that was my moment zero.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.480
I started over, and
I started learning.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.280
And that's basically what
I started in late 2000,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.940
and what I've continued
to do even now.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.140
And I think one of the
most important things that

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.430
happened to me when I
keyed in with the community

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.270
is I started to ask myself
questions that I had never

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.900
considered before, questions
that I'd never imagined before.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.360
So I'll give you an example.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.830
We have this word
"corner" here in English.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.600
And so presuming--
there's no tricks here--

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.480
that this box is just an empty
box, how many corners have we

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.432
got here?

00:13:54.432 --> 00:13:55.099
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:56.265
DAVID PETERSON: There we go.

00:13:56.265 --> 00:13:56.850
Eight.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.475
I know somebody said
four, but yeah, we

00:13:58.475 --> 00:14:00.350
have eight corners right there.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:04.960
It's slightly different if you
ask this question in Spanish.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.387
"Cuantos esquinas hay?"

00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:07.970
Anybody who speaks
Spanish is probably

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.678
going to know what
the answer to this is.

00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:11.980
"Esquinas" is essentially
a word for "corner."

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.030
And the answer to
this question is four.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.140
There are only
four esquinas alla.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.970
And they are those
on the outside.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.970
If you ask a different question,
"Cuantos rincones hay?"

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.860
Then you get a different answer.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.520
There are four, and they're
the interior corners.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.870
Because, in fact, there
are two different words

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.460
for that concept in Spanish.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.110
And if you think about it,
it's actually quite important.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.000
When somebody says
something like,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.790
oh, watch out for that
table, don't hit your hip

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.670
on the corner, you know
exactly what corner they mean.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.540
It's hard, and
frankly, it would be

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.580
really impressive to hit your
hip on the corner of a room.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.537
Like you'd have to
get it right in there.

00:14:54.537 --> 00:14:55.620
It'd be really impressive.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.130
It's like watching the little
DVD bouncing logo, right?

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.380
And you just keep watching it.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.171
It's like, god, it's
gonna hit that corner,

00:15:02.171 --> 00:15:03.550
it's gonna hit that corner.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.555
Oh, it just barely missed it.

00:15:05.555 --> 00:15:07.180
It's like, yeah,
that's an achievement.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.040
So anyway, that's just
something that, if you

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.340
don't know Spanish, you never
would have thought of before

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.050
if your language was English.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.920
Corners are corners.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.880
Well, it turns out they don't
necessarily need to be so.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.390
Another one, and this
is just phonologically,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.760
we have these two words,
"spit" and "pit" in English.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.340
They're actually different.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.080
And you can tell if you
put your hand right up

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.420
in front of your face.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:35.550
And focus on the P, and say
"spit," and now say "pit."

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.370
And if you'll notice
for the second one,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.080
there is quite more
of a burst of air

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.380
because, in fact, the
second one is aspirated.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.110
In English though, we don't
think of these Ps as different.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.690
Like the P in
"spit" is basically

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.119
the same as the P in
"pit" and whatever.

00:15:50.119 --> 00:15:51.910
Sound engineers know
they're different when

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.030
you have a handheld mic
in front of your face

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.650
because it's really annoying.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.250
But otherwise, we think of
them as basically the same.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.030
Whereas in other languages,
they can be quite different.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.766
So these are two words of
Hindi-- "tal" and then "thal."

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:08.390
And they're completely
different words.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.640
And you can see that they're
even spelled differently,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.240
"tal" and "thal."

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.345
The first one means "postpone."

00:16:14.345 --> 00:16:15.720
And then the second
one, I guess,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.790
refers to some sort of a
place where you can buy wood.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.731
I've gotten "wood shop," "lumber
yard," "lumber shop," something

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:22.230
like that.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.220
I hope it's actually
still a word of Hindi.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.466
If there isn't, somebody
can leave a nasty note

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:28.590
in the comments-- that's
not a word we use anymore.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.131
It means something
totally different.

00:16:30.131 --> 00:16:32.110
But anyway, it
illustrates the basic idea

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.970
that this aspiration, which is
just a background note of how

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.310
you properly speak
English, is functional

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.390
in a different language
like Hindi and very,

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.030
very important in order to
make yourself understood.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.199
In fact, even this
past Monday, I'm

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:50.490
constantly learning new things.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.640
This was an example
that somebody

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.390
from the conlang
community, William Annis,

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.870
found and showed me.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.830
This is Amharic.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.940
And it's an absolutely
fascinating little facet

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.744
that I never would have
even imagined as possible.

00:17:03.744 --> 00:17:06.160
These are two sentences. "The
judge judged against Aster,"

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.430
and then "The judge
judged in Aster's favor."

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.180
They're basically opposites.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.359
And what's happening is the verb
is at the end of the sentence.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:16.380
And I want you to look
at these parts of it.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.920
Essentially, the
verb is agreeing

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.240
with the little preposition that
means against somebody's favor

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.130
or in favor of somebody,
which is just wild.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.550
I've heard of applicatives,
but usually, that

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.009
involves some sort of
switch up of the arguments

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.800
and changing the
structures and everything.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.570
This looks just like agreement
with a really weird thing

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.330
to agree with.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.990
And that's just awesome.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.640
Oh!

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.340
It just gets me
up in the morning.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.370
Anyway, so being a part
of the conlang community,

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:47.430
this is what I gained.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.740
You gain, essentially, an
understanding of the ways

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.880
that languages
can and do differ.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.470
And then once you have
that, you get to a point

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.850
where you realize,
basically, all right,

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.180
languages can do
pretty much anything.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.340
So then when you sit down
to create a language,

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.650
you really are
saying, what is it

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.010
that I want to do
with this language?

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.300
I have all of the
options before me.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.550
And now what am I
going to do with it?

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.020
And so for example, if
you ask me right now,

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.100
just a quick example,
what the word for "corner"

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.770
is in Dothraki, it's "kemikhof."

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.740
And there actually
isn't a distinction

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.400
between an interior and exterior
corner, but not by accident.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.390
It's because I wanted
it to be that way.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.020
And in fact, it has to do
with the unique etymology

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.950
of the word.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.750
It ultimately comes from a word
"kem," which means "conjoined."

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.110
And so how the
word came to be is

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.070
that it's talking about
the meeting of two walls

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.320
or the meeting of two things.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.840
And so that's what
it's focusing on,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.440
not the interactional
properties of the human,

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.750
but actually what it
is and what it's doing.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.770
And so that's why
there's only one

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.760
word for "corner" in Dothraki.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.460
It was something I did on
purpose, not by accident.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.320
So now that I'm here,
I wanted to give you

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.820
an in-depth example of
the type of questioning

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.152
I do when it comes to
translation and things

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:12.860
that I work with.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.250
So this is a script page from
the first season of "Defiance,"

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.740
where this entire exchange
is in the Irathient language.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.170
And we're going to focus on
this first sentence, which

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:28.320
is an elder Irathient is saying,
"It's how the Castis killed us

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.720
in the Great Diaspora.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.610
Caves filled with chlorine gas."

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.950
So I got that, and I
think, well, of course,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.382
I don't have a word
for "chlorine gas."

00:19:37.382 --> 00:19:38.840
So what am I going
to do with that?

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.300
How am I going to
translate that?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.235
To catch you up to speed, for
those who are not familiar

00:19:43.235 --> 00:19:45.360
with "Defiance," I'm going
to need to introduce you

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.080
to some aliens.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.860
First, there are the Irathients.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.770
They look like this.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.450
They have orange hair like that.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:56.480
Their planet was previously,
before the show started,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.070
conquered by the Castithans.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.820
And basically, at some
time in the distant past,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.820
it was like the Norman conquest.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.566
They came.

00:20:06.566 --> 00:20:07.190
They took over.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.140
They became the
rulers for a while.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.890
Now, they're on more
or less even footing,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.600
but there's still some
tensions due to the history.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.480
And then a third set of
aliens are the Indogenes.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.340
The Indogenes are responsible
for pretty much all

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.090
of the technology that
the rest of the aliens--

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.640
called, collectively,
the Votans-- enjoy.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.910
So they created all
of the spaceships,

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.110
all of the nanotechnology,
everything.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.460
And they are, themselves,
an interesting creation.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.650
They modify themselves
genetically.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.310
They have implants
all over the place.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.660
Their eyes can act
like microscopes.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.220
Their hands can do really
fantastic little machinations.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.260
So for example,
with their language,

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.360
their writing system is
actually a post-hoc creation.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.910
Every single glyph
in the language,

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.870
whether it's for a number
or a syllable or whatever,

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.420
has these little
conjoined double hexagons.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.140
This is nothing that would
ever arise in a natural context

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.220
because it's way too complex
to draw with your hand

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.350
and get it right.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.880
But Indogenes can do it exactly
right every single time because

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.450
of their augmentations.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.450
And so they actually
created this writing system

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.752
for themselves after
the point in time

00:21:17.752 --> 00:21:19.460
where they started
augmenting themselves.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.870
Anyway, so this is
their number system.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.140
Their number system is base 7.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:28.010
And you'll see why it's base
7 if you see how the number

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.900
system works there.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.290
So you can see the
little tick mark

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.570
going do do do as
we go from azu,

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.170
kizu, fozu, dezu, nuzu, hazu.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.970
And then that's
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.410
And then ama, you switch
the suffix, and you get 7.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:50.000
So basically, their 7 is the
equivalent to our 10, like 1-0.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.860
So I started with
them when I need

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.760
to come up with words
for the elements--

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.800
the periodic table of elements.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.730
I reasoned that they would
be the ones to kind of codify

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.080
and then really
make use of this,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.030
and they actually
invented a system

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:09.850
for referring to the
periodic elements.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.400
They did it by protons.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.250
So chlorine has 17 protons.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.650
17 in base 7 is 23.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.770
What that means is that the
digit 2 followed by the digit 3

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.470
equals 17 in base 7.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.970
Then the word for
17, 23 in base 7.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.580
You have kima which
is basically 20.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.970
Remember, that's the number
2 with the ma suffix,

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.760
and now you see the
2 lines and then also

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.270
the straight line up
and down in the middle.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.660
That's 20, and then 3
of course we know, fozu.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.300
So 23, or 17, is kimafozu.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.940
They also have a suffix, vun.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.030
This was an older suffix.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.363
Basically the word vun used
to mean just something like,

00:22:51.363 --> 00:22:52.710
stuff way back when.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.870
Now it's a suffix
you can add to things

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.900
to make a kind of
nominal compound,

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.090
and specifically they
add it to numbers

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.990
to create a word that
means "that element."

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:08.400
So when you add vun to
17 you get chlorine.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.710
Kimafozuvun.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.477
Kimafozuvun.

00:23:10.477 --> 00:23:11.810
Yeah, sorry, I can say it right.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.190
And of course you can
spell it like that

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.260
with the numbers
in front, or you

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.310
can spell it all the way out.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.431
It's basically the equivalent
of this in English.

00:23:17.431 --> 00:23:18.930
You know spelling
twelfth like that.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.255
God I love it.

00:23:20.255 --> 00:23:20.880
Oh, it stopped.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.480
All right.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.160
Anyway, so twelfth,
12, all right.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.150
So we've created this
word now in Indogene,

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.120
or the Indogene language
which is called Indojisnen.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.600
Next step is to borrow
that into Castithan.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.010
And the reason is that
Castithan is essentially

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.210
the language of commerce,
politics, everything.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.870
It's the English
of the Votan world.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.440
So they borrowed all of
their scientific terminology

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.840
from Indogene, or Indojisnen.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.490
So that gets borrowed in, and
it gets borrowed in pretty well.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.250
So it's kimafozuvun
in Indojisnen and then

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:58.300
in Castithan it's kimafozuvuno.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.690
You have to add the O suffix
on there to make it functional.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.990
Then you have this
word in Castithan.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.450
By the way there are some
quirks-- little aside

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.330
with this spelling because
Castithan spelling is kind of

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.940
slightly more
difficult than English,

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.770
but slightly less
difficult than Tibetan.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.080
Tibetan I think is
the most difficult

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.730
that we've created
on the planet.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.600
So just some notes.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.530
Like for example, you could
write ki this way, or this way.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.446
The reason is that there
are 2 different types

00:24:23.446 --> 00:24:25.320
of K's in the history.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.520
-So you have this older word,
which had a long vowel "li-ku,"

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.470
which is now pronounced ligo,
and it refers to some sort

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.290
of small animal.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.529
That's using, essentially,
the traditional K.

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:36.820
And you'll see that the
traditional K is now pronounced

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.030
G in certain circumstances.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:44.220
However, the old ejective K
which is here for the word

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.400
"ni-k'u" which is now
pronounced "nico," and it means,

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.900
kind of, lot or parcel.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.520
That one is always
pronounced K no matter

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.650
where it is in the word.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.230
So when they do borrowings they
tend to use that special K,

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:00.380
just to make sure that everybody
knows it's always pronounced K.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.670
Same thing kind of here.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.120
These are both
pronounced the same

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.030
but the one with the
longer vowel-- or that

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.490
used to be the longer vowel--
is always going to be pronounced

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.990
ma.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.130
So we use that, just to be safe.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.850
And same, the first
Z also changes

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.150
in certain circumstances.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.230
The second Z does not.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.410
So you use the second Z
when spelling things out.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.090
That gets us kima and zu.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.640
This one has a slightly
different explanation.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.710
So these are the
non-sibilant fricatives

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.120
that have a different story.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.430
F is pronounced F at the
beginning of the word.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.980
It tends to be pronounced to
V in the middle of the word.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.669
So for example we
have this word that

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:36.960
used to be pronounced that way.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.330
It's pronounced fozwo, ritual.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.121
It's a nice F at the
beginning of the word.

00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:42.359
In between you had this
older word, hiifau,

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:43.400
which is pronounced hivo.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.380
It's that word for shirt.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.505
It's pronounced like a V
in the middle of the word.

00:25:46.505 --> 00:25:49.404
But since there are
no other fantastic

00:25:49.404 --> 00:25:51.320
ways of representing the
A, it's kind of known

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.855
that you have to swap out
for the sibilant fricative

00:25:55.855 --> 00:25:57.480
since there's two
versions of each one.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.670
There's 2 Z's and 2 S's.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.320
There aren't 2 F's.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.280
So you just use the regular
F in a borrowed word

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.320
and you know that rather
than being pronounced V

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.780
it's pronounced F
because it's a borrowing.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.200
The same is true of the original
V, which is often pronounced H

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.310
in between vowels.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.476
You know it's pronounced V
because it's a borrowing.

00:26:14.476 --> 00:26:17.440
So that's how you get the
spelling of kimafozuvuno

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.360
in Castithan.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.290
The reason we had
create it in Castithan

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.040
is because a lot of the
borrowings in a Irathient

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.650
that have to do with
technology come from Castithan.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.900
Usually via Indojisnen,
but Castithan

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.000
is where they got a lot of
terminology because of the time

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.570
when Castithans were essentially
in charge of everything.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.800
So that gets borrowed
into Irathient this way,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.610
and it's now kimafozvun.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.610
Notice that we lost a U there.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.070
That's because they're used
to having to remove vowels

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:50.560
in between sibilants and
secondary consonants,

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.070
moving from Castithan to
Irathient because that just

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.610
happens a lot with
Castithan words.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:59.750
So they saw this one and
said, well there probably

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.489
isn't a real U there.

00:27:01.489 --> 00:27:03.030
Even though there
was a real U there,

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.738
they thought there
wasn't a real U there.

00:27:04.738 --> 00:27:07.810
It's the same kind of thing
that happened with-- what's

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.210
a good example from English?

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.570
Like, nuncle.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.100
I think it was
originally nuncle,

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.150
but now we call it
uncle because we

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.820
thought people were saying
"an uncle" as opposed to,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.709
"a nuncle".

00:27:20.709 --> 00:27:21.250
Really weird.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.115
Anyway, so at it's
that type of a thing.

00:27:23.115 --> 00:27:24.490
Now as for the
word itself-- this

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.710
is just another
kind of a fun aside.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.910
Irathient has a
series of noun classes

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.830
that are indicated by
the initial consonant.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:36.150
And it just so happens that
since this word begins with a K

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.190
it falls into the
dangerous animal class.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.870
So klaidi is a dangerous insect.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.940
Kombisi is a kind of a
tentacle beast comes from above

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.490
and sucks you up.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:56.170
Then kangezi Is a word for like
the alpha of a pack of animals.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:00.650
So for that reason they treated
this like this was the root.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.360
That the root was actually
imafozvun and that

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.330
the K was incidental, and
indicative of a class 4

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.130
membership.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.900
Which means that they created
this word, rimafozvun,

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.000
which means chlorine the
element, or the substance.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.360
Then kimafozvun, which is
now the dangerous animal

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.130
and has the concept
of danger in it,

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.860
is used specifically
for chlorine gas, which

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.100
is what the Castithan's used to
kill them back in the old days.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.700
And that is basically the story
for translating just that word,

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.542
in that sentence, in that
scene, in that episode,

00:28:35.542 --> 00:28:36.500
in the show "Defiance."

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:42.510
So that's kind of the process I
go through when I create words,

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.790
and basically it's all
thanks to the education

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.910
that I had coming up through
the conlang community.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.770
I know to ask questions that
I never knew to ask before.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:55.760
And so one of the
things that I realized

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.360
when we had this great
shift in the internet

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.610
and how we interacted with it.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.660
I don't know if it
was 2009, 2010, 2011,

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.940
but it was that time
where suddenly nobody

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.190
was using hand-coded
HTML anymore

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.450
for their own personal websites.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:17.280
People kind of were going away
from listservs and bulletin

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.030
boards even, and
instead were interacting

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.400
through micro-blogging
platforms,

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.320
blogging platforms,
social media platforms.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.020
I started to see a lot of
conlangers coming to the art,

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.810
especially with a lot of popular
media like "Avatar," and "Game

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.140
of Thrones," who knew those
shows but didn't know anything

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.130
about the old
conlanging community,

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.010
and who definitely
at this point in time

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.120
were not going to
join an email based

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.920
listserv where they communicate
with people via email.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.570
Like, it's not even a part
of our vocabulary anymore.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.435
And so, the thing was though,
I felt like the education

00:29:53.435 --> 00:29:58.210
that I had, which I thought
was fantastic, was being lost,

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.600
and is essentially
irrecoverable.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.930
Even though like you can
search all of the archives

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.138
on the conlang listserv--
they're publicly available,

00:30:04.138 --> 00:30:06.677
there's great stuff there,
nobody's going to look at it,

00:30:06.677 --> 00:30:08.260
nobody's going to
pull it up, nobody's

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.700
going to go through
and read old emails.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.890
It's not going to happen.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.300
And so that was
one of the things

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.431
I hope to do with this
book, "The Art of Language

00:30:14.431 --> 00:30:14.930
Invention."

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.820
I'm kind of trying to rescue
some of that knowledge

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.440
and put it somewhere.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.410
Oddly enough into old
media, hardcover, book form

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.204
because I think people that are
conlangers that are primarily

00:30:26.204 --> 00:30:27.620
on Twitter and
Tumblr are actually

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.203
more likely to get
this book than they

00:30:29.203 --> 00:30:31.680
are to actually pull up the
old archives of an email list,

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.990
or join it.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.302
Which is a really weird
thing-- weird reality

00:30:36.302 --> 00:30:38.010
we live in but it's
kind of where we are.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:43.030
So that was kind of my
fondest hope and purpose

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.940
for this book is to kind
of capture that put it

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.660
somewhere so that other
people could benefit by it.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.610
And so it's not
even like my stuff.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.140
It's the stuff that I
learned and basically

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.420
just put into this capsule.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.050
So anyway, that's the
story behind this book.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.510
Thank you guys so much for
your time and listening,

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:06.200
and if you get it,
I hope you enjoy it.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:14.270
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thank you for coming.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.700
There's this old chestnut
about cellar door being

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.720
the most beautiful phrase from a
phonetic standpoint in English.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.260
Since the people who are
hearing your languages

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.640
aren't native speakers,
how does the sound

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.849
of the languages you create
play into their creation?

00:31:27.849 --> 00:31:29.931
DAVID PETERSON: Of course
that's always the thing.

00:31:29.931 --> 00:31:32.770
That was Tolkien that said that
most beautiful word was cellar

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.960
door, and of course he didn't
mean cellar door, he meant,

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.530
cellar door.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.395
Which is how he would
have pronounced it.

00:31:39.395 --> 00:31:41.020
So that was the thing
that was supposed

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.186
to be most beautiful to him.

00:31:42.186 --> 00:31:46.400
Because for us cellar door
just sounds, I don't know.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.480
And even so of course, that
thing is entirely subjective,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.850
but you can tell
though, if somebody

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:54.840
thought cellar door
was really beautiful.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.700
You can see how that really
informed Tolkien's languages.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.040
When I'm creating languages,
especially for shows,

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.614
I know that the
bulk of the audience

00:32:04.614 --> 00:32:06.280
is probably going to
be English speakers

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.780
and because of that
I know that they

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.520
have kind of the history
of cultural stereotyping

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.990
that exists for
English speakers.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.331
That is, we have kind
of a predictable range

00:32:16.331 --> 00:32:18.580
of which languages we think
are going to be beautiful,

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.340
and which languages we
think are going to be harsh.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.660
So you can play with those.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.660
So that if a producer
wants a language that

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.430
sounds harsh or
guttural, you know

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.930
what that means and
you can produce it,

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.300
but it's not actually
true that any language

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.070
is beautiful or ugly.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:39.010
It's totally just basically
cultural stereotyping,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:43.730
and just random resemblances
between a language you speak

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.070
and the languages you
think are beautiful.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:51.690
So yeah, it's an unfortunate
byproduct of our existence,

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:56.820
but I can still use it to
my advantage if I have to.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.600
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
you created your first language

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.240
while you were studying
at UC Berkeley.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.810
I was wondering how much formal
linguistics education you have,

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:09.024
and how that has helped or not
helped your language creating.

00:33:09.024 --> 00:33:10.440
DAVID PETERSON: I
actually started

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.010
creating my first
language at the same time

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:17.170
that I started studying
linguistics, or I think I did.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:21.750
I told a very-- I told a
very strange story in a lot

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.740
of interviews that when I'm--
I'm actually giving a talk

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.130
later at UC Berkeley and I
went back to my old notes

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.820
to photocopy some of them for--
this is for the linguistics

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.882
club-- to show at
that presentation.

00:33:31.882 --> 00:33:33.590
And going through my
old notes I actually

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.920
discovered what I had
been saying in interviews

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.830
was factually incorrect.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.040
So I thought that I created my
first language in the spring

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.260
semester of 2000 when
I was a freshman,

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:51.960
and when I was taking Arabic,
and Esperanto, and Russian,

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.550
and Linguistics 5.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:56.750
It turns out I wasn't taking
those classes at that time.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.230
I did take Arabic
and Esperanto, but I

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.880
took Russian and linguistics
the next semester

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.160
in the fall of 2000.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.446
So I took Russian
and linguistics.

00:34:06.446 --> 00:34:08.070
I had previously
taken a year of Arabic

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.800
and a semester of
Esperanto, and I

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.570
started creating my first
language at the exact same time

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.070
that I was taking my very first
introduction to linguistics,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.445
which I had never
heard of before

00:34:17.445 --> 00:34:20.110
and I only took because it
was a breadth requirement.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.888
But I think it was
like 2 or 3 weeks

00:34:22.888 --> 00:34:25.179
in-- I actually have the date
if I go back to my notes,

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:25.590
but I forget.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.210
Anyway.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.690
So I kind of started growing
as a language creator

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.550
as I was learning linguistics.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.290
Oh, but I eventually did finish
out with a linguistics major,

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.650
and I also got my master's
degree in linguistics

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:38.960
at UC San Diego.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.060
Definitely the study did
inform a lot of what I did

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.989
but at the same time
it was helpful to have

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.394
the background of
a language creator

00:34:48.394 --> 00:34:52.360
so that I could know to, kind
of interpret what I was learning

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.230
in linguistics with more of an
artistic and also critical eye.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.940
Especially a lot of
the theoretical stuff.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.630
Like theoretical
syntax has not really

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.230
informed what I'm
doing at all, but a lot

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.520
of what I studied in
morphology, especially

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.585
like lexical morphology,
[? word and ?] paradigm

00:35:11.585 --> 00:35:13.210
morphology, and a
lot of what I studied

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.910
in historical linguistics has
informed what I do enormously,

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.770
enormously, and definitely
phonology to, and typology,

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.134
typology is huge.

00:35:22.134 --> 00:35:23.550
There was a lot
of back and forth.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:27.930
But anyway, a lot of it came
in and definitely linguistics

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.750
was an important part of my
education as a conlanger.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.930
But I would say equally
important, if not

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:38.140
more important, was my education
from other language creators.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.630
AUDIENCE: I was interested
in birth of language.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.870
Have you investigated that?

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.500
DAVID PETERSON: What,
like language at all?

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah like,
6,000 years ago.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:50.300
What shreds we know, you know?

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.580
DAVID PETERSON: I think
we do know some stuff

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.750
about 6,000 years ago.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.780
But you know essentially--

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.260
AUDIENCE: Hard consonants
and like how it directly

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.771
translates to an object.

00:36:02.771 --> 00:36:03.810
You know phonemes.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.780
DAVID PETERSON: I
don't really buy that.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.170
I don't think that like the
earliest, earliest, earliest

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.180
forms of languages--
they were necessarily

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.180
like such great sound
symbolism like that.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.820
There is sound symbolism that
exists throughout the world's

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.430
languages so often.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:21.550
If you have vowel where
your mouth is closed,

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.770
like E, it's often
associated with small things,

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.730
and if your mouth is
wide open, ah, it's often

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.850
associated with large things.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.590
But beyond that
there's not a lot

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.970
that isn't language specific.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:41.560
So if you think about English
we have words like glean, glint,

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.486
glisten, glitter, glow.

00:36:44.486 --> 00:36:46.110
You could probably
come up with others.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:46.880
There are others.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.200
And you'll notice those
all kind of have something

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.480
to do with shininess, right?

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.020
But there's nothing--
I mean that's

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.720
an English specific thing only.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.360
It has nothing to do with any
other language on the planet.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:04.020
There's nothing about Gla--
Glee, it means Glee-- no,

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.040
there's nothing about
Gla that tells you,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.920
oh this has to do
with shininess.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.060
It's just a bizarre cultural,
historical artifact of English.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.530
Now having said
that, of course I

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.720
study the history
of languages a lot.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.540
I don't think that
we're at a point,

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.120
and I doubt we'll ever be at
the point, where we can say this

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.120
is where language was created.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.317
This is how it came to be.

00:37:24.317 --> 00:37:26.150
I don't think we're
ever going to get there.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.490
Honestly, we're pressing it
when we go back to things

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.560
like Proto-Indo-European.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.530
There's a lot we know but
then there's so much we don't.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.890
There are definitely
people out there

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.690
who have looked into doing this.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.930
Like Joseph Greenberg who's
a famous, famous linguist

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.980
and made some
brilliant typological

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.200
discoveries was a big
believer in proto world.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.910
That you could actually find
the commonalities between all

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:51.780
the languages on the planet.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.580
I would say most linguists
don't accept that,

00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.124
wouldn't even except some
of the less grandiose claims

00:38:00.124 --> 00:38:02.040
like there were 10
original language families,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.320
which I've also heard.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.880
I'd say most don't accept that.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.230
Most know that the further
back in history you

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:11.310
go the less and less certain
we can be about what we're

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.124
saying about these languages.

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:15.040
Though, but hey, from
here on out everything's

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.780
going to be recorded.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.170
So that's nice.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.530
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.630
Really interesting.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.330
I'm curious, do you have
any particular features

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.810
of your languages, or
of languages in general,

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.690
that you feel are really
interesting, that you

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.140
feel really enamored with?

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.440
Like you mentioned
in the example

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.160
that you gave you
have noun classes,

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.690
you had spelling
variations, you had

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:44.010
this very systematic writing
system-- reminds me of Hangul,

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:44.950
for instance.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.820
Is there anything that you
feel that you notice yourself

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.120
saying, like I can't put
this in another language

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.270
again, because I
do it all the time.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.802
DAVID PETERSON: Yeah, well
definitely noun classes

00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:59.260
are one of my most
favorite things.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.155
It's so easy to create
words, and to create

00:39:01.155 --> 00:39:02.780
really interesting
words that you never

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.696
would have thought of
if you had noun classes.

00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:07.120
I love them to death.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.600
But I've only ever-- the one
I did for Irathient, that

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.060
was like my second big one and
I haven't done that precisely

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.010
again, but I could
just do that all day.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.390
Love noun classes.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.780
Noun case is another
one I'm fond of,

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.150
but that you can get away what.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:27.250
I mean, most languages have
noun case in some form.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.970
But yeah, case systems
are loads of fun.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:34.340
I think where I get into
trouble is not something

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.540
that I love but something
that's a weak point of me.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.340
I just hate verbs.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.290
It's so easy, it's so easy
to do a verb system that's

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.880
basically perfect imperfect.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.730
Lots of languages
either are that way,

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.580
or started out that way.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.740
Where there's just basically
a binary distinction

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.240
of perfect and imperfect,
so done and not done,

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.740
and it's so easy
to just do that.

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:03.080
Say, all right we're done,
but I kind of do it too much.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.780
I know I shouldn't, but
verbs are just so complex.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:13.300
They change by the decade
precisely how they're used.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.980
Just watch a football
game and the guy

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:23.220
says during the replay--
it's like he'll say,

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.180
if he doesn't pick up
that block right there,

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.990
he doesn't run to the end zone.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:30.070
That's all present tense
but that's not actually

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:30.955
the present tense.

00:40:30.955 --> 00:40:32.580
I mean it's the
present tense, but it's

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.641
some sort of weird, bizarre,
hypothetical, counter-factual

00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:36.140
tense.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.540
We just use the present tense
for it in a sports context

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.490
only.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.580
Right?

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.860
That happens, that's
real verbs right there,

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.410
and it just pisses
me straight off.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.952
That's what it's the worst part
of learning any new language.

00:40:50.952 --> 00:40:53.034
I don't care how simple a
language will tell you--

00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:55.350
it's like, oh you have
these agreement patterns.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.120
We don't have that in Chinese.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.504
Yeah, I don't care.

00:40:58.504 --> 00:40:59.920
I'm not learning
that verb system.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.750
It's incredibly complex.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.720
Just because the words
themselves don't change,

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.303
doesn't mean the
system isn't complex.

00:41:05.303 --> 00:41:08.050
It probably means
it's more complex.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.300
Verbs!

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.360
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
what's your favorite word?

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.660
What language is it in?

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.180
What does it mean, and
what was the context

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.474
that you like it used in?

00:41:18.474 --> 00:41:19.640
Do you have a favorite word?

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.598
DAVID PETERSON: A favorite
word that I created?

00:41:21.598 --> 00:41:23.552
AUDIENCE: Yeah, more likely.

00:41:23.552 --> 00:41:24.510
You could tell us both.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.093
The ones you like
that others created,

00:41:26.093 --> 00:41:28.190
but I'm kind of
curious about yours.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.370
DAVID PETERSON: I don't know.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.300
I actually-- it's funny,
I get this question a lot

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.574
and I never have a very good
answer, and I'll tell you why.

00:41:36.574 --> 00:41:37.990
The words that I
remember the most

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:39.364
are the ones that
I use the most,

00:41:39.364 --> 00:41:41.210
and they tend to be
very prosaic words.

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:49.060
Like the word for "need
to" in Dothraki, zigerelat.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.970
I know that one but it's there's
nothing very great about it.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.790
I just use it all the time.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:58.460
And actually I was just
talking about this.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.220
There's a particular
reason I think

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.990
that I don't remember
a lot of the really

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.060
fancy, interesting words.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.870
Like I'll give you
an example of one

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:08.860
that I know because
I used it recently.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.470
[? "Hej" ?] is the word
for "sticky" in Dothraki,

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:17.450
and [? "hejov" ?] is a word
for a situation that is more

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:21.370
trouble than it's worth and so
you'll likely want to avoid it.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:25.050
I thought that was a pretty good
word but I've never used it,

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:27.230
and the reason is
that-- especially

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:31.220
for these shows, the words--
I'm acting as a translator.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.210
I get English
scripts and then have

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:37.210
to translate what's given
to me, and so the words

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.670
that I end up
using are the words

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:39.780
that the writers
come up with and they

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.330
don't think of these really
fantastic and interesting words

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.030
that exist in these languages.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.320
Where perhaps if there
were native speakers,

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.731
they would find uses for them.

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:49.480
They would have different
patterns of use,

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.840
but instead we're working
with English patterns

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.900
of usage and words that the
English speakers come up with.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.420
So consequently since my
most common interaction

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:04.660
with my own languages
is when I translate,

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.890
those words are the
ones I know the most.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.440
So there are scores of
words that I have completely

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.090
forgotten about, and I
usually only run across them

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.170
when I'm looking for some
word in my dictionary

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.420
and it happens to be right
next to another word that's

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.840
really cool, I'm
like, oh my god, I

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.965
forgot I created that word!

00:43:18.965 --> 00:43:20.140
It's so cool!

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.630
Now, here's the word for
belt. I go on from there.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.830
I do have a least
favorite word in English.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:29.810
Crafts.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.510
That's the most hideous
word I've ever heard.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.852
Just awful.

00:43:33.852 --> 00:43:37.250
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
word aversion for that?

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.620
DAVID PETERSON:
First of all, crafts.

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.470
It's f-t-s right in a row.

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:45.850
That's barbaric.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:53.030
And it just-- makes me think
of the term arts and crafts.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.595
It's just weirds me out.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:58.930
There was a-- who has the mic?

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.800
Over there.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.780
AUDIENCE: You'd
mentioned complexity

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.930
in one of the
previous questions.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:09.029
Are there-- in the
conlang community

00:44:09.029 --> 00:44:10.570
are there any measures
of complexity,

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:13.407
or precision, or granularity
for different languages?

00:44:13.407 --> 00:44:15.240
DAVID PETERSON: Yes,
but they're not applied

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.280
to artistic languages usually.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.140
As languages created
for the purpose of art.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.570
Usually where you see
things like that discussed

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.340
are creation of
auxiliary languages.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.069
So, languages like Esperanto
that are built either

00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:29.110
for international
communication, or communication

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:30.160
within a group.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.030
They try to measure things
much more objectively so they

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:36.700
can say which one is better.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.640
We tend not to do that
in the artistic language

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.610
community for the same reason
that you don't typically

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.490
go to paintings and say
which one is better,

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:47.115
and then come up with
objective reasons

00:44:47.115 --> 00:44:50.380
for why one painting
is better than another.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.390
There are certain
measures that exist

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:57.740
within linguistics, such as
the minimum word dependency.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.700
I'm going to get this wrong.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.889
Minimal length
dependency, I think it is.

00:45:01.889 --> 00:45:04.180
There's a paper that just
came out of this-- a kid just

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.840
came out of MIT on this.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.700
Where if you subscribe to
the theory of morphemes,

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.610
which I don't, but if you
do, you can chop up a word

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:16.590
and see how many of them there
are and come up with number

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.160
that tells you
something or other.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.720
But I haven't used
it myself, and I

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.140
don't think it
enjoys a lot of use

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.450
within the artistic
language community,

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.800
but definitely within the
oxlang and perhaps englang

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.050
community, englang being
engineering languages

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.659
that don't necessarily
need to be natural.

00:45:32.659 --> 00:45:34.200
AUDIENCE: As somebody
who had studied

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.890
a lot of languages and
studies a lot of linguists,

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:42.280
I'm sure you're aware that
there's some languages that

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.950
are-- although they have
their own vocabulary,

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:49.410
but structurally in
terms of lexemes,

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:50.660
they're very close to English.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.780
You basically can do a
word for word translation

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.260
and maybe change the
word order a little bit.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:01.050
There are other languages
where in that culture,

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.292
in that language, you just
express an idea structurally

00:46:05.292 --> 00:46:06.250
completely differently.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:12.990
You can't really say in
translating one sentence

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.050
to another that this
word corresponds to this,

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:16.280
and that to that.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.280
When you do these construction
languages for TV and movies

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.510
that you know you're going to
be translating English scripts,

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:30.240
does that tend to make
you create languages

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.570
that are structurally
closer to English

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:35.700
so your translation
job will be easier?

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.240
DAVID PETERSON: No, not a bit.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.430
No.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.620
Not at all.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.319
But of course, just a
comment, the languages

00:46:43.319 --> 00:46:45.860
that are going to be closer to
English structurally are going

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.780
to be those that are
related English genetically,

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.280
like in the Germanic
languages, but even so, there's

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.674
a general tenant
that we pretty much

00:46:54.674 --> 00:46:56.840
believe to be true that you
could translate anything

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.620
into anything.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.550
When it comes to--

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.800
AUDIENCE: I'm not
saying that's not true.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.720
DAVID PETERSON: But yeah,
like the word for word.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.240
AUDIENCE: You know what
you're going to be doing

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.869
and to make it
easier for yourself.

00:47:08.869 --> 00:47:10.410
DAVID PETERSON:
Yeah, no, not at all.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:10.910
No.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:14.070
Because that would be boring.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.120
The reason I do this is I
love creating languages.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:17.922
That's my fun.

00:47:17.922 --> 00:47:19.880
I mean the closest thing
I've gotten to English

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.567
is actually Old
Trigedasleng in "The 100"

00:47:22.567 --> 00:47:24.525
but that's because it's
actually supposed to be

00:47:24.525 --> 00:47:25.780
an evolved form of English.

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.860
English 100 years later.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.615
So it's like it's
really-- but there it's

00:47:28.615 --> 00:47:30.990
supposed to be like English
because it's kind of supposed

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.550
to be English, right.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:34.450
But other than that, no.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.200
Honestly, the languages
couldn't be more different.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:42.410
They range from marginally,
somewhat, kind of close,

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:47.780
to totally,
unrecognizably, out there.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.610
That's how I have my fun.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:53.120
AUDIENCE: So every year we
lose dozens, maybe hundreds,

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.030
of human languages
to extinction,

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.530
and we lose the cultural
payload with them.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:02.340
How do you feel about the ethics
of conlangs going into-- people

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.259
running around geeking
out on Klingon when

00:48:04.259 --> 00:48:06.300
we're losing real human
languages that they could

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.240
be learning.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:11.740
And why do you not consider
using obscure human languages

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.360
for some of these shows?

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.800
Bring them back a little bit.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.740
Give them a new life.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.720
Make people aware
of them, rather than

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.070
artificial languages.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:21.611
DAVID PETERSON: Let
me ask you this--

00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:23.740
how do you feel about
people getting really,

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.910
really excited about novels
like "The Hunger Games," which

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.840
are stories about
fake people, when

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.110
we're losing the stories
of real people every day

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:32.620
that are dying?

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:37.200
AUDIENCE: Honestly, I think
that's sort of false analogy.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.335
We have-- and I admit I come
from a very specific basis

00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:42.280
on this.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.930
But I guess I would
say, how do you

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.890
feel about ISIS
destroying antiquities

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.410
when we could make new stuff?

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:47.930
DAVID PETERSON: I'm
sorry say the last part?

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.825
AUDIENCE: How do you feel about
ISIS destroying antiquities

00:48:49.825 --> 00:48:51.610
when you could make new stuff?

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.820
That's equivalent to yours.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.140
Is it-- and I'm not saying
what you're doing is wrong--

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:56.910
DAVID PETERSON:
You're saying that I'm

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.990
destroying natural
languages in order produce--

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.531
AUDIENCE: I'm not saying you're
destroying natural languages.

00:49:01.531 --> 00:49:04.800
I'm saying, could we not
use some of the energies

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.820
that people go into learning
conlanguages, geeking out

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.365
about con languages, going
to Klingon conventions.

00:49:10.365 --> 00:49:13.430
I'll tell you I got very annoyed
when I see-- I saw even here

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.012
at Google recently,
people talking

00:49:15.012 --> 00:49:16.470
about looking for
Klingon resources

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.780
to do something in Klingon,
and it's like great,

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.550
but let's put that effort
to saving a real language

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.300
because when we lose
those languages, when

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.890
the last speaker dies,
it's never coming back

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:26.990
as a living language.

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.780
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah
so, of course--

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.390
and in fact if
they weren't going

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.970
to be doing Klingon they would
be doing the other thing,

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.278
right?

00:49:35.278 --> 00:49:36.490
AUDIENCE: That's how it ends.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:37.570
MALE SPEAKER: No, of course not.

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:37.820
So let's stop--

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.700
AUDIENCE: You could use
real human languages

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:39.970
for some of these--

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:40.840
DAVID PETERSON: You
certainly could.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:41.340
Yeah.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.220
We could have found
a-- for example,

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:46.910
we could have found some
very rarely spoken language

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:49.530
and given it to the
barbaric, Dothraki who are

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.280
ripping people's tongues out.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.932
How would that have been?

00:49:52.932 --> 00:49:54.890
AUDIENCE: I wasn't
necessarily saying Dothraki.

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:55.681
DAVID PETERSON: OK.

00:49:55.681 --> 00:49:58.672
OK, but that's actually
the issue that comes up.

00:49:58.672 --> 00:50:00.380
For example, there
are a lot of languages

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.720
that are dying out right now.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.860
Not the majority of them but
certainly a minority of them,

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.970
that are dying
because the speakers

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:11.140
don't want other people
to use their language.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.880
They don't want people
to write it down.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.840
They don't want
foreigners speaking them.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.590
Do we respect that?

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:20.530
Or do we just kind of sigh
and let the language die out

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.510
and respect the wishes of these
people who don't want contact

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:24.910
with the outside world?

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.030
It's a different kind
of ethical question.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:30.160
But personally there are
two ways of looking at it.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.360
One, artistically if you're
talking about a totally

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.030
fictional reality it
breaks the reality

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.970
to use a language that
actually is spoken

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.910
by other people on Earth.

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.660
It's kind of an odd thing.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.302
I always find it
odd when people are

00:50:46.302 --> 00:50:47.760
speaking English
when they oughtn't

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.640
to be-- like "Amadeus."

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.090
I mean it was a fantastic movie.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:53.965
It was a fantastic
movie, but honestly why

00:50:53.965 --> 00:50:55.090
were they speaking English?

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.760
Especially like, I don't know.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.385
Well, it's actually kind of
a bizarre thing of movies

00:50:59.385 --> 00:51:01.760
that we think that British
English would have been better

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.820
than American English.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:07.050
I mean it wouldn't, it's the
same thing, but I don't know.

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:10.090
So artistically it
simply breaks it,

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:13.090
and honestly there's
no alternative here.

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:16.640
The alternative to using
creative language in "Defiance"

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.890
was English.

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:19.780
They were never, ever
going to consider

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.430
using any other
natural language,

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:26.364
or the expense involved
in finding somebody

00:51:26.364 --> 00:51:27.780
to translate into
those languages.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:31.090
And then furthermore,
if you think about,

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:37.410
especially some very--
some minority languages

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:41.820
that aren't spoken very
well-- by very many people,

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.110
and you start to translate some
of the dialogue in "Defiance."

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:47.240
For example, this
sentence that I showed you

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.180
about the chlorine gas.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:53.320
Odds are that Piraha doesn't
have a word for chlorine.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.240
So then it's a question
of what you do.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.410
It seems doubtful that you
could get a speaker up there who

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.674
would have to learn and
understand English well enough

00:52:01.674 --> 00:52:04.090
and perform on a deadline to
be able to translate into it,

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:05.640
so you need somebody else.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.967
And undoubtedly they would
have to create words.

00:52:08.967 --> 00:52:10.550
They would have to
create words either

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.740
by working with
native roots, or have

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:17.410
a whole load of English
borrowings in there, or worse,

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.260
create words they kind of
look like the real language

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.070
and use them in those scripts.

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:26.300
Which to me seems
really offensive.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.860
Essentially you're
creating words

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.514
to plunk down into somebody's
actually existing language.

00:52:32.514 --> 00:52:34.680
You're not a part of the
culture, and you're saying,

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.860
well we're going to represent
this as a word in your language

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.490
for the purposes of
this television show.

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:45.550
I just can't see that
being a good idea.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:49.910
On a separate note, if you just
to kind of remove the created

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:52.010
language aspect entirely.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:54.740
The fact, of course, that
there are dying languages

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.840
is terrible.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.820
It's a question of what
one can do as an outsider

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:07.820
in order to either prevent it,
or to preserve those languages.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:11.620
I'm not sure how a lot of
speakers of minority languages

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.240
would feel if there were,
say, a bunch of teenagers

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.680
from Southern
California who started

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.820
to learn their language
just because they thought

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.380
it was cool, and
funky, and it was

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:26.300
used for these quirky
people in this show.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.200
That, at least for
me, that would make

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.410
me feel a little uncomfortable.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:35.555
So I think that the
sentiment is well founded.

00:53:35.555 --> 00:53:37.430
I don't think that the
solution you presented

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:43.840
is a good one, or feasible,
or necessarily respectful.

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:49.245
I also think that for standard
preservation of languages

00:53:49.245 --> 00:53:51.120
there are people that
are trained to do that.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.659
It's not an easy thing.

00:53:52.659 --> 00:53:54.450
And of course I know
them, and in fact have

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.320
studied under them coming
through linguistics.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.930
It's not just something
that anybody can do.

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:05.490
It takes a lot of
work with the culture,

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.410
and having worked with Hollywood
a bunch, it's a lot of work

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:10.640
that I know that nobody
would be interested in doing.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.930
They wouldn't be interested
in paying for it,

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:14.221
they wouldn't be interested
in taking the time with it,

00:54:14.221 --> 00:54:15.950
because they have
deadlines and they're

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:18.300
doing what they're going to do.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.530
I'm not sure if that
answered every single aspect

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:24.610
of your question but if not,
I'm happy to talk about it

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:27.050
further because this
is an issue that

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:30.260
comes up every
single time created

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.410
languages are discussed.

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.490
So thanks.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:35.040
[APPLAUSE]
