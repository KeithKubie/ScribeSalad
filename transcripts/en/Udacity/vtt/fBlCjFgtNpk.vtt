00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.790
If you've ever been interested in getting your own personal genetic

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.240
information and done any searching online, then you've probably come across

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.140
a company called 23andMe. And in this lesson, we're fortunate enough

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.070
to have a co-instructor, a representative from 23andMe join us, Joanna Mountain.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.060
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Matt. I'm excited to be here.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.980
&gt;&gt; It's great to have you. Now, can you tell us

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.345
a little bit more about 23andMe and, and what you do there.

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:25.190
&gt;&gt; as a geneticist at 23andMe,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.970
I'm involved in the research, where we try to link

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.090
the DNA with particular traits and diseases. We also I've

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.180
been involved in developing the tools and the features that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.110
help people understand their health and their ancestry through their DNA.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.800
&gt;&gt; Now when was 23andMe actually started or founded?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the company was founded in 2006, and we launched the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.790
service in 2007, the year I joined. and that was the first time

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.830
it was possible for people to really explore this

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.020
hidden dimension of themselves. Something that was, was hidden from

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.930
everybody And it was a brand new opportunity for

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.425
people to learn about themselves through looking at their DNA.

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:04.640
&gt;&gt; And this sounds like a pretty exciting revelation for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.810
most people. Is this something that's available and accessible to everyone?

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.620
&gt;&gt; anybody who has internet access can sign

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.060
up and start exploring their DNA. And the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.850
cool thing is, I remember the first time I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.170
went snorkeling, and I. It was just mind blowing to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.250
me, be able to, you know, discover a whole new

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.960
world within the ocean. And to me DNA, to be

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.340
able to explore your DNA is similar. You just,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.570
it opens up a whole new world of, of things

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.525
to learn. And it's, it's a very personal world, it's,

00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:41.150
it's you. And that's this is something that's was not

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.290
available 10 years ago.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.310
&gt;&gt; Well, I think I know just the group of people who might be interested

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.070
in learning a little bit more about their genetics. So let's go chat with them.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.070
&gt;&gt; Great. Let's go!
