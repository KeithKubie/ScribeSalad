00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.350
(dance music)

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.490
- Wow, I really broke a sweat
putting on my songkran shirt.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.710
It is blazing hot today in Bangkok.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.470
Songkran in Thailand is
when friends and family

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.740
come together to celebrate
when you have a chance

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.265
to bless your elders and loved ones

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:29.610
and when you have a chance to
have the biggest water fight

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.443
in the world.

00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:31.890
Here's the plan.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.770
It's April 13th, this is
the first day of Songkran

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.010
and I'm gonna take you on
a Thai street food tour,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.040
water fight, of Songkran.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.090
We're gonna sample whatever's available.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.980
We're gonna get wet and I'm
gonna share it all with you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.870
in this video.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.920
We're on our way now.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.890
Quick little bonus here.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.530
I didn't know my mother
in law was cooking,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.970
but she made some food.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.930
It's time to have some
breakfast before we leave.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.070
Got some fried fish.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.170
Got some rice.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.670
The sauce is where it's at.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.280
Some shallots and garlic under there.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.740
And then there's also gaeng liang goong

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.080
which is a vegetable stew.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.140
Oh she put some of the,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050
I think that was leftovers
from the other day.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.060
She put some kai mod dang,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.450
which are red ant eggs in there.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.870
The larvae of the ants

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.690
and they are incredibly delicious.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.710
Add a little bit of that chili
garlic sauce to this bite.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.171
Break into that fried fish.

00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:21.004
Oh yes.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.940
Oh yeah, that's delicious.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.630
The fried crispy fish, the rice,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.600
there's a lot of lime in that sauce.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.990
Those chilis

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.200
Yeah, they have some heat to them.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.740
And that raw garlic.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.670
There's pumpkin in here,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.600
there's all sorts of type of gourds.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.080
And then agan, yeah, those kai mod dang,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.440
those ant eggs.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.890
Oh, there's a good little
ant nugget right there.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.206
Mhm, mhm, mhm.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.940
The healthfulness of all of
those herbs and vegetables.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.518
The little red ant eggs,

00:01:56.518 --> 00:02:01.183
they kind of burst like really
creamy little pop sensation.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.900
We're fully prepared now.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.733
Micah.

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:12.184
(laughing)

00:02:12.184 --> 00:02:14.868
Micah just chucked the
shoe into the garden.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:15.701
Rah!

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.060
Check out Micah's amazing songkran outfit.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.650
He got the shorts included.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.560
Micah's gonna stay home today with grandma

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.850
because things are gonna be
a little rough out there.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.120
Joe, you ready man?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.903
- It's gonna be a cool day though.

00:02:27.903 --> 00:02:29.233
- He goes.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.013
- Bye bye.

00:02:33.013 --> 00:02:33.846
- Bye bye.

00:02:33.846 --> 00:02:34.679
Love you.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.920
Got the full songkran gear.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.570
The shirts. Water guns. Check.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.570
Got the bag, the waterproof
bag with the phone and cash.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.580
And as soon as you step out
of your gate during songkran,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.660
you will get doused, you will get wet,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.607
you will get soaked.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.334
♪ - About to leave. ♪

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:58.038
♪ Already packing. ♪

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:00.112
♪ Come with me. ♪

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:02.030
♪ I'm not really asking. ♪

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.210
- Just about everybody that rides the BKS

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.890
during songkran, during this day,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.313
is on their way somewhere to water fight.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:10.820
(speaking Thai)

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.250
Randomly on the BTS.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.948
Met up with Dwight.

00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:14.781
(speaking Thai)

00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:16.547
Courageous kitchen.

00:03:16.547 --> 00:03:17.380
- I'm going to eat.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.805
I'm not gonna play.

00:03:18.805 --> 00:03:19.840
- We don't want anybody
interrupting lunch.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.470
You gotta make sure the phone is in here.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.440
In a dry bag.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.187
- Be prepared at all
times during songkran.

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:27.687
(dance music)

00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:33.500
- We're jumping out of the
BTS at saladaeng station.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.360
This is where the Thai street
food water fight begins.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.560
And welcome to Silom.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.487
It's just like a gigantic
water park amusement here.

00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:46.633
Oh wow, there are a ton of people here.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.810
Hi, nice to meet you.

00:03:54.284 --> 00:03:56.830
Whoa, oh that's ice water.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.180
People actually put ice
into the water to spray you,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.220
so it's like a jolt.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.240
It's like a shock of water.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.733
Whoa, that's cold.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.440
Within five minutes, I'm already soaked.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.280
This is saladaeng, this is
silom, this is the downtown,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.700
this is the financial district of Bangkok.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.892
But now this is just, whoa,

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:28.023
that's some ice water.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.593
Now it's just a complete water park zone.

00:04:34.937 --> 00:04:35.770
Whoa!

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.503
Wow, okay, it is about time to eat.

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:50.792
This is gonna be a Thai street food,

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:53.033
this is gonna be a Thai
street food water fight.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.570
Now that we are properly soaked,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.560
it's time to start eating.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.610
I think this is the prime
opportunity to introduce you

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.994
to I'm pretty sure it's the
number one songkran food.

00:05:05.994 --> 00:05:08.661
(speaking Thai)

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.413
- Airbag.

00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:36.091
He's very friendly.

00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:37.099
- He's in the mood.

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:37.932
He's so hilarious.

00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:40.080
But that is part of the songkran spirit.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.050
People are willing to share,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.760
people are so friendly.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.480
That's part of the Thai culture

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.420
that you will love.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.800
It looks like an inner tube.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.834
It's a flotation device.

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:51.370
It's actually floating in the oil.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.201
I have never seen a single

00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:55.868
(speaking Thai)

00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:58.424
Just one egg.

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:00.605
- Just one, just one, just one.

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:01.438
- It's just one egg.

00:06:01.438 --> 00:06:03.556
You can probably pop it like bubble wrap.

00:06:03.556 --> 00:06:06.223
(speaking Thai)

00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:08.700
During songkran, if you
are with your family,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.150
you might have a special dinner,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.470
you might have a seafood meal,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.600
you might have a spread of dishes.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.670
But there's not really
a certain exact dish

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.360
that you have to eat during Thai new year.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.492
It's just about enjoying food,

00:06:21.492 --> 00:06:23.160
whether that be with your family,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.350
or whether that be a street food snack

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.660
when you're walking around water fighting.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.991
And this, by all means, khao kai jeow,

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:33.253
which is rice with a fried egg omelet.

00:06:33.253 --> 00:06:36.170
It's easily the contender for

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.460
the number one food of songkran.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.730
Just look at the interior of that egg

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.563
and the crunchy goldeness of it.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.146
Yeah.

00:06:49.146 --> 00:06:50.340
That's like a jolt of saltiness

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.940
that will delight your tongue

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.320
when you're walking around soaking wet

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.280
and in the hot sun.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.280
He graciously hooked us
up with some mood tod,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.380
which is fried pork.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.000
I'm gonna get some of that kai jeow,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.170
some of that egg.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.720
With a piece of the fried pork.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.453
For the deluxe bite.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.900
- He was making the omelets right here,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.620
but he also had some pot pad kra pao moo.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.503
Great lunch snack for songkran.

00:07:18.177 --> 00:07:19.175
Hm.

00:07:19.175 --> 00:07:20.433
Comfort food of Thailand, right here.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.760
- Oh, oh, there's bamboo shoots.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.983
Yeah, they're pretty good.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.483
- And then I eat it.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.971
- Ying, how's that khao kai jeow?

00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:35.970
- Really good.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.483
- Would you say that the
number one food for songkran

00:07:37.483 --> 00:07:38.598
is khao kai jeow?

00:07:38.598 --> 00:07:39.431
- Yeah.

00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:40.264
- Yes.

00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:41.480
- You have to eat khao kai jeow.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.740
- And make sure you
hydrate yourself very well

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.573
during songkran.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.070
It really is the hottest time of the year.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.308
All right, let's move.

00:07:52.308 --> 00:07:53.141
(speaking Thai)

00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:56.530
Here's a big giant cooler
full of that straight up

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.527
chunks of icebergs in that water.

00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:00.127
They're gonna fill it up for us.

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:07.899
Nice to meet you, thank you very much.

00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:14.967
He's rolled in his suit, that's awesome.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.020
Probably the most famous
thing about songkran

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.853
is a water fight,

00:08:20.853 --> 00:08:24.110
which this is known to be the
world's biggest water fight.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.741
Like actually songkran
is really about family

00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:30.780
and it's about the blessing of loved ones

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.810
and especially elders.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.840
And so most Thais, what they
will do during songkran,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.320
is they'll visit their elders,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.550
their grandparents,

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.554
and they'll pour water over their hands.

00:08:39.554 --> 00:08:44.554
But that has turned into
an all out water fight.

00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:55.291
Nice to meet you!

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.267
(speaking Thai)

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.330
A little more water fighting

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.490
and I have found what is
my favorite snack to eat.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.340
One of the ultimate Thai street
food snacks, sai krok isaan.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.530
This is a sausage.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.710
It's hanging out here,
it dries in the sun.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.610
Slightly ferments, and then
they grill it up over here.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.500
Yeah, this is next perfect salty
songkran street food snack.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.550
He said there's a
mixture of pork with rice

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.393
as well as mung bean
noodles inside of here.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.310
That always hit the spot.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.160
You immediately have to
chase it with a chili,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.840
a piece of ginger, and some cabbage.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.393
I like to go all at once.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.120
And that is the sai krok isaan
entire mouth full experience.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.953
It's very fatty.

00:09:51.953 --> 00:09:53.300
So fatty that it's creamy.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.040
And then you got the, it has
a little bit of sour component

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.160
because it slightly ferments,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.313
then it's smoky because the grills.

00:10:00.313 --> 00:10:02.070
And then the part that makes it

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.763
is the extra chili and that ginger for me.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.810
From here we've decided
to jump on a tuk tuk

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.270
and go to khao san road,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.780
which is another ultimate
place of water fighting

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.980
in Bangkok for songkran.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.430
And and Joel picked up
some jackfruit by the way.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.240
At the last stop.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.073
Thanks man.

00:10:25.073 --> 00:10:26.464
- [Joel] Yep.

00:10:26.464 --> 00:10:28.110
- This is a reclining tuk tuk.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.943
Woohoo.

00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:34.500
Jackfruit is fantastic.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.673
To me it has like an
overripe banana taste.

00:10:38.977 --> 00:10:41.477
(dance music)

00:11:00.963 --> 00:11:01.796
Whoa.

00:11:02.686 --> 00:11:05.853
Oh, Ying is about to take her revenge.

00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:18.185
(speaking Thai)

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.210
She dishes the curry up over khanom chin

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.230
which are the rice noodles.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.270
You can smell the krachai in the air,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.210
which is fingerroot.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.559
It's kind of similar to, it's gingery.

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:40.300
And then she has just the tables lined up

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.210
with the condiments.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.680
I got the nam ya kati

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.340
so the noodles are here and
they served it soup style.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.113
This is one is with the coconut milk.

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:48.940
So it's got a bit of a thicker.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.060
There might be fish.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.260
Is there fish the broth?

00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:55.330
There's fish, ground up fish meat.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.500
And then the fish balls.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.650
I gotta just try it
first before seasoning.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.570
Well the powder is coming off.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.560
There's like a smell.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.220
You can really taste
the fingerroot in there.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.053
Oh that's good.

00:12:09.053 --> 00:12:10.220
And then it has a little
bit of a fishiness.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.670
And it's creamy from the coconut milk.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.750
That is good.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.104
How's yours?

00:12:15.104 --> 00:12:16.940
- [Joel] I love the soup.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.120
- Okay there's no spoon in the chili,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.720
so I think you're
supposed to just dump it.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.870
My herb of choice is the bai maeng-lak,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.630
which is the lemon basil.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.140
I'm gonna add a bunch of this.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.624
This is really what makes it great.

00:12:28.624 --> 00:12:31.640
And stir this up with that chili.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.970
With the lemon basil.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.190
Okay, that's, there's a lot
of vegetables to eat, too,

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.283
but I'll start with this for now.

00:12:38.464 --> 00:12:39.470

Meatball.

00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:53.804
This is phack krachet,
which is water mimosa.

00:12:57.377 --> 00:13:00.360
Kind of like you're eating
like a stem from a tree.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.363
And it's delicious.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.210
That was a great bowl of khanom chin.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.043
Oh man.

00:13:06.043 --> 00:13:08.120

It's just kind of like single file.

We haven't gotten,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.410
oh right in the ear.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.796
We haven't even gotten on
to the actual road itself.

00:13:28.796 --> 00:13:30.223
But we're almost there.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.318
Trying to everyone just
kind of like marching along.

00:13:34.318 --> 00:13:36.413

00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:43.645
(dance music)

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.350
Saw the donor kebab,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.440
and it's just illuminating our faces.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.648
It's something we have to eat.

00:14:13.648 --> 00:14:16.315
(speaking Thai)

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.240
- I was not gonna order it with cheese,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.730
but then I saw she blow torched it.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:28.563
We gotta have the cheese.

00:14:28.563 --> 00:14:31.103
I mean we're just going
all out on snacks today.

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:36.234
Thank you very much.

00:14:36.234 --> 00:14:37.323
Wow.

00:14:37.323 --> 00:14:38.960
Oh that it just oozing.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.490
It's like an oozy mess.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.290
This is exactly what you're
gonna wanna eat in songkran.

00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:53.328
Whoa.

00:14:53.328 --> 00:14:57.245
That tastes extraordinary
during a water fight.

00:15:03.088 --> 00:15:06.421
It's all just gonna drip down your chin.

00:15:28.116 --> 00:15:30.699
(fiddle music)

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.670
- We're heading out of khao san road.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.190
It is incredibly hectic.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.750
It is a lot of fun.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.870
It's a place you can come for songkran

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.970
if you want the full action.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.890
Like a crazy amount of
action, nonstop action.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.143
On our way out we have stopped for,

00:16:00.372 --> 00:16:01.205
he's a friendly man.

00:16:01.205 --> 00:16:04.320
He's making a variety
of Thai teas and drinks.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.490
So it's always good to end on a cha yen,

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.773
which is a Thai iced tea.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.300
Oh yeah, that hits the spot.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.400
When it's hot like this.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.420
It's creamy, it's a little bit sweet.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.881
You can taste the undertone of tea.

00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:19.900
To me it kind of tastes
like melted ice cream.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.040
He sprinkles in quite a
lot of condensed milk,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.493
so it has that like
extreme creaminess to it.

00:16:25.328 --> 00:16:26.230

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.160
water fight ultimate episode.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.510
It's been a lot of fun.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.880
Songkran it's really about spending time

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.080

It's a lot of quick food.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.180
Especially in these areas,

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.250
the busy areas where they water fight.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.370
You'll find a lot of quick easy food.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.530
But it's definitely tasty
