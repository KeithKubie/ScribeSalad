percolated through a filter to remove

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
percolated through a filter to remove
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.150
percolated through a filter to remove
the solids that are floating in the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
the solids that are floating in the
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.540
the solids that are floating in the
water

another finer filter to remove even

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
another finer filter to remove even
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.500
another finer filter to remove even
smaller solids and then last step we go

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
smaller solids and then last step we go
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:52.990
smaller solids and then last step we go
through the reverse osmosis membrane

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000
 
 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.310
 
so this is the most energy-intensive

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
so this is the most energy-intensive
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350
so this is the most energy-intensive
water supply option with the most

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
water supply option with the most
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.330
water supply option with the most
greenhouse gas emissions so we know that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
greenhouse gas emissions so we know that
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.920
greenhouse gas emissions so we know that
climate change is largely caused by

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
climate change is largely caused by
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.049
climate change is largely caused by
greenhouse gas emissions in carbon

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
greenhouse gas emissions in carbon
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.310

building up in our system you know it

building up in our system you know it
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.810

requires a lot of energy to pump water

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
requires a lot of energy to pump water
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.460

here from Northern California right now

here from Northern California right now
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.200

we use it once send it to the ocean and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
we use it once send it to the ocean and
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.390
we use it once send it to the ocean and
they're going to use even more energy to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
they're going to use even more energy to
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609
they're going to use even more energy to
desalinate it and drink it again we call

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
desalinate it and drink it again we call
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.520
desalinate it and drink it again we call
that the cycle of insanity
