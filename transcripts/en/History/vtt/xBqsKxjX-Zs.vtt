00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.420
- Mike Rowley.
Uh, welcome to Ugly Pug Forge.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.670
The reason why I named it
Ugly Pug Forge

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.670
<i>is because I have two pugs.
They are just like me.</i>

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.380
<i>They're a little bit ugly,
but so ugly,</i>

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.960
<i>sometimes they're cute.
At least I hope.</i>

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.540
<i>That's what my wife says.</i>

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.880
I started here--
right exactly here--

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.710
with a railroad track anvil

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.830
<i>that I worked on
for about three years,</i>

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.000
and it was not bad,
but it wasn't, you know, great.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.250
<i>So I sold my soul,
found a couple anvils,</i>

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.250
and they're
definitely pricy now,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.670
but these bad boys
are just like family to me now.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.080
<i>- My name's Cody Craig.</i>

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.670
This is my shop here
in Bloomington, Indiana.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.960
So come on in
and check it out.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.330
<i>When I was younger,</i>

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.710
<i>I threw a hammer
through a window,</i>

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.500
and learned my lesson that way.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.170
So now when I get frustrated,
you know, I just come over here

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.080
and give this a couple swings

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.670
and it--
it helps not be so frustrated.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540
<i>Over here is my pride and joy.</i>

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.580
I've got my big anvil
and my coal forge

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.420
<i>and a couple propane forges.</i>

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880
This anvil, like I said,
it's my pride and joy.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.540
It actually was
my grandfather's as well.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.040
<i>When he got it,
he actually had to restore it.</i>

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.790
And now he passed away
24 years ago,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.210
and it's definitely stood up
to the test of time.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.750
- This is all my stack of steel

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.880
and all of this good stuff.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.830
I've been collecting
for years now.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.920
<i>I use mostly recycled steel.</i>

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.210
I'm a terrible golfer.
I still love golf.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.500
I go as much as I can,
but I'm terrible.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.960
This is probably, for me,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.080
the best use of a golf ball
I can think of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.000
just because the filing in that
tears up my hands,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.540
but with that golf ball
on there,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.830
then I can file all day
and not get torn up.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.750
This is my shop.
This is where it all happens.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.580
- Back kind of hiding
in the corner,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.420
is a weird,
old-school buffing machine,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.750
and this thing was actually
made in Indianapolis, Indiana.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.170
Made by Kurt Vonnegut's family.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.500
And that thing is a beast.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.670
It was also my grandfathers,
and now it's here,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.170
and it will be restored
and rewired,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.330
<i>and it will be returned to use
once again.</i>

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.830
<i>This has been my shop,</i>

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.500
hope you enjoy it,
and thanks for coming out.
