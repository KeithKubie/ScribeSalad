00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; How do we do that? Well, we use the open
standards that have emerged for distributed

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.590
identity on the web. You all know where I'm
going: OpenID. Open ID is the way that you

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.490
can take authentication that's maintained
in one place and rely on it in other applications.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.650
So when you build your application, you build
in the cap--the support in your app using

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.960
either just the standard or any of the libraries
out there to be an OpenID-relying party. You

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.659
build that into your application. You put
a couple of lines into the manifest that say,

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:33.260
"Here's how I'm using single sign-on by OpenID,
and here's my OpenID end point to allow that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.790
to work. The last point of integration that
I'm going to talk about at this level is around

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.671
getting access to data. As Vic said, it's
terrific to build a great app, it's terrific

00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:48.360
to have all the UI integration so your users
can get between Google Apps and your app and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.370
go back and forth. But what about actually
being able to work with the information that

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.670
they are stored--that they have stored in
Google Apps? What if you have an application

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.470
that maybe wants to create calendar entries
on behalf of your users, so that the information

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.390
they're working with in your application can
be integrated into Google Calendar? Or what

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.780
if your application wants to let your users
pick from a list of their contacts that they

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.049
store in their Gmail address book, and you
want them to be able to pick from that list

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.439
to do some action in your application? Before
I tell you the answer, I want to make sure

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.160
people understand the challenge of securely
accessing that data. This is a trust relationship

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.170
that you're looking for in your application.
So your application wants to get at some data,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.569
and that data is stored on Google servers.
But it's not Google's data. The data belongs

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.409
to a particular user at your customer, and
is administered by the domain admin for that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.549
customer. So what you really want to do is
have your application ask the domain administrator

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.219
for permission to access the user's data for
the purposes of your application, and then

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.079
make sure that that agreement is passed on
to Google in a verifiable way, so the information

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.619
that you need is available, but only the information
you need. That's a four-way trust relationship,

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.151
where all the parties have to be able to get
that right. The last thing you want to do

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:13.580
is invent the answer to that kind of four-way
trust relationship yourself. Again, the good

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.201
news is the community has invented the answer.
OAuth is the emerging standard for how you

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:24.159
do delegated trust, how you can do authorization
on the web in a secure way for multiparty

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:31.019
trust. And Google APIs use OAuth for authorization.
What we've done in the Marketplace is built

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.900
that OAuth, the OAuth grant of trust capability,
into the Marketplace flow. So what your application

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.690
does--you're gonna hear a theme here--puts
a few lines in the manifest. You implement

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.920
the code in your application to actually access
our APIs using OAuth, and then you put code

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.849
in the manifest that says, "Please." You say,
"My application would like access to your

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.190
user's calendars, and here's why." In this
case, because I would like to display their

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.860
next calendar appointment. By putting the
information, the request for trust in the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.360
manifest, the domain administrator--your customer--is
able to grant you that trust so your application

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.209
can access the information on behalf of your
users who are our users; are joint users.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.310
All right, we've built a manifest. We've taken
a simple few points of integration. We've

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.290
put them together into a single XML file.
I'd like to ask Ryan Boyd to come up here,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.780
and we're gonna switch from slides to a demonstration
now. So this is a manifest that we've built

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.859
for a simple Hello World application. Well,
Ryan is a developer, and he's actually built

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.159
a simple Hello World application. So if we
could switch to the demo, what we're gonna

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.150
see now, here's the real version of the manifest.
This is what Ryan's been working on. So he's

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.780
built his application, he's described the
integration in his manifest file sitting in

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.859
a high-tech text editor. Always wondered which
side of the Emacs versus vi war you were on.

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.659
Now I know. Um, he's built his application.
So now what does he want to do? He wants to

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.401
put it in the Marketplace. So let's switch
to the Marketplace, and you're gonna see now

00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:10.800
the same Marketplace UI that Vic showed you
a picture of before. This is the live Marketplace

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.250
UI. Has the usual tools you'd expect in a
marketplace that your customers, the domain

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.440
admins, use to find the apps they want and
install them. But you'll also notice, if you

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.690
look closely at the top right, that because
Ryan is logged in as a vendor, as a software

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.810
developer, and because he has previously registered
himself as a vendor with the Marketplace,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.740
he has a new link to his vendor profile. So
if he clicks on that, we're now going to see

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.590
Ryan's vendor page. So when we click on the
vendor profile we see here's there information

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.280
that Ryan has entered about his company. Contact
information, whatever he wants to put in about

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.710
his company. But you'll also see that he doesn't
have anything for sale yet. He hasn't yet

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.590
created any apps for sale in the store. Well,
let's do that. Let's go ahead and create his

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.449
first listing. So when he's creating a listing,
the first thing that he's going to do is take

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.651
that manifest file that he built, copy the
information from the manifest file, and he's

00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:09.150
going to paste it into the listing page. There
it is, pasted in. We've now done all the hard

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.000
work. Technically, we're done. We're integrated.
What's left is marketing. What's left is let's

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.430
tell Ryan's customers, his prospective buyers,
what they need to know to discover and choose

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.460
his application. So we'll start by filling
in some information. What kind of application

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.770
is this, so we can find it by browsing? Let's
type in a name. Let's put in some of the marketing

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.639
material that Ryan's crack marketing team
has been working on to make sure that this

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.760
is one of the more compelling apps. He probably
has been working with a pricing consultant

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.211
for a while to come up with a business strategy
for making money on his application. And he's

00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:46.470
also, I'm sure, been working with a legal
team to make sure that his terms of service

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.000
are iron-clad boiler plate, and, you know,
don't allow any exemptions. So terrific. He's

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.039
got that in there. If you look at the top
left of the listing page, he has the ability

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.830
to put in some more information. This is all
marketing and promotion information, describe

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.539
the benefits of his application. He can put
in some media to have a screen shot of his

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.620
app. Maybe a video of his app in progress.
Whatever information he wants to use to help

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.780
his buyers discover and choose his app and
decide this is the app for them. All right,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.860
he's filled in his listing page. Now his next
step is to save it and preview it. Make sure

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.300
that the listing looks the way that he wants
it to look. So we're saving the listing. The

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.860
Marketplace is gonna show a preview. Here's
what his listing would look like. He takes

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.700
a quick look over it. He sees the information
he entered. He sees a little bit of information

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.110
he didn't enter explicitly. If you notice,
under the add-it-now button under Specifications,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.310
it says this application asks for access to
Calendar, because it uses Calendar for part

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.509
of its integration. That was extracted from
the manifest. That's information that we know

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.350
about, technically, what the app does so we
can put it in the description of the app.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.909
All right, let's submit it. We have a listing,
looks good. Submit it for approval. This kicks

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:02.759
off the quick approval process where we go
through and validate the listing, and turn

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:07.900
it on live in the Marketplace. That might
take a couple of days. Rather than waiting

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:14.620
for a couple of days here, Ryan has previously
published another copy of this app. And now

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.810
you'll see he's logged in as the admin and
a customer. So what we're going to do now

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:25.030
is walk through the experience of a prospective
buyer of Ryan's application. So this prospective

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.430
buyer, this admin at Acme Systems, has been
looking for a Hello World app. They're looking

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.160
for the best one. And they searched in the
Marketplace, and they found a killer description

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.340
of Ryan's application. They said, "This looks
like the one I want." So the admin says, "Yes,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.240
I would like to add this application to my
domain." So let's add it. First thing you

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.560
have to do, of course, is say what is your
domain, where are you trying to install it?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.139
So Acme Systems Inc. wants to install it.
Now, because we're trying to install an application

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:57.800
on our domain, we have to prove that we are
the admin, that we have the rights to install

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.210
it. And all that's left is three clicks. The
first click is let's agree to the terms of

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.240
service of this application. So yes, we accept
these terms. These are the terms that you,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.699
as a software developer, have put into the
Marketplace for your buyers to use. Second--we've

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:18.470
been talking about data access-- Well, this
is where the domain admin sees this application

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:24.009
would like to display your next upcoming Calendar
appointment, and therefore is requesting access

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:30.060
to the Calendar a.p.i. to get access to that
information. Sounds good. Let's grant access.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.979
The app is now installed, and all that's left
is to enable it. Flip the switch. Let's turn

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:39.539
it on. So the admin of Acme Systems has now
installed this application. They could manage

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.880
it from the control panel, if they wanted,
along with all their other apps. Or they could

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.040
go, as an end user, directly to one of their
applications. Let's go ahead, and let's go

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.610
to-- Let's go to Gmail, in this case. So now
I'm just a user of Acme Systems, logging in,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.660
looking at my Gmail. I have my regular mail.
And at the top left, I have my nav bar, where

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.330
I can see what applications--and look, there's
a new entry in the menu: Hello World. Let's

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:10.320
go ahead and launch this brand-new application.
And now we're launching the application using

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.970
the link that we specified in the manifest
to get to the application. No sign-on dialogue,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.540
because we're already signed in. And the app
is actually showing us that it knows who we

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:25.320
are, to show that. And because the app was
granted access to Calendar, can find out that

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.950
Mary's next appointment is to join us in eating
some s'mores right after this event ends.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:35.991
So that's the flow. Build your app, integrate
it, describe the integrations--the manifest--

00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:42.079
listen in the Marketplace, sell it--your users
can use it. It's that simple. Thank you, Ryan.

00:09:42.079 --> 00:09:48.320
So if we could go back to the slides. You
know, what you just saw was the complete flow

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.250
of everything it takes to integrate. But you
saw that flow on a complete sample application.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.910
Just a test application to show the capabilities.
I'd now like to bring up Martin and Mindy

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.500
from Intuit, who are going to show you how
using...
