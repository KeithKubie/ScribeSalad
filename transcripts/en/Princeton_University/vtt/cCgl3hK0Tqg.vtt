00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.490
        of my backyard.
              

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.550
        PAUL RILEY: From my hometown,
        the great city of      

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.500

        Princeton from Boston,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.520
        BENEDICT WAGSTAFF: From the
        beautiful hills of Italy.      

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.190

        Class of 2016 from the

        Turquoise Trail in New Mexico.
              

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.000
        ELEKTRA ALIVISATOS: I am
        talking to you from the      

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.140
        beautiful island of
        Paros in Greece.      

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.770
        DILLON SHARP: I wanted to give
        you a warm welcome from my      

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.220
        hometown of Chicago.
              

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.520
        GAVIN COOK: Right now, I'm in
        Jingshan Park, which is one of      

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.260
        the very few hills in
        Beijing, overlooking      

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.140
        the Forbidden City.
              

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.550
        STEPHEN STOLZENBERG: And welcome
        to Princeton from      

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.470
        Dusseldorf, Germany.
              

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.010
        JOHN MCNAMARA: And welcome
        from the Jersey Shore.      

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.850
        BRUCE EASOP: Hi,
        Class of 2016.      

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.980
        Welcome from your USG.
              

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.720
        My name is Bruce Easop,
        and I'm USG president.      

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.860
        I'm here in beautiful
        Copenhagen, Denmark, for the      

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.250
        summer before heading back for
        my senior year at Princeton.      

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.330
        So the first thing
        you're probably      

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.400
        thinking is, what is USG?
              

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.060
        USG stands for Undergraduate
        Student Government.      

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.230
        And I like to think of our job
        as building connections.      

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.890
        We connect student ideas to
        the administrators who can      

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.530
        make them happen.
              

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.570
        We bring students together
        through campus-wide social      

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.400
        events, plus we like to connect
        you guys to your      

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.520
        representatives through
        videos like these.      

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.320
        So if you have any questions
        or ideas that you want to      

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.570
        happen, feel free to check out
        our online suggestion box at

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.270
        Or contact anyone
        in this video.      

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.970
        But first, we have a few
        things to say to you.      

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.230
        So here are some people who
        couldn't wait to welcome you      

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.670
        guys to the Princeton
        community.      

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.750
        BENEDICT WAGSTAFF: Just wanted
        to send a message of welcome      

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.460
        to all of you to the
        Princeton fam.      

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.860
        PAUL RILEY: I want to
        congratulate you all on      

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.020
        officially becoming
        Princetonians.      

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.710
        SHAWON JACKSON: I'm super
        excited that you all chose to      

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.020
        come here, and I know you're
        going to have a really, really      

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.270
        great four years.
              

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.240
        KATHERINE CLIFTON: I'm sure you
        know you're very lucky to      

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.750
        be here at Princeton.
              

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.770
        But remember, Princeton
        is also in turn very      

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.690
        lucky to have you.
              

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.520
        JOHN MCNAMARA: As you begin your
        time at Princeton, the      

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.730
        best advice I can give to you is
        to take time to reflect on      

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.160
        where you are and where
        you're going.      

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.240
        SHAWON JACKSON: Have a
        random conversation      

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.460
        with just about anyone.
              

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.820
        People at Princeton have so many
        diverse experiences, from      

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.210
        travelling all over the world
        to doing the Rubik's Cube in      

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.000
        10 seconds.
              

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.390
        And you really do learn a
        great deal from them.      

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.310
        So instead of staying up until
        4 o'clock doing a paper, stay      

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.820
        up until 4 o'clock talking
        with some of      

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.740
        your closest friends.
              

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.640
        ELEKTRA ALIVISATOS: Definitely
        take advantage of all the      

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.550
        opportunities, academically and
        socially, that you have at      

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.830
        the school.
              

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.700
        ZHAN OKUDA-LIM: Ultimately,
        there are just so many people      

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.920
        to meet, so many places to go,
        and so many things to do.      

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.760
        And while, of course, you must
        balance your time, I encourage      

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.370
        you to take advantage of
        the many opportunities      

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.650
        available to you.
              

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.420
        PAUL RILEY: As you prepare to
        pack up your things and move      

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.820
        to Princeton, where you'll spend
        the next four years of      

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.640
        your life, I encourage you all
        to always remain humble and to      

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.080
        remain grateful for such
        an amazing opportunity.      

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.380
        JOHN MCNAMARA: Combine that with
        being yourself, working      

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.800
        hard, asking for help when you
        need it, and of course, taking      

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.970
        a little time to enjoy
        it along the way.      

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.820
        I promise your time at Princeton
        will be nothing      

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.310
        short of fantastic.
              

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.650
        BENEDICT WAGSTAFF: Enjoy
        yourselves at      

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.660
        OA, CA, or at home.
              

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.780
        Finish up your summers
        with style.      

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.260
        DEANA DAVOUDIASL: We really
        can't wait to meet you all,      

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.870
        and see you in a few weeks.
              

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.870
        ZHAN OKUDA-LIM: Welcome to
        Princeton University, and I      

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.650
        hope to see you around campus.
              

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.870
        GAVIN COOK: Hope you have
        a great summer.      

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.530
        Get excited.
              

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.300
        I trust you'll love Princeton
        as much as I do, and I look      

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.420
        forward to meeting
        you in the fall.      

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.550
        ELEKTRA ALIVISATOS:
        [INAUDIBLE]      

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.390
        summer, and see you on campus.
              

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.990
        PAUL RILEY: I hope that you all
        are enjoying the last few      

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.180
        weeks of summer.
              

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.750
        I hope that you all are anxious
        and excited about this      

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.350
        transition and this next
        chapter of your life.      

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.230
        DILLON SHARP: So go out, meet
        new people, find new friends,      

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.410
        and find some activities that
        you're interested in.      

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.160
        And really have a great time.
              

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.350
        Welcome to Princeton.
              

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.520
        CHARISSA SHEN: So all right.
              

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.310
        I'm excited to meet you guys.
              

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.560
        Make you sure come find me
        when you get to campus.      

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.050
        Hope you enjoyed your summers.
              

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.760
        We'll see you in the fall.
              

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.410
        KATHERINE CLIFTON: Have a
        wonderful freshman year.      

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.040
        BENEDICT WAGSTAFF:
        And get ready to      

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.290
        rage for lawn parties.
