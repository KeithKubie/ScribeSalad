BURT HERMANN: Thank you very
much for coming here tonight.

00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:06.670
I definitely want to thank
Google for being such gracious

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.040
hosts and having us here.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.246
Yes, definitely applause
for them.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:17.630
With the beautiful view, which
is hopefully not too

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.750
distracting.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.390
My name is Burt, I'm the
organizer of Hacks and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.620
Hackers, and I know we have
perhaps a lot of new faces

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.530
here tonight, so I thought I
would just explain a little

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.720
bit about what that is.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.090
Hacks and Hackers is a group
for journalists and

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.840
technologists.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.930
So hacks, a hack is actually a
slang term for a journalist,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.850
hackers obviously slang term for
a developer, and the idea

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.620
really is to bring these two
groups together to think about

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.070
the future of media.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.350
We're living through this
amazing time of revolution--

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.160
What?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.528
[AUDIENCE MURMUR AND LAUGHTER]

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:51.930
Oh, music.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.890
"Ladada." Yes, that was
planned, that's all--

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.360
[LAUGHS]

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.510
So, we're living through this
time of media revolution, and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.750
really everything is changing.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.710
Obviously that's why
you're all here.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.160
I mean, the way they you create
media is bound up with

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.880
technology.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.760
The way people are telling
stories is bound together with

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.930
technology.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.290
There's amazing tools
out there.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.460
People are empowered
like never before.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.030
And Hacks and Hackers is about
trying to encourage new ways

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.470
of thinking about this.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.520
Trying to get people to actually
create things.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.050
We do Hackathons, we have
training workshops, and it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.260
started as just kind of
a meet-up group in San

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.800
Francisco, and we've grown
since then to actually an

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.130
international organization, and
now we have chapters all

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.240
over the world.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.640
We have nearly 2,000 people in
New York, in a group there.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.670
We have active groups
in Argentina.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.850
We have somebody setting these
groups up across Africa.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.740
So really it's become part of
this movement because I think

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.040
there is such a hunger out
there to figure out where

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.180
things are going.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.290
This is important because we
need to be informed about

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.620
society, we need to make
sure government is held

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.630
accountable, that doesn't
change with the media.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.820
But how can we take the
best of the old and

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.120
combine it with the new?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.200
That's really what this
is all about.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.170
So, with that, I'm going
to introduce--

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.670
Jarek from YouTube is going to
talk about the event, and he's

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.280
going to run this, and
introduce some of the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.270
company's that'll
be presenting.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.370
And we're actually gonna save
all the questions for the end,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.150
which I'll say now and he will
say again, and have a lot of

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.870
time where people can
be interactive then.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.050
So please hold your questions
to the end.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.300
Thanks.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.280
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good
evening, everybody.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.070
Before we start, I would like
to give a hand to our VC

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.590
Operations.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.230
So there's people in space who
are recording this event right

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.450
now, and hopefully you'll be
able to see this online a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.520
little later.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.650
So we just went through
the introductions.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.460
Before proceeding, I
just wanted to call

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.260
out a couple of names.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.300
I have Olivia Ma here with
me from YouTube News

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.550
and Politics team.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.580
She did a lot of work
on this event.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.540
And Hannah Eaves from Link TV.
Link TV is sponsoring alcohol

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.167
tonight, so this is the most
important part of the event.

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:06.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.020
So here's the agenda
for tonight.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.380
We're going to go through the
API Overview, so I get my five

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.820
minutes of fame.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.480
And then we'll have Lightning
talks from YouTube, and

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.410
Storyful, Storefy, ShortForm,
and Link TV. And we'll try to

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.420
keep it on track, five
minutes each.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.200
At the end we'll have a Q&amp;A
session, and hopefully fun.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.740
Please leave us feedback at
the end of the session.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.270
I have set up a short link
and the QR code.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.390
We'll show it again during
the Q&amp;A session.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.470
We would really appreciate
your feedback.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.970
And if you would like to tweet
about this event, here's the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.220
hashtag: #hackshackers.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.800
All right, so enough
logistics.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.610
I would like to start
with a quiz.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.596
Actually, I need to
start [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:55.140
since I get five minutes.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.630
All right, so how much you
know about YouTube?

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.030
First question is, how
many YouTube views

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.790
do we get per day?

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.920
2, 3, 5 zillion?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.440
2 million?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.860
Come on, guys, I have
only five minutes.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.560
100 million?

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.810
2 billion?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.370
5 billion?

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.660
It's actually over
3 billion now.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.310
So you were pretty close.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.279
Next one.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.470
Out of these views, how
many are mobile?

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.006
10 million, 20 million,
30 million?

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:25.874
[AUDIENCE MURMUR]

00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:26.310
10?

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.690
100 million?

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.482
AUDIENCE: 500 million.

00:04:29.482 --> 00:04:31.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: 500 million?

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.860
Actually, it's over 200
million, and this is

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.570
data from last year.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.445
How much video is uploaded
each minute?

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:38.830
That should be simple.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.600
think a lot of--

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.320
[AUDIENCE MURMUR]

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.780
How many?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.430
AUDIENCE: 48 hours?

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.850
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: 48?

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.240
35?

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.470
It's actually over 48,
so you were right on.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.670
And last question.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.650
How much viewership does
YouTube get from

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.630
outside of the US?

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.910
So the percentage views coming
in from outside of US?

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.360
AUDIENCE: 50%.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.210
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: 50, 60, 70.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.020
AUDIENCE: 70.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Right
on, 70's the number.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.980
All right, so now let's
talk about APIs.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.610
So we have two sets of APIs.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.420
Google Data APIs and
player APIs.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.320
So first of all, how many of you
have actually used YouTube

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.250
APIs before?

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.910
Fair amount.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.460
And how many have use
any Google APIs?

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.680
OK, great.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.690
So this should be pretty
straightforward.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.610
So when you think about the APIs
that YouTube offers, we

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.110
have the back in APIs.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.550
So you saw the APIs you use to
interact with, for example,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.310
our search engine, to interact
with the video rating

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.460
capability, comments,
and so forth.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.220
The player APIs let you
customize the player behavior.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.740
So if you're building a website
or web application and

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.360
you care about user experience,
and you really

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.250
want to get the most out of the
video playback capability,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.400
you can use the player
APIs to customize it.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.360
Google Data APIs are based on
rest. So if you know rest,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.350
that needs no further
explanations.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.110
If you don't, all it really
means is that you can access

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.480
the API back end over HTTP in
a very straightforward way,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.880
and I'll demonstrate how you can
do that in the next slide.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.885
We support a couple of
encoding formats.

00:06:10.885 --> 00:06:13.750
ATOM, JSON, JSON-C, for those
of you that are Javascript

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.690
programmers and you
really like JSON.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.090
And we have a set of open source
libraries that allow

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.460
you to access to YouTube back
end using your favorite

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.220
programming language.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.680
So you would rather write Java
code and you don't have to

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.040
deal with XML and JSON
and all that, we do

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.980
have support for that.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.250
We have C# libraries,
Objective-C libraries, we have

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.980
PHP libraries, we have pretty
much libraries for most of the

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.030
major programming languages.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.390
And the way we organize the data
is we talk about feeds,

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.740
so anything on YouTube is
represented as a feed.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.560
So if you would like to
know, what are the

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.590
top videos on YouTube?

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.160
Or what are the most viewed
videos on YouTube?

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.680
Or what are the subscriptions?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.430
What you get back is an XML
document, or JSON document

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.310
that consists of an outer entity
called "feed" and the

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.940
inner entities called "entries."
And YouTube API

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.840
applications interact with the
YouTube platform using the

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.650
Google Data APIs.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.570
I have an example
here of a feed.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.220
This feed represents top-rated
videos on YouTube.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.730
And in order to access its feed,
all I need to do is just

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.500
click this URL issue an HTTP
get request, and what I get

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.140
back is a bunch of XML entries
corresponding to the videos

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.590
that are top-rated on YouTube.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.500
As you see, each video
has a video ID.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.640
It's very straight forward.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.920
So really what I just did is I
used the YouTube API in order

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.140
to get information about
top-rated YouTube videos.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.070
Player APIs.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.370
There are three ways in which
you can actually interact with

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.960
the player.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.550
The simplest one is through the
URI parameters, and then

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.560
we have JavaScript API and
ActionScript APIs for those of

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.990
you that really would like to
get fancy with customization

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.890
of the player.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.830
So player parameters, the
easiest way to interact with

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.180
the player behavior.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.340
Here are two examples.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.720
The first one is the
old object embed.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.070
And in this example, I'm
actually telling the object in

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.860
the bed-- which represents a
video, a YouTube video--

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.330
to not allow the user to play
the video on full screen.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.640
So I want to take entire
control over the user

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.430
experience.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.980
I don't want them to
ever leave my site.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.770
I just want them to see the
video embedded on my site.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.920
I can do that by appending an FS
equals zero parameter to my

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.120
embed code.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.080
And then similarly, using the
new iFrame embed codes--

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.730
this is something that we've
been promoting lately--

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.630
you can actually trigger the
video to start playing as soon

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.310
as somebody navigates to a page
which has this embed, and

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.390
the autoplay parameter
does this.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.929
So here's an example for those
of you that would really like

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.549
to control the player
behavior a lot more.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.360
You can use JavaScript
for that.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.000
And in this example I actually
tell the player to play a

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.750
video for 10 seconds
and then stop.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.990
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.680
ELEPHANT: Hey zebra, how do I
make a cool YouTube video?

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.105
ZEBRA: Go to youtube.com/create
and type--

00:08:52.105 --> 00:08:54.710
[END PLAYBACK VIDEO]

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.160
So what you see is I was able
to tell the player to--

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.310
and there's my timer--

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.860
to start the playback and then
stop it after 10 seconds.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.260
And my time is up.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.370
So I have a couple of other cool
things to discuss, so if

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.320
you'd like to learn more
about the API, see

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.570
me after the show.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.348
Thank you.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.290
Now we going to have Olivia
talk about YouTube Direct.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.710
OLIVIA MA: Hi everyone.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.870
My name's Olivia Ma, and I'm the
YouTube news manager, and

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.290
today I want to talk really
briefly about an application

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.470
that we built and released about
a year and a half ago

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.760
called YouTube Direct, which is
an open source application

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.240
using the YouTube API.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.790
So a little background on why
we created this tool.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.760
In today's world, there are so
many mobile phones that are

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.060
video-enabled, and you have
such widespread broadband

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.600
access that we believe that
everyone can be a reporter.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.580
Now, before anybody comes at me,
that does not mean that we

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.890
believe that everyone could be a
journalist. In fact, we very

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.920
strongly believe that the role
of the journalist has never

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.800
been more important.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.250
But the fact that now anybody
can document the news and

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.470
events happening around them,
can bear witness to news that

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.120
is unfolding before their
eyes, has fundamentally

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.750
changed, I think, the way
that we gather news.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.510
And I think everyone
can agree to that.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.800
A few examples.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.780
Obviously most recently, what's
been happening in the

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.610
Middle East, the Arab Spring,
we've been seeing every single

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.760
one of these countries that is
undergoing political change,

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.040
we're seeing this play
out on YouTube.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.490
Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria,
Yemen, and Syria

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.260
right now, we're seeing a lot
of footage out there.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.770
It's pretty incredible, and this
has become indispensable

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.460
to a lot of news
organizations.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.990
A local example that I think
we're all familiar with was

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.640
the Oscar Grant shooting.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.120
And I think this is particularly
relevant this

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.600
week since there have been a
number of other SFPD-related

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.280
incidents that have been
captured on video.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.030
This was an example where many
people saw a young man be shot

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.060
in the BART station and captured
it on video from

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.960
multiple angles.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.270
And these became really
important videos in that case.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.010
And then I think a lighter
example, but an example of

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:25.460
sort of how commentary can
play in on YouTube, when

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.420
Michael Jackson died, we saw
in just a huge influx of

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.230
response videos about what
that death meant to

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.350
individuals, to our culture.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.670
And so you can see that it's not
just news events but also

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.060
commentary and conversation
around the news.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.510
So what we wanted to do was
create essentially a virtual

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.780
assignment desk.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.350
An application that would allow
news organizations to

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.010
embed the YouTube upload
functionality on their site.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.050
So we decided to create YouTube
Direct, which I

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.640
mentioned is open source, and
it allows news organizations

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.630
or really any news, any website,
to easily integrate

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.090
an audience engagement platform
on their site.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.310
There are two pieces to this
and I'll talk about that a

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.560
little bit more detail
on the next slide.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.570
But basically, you have an
embeddable uploading tool, and

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.770
then you have an admin interface
that allows your

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.070
editors, or the keepers of your
site, to actually manage

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.470
the submissions.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.890
So quick overview of
the technology.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.400
YouTube Direct is built using
the YouTube API and it's built

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.550
on top of Google's app engine.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.430
And it consists of
two components.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.680
The first is the front end.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.490
It's the embeddable YouTube
Direct container.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.830
We use Google's AuthSub to
authenticate users to their

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:36.930
YouTube account.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:42.150
And from your website, users
can actually submit videos

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.530
using the YouTube back end,
and they can submit photos

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.480
that get submitted to Picasa.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.610
On the back end for the editors,
for the reviewers,

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.310
there's an admin interface
that allows you to create

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.870
assignments to review and accept
or reject the video and

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.610
photo submissions that come in,
and really just manage how

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.930
all of these different assets
appear on your site.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.940
So here's an example of
a partner integration.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.390
Our partners here, KGO ABC 7
here in the Bay area, we

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.260
partnered with them starting
last summer on a really cool

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.290
citizen journalism project
that's called uReport.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.650
This version of uReport had
YouTube Direct where users

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.850
could come to their site and
actually upload videos, you

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.350
can see, into various
categories.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.290
So they could select breaking
news, or there were also

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.750
different types of submission
categories that users could

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.410
then upload them to.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.530
Here's an example of how this
is displayed on their site,

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.090
again, using the YouTube API
to display these videos on

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.990
their website, on ABC 7.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.240
And here's a screenshot of what
the admin panel looks

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.590
like for YouTube Direct.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.090
So these are all a list of
submissions that came in

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.680
through both the mobile app,
which I'll show you a

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.570
screenshot of in a second, as
well as the web interface.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:08.130
And the editorial web team over
it at KGO actually would

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.010
go through and review these
videos and decide which ones

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.640
they wanted to use on air, and
which ones they wanted to

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.180
display on their website, and
which ones just didn't fit or

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.890
were not appropriate to
the call to action.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.140
And here's a quick
screenshot--

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.830
a very bad screenshot--
of our mobile app,

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.360
which was a total beta.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.670
We just wanted to test it out,
but we had 150 what we call

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.110
citizen stringers out in the
field who are actually using

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:39.670
these mobile applications to see
submission ideas and then

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.490
submit videos directly related
to those various topics.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.130
So, my time's up.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.380
Thank you.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.660
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you
Olivia, and I would like to

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.260
invite Storyful to
present next.

00:15:01.972 --> 00:15:03.670
GAVIN SHERIDAN: So just
a warning, I'm

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.110
a hack, not a hacker.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.960
And I think that means
I'm more dangerous, I

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.500
don't know, or less.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.500
I'm not sure.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.670
And so I'm going to play
this in Prezi.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.950
So I'm going to start by saying

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.220
that at Storyful where--

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.860
my name Gavin Sheridan, by the
way, and I'm from a company

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.320
called Storyful.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.620
We're based in Dublin
in Ireland.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.790
And we're also YouTube's
curation partner for

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.830
CitizenTube,
youtube.com/citizentube.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.640
So we're a social media news
agency, and we monitor

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.780
YouTube every day.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.350
We monitor YouTube
for videos from--

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.810
particularly in the last six
months-- from the Arab Spring.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.420
And we spend a great deal of
time watching YouTube videos.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.180
Our own back end system in
relation to the API, we spend

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.310
a great deal of time on
searching, persistent

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.930
searching, understanding what
we search for, sourcing

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.330
uploaders, where they're from,
messaging people who've

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.440
uploaded videos that we
find interesting.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.170
And I'm just going to show a
video here that was uploaded

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.590
to YouTube just over
two weeks ago.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.110
And it's a bit dramatic, so
I hope you don't mind.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.270
I was going to play the
first minute of it, if

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.520
it plays for me.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.660
I think the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
is going to work, is it?

00:16:27.925 --> 00:16:40.350
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:53.272
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:16:53.272 --> 00:16:54.300
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.560
Now I'm going to stop there.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.860
It gets a little bit more
graphic later, but it's

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.490
important to remember why we're
watching these kind of

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.110
videos and why these videos
are important.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.339
So this is kind of a mantra
of journalists

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:06.450
all over the world.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:07.480
"I keep six honest-serving
men.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.889
They taught me all I knew.

00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:11.629
Their names are What and Why and
When and How and Where and

00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:11.849
Who."

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.829
So the first question I ask
myself when I see a video like

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:17.359
that is what can I understand
from that?

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:22.349
And what answers can I
gain from that video?

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:27.190
So how many of those questions
can we answer just by looking

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.105
at this video, before we contact
anybody, before we

00:17:29.105 --> 00:17:31.710
contact anybody who's uploaded
the video, what can we learn

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.800
from looking at it?

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.860
So the first question I'm going
to ask is where was that

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.220
video taken?

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.560
Now it was taken in Syria, so if
that's your starting point

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.800
the original uploader did-- the
same video was re-uploaded

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.240
several times-- so we have to
try and understand which city

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.850
was this taken in.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.975
Some videos had said it was Hama
some videos said it was

00:17:48.975 --> 00:17:51.740
Homs, but we were leaning
towards Al-Kseer

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.570
as the upload location.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.190
So this is the town
of Al-Kseer.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.030
If you remember, the video's
pretty dramatic.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.830
You watched the people running,
there's shooting

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.530
going on, it's all
very dramatic.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.080
But I was looking at
something else.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.830
I was looking at what were the
buildings in the background?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:07.850
What time of day was it?

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:08.980
Where was this being filmed?

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.530
So you zoom in on Al-Kseer on
Google Earth and you can see

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.250
there's pretty prominent area
in the middle here is a

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.980
government-owned land because
you can see there's a cemetery

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.330
here and there's pretty
prominent buildings.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.000
And if you re-orient that
looking east you could begin

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.420
to see that this might be where
the video was filmed.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.940
And so you're trying to
answer the question of

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.330
where it was filmed.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.960
So at the start of the video
you see this building.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.080
That's probably that building
on Google Earth.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.000
When you're looking south,
there's that video on a

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.280
billboard in the corner.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.500
That's probably that
building and that

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.990
billboard in the corner.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.830
When you're looking west there's
a tree in the middle

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.940
of the street with a tall
building in the back.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.700
That's probably that tree and
that building in the back.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.480
And as you're looking north you
see another building with

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.560
a little thing on the top of it,
and you can see the same

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.020
building looking north.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.130
So when you get to the end of
it you can see that this is

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.630
the general path the
videographer

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.490
took when he was walking.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.620
These are the buildings that
were in the video.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.220
And we're answering the question
of where it was.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.620
So on the balance of
probabilities this was taken

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.900
at Al-Kseer, probably in the
last couple of weeks.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.940
But once you've found
out where your next

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.700
question then is when?

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.960
So can we answer the question
when this was taken?

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.820
Once we've established that
it's Al-Kseer we can start

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.670
searching and see is this video
being discussed or is

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.970
the town of Al-Kseer being
discussed in the context of

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:27.910
the time this was taken?

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.460
And you can see here they're
discussing it.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.480
The military had moved into
Al-Kseer on the 24th of June.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.310
So it's after that
date, probably.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.800
And we're trying to find out the
answer to this question.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.672
On a blog this was being
discussed and they say that

00:19:43.672 --> 00:19:47.690
the Syrian army had moved into
Al-Kseer on the 24th.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.620
There was a Tweet on 24th of
June from Ham Farouk saying,

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.840
heavy machine guns are being
used to shoot on protesters in

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.050
bystreets and on houses
in the city of Kseer.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.280
So that's backing up
the 24th of June.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.560
This same video is being
discussed on a Syrian

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.150
revolution Facebook page.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:02.750
Having been discussed in Arabic,
we translate that back

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.440
into English to see what
discussion's going

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.380
on about the video.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.780
And if you look at this
picture, this is what

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.360
confirmed to us that this was
taken on the 24th of June and

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.810
not, as some people thought,
on the 1st of July.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.620
This was a satellite photograph
taken five days

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.130
after, and it was uploaded to
Google Earth this week.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.030
And you can see the same
location but the topography

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:28.590
has changed.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.600
And you can see down at the
bottom, there there's a small

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.540
vehicle in the bottom right.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.340
That's probably an APC because
you can measure the

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:34.840
dimensions of it.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.190
It's three meters across,
nine meters long.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.260
And there's a barrier
being put up on

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.280
the side of the street.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.420
So that photograph was
taken five days later

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.710
on the 29th of June.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.260
And that means that the video
was filmed at Al-Kseer, it was

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.830
taken on the 24th of June.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.860
And we can answer two questions
before we even

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.080
approach the people who've
uploaded the video or approach

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.310
our sources in Syria and say,
where was this video taken,

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.520
what does it depict?

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.400
So we've answered two major
questions just by

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.610
understanding, searching for
videos using the API to our

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.150
system and then going through a
process of looking at them.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.280
And I think the significance
of this--

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:16.800
I mean, it's applying very
traditional values to

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.550
journalism, to traditional
journalistic values, that is,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.840
but using technology to answer
those questions that

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.130
I put at the start.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.770
So in Storyful we always
live by two mantras.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.080
The first is that
there's always

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.330
somebody closer to story.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.290
And the second is that every
event creates a community.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.650
Every event creates a community,
whether it's a

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.650
Facebook page, whether it's a
Facebook comment, whether it's

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.760
a tweet, whether it's
a comment on a

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.930
video, whether it's--

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.760
Everything creates
a community.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.030
And it's about being able to
understand that community and

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.240
exploit it to understand
and contextualize

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.490
content like that.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.450
And I suppose the final question
I suppose here is

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.380
what time of day was it?

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.900
So by the shadows going in that
direction and being able

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.590
to understand the north,
south, east direction

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.080
orientations of the video, it
was taken around 3 or 4

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.313
o'clock in the afternoon.

00:22:07.313 --> 00:22:11.640
And that's
YouTube.com/CitizenTube.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.030
We're storyful.com.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:17.140
I'm @gavinsblog and @storyful
is our tweet.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.213
Thank you.

00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:20.760
XAVIER DAMMAN: So hi everyone.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.810
I'm Xavier Damman, the
co-founder of Storify with

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.980
Bert Herman.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.590
So those are really great
presentations.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.890
We really believe that we are
living in this new golden age

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:34.950
of journalism.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.240
For the first time in human
history we have not only a few

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.470
thousand reporters around the
world we have actually half a

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.050
billion reporters.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.850
And thanks to that, now we can
know what's happening in

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:50.630
Syria, in Egypt but also when
there is a tornado in America.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.740
There is always someone on the
scene that's going to report

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.600
on YouTube, or Twitter, or
Facebook, or Google Press

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.120
what's really happening.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.680
So this is really awesome.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.900
And so everybody's a reporter
but not everybody is a

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.150
journalist. And we really need
journalists more than ever to

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.460
actually make sense of
what's happening.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.680
And so other question is when
you see all this great

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.090
content, the video that has just
been shown, for example,

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:19.570
the question becomes how can
we publish that content so

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.050
that our audience, your audience
as journalists, can

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.440
benefit from that content,
and you can touch them.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.380
And so this is really what
Storify is all about is we

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.860
really want to make Storify the
bridge, the typewriter,

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.080
for this new social media age.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.170
So just create a story, and this
is the way it looks like.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.050
You have your story on the
right-hand side, and then on

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.370
the left-hand side you have
access to different APIs, to

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:48.100
different sources, Twitter,
Facebook, YouTube.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.630
And I can search for, let's say
hacks and hackers here.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.360
And I can find [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.590
out to the YouTube API, and I
can just find things that are

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:02.380
interesting, and I can just drag
and drop into my story.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.960
So I don't need to deal with all
those API codes and things

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.140
like that, I just
drag and drop.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.900
And I can add text anywhere in
between, do my blog post and

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.610
tell the story like, this
is what's happening.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.870
With it, you can tell your own
narrative and you can add what

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.490
also people are saying
on Twitter.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.910
For example here.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:22.790
Here we go.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.750
I'm going to add--

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.880
what story?--

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.360
nice quote from David here.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.370
And so you can really augment
your story using what people

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.070
on the ground are sharing.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.040
And so once you do
that you can-- so

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.140
YouTube API, Meetup here--

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.770
once you do that you can select
a different story, a

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:48.740
different thumbnail then you
publish your story and you get

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.190
this story that you can embed
anywhere you want.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.265
You can embed it on your site.

00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:56.930
And for example here, we have
the Toronto Star, who created

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:02.240
a story with Japan tornado and
taking what people posted

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.610
about the tornado on YouTube.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:09.470
Or we have here the Washington
Post, also using Storify to

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.570
publish that content and really
create a new kind of

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.510
story that really has a
different kind of impact.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:20.010
Because it's something to send
a reporter after the fact

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.430
that's going to take a
professional picture, but then

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.650
when you have a picture like
this one where it's actually

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.200
you can see the church being
destroyed, and it's actually

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.300
someone who says, this is where
I got married, and my

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.130
best friend came and
went to school.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.660
I mean it's something that has
definitely a different

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.450
emotional impact on
your audience.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.250
And this is what journalism
is all about.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.190
It's about informing your
audience of what's happening

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.990
and trying to get them feel
some empathy about what

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.120
happened, and really care about
the message that you

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.260
want to get across.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.570
So once you publish your
story so you can

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.320
embed it on your site.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.410
But you can also notify the
people that you've quoted.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.020
So now I can let David
know that actually

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.320
he's part of the story.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.030
And people love that.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.330
And they receive a tweet and
again will re-tweet that

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.320
because they want to tell
everybody, hey, that's so

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.120
cool, I'm now part
of the story.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.600
And so it really helps your
story go viral, which is

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.140
really something important now
in this new social media age.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.220
Because we talk so much about
APIs, we have a lot of APIs.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.410
If you're a hacker, actually,
by just appending at the end

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:31.560
of the story that JSON you
actually get access to the

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.920
JSON representation
of the story.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:39.530
And thanks to that you can
create a great visualization

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:40.750
of your story.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.640
For example I can just turn that
story into a slide show

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.550
by appending /slideshow at
the end of the story.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.940
And so now this is
my great text.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.350
You can see I'm a hacker
and not a hack.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.820
But now I've got here
this Tweet.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.686
I just add it, and also
the YouTube video.

00:26:58.686 --> 00:27:01.610
Here we go.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.320
And the resolution of the
screen is not the

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.220
best one to show that.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.330
So you get the idea.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.080
So we can really create great
social media stories and tell

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.120
your audience what's happening
using content from all those

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.470
social networks and YouTube.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.720
And my time is up.

00:27:24.622 --> 00:27:25.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you Xavier.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.780
Great presentation.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.620
Great story.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:34.340
And, yes, I think we have
ShortForm next.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.860
Is this on?

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.650
And I think you guys have a--

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.390
NADER GHAFFARI: While
he pulls that up,

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.776
who's heard of ShortForm?

00:27:40.776 --> 00:27:42.250
Oh, I see some hands.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.510
Great.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.970
Hi my name is Nader Ghaffari.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.690
I'm the CEO of ShortForm.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.230
I'm here with my
co-founders Tom

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.830
Collier and Jereme Monteau.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.170
As Jarek said earlier, today
over eight years of online

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.000
video content is uploaded to the
internet every single day.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.110
That's eight years.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.970
What we do at ShortForm is we
transform all that video into

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.620
the most social and interactive
online video

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.770
experience on the web.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:12.650
On ShortForm, you can either
be a VJ, a viewer, or both.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:17.050
VJs curate the world's videos
into continuous channels and

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.780
share them with viewers.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.180
Viewers subscribe and tune in
to channels of interest, and

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.300
consume a continuous stream
while interacting with viewers

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.160
and VJs while they consume.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.470
We've got channels on every
subject imaginable.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.840
People are curating channels
around their favorite videos.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.300
Relevant to today's topic, most
new stories eventually

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:37.960
get a channel.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.390
We had channels around Egypt,
Libya, the Japan tsunami.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.700
And Tom will in fact
show a channel on a

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.300
local weather station.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.080
We can be found today on
shortform.com and through an

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.590
embeddable widget, which brings
curated videos to any

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.690
publisher out there with
continuous streams of video.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.695
And with that I'll pass it to
my co-founder, Jereme, who

00:28:57.695 --> 00:28:59.190
will talk about making
a channel.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.680
JEREME MONTEAU: The lead
developer, so--

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.450
Thanks Nader-- got a little
narration there.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.600
I'm Jereme, lead developer
at ShortForm form.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.430
ShortForm is a great way to
curate online video into your

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.730
own channels.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.940
Getting started is
really easy.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.570
You just sign up at
shortform.com and you can

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.020
start adding videos.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.410
We've made it possible to add
videos from all over the web,

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.040
but I think given the setting,
I'll talk about YouTube in

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.340
particular.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.130
Now OAuth is a protocol that
allows web applications to

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.790
make secure API calls on
behalf of the user.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.130
You can find out more
at oauth.net.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.270
YouTube has implemented OAuth
for their data API, and we've

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.490
integrated with it.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.850
And so the result is that it's
really easy to connect your

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.830
YouTube account to ShortForm.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.580
It's a matter of just clicking
on a button in our UI, logging

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.480
into YouTube, and then approving
our application.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.560
At that point you can login to
ShortForm with your YouTube

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.630
account and you can import
videos into your channel from

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.820
your YouTube account.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.860
Now the nice thing about OAuth
is it allows you to grant and

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.140
revoke access on a
per-application basis.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.200
So if for some reason you
decide later that an

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.890
application shouldn't be able
to get your data anymore you

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.520
can just go in and revoke it.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.550
But you won't do that
with ShortForm.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.460
Anyways, after you connect your
account to ShortForm, you

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.090
can import videos from your
list of favorite videos on

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.610
YouTube or the list of videos
you've uploaded.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.220
Behind the scenes, we make
secure calls to the YouTube

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.510
data API to bring those
into our UI.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.570
You can add videos from any
other YouTube user, you just

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.170
enter their username and you can
import their videos all at

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.070
once, or you can be
more selective

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.020
with our user interface.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.370
Once you've got a channel going,
you can share it on

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.060
shortform.com or you can
distribute it across the web

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.320
with our embeddable widget.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.070
And that's what our CTO
Tom Collier is going

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.030
to talk about next.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.074
Thanks.

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:44.720
TOM COLLIER: Thanks Jereme.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.140
So I'm Tom Collier.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.450
I'm the CTO of ShortForm, and
like Jereme mentioned, I'm

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.470
going to talk a little bit more
about the ShortForm of

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.520
embeddable widget, and I'll also
touch upon some of the

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.090
integration points we have
with the YouTube API.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:02.700
So there's a prominent weather
blogger in the Pacific

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.910
Northwest, who we're using as
an example here, who has

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.180
embedded our widget
on his site.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.930
And you can see that the videos
on this widget add a

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.360
little bit a life to the
text-based content of his blog

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.920
post.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.020
So this is about a tornado that
happened recently, and

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.740
you can see the videos are all
related to the particular

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.080
topic that the blogger
is blogging about.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.500
And as one video ends we
seamlessly transition to the

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.610
next video.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:33.240
If the viewer is not so into
the video he's currently

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.300
watching he's able to browse
the channel through the

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.510
thumbnails below the player and
select a video he might

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.470
want to watch instead.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.970
As you see, the most prominent
part of the embeddable widget

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.540
is the YouTube player.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.710
And we've actually integrated
with YouTube's iframe API

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.930
player, which is still labeled
experimental but we've found

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.280
works really well in a
production environment.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.530
And the nice thing about the
iframe player is that it

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.300
chooses dynamically whether
wants to use a flash-based

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.940
player or a HTML5-based
player.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.200
So it actually works on a lot
of platforms including IOS

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.750
devices like the iPad.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.970
We do integrate with other video
players but we find that

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.420
the YouTube player is the
most fully featured.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.590
It gives us full programmatic
control of the video so we can

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.130
play and pause, and also
dynamically load in new videos

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.290
as we see fit, whether we're
transitioning to the next

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:27.490
video or if the user selects
a different video.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.020
It also gives us a full set
of video state callbacks.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.140
So if a video is unavailable
for whatever reason, if it

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.720
were taken down or if a user
marked it unembeddable we can

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.390
tell the server to update the
channel and dynamically move

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.100
the video on.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.550
So if you want to learn more
about the ShortForm embeddable

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.310
widget visit
shortform.com/widget.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.240
And we'd like to thank Jarek
and the YouTube folks for

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.490
having us here.

00:32:59.255 --> 00:33:01.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you
for the nice demo and

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.630
presentation, and accolades.

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.510
That's pretty awesome.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.010
Next we have GoAnimate,
I believe.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:13.080
Is Gary in the room?

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.330
All right.

00:33:22.678 --> 00:33:25.140
Just start the clock.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:25.980
All right.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.894
You've got five minutes.

00:33:27.894 --> 00:33:29.410
GARY LIPKOWITZ: Hi everybody.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:33.310
My name is Gary Lipkowitz,
and I'm with GoAnimate.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.080
Just a quick overview.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.950
GoAnimate is a suite of web
apps, located at goaimate.com,

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.040
that allows everybody to quickly
and easily create

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.720
animated videos.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.660
Most importantly, no drawing
or programming is required.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.710
And I've got on here simple drag
and drop apps, but the

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.840
easiest one is actually a
text-to-video app where you

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.970
literally type your video and
we take care of the rest.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.390
We've done a lot of
work with YouTube.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.810
We're part of youtube/create,
and we've also used the data

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:06.530
APIs to enable our subscribers
to very seamlessly export

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.980
their videos to YouTube.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.929
The connection to reporting?

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:14.530
I've written a couple
of things up here.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:16.710
Certainly if you wanted to put
yourself into a virtual

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.020
studio, this would be a very
easy template to create quick

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.570
and easy studio sets.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.440
Although it's a full-featured
suite of web apps, this does

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.780
allow you to import video,
audio, or any other digital

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.300
assets into the studio
environment to be incorporated

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.010
into the assets that
we have there.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.760
For instance, audio journalists
or bloggers could

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.820
very easily translate their
material into a video and

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.739
publish it.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:45.929
It's a freemium model, and
there's plenty to work with on

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.610
the free side.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:52.320
Most importantly, on the
news-related side I'd say this

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.510
allows you-- or provides a forum
in which you can very

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.100
easily comment on the news.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.240
And I'll show you a
little video to

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.490
illustrate that at the end.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.810
I'd just like to quickly show
you the three apps that are in

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:05.830
our environment.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:08.330
The simplest one is the
text-to-video app.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.340
I'm sure many of you have seen
little videos running around

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.060
YouTube often with millions
of views where a couple of

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.440
animated or robot voice
characters argue with each

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.780
other over mobile operating
systems, or stuff like that.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.090
So there's two providers in that
space both of them are on

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.030
youtube/create for your
creation pleasure.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.410
You can see there's a three
at the top of the screen.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.130
So the way it works in
our environment,

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.520
you choose a theme--

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.850
that's kind of a matching
set of backgrounds, and

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:39.190
characters, and props-- so you
choose a theme, then you

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.800
choose your characters.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.550
The robot voices in this app are
married to the characters,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.690
so you don't even have
to worry about that.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.750
Then you type your dialogue,
then you press play.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.560
Literally you could be done in
a minute, but they would be

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.270
robot-voiced.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.680
And I really messed around
trying to find ways these

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.640
robot voices can tell jokes
and do one-liners.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.440
There's ways with punctuation,
you can mess around with it.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.870
But if you want to be more
creative than text-to-video

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.790
the next step is the
character creator.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:09.600
How many people have a Wii, and
have used the Mii creator

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.100
on the Wii?

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:11.460
All right.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.640
So you guys are all
ready to go.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.200
You can use the character
creator right away.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.600
You can see here we're
choosing the

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.170
top half of his clothing.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.090
If we right arrow we
would then move on.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.600
You see the icon
of the pants--

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.110
or hopefully you can see
it on this screen.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.960
You would then choose that, then
you choose shoes, then

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.230
eyebrows, nose, facial
hair, ears, earrings.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.890
Not only can you choose
different things off the

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.810
pallet you can make them bigger,
smaller, rotate them.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.980
If your Mr. Spock has to have
his pointy ears exactly at a

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.730
certain angle you can do that,
and you can get it done in

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.270
about five seconds.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.000
When you're really ready to make
a full-featured video you

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.070
would go into the animation
studio.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.790
This is what the pallet
looks like.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:53.800
Like I said, it's all point,
click, drag and drop tools.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.630
You can see a drop down
menu with the theme.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.090
Below that, icons for character,
callout buttons if

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.520
you're try to do a comic strip
style, backgrounds, props,

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.160
music and sound effects, and
then visual effects.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:08.450
Shoot.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.140
I'm real short on time so I
want to quickly try to get

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.410
this video to you.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:21.210
And I hope we can--

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.460
shoot, that is the wrong--

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.175
That's not copied correctly.

00:37:28.175 --> 00:37:29.910
Where was the presentation?

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.377
Was it this one.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:47.730
Shoot.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.320
Failed again.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.006
BERT HERMAN: Do you
want me to try it?

00:37:50.006 --> 00:37:51.295
GARY LIPKOWITZ: Yes, please.

00:37:51.295 --> 00:37:54.362
BERT HERMAN: This is my mic,
and this one a special.

00:37:54.362 --> 00:37:57.640
GARY LIPKOWITZ: This video is
a sneak peek of the new

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.530
topical theme that we're
bringing into the production

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:00.280
environment.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.060
As many as you know, in this
country we elect a president

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.080
every four years.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.010
And usually the party not in
power gets started by having

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:10.140
multiple candidates in what's
called the primary, and then

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.666
they have a lot of debates
before you get

00:38:12.666 --> 00:38:14.070
to the general election.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:14.395
I'm deliberately talking
like we're in primary

00:38:14.395 --> 00:38:15.590
school to kill time.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.880
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.796
-Thank you.

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:19.720
Thank you.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.154
Thank you so much for joining
us this evening.

00:38:23.154 --> 00:38:26.160
Welcome to the future of
presidential primaries and

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.790
elections brought to you by
YouTube and GoAnmate.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.830
-Please welcome former
Massachusetts

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.595
governor Mitt Romney.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.700
-Compared to the other
candidates you will meet

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.110
tonight, I'm twice as strong
on the issues.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.410
That's because I stand on
both sides of them.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:53.590
-Please welcome Congressman
Ron Paul.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.800
-If elected president of the
United States, I pledge to

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.530
immediately abolish said office
as well as the entire

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:04.560
federal government.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:09.700
-Texas Governor Rick Perry.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.370
-If elected, I will
intelligently design the

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:17.520
government and execute as many
criminals as executive orders.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.070
-And finally, the Drilla
from Wasilla.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:27.530
The highly publicized
vacation-taker Sarah Palin.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.540
-Alaska was small potatoes.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.680
My commitment to the office
of President is strong.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.160
I promise not to resign until
the public speaking money gets

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.980
really, really, really good.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.570
-And there you have it.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.350
Brief introductions from
all our candidates.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.540
If you don't like what they're
saying, change it using

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.190
YouTube and GoAnimate.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.840
I'll now leave the stage since
zombies are coming to eat the

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.260
candidates.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.670
Thank you for joining us.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:01.866
Drive safely and have
a good night.

00:40:09.186 --> 00:40:12.114
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:12.114 --> 00:40:13.110
HANNAH EAVES: Hi.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.930
That's kind of a tough act to
follow, but I'm going to do my

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:20.630
best. So I'm going to try and
start this with a bit of a

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:24.000
statement from a well known
provocateur, Clay Shirky here.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.360
And he says, "If I was going
to start a news business

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.590
tomorrow, I would start a news
business designed to produce

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.630
not one new bit of news.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.600
But instead to aggregate news
for individuals in ways that

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.591
matter to them."

00:40:36.591 --> 00:40:41.020
And I think that that is really
revealing of a new

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.660
opportunity that's come about
recently thanks to this

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.070
creation of a whole
new system of vast

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.740
syndication of video content.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.320
So if you look at YouTube, in
a lot of ways YouTube is a

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.780
vast syndicator.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.590
It's a huge library of content
that multiple people can use

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.380
in different ways, through
APIs and through

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.040
an embeddable player.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.890
Now Link TV, probably a lot of
you aren't familiar with us,

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.130
but we are a national satellite
broadcaster in about

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.330
35 million US households.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:17.580
And for a long time, one of
our areas of expertise has

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.330
been content curation.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:22.890
And not just content curation,
but the ability to add

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:27.140
additional added value to the
content that we select.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.790
So a lot of the content that
we select is international

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.960
news, international
documentaries, world cinema.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.640
And then we have programs such
as Mosaic World News from the

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.530
Middle East, which is a daily
half-hour program where we

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.020
select eight to 10 broadcasts
from Middle Eastern

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:46.450
broadcasters, and then we
translate those into English.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:51.650
And it's a combination of
curation and aggregation with

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.480
this extra valued content, which
is that you're then able

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.490
to hear what it is that the
Middle East is saying about

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:01.880
the United States, and see
opinions from people on the

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.330
ground in the Middle East and
broadcasters in the Middle

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.270
East. We have a similar program
called Link Asia,

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.850
which does a similar kind
of thing with Asian news

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:16.030
programming, except that it also
uses blogger contributors

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.410
from Asian countries.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:21.810
Now what we've decided
to do with Link

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.260
News is a new website.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.860
We've realized that there is
this new opportunity around

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.300
curation and added value.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.660
And so we've created a new
website that's heavily based

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.710
on those concepts.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:37.330
So I'd rather just show you the
website than talk about

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:38.580
this stuff.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.310
Can I get into the--

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:56.760
Here we go.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.912
Yep.

00:42:57.912 --> 00:43:00.020
There we go.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.380
So here's a homepage
of Link News.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.770
This is a new site that
we just launched.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:11.120
As you can see that this is a
broad variety of content from

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.700
a whole bunch of different
broadcasters--

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.860
international broadcasters--

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.650
Al Jazeera English, Telegraph
UK, ITN News, Euro News.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.600
And in a lot of ways this looks
like a traditional news

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.145
website, an international
news video website.

00:43:23.145 --> 00:43:26.270
But what's powering this website
is the YouTube API.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.530
So every single piece of content
you see here featured

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.230
on the home page has been
curated from the library of

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:33.040
content at YouTube.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.830
Every morning we have a news
editor that comes and searches

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.060
for the best and most
interesting stories that are

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.870
breaking in the world, and also
looks for angles that

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.290
might not be covered in the
mainstream media, or stories

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:46.250
that might fall through
the cracks.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:51.100
For instance, UN declares
famine in Somalia.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.050
But what we're doing differently
to a lot of sites

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.440
that use the YouTube API--

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.700
and you could see it in a lot
of the projects tonight--

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.930
is that we're integrating fully
the YouTube experience

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.540
into the news experience.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.280
So if you click on one
of these videos--

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.640
and we have one down
here that seemed

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.050
appropriate for tonight--

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:11.700
"Hacks and Hackers: LulzSec
Attacks Murdoch Newspaper."

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.950
This is a YouTube video.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.730
You can see it has a YouTube
watermark here.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:20.490
It plays through YouTube's
chromeless player, but it has

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:23.900
all of our own controls, all of
our own video controls, and

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.920
it looks just like a video
from our own system.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.960
When we call that video into
our system we bring with it

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.920
all the metadata that
comes from YouTube.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.970
So here we have the title,
description, and that's where

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.660
the added value starts
coming in.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.040
Our system, which is a unique
system, it analyzes the

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.800
metadata, the title,
description, transcript, any

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.740
other kind of information that
comes with the video, and it

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.490
automatically pulls out topics
and tags that are related to

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:52.100
that video.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.070
So it has an intelligent
analysis that says, this video

00:44:55.070 --> 00:45:00.240
is about Rupert Murdoch,
LulzSec, news international,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.120
anonymous, hacker, hacktivism.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:03.995
And this is automated.

00:45:03.995 --> 00:45:06.650
You know, at most news websites
someone would

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:09.390
manually come through and tag
this video, but this is an

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.500
automated system, an intelligent
system, and that

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.840
means that it's highly
scalable.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.570
So we can have just one person
part-time curating a massive

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:23.310
news website because this
system is automated.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.220
In addition to that we use those
topics then to bring in

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.730
related content from
around the web.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.900
So here we have articles
from around the web.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.330
And we have related videos from
other websites such as--

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:38.570
we can bring in videos from Wall
Street Journal, CBS, ABC.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.830
And then in addition we have a
supporting articles, Gawker.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:46.530
So when this story broke this
system not only featured this

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.970
video about this story, but
intelligently brought in the

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.980
best information from all
around the web to

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.440
support this story.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.580
And that information updates
itself live the minute someone

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:03.400
watches this video, which means
that we turn a site that

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.590
is a basic video site into
an incredibly rich media

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.350
experience adding a whole extra
level of information

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.190
around the video.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:18.580
In addition these topics all
lead to advance topic pages.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.290
So it gives you information
about that topic, information

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:25.320
about the individual, and again,
all sorts of videos

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.910
from around the web, videos
from Link TV, around this

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:30.680
topic area.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.720
And also the ability
to narrow down.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.550
So you're looking at Rupert
Murdoch you might want to see

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:38.360
what the Australian Prime
Minister had to say about

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.230
Rupert Murdoch's recent
behavior.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.300
So you can narrow it down.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.060
It does an intelligent analysis
of all the videos

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.080
that have been categorized
as Rupert Murdoch videos.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.060
What are the secondary
categories?

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.140
And it suggests where
you might want to

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.700
narrow down your focus.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:56.070
So here now we're just seeing
news story videos from around

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:59.200
the web about the Australians
Prime Minister's reaction to

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.120
Rupert Murdoch.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.870
And of course topic pages like
this are incredibly great for

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.630
search engine optimization and
all sorts of other techniques

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:11.030
to bring larger audiences
to your video content.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.470
So I think that I'm
out of time.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:15.130
But that does give you kind of
an overview this isn't a more

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:19.620
traditional video website but
it's just a deeply integrated,

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:23.360
curatorial-level on top
of YouTube's content.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.590
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you, Hannah.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:35.110
And I'm going to hand it off to
Bert now, who will run our

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:36.060
Q&amp;A session.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.850
And I would like to invite our
presenters to come up closer

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:43.630
to the podium so you guys can
take questions with us.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:44.880
Thank you.

00:47:46.818 --> 00:47:47.760
BERT HERMAN: Yeah.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.820
Thanks a lot to all
of the presenters.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:49.710
That was really great.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:52.430
I saw actually one question
on Twitter.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:54.810
I thought maybe I would start
with Olivia, actually, because

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.260
somebody said, oh,
I didn't realize

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.330
YouTube had a news director.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:01.140
Maybe you should even just say
a little bit briefly about

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.740
what you do on a daily basis.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.580
OLIVIA MA: I wouldn't
get caught

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.270
calling myself a director.

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.490
Yeah.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:11.140
No, YouTube has a small
but mighty news team.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.040
There's just a couple of us
and we're obviously not

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.290
focused on creating content.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:16.430
YouTube doesn't create
content.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:21.820
But really what we do is try
and create programs,

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.270
partnerships, and products
that help both news

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.830
organizations as well as
individual journalists and

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:31.150
citizen reporters-- we use
that phrase not citizen

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:32.670
journalists--

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.770
use YouTube more effectively
to disseminate information.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.170
So we actually have another
person from our team Dave

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:40.450
Gehring, who's in the back--

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.950
Dave, raise your hand--

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:44.790
who's our strategic partner
manager for our news

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:45.320
organization.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.750
So he works directly with news
partners on the site and help

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:53.350
them optimize their channels
and their experience for

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:57.080
distributing their content,
whereas I'm more on the side

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.170
of working with the community
and trying to bridge the gap

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.330
between news organizations and
these citizen reporters.

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:06.838
So that's what we do.

00:49:06.838 --> 00:49:11.050
BERT HERMAN: Questions please.

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:12.720
All of you here you don't
have any questions?

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.105
You're blown away by the--

00:49:14.105 --> 00:49:14.730
yeah, Jack.

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:15.585
Go ahead.

00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:18.060
AUDIENCE: A couple questions
but I'll take my turn.

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:22.335
The first question goes to the
last. The related videos,

00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:26.135
doesn't YouTube have a related
videos feed in the API?

00:49:26.135 --> 00:49:28.510
And do you guys do a better
job of the related videos?

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.990
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:30.510
BERT HERMAN: I'm going to just
repeat the question actually

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:32.670
just to make everybody hears, So
the question is YouTube has

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:34.860
a related videos API.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.980
How do they work with that
or is there something

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:41.880
HANNAH EAVES: Well YouTube's
related content API is limited

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.030
to content that's on YouTube.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.460
What we do is we link
to content from

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:47.650
all across the web.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.950
So it's not just videos that
are on YouTube it's videos

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.110
from all over the place.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:58.160
And also, I would say using the
semantic technology we use

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.500
also provides in some
ways, perhaps,

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.065
better related content.

00:50:04.065 --> 00:50:06.480
I don't want to say that I'm
better than Google because

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.610
that sounds kind of ridiculous,
but we are doing a

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:13.010
lot of really advanced work
with semantic entities and

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:17.940
link data that mean that it
does kind of a good job.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.630
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I would like
to add that the application is

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.880
actually open source, so for
all of you hackers you are

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.170
welcome to download it.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.600
I think a fair amount of
the work is actually

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.870
available right now.

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:31.390
And you can hack with it and
see how well it works.

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:35.370
And then I don't think we have
a monopoly of the best video

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:37.850
selection ever, and this is
precisely why we want

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:41.450
application developer partners
so they can do their own share

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:44.100
of discovering the content
on YouTube.

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:44.420
HANNAH EAVES: Yeah.

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.570
And I would say it's
not all us.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:46.870
We use about--

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:47.970
how many different APIs?

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:50.420
Our developers are over here--

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.380
five or six different
APIs as part of the

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.725
whole application process.

00:50:54.725 --> 00:50:56.200
AUDIENCE: Quick question
to you.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.812
The data API, some of the
data not's updating.

00:50:59.812 --> 00:51:02.192
It's been something that's going
on with channel views,

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:03.620
data views?

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the view
counts are not always updating

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:08.000
in real time.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.760
They will eventually return
the consistent

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.260
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:17.470
Well, it's not something we
discussed as far as the actual

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:18.840
implementation.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.970
But yeah, if our algorithms
detect that there maybe some

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.300
issues with the view count,
then we kind of take a

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.090
conservative approach.

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:29.160
But eventually they do coverage
on the right number.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.391
AUDIENCE: Kind of a follow up
on that and then I have

00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:35.896
another question.

00:51:35.896 --> 00:51:41.630
I know Google uses the search
API in its videos.

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.760
What's interesting and my
question is do you guys do

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.350
customization in the app and
that maybe something you could

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:46.850
develop later?

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:48.850
Could they could choose
what sources they

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:50.443
want for their dashboard?

00:51:50.443 --> 00:51:53.269
That's really a cool app because
you can do custom

00:51:53.269 --> 00:51:54.519
searches [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:59.190
BERT HERMAN: So the question
was if they can customize--

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:01.550
a viewer can customize
the sources they see.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.140
And I'm going to say we're going
to keep it to just one

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:06.000
question per person.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.250
HANNAH EAVES: We don't right
now but we have the

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:11.550
architecture in the back end to
support that in the future.

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:14.820
We do have a weighting system
for sources that we use

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:18.960
internally, but definitely
interested in the idea of

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.080
making that available
to users.

00:52:25.294 --> 00:52:26.258
AUDIENCE: This is for the
panel in general.

00:52:26.258 --> 00:52:31.560
This is such fabulous, powerful
tools [INAUDIBLE],

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:35.306
but I'm wondering how will media
professionals continue

00:52:35.306 --> 00:52:37.256
to get paid?

00:52:37.256 --> 00:52:38.840
BERT HERMAN: How do
people get paid?

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.760
DAVID CLINCH: Can
I answer that?

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.470
BERT HERMAN: Sure.

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:41.210
Go ahead.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:42.000
DAVID CLINCH: Hi.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.840
I'm David Clinch.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.570
And I'm with Gavin and Mike from
Storyful here as well.

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:49.440
And the answer is, I'm one
of those professionals.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:55.600
I worked at CNN for 20 years and
left with no other plan in

00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:00.470
my pocket except to start a
company that would do the news

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.130
in a completely new way.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.830
My co-founder, Mark Little, was
exactly the same, 20 years

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:06.140
of doing journalism.

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.540
As far as we're concerned, we're
still doing journalism.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:12.630
So what we did, and what Gavin
did a great job of showing you

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:14.840
there with the video that we
identified, that's just one

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.440
piece of video.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.140
We do hundreds.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:17.900
AUDIENCE: Pardon me for asking,
but how are you paid?

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.060
DAVID CLINCH: News companies
pay Storyful--

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.570
that's a very good question
because we didn't really

00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:24.910
address that-- news companies,
some of the largest news

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:29.040
companies in the world, pay
Storyful a subscription to get

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.190
our services, curated video,
sent in a stream directly to

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.840
their news room with all of the
information they need not

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.560
just to identify videos like
that from Syria, which are

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.400
obviously then verified by us,
but also videos of tornadoes,

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.210
of floods, of anything else,
with all of the information

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.750
that we can get from the API but
also what we get from our

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:51.240
own curation, which would be
telephone numbers, emails,

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.410
verification that would help
the news companies then

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:57.550
immediately get the person, who
is literally still sitting

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:00.330
on the plane taking a picture
of the shuttle taking off

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:03.380
through the clouds, before
they even leave the plane

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:05.210
they're getting phone calls from
news companies saying,

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:06.680
can we use your picture?

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.210
So they pay us for
the service, we

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:09.120
don't own the content.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.500
HANNAH EAVES: Can I take just a
quick stab at this as well?

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.250
BERT HERMAN: You can take
a stab at that.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.695
Yeah, there was some--

00:54:13.695 --> 00:54:17.030
HANNAH EAVES: I know that this
revenue source is not catching

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:21.780
up, so this is a bit of
disingenuous answer, but you

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.760
know there is advertising
on YouTube videos.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.860
And that comes with the videos
when we use them on the site.

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:33.100
So there is opportunities with
syndication for your ads to

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.320
reach a much, much, much
larger audience if the

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.290
syndication happens to
the right places

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:40.070
with the right numbers.

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:44.200
It could boost your ad revenue
significantly.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.550
And also there is potential,
eventually--

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:49.560
we're doing news but we're
also doing documentaries.

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.690
Say you're watching a news
story about the nuclear

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:57.950
reactor breakdown in Japan, and
you really want to watch a

00:54:57.950 --> 00:55:00.890
documentary about
nuclear energy.

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:05.090
Maybe that documentary is on
Hulu Plus, but maybe the site

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.360
allows you to plug in your
credentials via various

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.940
subscription services.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:13.090
And so you could then, if all
worked well in the syndication

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:17.600
world, you could watch that
content on a site like ours by

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.050
plugging in your paid

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:20.405
subscription to other services.

00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:27.660
NADER GHAFFARI: At ShortForm we
actually think Jereme had

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.780
once Tweeted curation
is the new creation.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.260
When you've got eight years of
content being uploaded we

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:38.770
actually intend to distribute
some of our revenue to the VJs

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:42.290
who actually curate
these channels.

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:45.960
So when you have socially
programed channels and these

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:50.160
VJs are finding the right
content for their audience,

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.540
and they build and audience, we
intend to reward them for

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.810
finding an audience, building
an audience, just like a

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:59.440
television network would if they
had built an audience.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.400
And our revenue model's to
interstitial place ads within

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.650
the channels.

00:56:06.591 --> 00:56:09.960
AUDIENCE: I have a question
for the Storyful folks.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.386
Your video is very dramatic and
you talked about how you

00:56:13.386 --> 00:56:15.839
get to who, how, when, where,
why, et cetera.

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:18.713
But that looked like a very
time-consuming process.

00:56:18.713 --> 00:56:23.537
Do you have cool software tools
to make you able to do

00:56:23.537 --> 00:56:25.439
it much, much quicker than
you might think?

00:56:25.439 --> 00:56:26.410
GAVIN SHERIDAN: It
often depends--

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:27.720
BERT HERMAN: The question,
let me just

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.890
repeat it since, yeah--

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:32.070
So the question was Storyful,
it looks like it's a very

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:33.430
time-consuming process.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.712
Do they have any software
that makes that easier?

00:56:36.712 --> 00:56:37.930
GAVIN SHERIDAN: It depends
on the videos,

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:38.700
really, is the answer.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.430
And that particular video I was
able to find out where it

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:42.750
was filmed relatively--

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:46.660
it took about 15 minutes because
if you become attuned

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.860
to be able to identify
stuff in videos--

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.160
and as I said, it depends
on the video.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.710
Some videos it's much harder
to identify location, it's

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:54.780
much harder to identify
landmarks, it's much harder to

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.540
identify the time of day,
and that kind of thing.

00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:00.430
So yeah, oftentimes you're
leveraging a social graph that

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:03.980
develops around content so
you're actually letting people

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.840
help you understand what
the content is saying.

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.950
So easier using the crowds to
some degree to understand the

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:11.450
discussion that's
forming around--

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:15.200
As I said, content and videos
like this create communities.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.510
Even singular events
create community.

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.680
So you're reaching out to people
subsequently and you're

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.530
saying, is this video showing
what I think it's showing?

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:24.940
And you're trying to reach to a
balance of probabilities and

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:28.270
saying, I think this is a fair
stab at trying to understand

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:30.385
what's going on.

00:57:30.385 --> 00:57:34.160
DAVID CLINCH: I would also say
that process you saw and that

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:38.460
Gavin described, we have dubbed
it the human algorithm.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.960
So while we do have quite
sophisticated back end systems

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:44.370
that help us do one thing that's
very important, and

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:48.100
that is we can quickly identify
those videos that we

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.975
should be spending time on and
not the hundreds or thousands

00:57:50.975 --> 00:57:52.930
that we should not be
spending time on.

00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:56.520
So we can then dedicate the
human algorithm part, which is

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.990
both our curation and the
community that's around it, to

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:01.810
the process that might
take 15 minutes or it

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:03.320
might take five minutes.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:06.400
And then, of course, the more
you do it in some ways the

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.620
easier it gets.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:13.766
AUDIENCE: I've got a question
for the hacker from Storify.

00:58:13.766 --> 00:58:15.680
I really like your idea
and I could see myself

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.360
using it in my blog.

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.250
I write technical articles,
how-tos, tutorials--

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:24.286
But the question was, you showed
in YouTube you can type

00:58:24.286 --> 00:58:25.920
in somebody's username
and pull all of

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.528
their videos and stuff.

00:58:27.528 --> 00:58:31.280
What about copyright issues
where people, it belongs to

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.630
somebody but you can't use it
without their permission.

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:36.566
How do you handle that?

00:58:36.566 --> 00:58:40.080
And with YouTube-- you know,
you can mark it private.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:44.040
Does the API provide the whole
list of videos for the user or

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:44.875
how does that work out?

00:58:44.875 --> 00:58:46.390
BERT HERMAN: A question
for Storify

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.020
about copyright issues.

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.976
Good thing he has
to answer it.

00:58:51.976 --> 00:58:54.090
XAVIER DAMMAN: Thanks.

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:54.400
Yeah.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.160
So there is some interesting
things there.

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.790
So obviously when you upload a
video to YouTube you can set

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:04.870
the privacy settings, and so you
can allow or disallow the

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:07.910
being able to embed the video.

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:10.090
So it's really like, if you can
embed the video, then it's

00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:11.060
going to be embedded.

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:13.020
And if you cannot embed the
video it is going to be you

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:16.540
can embed it and then show that
actually the owner of the

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:19.330
video didn't want to
embed the video.

00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:20.500
And that may be interesting.

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.770
I don't know if you remember the
golden voice, there's the

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:28.130
famous guy who actually was the
homeless person who has an

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:29.400
amazing voice.

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.360
And so someone took a video of
that and uploaded that to

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.740
YouTube and then someone did a
Storify story about it that

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:37.840
really went viral.

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.250
And then after a while, I don't
know, the rights were

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.070
bought or something.

00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:44.340
But anyway, long story short,
the video was not available

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.720
anymore for embedding.

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:49.400
And so the person, the author
of the story, updated the

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.540
story and says, oh, well now
we don't have the right

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.550
anymore to publish that video.

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:58.630
Which is also kind of part of
the story, the fact that

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:01.500
someone actually took over the
rights and actually decided

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.370
not to publish it anymore.

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:05.134
AUDIENCE: But then you can
link them to your--

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.016
that YouTube--

01:00:06.016 --> 01:00:06.710
XAVIER DAMMAN: Yes.

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.730
We can always link
back anyway.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.760
So through the API we have also
access to the information

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.610
whether you can embed it
or not, or whether

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.660
it's private or not.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.390
And it is a fundamental aspect
of Storify, which is the fact

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:20.410
that we always keep
a link back to the

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:23.105
original piece of content.

01:00:23.105 --> 01:00:25.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I would
liked to add one common.

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:27.740
So through the API, you can
discover whether the video has

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.330
been allowed for embedding
or not.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:32.140
And we do give content owners
the ability to actually

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.210
prevent people from embedding
the video.

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:36.650
So they can upload it but
you can only see it on

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:38.270
youtube.com, for example.

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:40.980
And then actually as far as the
copyright and stuff like

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:43.320
that, I'm not a lawyer but I
would like to mention also

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.430
that recently we added the
ability to indicate upon the

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:49.200
upload what type of licensing
you would like your video to

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.240
have. In fact you can designate
creative commons as

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:55.230
the license for the video that
you upload to YouTube, and you

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.930
can do that today.

01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:58.135
AUDIENCE: What about like a--

01:00:58.135 --> 01:01:00.551
BERT HERMAN: Just one
question, sorry.

01:01:00.551 --> 01:01:03.848
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So we can
chat after the event.

01:01:03.848 --> 01:01:05.098
BERT HERMAN: Other questions?

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:12.690
AUDIENCE: For YouTube Direct,
can you just talk more about

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:18.250
how the program's been going,
and some insights like have

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:22.840
people been submitting great
videos or have the editors

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:28.675
been inundated with videos
that aren't as cool.

01:01:28.675 --> 01:01:29.400
OLIVIA MA: Yeah.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.300
No, it's a good question.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.250
BERT HERMAN: A question
about YouTube Direct.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.230
What kinds of videos are
people uploading?

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.660
Is it a lot of noise?

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.980
Are people being inundated?

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:40.440
OLIVIA MA: So the team from
KGO is actually here, so I

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.420
encourage you to find
them after.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.590
With that project in particular,
I think they

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:48.770
definitely saw a fairly
significant

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:50.160
increase in video content.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.650
They already had a
user-generated program that

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:56.520
they had launched a few months
earlier, and had seen a lot of

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.310
photo uploads.

01:01:57.310 --> 01:02:00.340
I think it's easier for people
to take photos with their

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:01.420
mobile phone.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:05.410
And so with this with this
program they definitely saw a

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:08.060
notable uptick in video
submissions, which for a

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.950
television station is pretty
useful, right?

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:12.740
Because video content is more
interesting to show on a

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:15.030
nightly news than photos.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:18.010
I do think that video
is harder, right?

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.630
It's harder to get good
quality stuff

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:20.770
when you ask for it.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:26.170
And I still think that the
balance of YouTube is fairly

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:29.400
significantly weighted towards
what's organically showing up

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.170
versus what you ask for.

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.890
I think that that's why a lot
of these applications that

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:35.640
people are talking about today
are so interesting is because

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.190
using the YouTube API you can
search and find the stuff that

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.980
people are uploading
to YouTube.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.900
Because they may not know about
that news organization

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:46.100
that's asking for it.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:50.290
So we still strongly encourage
news organizations to look on

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:52.270
YouTube to see what they can
find that's just being

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:55.105
uploaded because not everyone's
going to know, oh,

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.440
I should go to this news
organization's

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.760
site to submit this.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:01.040
But we have noticed that if a
news organization really does

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.000
dedicate themselves to investing
in the community and

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.600
asking for stuff on a
regular basis, it

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.960
really has to do with--

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.500
KGO really promoted that on
air and said, send us your

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.660
stuff, we want it.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.970
And every day they said that,
so their audience started to

01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:19.300
understand, OK, this station
really does want my content.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.785
That really does pay off
in the long run.

01:03:22.785 --> 01:03:23.775
BERT HERMAN: Yep.

01:03:23.775 --> 01:03:24.765
Back there.

01:03:24.765 --> 01:03:28.725
AUDIENCE: Are there any viewer
tools around to allow viewers

01:03:28.725 --> 01:03:32.190
to establish their preferences
and make a virtual channel?

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:33.440
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:46.620
BERT HERMAN: So the question was
about viewer tools, ways

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.915
to share things with their
social networks.

01:03:48.915 --> 01:03:51.040
NADER GHAFFARI: That's
essentially where we're at

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040
with ShortForm.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.480
it is social video so where
we're going is you would

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:00.150
arrive at ShortForm and you
would know exactly which

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:03.620
channels your friends have
watched or are currently in,

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.700
and you would have the ability
to join those channels and

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:11.210
watch with them synchronously
and consume that content.

01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:15.370
So we are absolutely going in
that direction of social video

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:20.590
and opening it up fully
to your graph.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.600
DAVID CLINCH: And I would just
like to add-- this a bit

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.150
provocative, but I think things
like that are very

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:28.410
interesting and that certainly
it is great within the context

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:31.530
of a particular group or company
but I'm particularly

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:34.810
interested in perhaps the role
that Google Plus might take

01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:37.340
going forward particularly
because it's a Google product

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:41.420
and YouTube will presumably be
as integrated as it could

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.600
possibly be.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.170
And it's very interesting for us
at Storyful, for instance,

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:47.820
to think that right now we're
using Twitter, and Facebook,

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:52.690
and lots of different platforms
that are circling

01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:55.890
around the YouTube video, but it
would be really interesting

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:59.160
to us to imagine a situation
where a YouTube video could

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.300
actually be framed within Google
Plus and all of that

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.950
functionality of discussion,
and sharing, and related

01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:08.170
videos, and everything else--
and again, I'm getting way

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.820
ahead of myself here, but it's
really interesting to think

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:15.100
that instead of all these
disparate social networks

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.930
where YouTube videos may be
shared in different ways, that

01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:21.870
you could have a sort of a
central one-stop shopping

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:24.190
where both the video and
the commentary about it

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:25.440
will be in one place.

01:05:28.506 --> 01:05:31.240
HANNAH EAVES: I think there
are also some exciting

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.420
potential opportunities around
topic tagging, tying into

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:38.750
Facebook's tagging system.

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:40.330
We do that.

01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:42.960
Rob would be-- our developer
would be better to talk to

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.770
that a little bit.

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:45.430
But there will be, potentially,
the opportunity

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:46.740
down the line to--

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:50.020
Right now, if you like something
on a website you can

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.790
see if your friends like
the same article.

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:54.100
There is the potential--

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.000
we were looking at a video
about Rupert Murdoch.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.790
You might be able to see other
of your friends liked other

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:03.070
articles, videos and other kinds
of content around that

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:06.520
news story instead of
just this page.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.230
So I think there is an
opportunity eventually for

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:12.720
facilitated conversations, not
facilitated actually, just

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.060
organic conversations, on pages
that are about certain

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:19.240
topics, like videos about
certain topics.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.900
BERT HERMAN: Adding to what
David said, I hope we have an

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.970
API Meetup up about the Google
Plus API when one exists for

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:26.930
external consumption.

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:28.770
Anyway, one last question.

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:29.450
Right there.

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:32.294
AUDIENCE: Are there any plans
to do any kind of live

01:06:32.294 --> 01:06:34.190
curation, live video feeds?

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.440
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:40.545 --> 01:06:43.830
BERT HERMAN: The question about
live video curation.

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:44.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I can
take that question.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:49.400
So we do have a early version
of our live streaming APIs.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.890
So if you're interested in
them-- in fact, that was one

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.830
of my slides, but I only
got five minutes

01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:55.200
and I ran over time.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.570
And so we do have two sets of
APIs that we are working on

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:02.760
with partners on integrating.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.430
One is on the discovery front,
on the consumption front.

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.710
You can actually discover what
other live events that are

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:11.150
scheduled, when will they be
airing, and what's the URL to

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:12.270
actually consume it?

01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:16.990
And then on the other side, we
have APIs that allow a content

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:20.120
owner or a live video producer
to actually hook up with our

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.510
system to actually schedule
the event and then

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:23.920
and deliver the event.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.710
So these are very early API's
We are just actively working

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.560
on ironing out the kinks out
of it, but if you're

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.930
interested in them please chat
with us because we are

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:35.546
actively looking for feedback.

01:07:35.546 --> 01:07:38.180
XAVIER DAMMAN: And so if you're
a hacker and you want

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.830
to play with this kind of API
we also have a write API.

01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:44.860
So you could actually use the
news trimming API of YouTube,

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.380
and use that and then turn
that into stories.

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:51.230
So definitely, we want to be a
video system that can plug

01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:55.760
into different APIs as a source,
but also as an output.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.130
So there's definitely a lot of
things that can be done there.

01:07:58.130 --> 01:08:01.070
And definitely integrating more
wait time is definitely

01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:03.010
something that has been
requested a lot.

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:07.606
And that's definitely a thing
that we want to work on.

01:08:07.606 --> 01:08:10.550
HANNAH EAVES: We also have done
a lot of live streaming

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:14.130
events with dialogue and
conversation with guests

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:16.790
around the live streaming, we
just haven't done those on the

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:17.859
news website yet.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:21.220
But I think it's definitely an
interesting idea thought that

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.460
we're going to be looking at.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.100
DAVID CLINCH: Just one last
thing because we're all

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:24.569
talking here.

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:28.340
But the political season will
be a really interesting

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.800
experiment area for that.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.420
We're definitely discussing with
our partners, YouTube and

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.160
others, the idea that you could
do live curation of

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.950
content around live political
events and things like that

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:41.470
would be really interesting.

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:44.569
We'd love to see more
YouTube live news.

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:48.410
It's very frustrating to us when
there are YouTube videos

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:51.689
and then there is live video
from another source.

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:53.779
We'd love that live
video to be on

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:55.670
YouTube as much as possible.

01:08:58.322 --> 01:08:59.310
BERT HERMAN: OK.

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:01.010
Well yeah, I think we're
going to wrap up here

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:02.140
as far as the questions.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:05.290
I do, definitely, before ending
here, really do want to

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:08.300
thank very much Hannah and
Link TV, who did help put

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:13.130
together all this and
pay for the drinks.

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:15.340
So part of the reason for this
event tonight is that they've

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.140
also released a new report on
youth and video consumption.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.510
Maybe she could quickly mention
that because there's

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.859
copies of it here.

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:23.800
HANNAH EAVES: I'd to mention
that because especially some

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.370
people who worked on the
report are here.

01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:31.279
Andrea Sevari, who did the
research, Lauren House, I'm

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:33.750
not sure she's still here,
our youth division

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.109
worked a lot on this.

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:38.160
We did a lot of research with
16- to 25-year-olds about

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.439
their news media consumption
habits, with support from the

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:45.649
Knight Foundation, that
we used when thinking

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:47.760
about this news site.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.109
And those findings, a national
survey and several focus

01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:53.500
groups, are in the white paper
that was being distributed.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.430
I think there's a lot of really
useful information in

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:57.490
there for people who
are trying to

01:09:57.490 --> 01:09:58.780
reach that age group.

01:10:02.508 --> 01:10:03.980
BERT HERMAN: So thank
you again.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:04.820
Thank you, everybody.

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.870
Again, if you have questions,
I'm sure everybody's going to

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.830
be hanging out up here, and look
forward to seeing at the

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:10.290
next event.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:11.540
Thanks.
