&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.180
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: This
program is being sponsored

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.370
by the European Division
at the Library of Congress,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.480
and the Hebrew Language Table
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.840
I would like to thank at LC
Grant Harris [assumed spelling],

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.030
Erica Spenser [assumed spelling],
Audrey Fisher [assumed spelling],

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.050
and Galina Teberoski [phonetic].

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.990
Today we'll hear two very different
approaches to Holocaust stories.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.460
Our Crime Was Being Jewish contains
memoirs of 358 Holocaust survivors,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.910
and Auschwitz #34207 tells the
story of one, Joe Rubinstein.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.670
Our panel will be moderated

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.490
by Michlean Lowry Amir whose
is Reference Coordinator

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.620
of the Holocaust Survivors
and Victim Center

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.380
at the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.620
And as part of her job she's
always helping researchers,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.590
and she's always throwing
these speakers.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.090
And she says, Gail, you've
got to have this speaker.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.140
So that's how our two wonderful
speakers came to us today.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.350
Michlean is going to be
moderating, questions

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.920
and answers will follow
at the very end.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.220
Thank you.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.020
Michlean?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:38.070
[ Applause ]

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.030
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: Well,
thank you all for coming.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.190 position:56%
For me it's an honor and a privilege
to be here and moderate two authors

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.820
who I are I think very,
very special.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.110
And I'm sure you will feel the same
at the end of this presentation.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.970
I thank Gail for inviting me to
be part of this event which is

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.170
in a way a commemoration
of Kristallnacht

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.270
which happened November
9th and 10, 1938.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.010
I just want to say a
few words about that.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.190
Kristallnacht is not a word that
Holocaust survivors like to use

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.390
for this event because it has
a little positive connotation.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.490
You know, Kristall is beautiful.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.240
So they prefer to call it
the night of broken glass.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.900
The I guess excuse for that
evening, for that night,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.400
was the fact that a young man by
the name of Herschel Grynszpan,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.080
who was 17 years old, was very,
very frustrated because in 1938,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.790
towards the end of 1938, many
German Jewish people who were

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.800
of Polish descent were
suddenly sent back to Poland.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.130
Some of these people were in
Germany from 1900 and even before.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.390
Herschel Grynszpan's
parents were there from 1911.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.600
And he was so upset that they were
sent to Zbaszyn which was a town

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.270 position:56%
on the border of Poland and Germany.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.420
So they were in a camp in
Poland and had nowhere to go.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.360
They had lost all their
contacts in Poland,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.300
and so were many other people.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.690
So he went to the German
Embassy in Paris,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.120
and was very frustrated
talking to Ernst vom Rath

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.240
who was an employee
at the embassy there.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.120
And finally he just took
out his gun and shot him.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.930 position:56%
And that was the excuse for
everything that happened that night.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.360
It was encouraged by two well
known Nazis, Hydriff [phonetic]

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.900
and Gerbals [phonetic], and that
evening 267 synagogues in Germany,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.600
Austria and in the
Protectorate were burned

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.730
down as were 7,500 Jewish
businesses, many Jewish cemeteries,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.550
Jewish schools and Jewish homes.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.630
So it was really the beginning of
what we now call the Holocaust.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.970
And I think this presentation
is very, very appropriate

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.490
to remember that horrendous day.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.990
So I have to admit that I'm not
an objective presenter here.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.950
I have known the authors, Tony,
for a very, very long time

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.300
and his works, his
books for a long time.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.780
I know he's an excellent
author and so is this book.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.220 position:56%
I like to always remember the moment
when I saw President Clinton going

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.280
on vacation to Martha's Vineyard
with Tony's book on the Burning

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.500
of Washington in his hand
so the world could see it.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.970
And that was fantastic publicity.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.740
And, of course, his book
on the assassination

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.160
of President Lincoln
is also very famous

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.810
as are his other 10 or 11 books.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.870
And so the years that I've
known him I won't even tell you

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.230
because it's so many.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.990
I haven't known Nancy as many
years, but I feel very close to her

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.710
because we've worked both
with Tony and with Nancy

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.090
on their research actually
from the very beginning

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.740
when they just started thinking
about writing their books.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.350
I think Tony was not sure exactly
what he wanted to do immediately,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.240
and I'm sure you'll hear
that a little later.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.460 position:56%
But he knew that it was time for him
to write a book on the Holocaust.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.090
And Nancy was fortunate I think, as
was Joe Rubinstein that they met,

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.240
and eventually the book has been
written, and it is here available

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.930
and of information to
everyone around the world.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.190
And I know Nancy is in
contact with people all

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.610
over the world because of the book.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.680
So our work together was at the
Holocaust Museum where I have been

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.370
for 16 years in working in
reference, now more specifically

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.380
on the fate of individuals.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.840
And, therefore, Joe
Rubinstein's store was exactly

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.200
in my area of research.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.550
And we did find all kinds of
information on him during the war,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.890
how he moved from camp
to camp, and how he came

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.310
to the United States and so forth.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.790
And when Tony eventually
decided that he wanted to look

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:42.240
into oral histories, we worked
together to see which ones

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.480
and how he would access them.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.940
The museum has an enormous
resource for Holocaust studies.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.160
Not only does the museum
have its own Center

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.560
for Advanced Holocaust Studies
where there are scholars,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.670
but there are also interns and
fellows a the museum all the time

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.760
from all around the world.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.970
And they work on so
many different areas.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.320
We know that the Holocaust
is the most documented event

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.720
in human history.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.620
So the documentation is enormous.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.960
We have in the library
over 100,000 books.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.100
These books are in every
language that you can imagine.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.700
Any book that's been
written on any aspect

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.990
of the Holocaust the
museum tries to get.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.180
And so there are books in Chinese
and in Japanese and languages

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.550
that you would not imagine.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.250
And there are 100 million
pages of archival information.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.740
The museum has been collecting
this for over 21 years.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.570
That's how long the
museum has been open.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.500 position:56%
But many years before that when it
was just an idea information started

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.830
to be collected.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.010
So that, and then there
are 100,000 photographs

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.010
and 10,000 or more interviews.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.650
So for all these scholars when they
come to research they need help

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.340
to navigate through this
wealth of information.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.540
And that's what we do when we help
them in doing the reference work.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.800
A lot of the information is
available on the website.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.620
But, of course, much has
not been digitized yet.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.170
It is I think the idea that
eventually this will happen,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.830
but it will be a long time
because those of you who have been

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.050
to the museum to the permanent
exhibit, everything that's there is

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.030
about five percent of
what the museum has.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:43.550
The rest, the 95 percent is
kept in a state of the art area

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.330
where temperature, pressure
and humidity are very,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.770
very carefully controlled.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:54.090
And we are building a new
structure just for that.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.030
So my interaction with these two
authors has been very interesting.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.530
And to see how the process evolved

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.320
so that there is a book
is always amazing to me.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.620
Because sometimes it's an idea in
someone's mind, and it takes five

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.890
or sometimes even ten
years to see the product

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.400
and be able to actually read it.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:21.130 position:56%
I think that both Nancy and Tony
had in mind the words of Elie Wiesel

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:26.840 position:56%
who warned that only those who were
there can write about the Holocaust.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.200
And that's why I think they went
to the horse's mouth, so to speak,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.140
to those survivors
who were interviewed

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.290
or the survivor was alive.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.610
And I think they're
also trying to make sure

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.360
that these memories are
there for us to remember.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.850
Because Elie Wiesel also said

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.960
that if we forget we'll cause
them to have a second death.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.730
And unfortunately that is true.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.550
The only thing that we
have really from those

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:02.540 position:56%
who were there are the memoirs and
oral histories of those who survive.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.980
So they used raw testimonies,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.460
and for Our Crime Was
Being Jewish Tony combed

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.660
through the museum's oral history
interviews and listened to,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.530
as you heard, 358 of them
and pulled out of them some

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:26.640
of the most powerful and
poignant testimonies.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.850
Symbolically that book is like
the chaos of the Holocaust.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.670
There's no arrangement.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:39.470
It's not arranged by geographical
place or in any other way,

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.970
not chronologically or by subject.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.440
And there's no index because
I think the author felt

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.170
that if he indexed the
358 names one would think

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.760
that these were all of them.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.140
But all the others,
especially the victims,

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.610
would not have been on the list.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.870
And those evil acts that were
perpetrated by the Nazis are

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.740
so coldly described in the
passages that Tony pulled

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.690
out that one is left holding
your breath in disbelief.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.650
I think this book will be a very
useful resource for teachers

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.230
of all age because the
information is right there.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.910
And they will not have to comb

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.580
through all these interviews
as Tony had to.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:31.320
And it is really excellent
documentation of those crimes.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.320
Nancy Geise, on the other
hand, focused on one person.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.000 position:56%
And she interviewed him masterfully.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.380
He was very reluctant at first.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.000
Actually, you will hear from
Nancy, did not want to talk.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.670
I think it just was too
painful for him to remember.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:55.140
But after several years
possibly because of his guilt

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.780
that he was the only one that
survived he felt that he needed

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:05.200
to talk to be the one who would
record what happened to his family,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.440
too, everyone in his family.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.690
His fortune was that he was a
very positive thinking person.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.860
Because even in the total
darkness of the war he was able

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.540
to see some rays of light.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.460
And he was able to make a new and
wonderful life in the United States

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.450
for himself and his family.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.360
And you will hear more
about it very soon.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.300
Nancy's book is very readable.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.760
She divided it into sections,
and they are very accessible.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.420
She provides historical
background to events describe

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.560
by Auschwitz prisoner #34201.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.970
And she included maps, documents,
photographs and a time line

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.030
so that one could read it and
really get the background,

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.640
not just what happened to Joe

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.170
but what was happening
during the war at that time.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.900
The reviews of both books
have been excellent,

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.880
and you might hear more about that.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.570
And I think we're really very
fortunate to have Anthony Pitch

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:09.230
and Nancy Geise talk about the
issues of writing the Holocaust.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:14.090
So I invite Tony to come up here,
and I have some questions for you

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.430
so that we will hear how this
process of writing went on.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:28.580
My first question is what led
you to decide after all the books

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.980
that you wrote that you needed to
write a book about the Holocaust?

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.290
&gt;&gt; Anthony Pitch: Good question.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.550
Look, I must at the
beginning apologize.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:44.530
I had a stroke, and my short-term
memory is not what it used to be.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.270
In fact, I recently forgot
what I was talking about.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.360
I hope it doesn't happen today.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.370
Why did I choose the Holocaust?

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.250
I had always been attracted
by subjects

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.960
that were epic, true and sad.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.790
I don't know why, but
that's a fact of life.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.440
And that's why I wrote about
Vietnam, [inaudible] held prisoner,

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.210
the burning of the White House
and the capital by the British,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.680
the Lincoln assassination.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.890
They all fit that mold.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:23.240
And then I thought, well, the
Holocaust is in that mold also.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.390
And probably it was my daughter
said to me don't touch it.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.000
It's been overdone, it's
been written by everybody.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.720
There's nothing new you can say.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.850
And I accepted that,
and I put it aside.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.220
And then one day I was
looking at at YouTube,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.500
and I saw Dieudonne M'bala M'bala.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.350
He is a Frenchman whose
father was Cameroonian

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.730
and his mother was French.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.710
He lives in France.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.500
And this is the ranking anti-semite

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.220
in Europe today, Dieudonne
M'Bala M'Bala.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:03.370
He has an enormous following
and he ridicules the Holocaust.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:09.490
He has Shoananas, shoa you know
and ananas is pineapple in French.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.520 position:56%
And he plays with the pineapple
while he's ridiculing the Holocaust.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.470
And he's making a fortune,
and he's getting followers

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.430
like nobody's business.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:24.330
It so infuriated me that
I had to reply to him.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.600
And the best method I could do was

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.340
by getting the Holocaust
survivors themselves

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.820
to tell him what they went
through, what they endured.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.070
And that's why I chose this book.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.810 position:56%
And I wrote the preface, that's all.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.060
I let them speak for themselves.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:48.990
I excerpted brief amounts that
they could describe the range

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.630
of atrocities.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.980
And it's one of those things that
all Holocaust survivors have,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:01.320
the urge to record it for
a world naive to believe

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.670
that it appears again and again.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.750
And these are their
statements, not mine.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.200
It's their wisdom.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.370
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: So
my next question is,

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.120
although you partially answered it,

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.480 position:56%
but how was writing this book
different from writing about Lincoln

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.800
or about the White House?

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.880
Writing it how was that different?

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.730
&gt;&gt; Anthony Pitch: It's
different in this respect.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.010
I had to insert myself
into my other books.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.950
And I did research from
Harvard right down to Alabama.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.890
Any document I could get hold of.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.930
There are state historical
societies all over the place.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.290
There's no end to the research.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:45.330
This one was quite easy for me

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.490
because I let the people
speak for themselves.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.810
My only insertion of
myself was to edit

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:58.840
because English was not the mother
tongue of many of these people.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.310
In fact, I probably
went through much more

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.840
than 1,000 of these interviews.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:11.830 position:56%
And some of them the English was not
quite good enough even for editing.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:17.840
And so I chose those who would
show the range of atrocities.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.090
And it was rather like
being at an operation.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:25.100
I can stand blood, the slight
of it, I can watch these things

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.100
on TV, it doesn't matter.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.310
Many people have said to
me how did you manage it?

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.940
It's so frightening.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.650
But you can't write about the
Holocaust unless you describe how

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.950
it was.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.470
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: So that leads
me to the next question which,

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.770
again, you partially answered.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:50.480 position:56%
Was it emotionally difficult for you
to deal with these interviews day in

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.120 position:56%
and day out, during the night when
you were reading them so thoroughly?

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.090
Did it leave an effect on you the
next day or for a long period?

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.670
&gt;&gt; Strangely it didn't.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.630
It should have but it didn't.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.950
I don't know why.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.830 position:56%
It was like when I visited Auschwitz
it was all scrubbed and clean.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.600
You couldn't smell it.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.620 position:56%
You couldn't see the people
suffering, skeletons walking around.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.920
It was all scrubbed and clean.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.230
And that's the effect
that this had on me.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.350
Many people express surprise.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.140
They said how did you
get through it?

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.460
And I don't know, but
that's an individual thing.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.780 position:56%
It really didn't affect me, but know

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:43.020
that if you read this book
you probably may not be able

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.010
to finish it.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:52.170 position:56%
It's so horrific, and this is really
my reply to Dieudonne M'bala M'bala.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.020
They spoke and they answered him.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.890
&gt;&gt; I think that Michael Barenbaum
gave you a wonderful forward

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.790
for the book, and you
were fortunate to him.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:08.090
And we were fortunate because
he added to your forward.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.130
So one more question I have.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.270
And that is did you have any
difficulties getting a publisher?

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:18.120
I constantly hear it from
writers about the Holocaust

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.680
that it's impossible
to get a publisher.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.830
Can you tell us about the
process of getting a publisher?

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.120
&gt;&gt; Anthony Pitch: I wish
I could answer that.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.510
They are a curse.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.590 position:56%
[Laughter] I don't know the secret
to it, but I have no problem in this

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:43.180
because my agent was Jewish,
and he took it like that,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.610
and he placed it very quickly.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:50.220
It was all done in
a couple of weeks.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.940
J.K. Rowling had multiple, multiple
rejections before Harry Potter

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.710
was accepted.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.010 position:56%
So it's really one person's opinion.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.050
Jonathan Livingston
Seagull the same thing.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.670
And you could name
all these bestsellers.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:11.080
It's really one lousy person
in the publishing business.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.080
[Laughter]

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.860
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: So here
we're quite limited on time.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.820
I just wanted to see
if there was anything

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.320
that you wanted to
add to the questions.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.440
Any answer, any description
you're welcome to do it.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.140
And then we'll invite
Nancy to come up.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.440
&gt;&gt; Anthony Pitch: I
really don't have any,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.120
I'd rather respond to questions.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.370
But what you have coming
up now is marvelous.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.910
Nancy is a wonderful speaker.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.410
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: Thank you.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:48.130
[Applause] Thank you,
Tony, very much.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.130
Nancy, we're anxiously
waiting to hear

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.270
about the story of Joe Rubinstein.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.710
And if you could respond
to these questions as well

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.510
as you talk that would be great.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.030
&gt;&gt; Nancy Geise: Perfect.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.060
Well, thank you so much.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.450
I just first have to say thank
you, Gail, thank you Michlean.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.910
I'm so honored to be
here with Anthony Pitch.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.920
His book is marvelous.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.390
And, Anthony, I just
want to say thank you

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.590
on behalf of future generations.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:19.500
What you've done is a tremendous
gift so thank you very much.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.800
I'm so honored to be here.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.360
I came in from Topeka,
Kansas to be here.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.930
I think half the state of
Kansas knows that I'm here.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.400
And the other part I'm
making sure they do know.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.290
But I want to say thank you
for the opportunity to be

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.590
at the Library of Congress.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.930
It truly is one of the
greatest honors of my life.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.280
To share with you a little bit
about a truly remarkable man

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.250 position:56%
who survived -- can you hear me
okay, who survived really everything

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.770
that the Nazis tried to do
the Jews with the exception

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.690
of killing him which
they nearly did.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.400
So I'll try to answer some of the
questions and give you a little bit

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.370
of background on Joe
and how I met him.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.910
Because Joe was raised in a
town called Radom, Poland.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.180
He was born in 1920.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.510
And when he was five years
old his father passed away,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.550
and life got very, very difficult
at that point for his family.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.910
His mother was widowed
raising five children.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.750
And all the kids were
just incredible kids.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.510
They all did everything they could
to help keep food on the table.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.590
When Joe was 12 years old he would
go from school to then working

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:36.510
in a lumberyard to then after that
learning to make shoes at night.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:40.820
So they were just really
hardworking, loving, loving family.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.700
And when the Nazis
invaded, of course,

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.620
they moved all the Jewish people.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.310
There were about, I've
heard estimates anywhere

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:53.350
from 30,000 people moved into the
two ghetto areas of Radom, and Joe

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.230
and his family were among them.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.630
I first met Joe in 2007.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.930
It was rather unusual.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.870
And I'm a very unlikely
person to be standing here.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.180
I'm not Jewish.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.940
I'm certainly not a
Holocaust scholar.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.620
If you told me a few years ago

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.490
that I would be writing this story
I would have told you're crazy.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:14.310
That's not possible, certainly
not possible to be here.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.340
But I was working at a
retirement community in Ft.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.900
Collins, Colorado, and
Joe and his wife were two

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.490
of our first residents
that moved in.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:26.560
And one of my co-workers told me
that Joe was a Holocaust survivor.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.260
And so I asked him -- a while
later I saw a little portion

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.190
of his tattoo sticking
out from under his arm.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.900
He's got a tattoo that runs
the length of his forearm,

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.540
and he keeps it covered always.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.290
But I saw a portion of it
and asked him about it,

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.390
and he said it's from Auschwitz.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.480
And I said, Joe, our daughter
is majoring in history.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.860
Would it be okay if she interviewed
you for one of her classes.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.790
And Joe said, never.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.370
I will never talk about it.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.950
I didn't realize then that in

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.730
over 70 years he had
never shared his story.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.380
Even his family knew
just bits and pieces.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.070
It was so incredibly
painful for him.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.550
That was in 2007.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.230
And then I moved with my husband
to Topeka, Kansas, but Joe

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.530
and I remained really close.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.160
He's just a phenomenal man.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.890
He is the most joy filled
man I've ever known.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.190
And so we remained close.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.710
And I came back for a visit five
years after I first asked Joe

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.820
if I could write -- or if my
daughter could interview him.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.170
And I was back for a visit.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.210
I ran into Joe, and literally
out of the blue he said, Nancy,

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.870
I'd like to tell you my story.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.240
So I dropped everything.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.010
I went over to his house, and I
had no idea what it was I would be

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.310
writing or hearing.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.240
I thought maybe it would be a
little keepsake for his family.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.220
But as soon as he started
talking I knew

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.560
that this was a story the world
was going to want to hear.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.510
And it proved to be the case.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:53.500
I'm hearing from people
all over the world

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.230
about the impact Joe's
story is having on them.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:01.240
People are telling me that if Joe
overcame everything that he did

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.320
and did so with joy,
that they can deal

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.790
with whatever they're dealing with.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.940
I heard from somebody from New
Zealand a couple weeks ago.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.740
A German police officer contacted
me a couple weeks ago and told me

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.430
that because of Joe's story it's
changed his life, and he is vowing

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.590
that it never happen again.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.540
And I love that.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.440
So as Joe began to talk
he told me that he wanted

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.400
to get it all out once and for all.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.760
A to Z he told me, A to Z I'm
going to tell you everything.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.380
And he began with extraordinary
detail.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.870
Do you all remember the move The
Titanic, the fictional version?

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.710 position:56%
And they asked the very elderly Rose

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.660
at the very beginning tell
us anything you can remember.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.090
They don't think she'll
remember everything.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:52.370
And she says, I can still
smell the fresh paint.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.570
That was the detail that Joe
started telling me his story.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.270
He began like this.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:02.970 position:56%
It was four o'clock in the morning
and someone was pounding at my door.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.320
And I knew that someone pounding
at my door at four o'clock

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.430
on the morning could only mean
trouble, and I didn't want trouble.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.440
We had had so much trouble
since the Nazis had invaded.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.740
I wanted to go back to bed.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.070
I wanted to pretend none
of it was happening.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.260
But as the oldest male in the
house I knew it was up to me now

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.260
to handle what was on the
other side of that door.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.590
So I walked across the floor,

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.270
and my hand was trembling
as I reached for it.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.730
And as I opened the door two
German soldiers were standing there

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.790
with machine guns in hand
ordering me to come with them.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.130
And I told them but I
haven't done anything wrong.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.370
And they said you come with me.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.470
But I need to say goodbye
to my family.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.430
I need to change my clothes.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.540
They said you have
everything you need.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.300
And I looked down at my bare
feet, my sorts and my t-shirt,

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.010
and I thought everything I need?

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.330
And then they walked me outside
into the bitterly cold air,

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:02.830
and they put me on an open
air truck with no protection

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.330
where I would be huddled
with strangers.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.790
Several would die.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.950
And that's the detail that Joe
started telling me the story.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.480
And I was thinking, oh my
goodness, all I need to write

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.680
down his words and,
Joe, here's your story.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.350
And then a really strange
thing happened.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.820
So we went from that
detail, and he said,

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.970
and then they took me to Auschwitz.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.880
And while I was there I
worked in a coal mine.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.710
And then after that, after
the war I went to New York.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.900
And I jokingly said
I had A and I had Z

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.570
which Joe was said he was
going to tell me A to Z,

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.910
but I had nothing in between.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.840
And my next book is surely going

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.810
to be called getting
to Z. Because I did.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.330
I spent the next almost
three years trying to figure

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.520
out what happened in between.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.710
Because it was so incredibly
painful for Joe to share this.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.530
Seventy years he had tried
not to talk about it.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:02.100
Until he shared his story with me
he never told anyone what he did

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.070
to survive at Auschwitz.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:10.330
His job was moving the bodies
of the dead from the gas chamber

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.550
to the open pits, pushing them

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.520
in a wooden handcart all the
while praying for the souls

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.770
of those he pushed and praying

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:23.560
that he wouldn't find his
family among those dead.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.750
And until he shared his story
with me he never told anyone,

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.420
anyone that while at Auschwitz
he had been repeatedly

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.590
sexually assaulted.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.540
Seventy plus years he kept that
hidden and tight and closed.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.410
And that to me is also one of
the miracles of this story.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:45.240
Joe was so incredibly worried about
his family learning about this.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.570
His grandkids, they're adults
now, but one of them said

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:52.940
to him afterwards, grandpa,
I've never loved you more.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.500
And that was one of the greatest
blessings anyone could give

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.820
to their grandfather,
someone who felt

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.920
that if anyone knew
they may not love him.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.520
And it's such an important
lesson for all of us.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.180
So Joe was taken to Auschwitz.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.270
He arrived, and I thankfully
know this

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.870
because of the Holocaust
Museum, April 30, 1942.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:17.150
He was at Auschwitz over two
years proper before being taken

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.860
to several other camps:
Buchenwald, Ohrdruf and, finally,

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.140
right before the end of
the war Theresienstadt.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.060
Just before the end of the war Joe

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:31.050
and as the Soviet Army was
approaching that camp was in chaos.

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.400
The Red Cross was coming in.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.190
The Soviets were advancing.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.000
And Joe looked out one day

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.890
and he saw the Nazi guards
pulling civilian clothes

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.520
over their uniforms.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.990
And Joe said to the man next
to him, what's going on?

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.410
And they said it's over.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.380
They're going to hide.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.000
And suddenly there was
about two or three days

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.430
that there was just
chaos in the camp.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.110
Eventually it would be
quarantined and shut down.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.360
But for a couple days
the gates were just open,

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.510
and Joe said there was a sign
packed up saying you're free to go.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.350
And he was convinced
that if they walked

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.130
through that gate he would be shot.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.120
But he said I was so
sick I didn't care.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.920
I was going to die anyway.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:17.830
And he simply with the help of
two buddies walked out to freedom.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:23.950
And so while Joe's story is a
tremendous story of heartache,

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.890
he never knew when he
was taken from his home

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.360
that he would never again see
another member of his family.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.110
He had no idea that he would
never again return to Poland.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:35.620
He has never been back home.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.430
That's something you
could keep in your prayers

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.950
because Joe is struggling
with this decision.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.590
He would really like to
go, but he's also worried

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.840
about going as you can imagine.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.140
You could also keep in your prayers

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.210
that we could find a
photo of his family.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.880
Joe said he would give anything
for one photo of his family.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.010
He says he can remember the
faces of his brothers as clearly

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.570
as if it were yesterday, but
he can no longer remember his

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.400
mother's face.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.760
So I just know there's a
photo out there somewhere.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.790
So, please, if you know anyone who
could help us find it let me know.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.040
That would be a tremendous
gift we can give him.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.290
And Joe went on to live an
extraordinary life afterwards.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.700
You'll have to find out more.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.000
We don't have a lot of time.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.670
But just briefly immediately after
the war he didn't know where to go.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:21.970
He knew he couldn't
go back to Poland.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.380
He didn't have a dime to his name.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.710
He was sick.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:30.340
He lost everything a human
being can lose but his life.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.390
And his buddy next to him said, you
know, I'm Jewish, I'm from Germany,

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.890
I had a business before
the war, I'm going back.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.220
And, Joe, you should come
back with me until you heal

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.860
until you know what else to do.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.060
And so of all places Joe
went back to Germany or went

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.360
to Germany after the war.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.320
And he's standing on a street
corner one day and a man taps him

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.480
on the shoulder and says,
is that a Polish accent?

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.160 position:56%
And Joe said, yes, and the man said,
well, I'm from Poland originally,

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.560
although he had lived in
Germany during the war.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.920
And they got to talking,
and he said,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.630
would you like to come
to my home for dinner?

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.940
And Joe said, sure.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.060
And the man said and, by the
way, I have a beautiful daughter.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.110
Well, that beautiful daughter
and Joe have now been married

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.480
over 65 years, actually 68 years,

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.380
and she is a German Catholic,
married this Jewish man.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.680
And that's one of the
brilliant things

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.350
about Joe's story he tells everyone
I don't care what religion you are.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.770 position:56%
I don't care the color of your skin.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:24.670
We must love one another.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.770
And Joe lives that and
breathes that with every aspect

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:30.000
of his life including
who he married.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.350
And I think that's
one of the things,

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.270
the reason this story is
touching so many lives.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.450
It doesn't matter if people are
Jewish or Catholic or Protestant

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.790
or even Atheists are telling
me this was having an impact.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:43.350
And to me that's another
miracle of Joe's story.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.770
So he went on to New York.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.590
He had an extraordinary career.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.390
He became one of the
leading shoe designers

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.640
in New York if not the world.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.260
And he is just an incredibly,
joy filled man.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.730
He's 95 now.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:00.100
He looks like he's
75, acts like he's 75.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.540
He is incredible.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.900
And he just tells me
to tell everyone,

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.130
tell everyone, Nancy,
life is precious.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.360
It's the most precious
gift we have from God.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.110
We must love one another.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.640
We must love life.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.630
And we must love God.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:18.720
And he says that to
tell me to everyone.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.240
And so on behalf of
Joe I'm telling you.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.360
I'll stop there and see if
you have anymore questions.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.620
We're going to have a brief video.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.420
One thing I wanted to --
it's about nine minutes long.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.360 position:56%
And Joe's story is remarkable in
another sense in that just one thing

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.060
after another happened to save his
life, a little bit like Unbroken.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.770
One of those things, and he
talks about it just briefly,

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:48.880 position:56%
was at one point -- the inmates were
tattooed when they first got there.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.660
Joe said that he was brought back
in later with a group of people.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.840
And they were being tattooed
most of them with the triangle

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.180 position:56%
which was the sign for being Jewish.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.980
And for whatever reason the man
looking at Joe looked at him

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.150
and said, you know what,
you don't look Jewish to me,

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:09.250
whatever that means, and said
I'm not giving you that sign.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:12.700
And he put on instead of
a triangle he put on a V

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.410
which meant political prisoner.

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.910
And that designation, the
difference between a V

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:22.510
and a triangle was one line of ink.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:25.440
One stroke of ink saved Joe's life.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.280
They certainly knew Joe was Jewish.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.580
He wasn't a political prisoner.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.450
We have no idea how he
got that designation,

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:34.300
but all his documents say
Jewish political prisoner.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.630
And because of that he credits

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.780
that to having saved his
life, one line of ink.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.820
&gt;&gt; Joe Rubinstein: Life
is very precious, very.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:49.070
I love life and I always did.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:56.390
So I did not give it up no
matter what condition I was.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.150
Usually the [inaudible] for
the Jewish [inaudible] used

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.310
to put the David Star on.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:07.280
And the guy who did that he
said I'm not crucifying you.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:29.260
So he put that V on me.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:35.700 position:56%
I was blessed, you know [inaudible],
I'm sitting here 93 years old.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:41.600 position:56%
I have a beautiful family, beautiful
grandkids, and I worked all my life.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.340
I never was afraid of hard work.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.350
I was just a kid.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.710
Of course I'm scared.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.260
Who wouldn't be scared.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.750
Who wants to die?

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.430
Everybody wants to live.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:11.560
Well, I tell you when they took
me away I did not believe it

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.980
that they're going to --

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.180
I said they're going to
just ask me questions.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.900
I did not believe that
they're going to take me.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:24.860
Now, after I opened the door

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.990
and I [inaudible] the door forever
never to see my folks again.

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:35.550
I said that cannot
happen, it will not happen.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.460
We didn't do nothing wrong.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:42.500
Why? That was my question, why?

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:47.520
On the train you couldn't
help each other, you know.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.080
You just did.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.880
You were so jammed in.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.350
It was so hot, we had no air.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.950
So it was hot enough on
the train with the people.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:03.380
Everyday, everyday lots of bodies.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.430
Thousands of them.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.940
There were big, big
graves, big ones.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.770
And then they [inaudible]
and then the covered them.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:15.240
You could not survive.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.710
I knew that.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:20.770
I myself sometimes
was thinking about it.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.320
The people didn't want to suffer.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.370
They know they're going to die.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.570
They didn't want to die
and that [inaudible]

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.230
so they took their own lives.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.450
They went to the electric wire.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:39.130
That was the easiest way to
die, electrocute themself.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:43.180
[Inaudible], no, I wanted to live.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.840
You call it day-by-day,
living, day-by-day.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.790
You don't know if you're going

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.210
to survive another
night or another day.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:56.050
You figure you're next in line.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.500
When I was in camp
already I was thinking

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.920
about it what I'm going
to do when I get out.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.690
I have to do something.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.840
I have the most [inaudible]
shoes in my life.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.810
Wooden clogs.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:14.680
And I got blisters all over,
and I've got to walk with them.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.660
I said if you want
to kill me, kill me.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.660
I cannot go to work
with those shoes.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.050
And he said to me go in there

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.060
and I'll tell them you
give you other shoes.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.240
You happen to be a very nice
kid, you should not suffer.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.310
And I went in, and he gave the
orders to give me other shoes.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:35.500
There was a general which
was running the camp.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:42.270
He got the orders to kill
every one of us, all of them.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:48.000
Then he said, no, I'm
not going to do it.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.640
[Inaudible] then he opened the
camps, everybody is free to go.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.690
All us, anybody.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.480
And he told the soldiers not
to touch us, to leave us go,

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.970
the general who was in charge.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:09.520
That was already [inaudible]
the generals got beaten

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.000
for all [inaudible].

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.940
We didn't have no chance
of survival anyway.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:25.490
We went into the stores
[inaudible] get your clothing.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:33.620
We didn't have [inaudible]
they are naked.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.930
They were so afraid, they said
anything you want to take it.

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.230
It's yours to take.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.530
We know what you've been
through [inaudible].

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.830
I'm a survivor, you know?

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:45.440
And I said, well, I'm the only
one survivor of all of my family.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.960
And I have to fill out a
form where I'd like to go,

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.620
and I choosed the United States.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.540
&gt;&gt; Irene Rubinstein: When we
arrived, when we got off the ship,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.420 position:56%
I went down and I kissed the ground.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.690
And I said, thank God
I'm in the United States.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.190
And I was so happy.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.920
&gt;&gt; Joe Rubinstein: I wanted
to be a fashion designer.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:15.370
I met some people, and I
told them if I design shoes,

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.590
I'm a sketch designer in shoes.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.030
And the guy said, you
know what, I have somebody

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.330
who would love to have you.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.470
He gave me the address
and I went to see him.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.680
I came to see him, and I
said I don't speak English.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.580
You don't have to speak English.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.880
I will speak English.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.180
We speak for you.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.120
The sketch is what yo make.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.070
That is your ID.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.020
You don't have to speak English.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.300
That was the [inaudible]
foremost designer

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.600
with his sister [inaudible].

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.020
And then she hired me.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.410
She said I opened up another
place they call [inaudible],

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:59.100
and I want you to go over there to
see what you can do in that place.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.400
I went over there.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.780
They couldn't even make
20 pairs a day, boots.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:08.350
And I came in and said
everything has to be changed.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.470
You don't work this way.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:14.210
I say you're not going to punch
a clock and get paid for it.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:18.200
You've got to work for it piece
by piece and I will teach you,

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.390
every one of you, how to make more
money and to help your family.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:26.050
That's the way I was all
my life helping people.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.540
Believe in people.

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:33.970
That makes life more
rewarding and life for it

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:38.670
because you can still do things
for yourself and for others.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:44.970
That makes you feel
more excited and good.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:57.490
To give to somebody a gift,
help, that's the way I live

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:01.510
and I'm going to die by it.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:43:18.040
[ Music ]

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.030
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: Thank you so
much both of you for your responses

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.030
and for explaining the
works on your books.

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:31.680
I think that these presentations
only strengthen our understanding

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:37.170 position:56%
that we can fathom the life of one
person, we can understand one person

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:45.700 position:56%
when it's six million or even 358,
it's a little bit more difficult to.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:50.220
One little item about Joe that
Nancy and all that you mentioned

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:55.310
and you didn't say was that
Joe had an identical twin.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:44:01.760
And I cannot imagine, this must
have been so difficult for him

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.960
to lose his other siblings as
well, but his identical twin.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.000
So we're open now to questions.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.620
If you have any questions for
either of the speakers please.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.920
Yes, sir?

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.130
&gt;&gt; I have a question for Nancy.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.670
Nancy, you mentioned
Nazi invasion of Poland.

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:29.260
It was the German invasion of
Poland [inaudible] in German,

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.730
German soldiers, German
[inaudible], yes.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:36.170
I think that to call
names by the right name,

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:38.340
it was a German invasion to Poland.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.140
That's my comment.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.010
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: This is a
comment, not really a question.

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:47.110
The comment is that
mentioning the invasion

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:51.290
of Poland it was the
German invasion,

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:54.320
not the Nazi invasion of Poland.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.010
Did you want to comment on it?

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.310
&gt;&gt; Nancy Geise: No, thank you.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.550
I think that's an excellent point.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:01.590
I wanted to say one more thing.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.280
I forgot to mention about Irene.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.510
I said that her father was Polish.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.580
And they lived in Germany
there in the war,

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.900
but their time was
also very difficult.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.570
Her only sibling -- about
the time the Nazis knocked

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:18.330
on Joe's door also knocked
on their door in Germany,

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:22.160
accused her only sibling of
being a spy against the Nazis,

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.290
took him out and hung him.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.530
&gt;&gt; I've got a question.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.830
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: Yes?

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.410
&gt;&gt; What do each of you
plan for the future?

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.530
I know you're working
on another book.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.060
Nancy, are you going to be
working on another book?

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.820
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: So the question
is what will the authors be working

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.730
on now in the future?

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:46.050
Tony already has a book that
he's working on and, Nancy,

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:52.560
the question is for both of you.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.210
&gt;&gt; Tony Pitch: [Inaudible]
time to sum up.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:03.160
And I really think the survival of
the Jewish people is phenomenal.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.940
That's the first thing.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:08.560
So having written this
book I now want

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.860
to write something that's a
little bit less distraught

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:18.290
and less suffering in it.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:24.430 position:56%
I've writing now, the last two and a
half months I've written 160 pages.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:28.550
It's easy if you're 12
hours a day like me.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:33.240
And I'm writing now about a
true love story of World War I.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:37.400
A woman of 25 years old
was sent from Kansas City

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.520 position:56%
to occupied France by the Red Cross.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.370
And she became director
of entertainment

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.220
because the wounded soldiers

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:51.970
and the amputees needed
medication and also laughter.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:57.300
And at the same time a man
left, he was 26 years old,

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:03.420
left Brooklyn as a lieutenant, and
he was sent to occupied France.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:09.590
And he was very scared of being
in the combat zone, terrified.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:17.720
And he was awarded the [inaudible]
by the French for his bravery.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:23.050
I got letters from both of them
from the Library of Congress.

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:29.230
By sheer chance I looked through
2,000 names before I found theirs.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.860
And then I asked what,
if anything, they had.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.280
It was one box, and there
were 69 letters there.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.330
And then the family in Princeton
and Wisconsin opened up to me,

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.780
and the deluged me with documents.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:48.870
I hope it will come
out before the Library

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:55.740
of Congress has their exhibition
on World War I planned for 2017.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:00.540
But their experiences are
not only about this war,

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.350
the terrible facial wounds
and things like that,

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.130
his experiences in warfare.

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:11.750
Twice in one day he
was almost killed.

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:15.840
Once he was in a trench,
and a German soldier jumped

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.850
over with a bayonet
and tried to stab him.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:22.310 position:56%
They literally had hand-to-hand
combat before he plunged the bayonet

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.030
in his enemy.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.900
And then he was in the same
trench when the walls caved in

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.190
and he was buried alive almost.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:34.630
This telegram runner saw this,

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.070
went back to headquarters
and said he's dead.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:40.540
They sent a telegram to
his father in Brooklyn

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.660
from a state assemblyman, and
they said your son is dead.

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.260
And he walked around for two
hours wondering how he was going

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.680
to tell his wife.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.730 position:56%
And then he went back to the office,

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.510
and another cable came
and said he's alive.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:56.520
He hadn't told his mother.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.060
So his experiences
and her experiences.

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.740
Now, that's not the
end of the story.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:06.190
They came back on the same
ship and they met each other.

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:08.880
There were 4,000 people there,

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.040
and they met each other
and they married.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:17.340
And her fianc was waiting on
shore but he lost out, he lost out.

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:22.300
And they married and they had one
who became a world famous physicist

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.030
at Princeton, world
famous, died of leukemia.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:30.320
And his daughter and his
second wife are the people

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.700
who deluged me with information.

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.160
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: Well, that sounds

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.820
like a more upbeat
story of an awful war.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.430
I think that World
War I was overshadowed

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:47.270
by the horrible atrocities
of World War II.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:50.920
And there's a lot that needs to
be told still about World War I.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.230
So it's excellent that
you're doing that.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.530
Nancy?

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:56.830
&gt;&gt; Nancy Geise: Thank you.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.940
I have another book, but it's
long term off before I even really

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.240
start writing.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.160
Because when I write I can't
do much of anything else.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:07.230
And I really feel like I owe it
to Joe to do everything I can

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.620
to get the word about this book

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:11.510
out because I feel like
it is so important.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:15.530
And so I'm dedicating my time
to speaking about Joe's story.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.910
So if you have any other contacts
let me know around the world.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:20.580
I would love to speak there.

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:27.060
And I'd love to see it as a
movie someday and a documentary.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.360
So there's a lot of things.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.870
We are in production right
now for an audio book.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:32.170
And this was so cool.

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.410
About three weeks ago I
was in Colorado with Joe.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.980
We took him into this
recording studio.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.430
We were able to record Joe
reading his opening quotes

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.490
at the beginning of every chapter.

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:45.720
So I think that will be
really powerful as well.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.120
Because without a driving force
behind somebody behind a book they

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.650
don't do much.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:56.980
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if any of
you have had a personal face-

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.170
to-face confrontation with someone

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:03.890
who is a known Holocaust
denier and what happened.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.420
Or if it hadn't happened what
do you think might happen?

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:11.080
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: The
question is about any interface

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.330
with the Holocaust denier.

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:18.940 position:56%
I know Nancy has a story about that,
and perhaps Tony has in addition

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:23.030
to what he already said
about the French neo-Nazi.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.330
Nancy?

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:27.310
&gt;&gt; Well, it was interesting.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:31.040
After we recorded Joe's
voice for the audio book,

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.050
I posted it on Facebook what
a neat experience that was.

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.100
And some woman, not a Holocaust
denier, but someone posted

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:42.580 position:56%
on my Facebook, my profession
Facebook page, that, oh, that woman,

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.660
meaning me, was just
making this all up.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.650
That Joe is really dead.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:48.510
That he's been dead a long time.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:49.810
That there's no such thing

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:53.020
as a 95 year old Holocaust
survivor from Auschwitz.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.450
And so I took that
down from the site.

00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:01.690 position:56%
And I just posted saying that anyone
who denies the Holocaust happens

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:03.990
or denies that Joe
is anything but alive

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:05.860
and well will not permitted
on this site.

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:11.540
Because to do otherwise would be a
disservice and would be very awful

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:15.540
for the memory of all those who
lost their lives including Joe's

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:16.840
whole family.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.140
So I just won't allow that.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.610
But it was kind of
funny because right

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.980
after that we were
at a party with Joe.

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.270
It was a going away party for
my parents who actually lived

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:25.750
in the same neighborhood.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:28.920
And so we were able to record
some fun video of saying, now,

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.400
does Joe look dead to you?

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:36.990
And he kept saying, no, I'm
alive and I'm well, and he is.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:43.870
&gt;&gt; Anthony Pitch: I tell you
when this book came out I wrote

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:47.260
to the Southern Poverty Law Center

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.190
and also the Simon
Wiesenthal Center.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:53.670
And I said I want to address Nazis.

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:57.880
And I really was serious about it.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.970
And they both said to me don't.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:03.670 position:56%
First of all you won't get an
invitation, and if you do they'll be

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:05.040
after you and your family.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.140
Now, I didn't mind if
they came for me because,

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.580
as I said, I had a good life.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.880
But my family I wasn't
prepared for that.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.700
So I dropped that.

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.120
But I want to leave
you with one subject.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:23.800
This is not about horror,
it's about heritage.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:29.000
And the people who deny the
Holocaust happened they probably

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.080
haven't opened a book before.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.790
They don't only live in
the hills of Appalachia

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:36.040
but they're all over the place.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:40.940
And this really is a
reputation of these people.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:48.120
The Jews have always survived
bequeathing a triumphant heritage

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.420
of endurance.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:53.870
And the stories in my book testify
to this everlasting resilience.

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:57.850
I phoned a fellow in Switzerland
just before his death last year,

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:02.100
and he said to me,
he was a survivor,

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:08.480
if the Holocaust never
happened where is my family?

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.180
And so the deniers are the people

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.800
who really are the
scum of the earth.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.810
They were not there.

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:18.550
They haven't researched it.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:20.500
They haven't talked
to the survivors.

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.920
How can they possibly know
what these people endured?

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.720
&gt;&gt; Nancy Geise: And I was going
to say one more point to that.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.890
There are people right now
that deny 9/11 ever happened.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.440
A hundred years from now can
you imagine there will be a lot

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.090
of people denying that
ever happened.

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:38.210
People like to deny
that evil exists.

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:41.360
Evil does exist.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.660
&gt;&gt; Michlean Amir: Unfortunately.

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:46.080
One more question.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.380
Anyone have another question?

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.520
All right, well, the authors
will remain around here

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.020
if you'd like to speak with them.

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.570
And, again, thank you
very much for coming.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:59.170
Gail, this was a very
successful program.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:03.720
Thank you very much for having us.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.020
[Applause]

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:08.200
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
