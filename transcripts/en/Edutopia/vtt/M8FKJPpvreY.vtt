00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Wait should I clear out this?

00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:10.596
&gt;&gt;Jodi: I numbered the
lines in your tribute poems.

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:14.146
When somebody is giving you feedback,
they can name the specific line number.

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:19.126
&gt;&gt;Student: I like stanza one, because it
has really strong figurative language.

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:21.516
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Because our students
participate in critique protocol,

00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:25.876
they have the opportunity to really
understand what quality looks like,

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:28.976
and to define for themselves their
expectations for achieving it.

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:42.326
&gt;&gt;Elaine: Starting as early as
preschool, the culture of revision

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:47.156
and of learning together is
better, is what sets up students

00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:50.836
to be very proficient in their
ability to receive critical feedback

00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:51.976
and to give critical feedback.

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.026
&gt;&gt;Anne: I have a couple
of your friends' work.

00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:58.326
&gt;&gt;Sylvia: Today in class
we looked at our work

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:01.296
to see if we could fix anything.

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:04.366
&gt;&gt;What are our rules
when we are critiquing

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.316
and making our friends' work better.

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:07.046
Yes?

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:09.576
&gt;&gt;Don't feel like, "I hate your work."

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:10.086
&gt;&gt;Very good.

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:10.976
We should always be...?

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:12.196
&gt;&gt;Kind.

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:12.636
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:16.076
&gt;&gt;Jessica: The rules of critique,
be kind, be specific and be helpful,

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.746
apply to all of the work
we do with critique.

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:21.586
&gt;&gt;Anne: First we're going
to look at Jessica's work.

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:23.236
&gt;&gt;We looked at one student's work.

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:29.466
The task itself was to use measurement
descriptions to order a number

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.946
of animals, like insects and arachnids.

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:37.386
&gt;&gt;So she read that it was half the
weight of the rose haired tarantula.

00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:41.526
&gt;&gt;We looked at her work and we talked
about, wow, how is this really strong?

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:43.136
&gt;&gt;What did Jessica do?

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:47.486
&gt;&gt;Student: She drew pictures
and she labeled them.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.666
&gt;&gt;Anne: Interesting.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:52.306
&gt;&gt;Jonas: You can learn more about it

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:55.846
and you're teaching others
about what you learned.

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:59.176
&gt;&gt;Anne: What could she do
to make that even clearer?

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:03.176
&gt;&gt;The way that I think about a
critique is, it's back and forth.

00:02:03.286 --> 00:02:07.256
I'm going to give you some feedback on
how you can make your work more clear,

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:08.976
but I'm also getting
really good ideas from you.

00:02:10.156 --> 00:02:10.836
&gt;&gt;Student: She could put...

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:12.896
&gt;&gt;Anne: Things that are...

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.226
&gt;&gt;Student: Lighter and the
top, and write the things

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:16.646
that she needed to write up there.

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:18.666
&gt;&gt;Anne: It shows them
that, no matter what,

00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:20.466
people should learn from their work.

00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:22.736
You can learn from other people's work

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:29.716
and there's always the
potential to make it even better.

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:32.346
&gt;&gt;And what are the measurement words?

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:33.766
&gt;&gt;Students: Lighter and heavier.

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:36.006
&gt;&gt;Jessica: I think there are a number of
ways that you could approach critique.

00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.766
One is to use a high quality piece
of work and have kids observe it

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:41.386
and make comments about it.

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:43.846
And then there's peer to peer critique.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.926
&gt;&gt;Student: I feel like we need to add
a little bit more rhyming scheme to it.

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:49.556
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I've been doing critiques
since my first year at Two Rivers.

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:52.816
In seventh grade, you're on
a deeper level of critiquing.

00:02:52.816 --> 00:02:54.356
You're like, more specific.

00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:55.896
&gt;&gt;Jodi: Marcus, what are we doing today?

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:57.726
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I can give
and receive feedback

00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:00.146
to improve my peers' tribute
and my group's tribute.

00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:04.806
&gt;&gt;Jodi: Okay, so think about the guiding
question of, how can this poem show

00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:06.926
and describe rather than just tell?

00:03:07.726 --> 00:03:12.926
&gt;&gt;Having a very detailed, concrete
structure really makes sure

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:16.416
that students sit with
the work and analyze it.

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:22.046
&gt;&gt;Wynne: So my tribute poem is
on the real story of slavery.

00:03:22.546 --> 00:03:24.386
My poem's in draft three.

00:03:25.026 --> 00:03:29.346
We're getting critique right now so we
can move onto draft four and eventually,

00:03:29.346 --> 00:03:31.816
I believe, draft five
will be our final product.

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:35.136
&gt;&gt;Student: I still think throughout
the poem, you should give like,

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:37.726
more detail about like,
who she was, because--

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:39.256
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I know that by the hard work,

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.896
I'll end up with a really
high quality piece,

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:43.956
because my friends are here to help me.

00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:46.876
&gt;&gt;Student: We need to
make a stronger ending.

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.216
&gt;&gt;Jessica: You're asking
them to do a lot more work.

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:51.646
You're asking them to keep thinking,
and you're basically changing the idea

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:52.976
of what it means to be
done with something.

00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:54.906
&gt;&gt;Student: It adds flow.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:56.836
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.696
&gt;&gt;Elaine: Our students work very
hard here at Two Rivers to ensure

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:03.606
that their craftsmanship is really
on point, to best convey their ideas.

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:07.506
And their ability to participate in
critique just gets better and better.

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:09.786
&gt;&gt;Jodi: See, you just came
up with a great suggestion.
