1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,160
Okay. So we saw last time
that Louis wasn't so dumb.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,380
He knew about her and Shaw's Theorem,
but he thought that so,

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,980
but he's still thought there was an
octet of electrons around the nucleus.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,510
How could he think such a thing? Because
if you have inverse square force laws,

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,900
you can't have a static positions of
charge things unless they're right on top

6
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:27,360
of one another or blown apart.
So what did he think

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,480
that it's not an inverse square force law.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,990
That cool ohms law breaks down when
you get to various small scale.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,260
And Jj Thomson thought the same thing
and wrote here this two terms here.

10
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:47,660
The first one is that is cool ohms law
indeed, but there's this other thing,

11
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:52,530
c over r. So as long as our is
very big, you don't compare,

12
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:55,140
but you don't care about that term.
Right?

13
00:00:55,141 --> 00:01:00,141
As long as it's very big compared to c
and c is a distance that something like

14
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:03,210
the size of atoms.
So once our,

15
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,090
once the distance of the things that
are interacting with one another,

16
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,230
the electron and the nucleus
say once they get near,

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,730
near the distance, see then this, this uh,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,730
sorry,
got the back there,

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,010
then this c over r thing becomes
significant if our becomes very small,

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,980
right? And even changes the sign, right?

21
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,110
So what was attractive becomes repulsive.

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,700
So that would do okay then
for a structure, right?

23
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,800
That was in 1923 in 1926
just three years later,

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,040
quantum mechanics came along and showed
that cool ohms law was just fine.

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,140
Nothing wrong with cool ohms
law. It goes to much, much,

26
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:50,850
much tend to the 20th smaller distances
than the size of Adam's cool ohms.

27
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,040
Law Still Works,
right?

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,460
What was wrong was the way they treated
kinetic energy because kinetic energy,

29
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:03,780
quantum mechanics reformulates
so it gives you electron clouds.

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,370
And so what's a cloud is
not the positive charge.

31
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,790
Remember Jj Thomson had a positive sphere
of electricity in which he embedded

32
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,720
the electrons.

33
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,170
What's a cloud is the electrons
and nuclei are put in it to make,

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
to make molecules. Right?
So it's, it really is.

35
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:26,100
He was right about Blumberg writings.
He just had the charges backwards.

36
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,310
Not many people give him credit for that.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,720
So cubic octets of Louis and ad hoc
electrostatic force law like this see over

38
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,110
our term in there,

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,880
soon disappeared from Conventional
Chemistry and physics immediately.

40
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,940
In fact,
I mean within a month say okay.

41
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,630
But the idea of shared pairs and lone
pairs that Lewis came up with remained

42
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:56,550
useful tools for discussing
structure and bonding. Right?

43
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,480
So we still do them.

44
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:01,270
And that's why you did problems today
that had to do with that? Yes, Nico,

45
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,563
yes.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,780
Yeah. But I won't do it for a week.
Still does. It takes a little while.

47
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,420
Okay.
Okay.

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,440
So Earnshaw said there's no structure
of minimum energy for point charges,

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,870
right?
That is no classical one.

50
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:25,170
But if you come to quantum mechanics
and fiddle around with kinetic energy,

51
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:29,820
then you can get it. Okay.
But despite Earnshaw,

52
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,980
might Lewis have been right?

53
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,410
Might there still be shared
pair bonds and lone pairs?

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,630
What are bonds? Okay. And that's
what we're going to try to find out.

55
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,380
And how do you know or how do you know,

56
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,150
how are we going to know whether their
electron payers and whether that are

57
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:55,920
shared between Adams and lone pairs
on on Adams? How can we find out?

58
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,990
All right, you got to do an
experiment. So what kind of experiment?

59
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:06,800
Now these experiments are tough.
Why are the experiments tough?

60
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,500
Cause things are, well
we, we, we could see our,

61
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:16,220
we could feel whether these
electron pairs are there, right?

62
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,440
But there's a problem as you say,
that it's inconceivably small.

63
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,630
The thing we're looking
for to see or to feel okay,

64
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,710
but does it really inconceivable
how small they are?

65
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,500
I mean when I was in your place,
everybody thought,

66
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,990
yeah there is conceivably
small, we'll forget it. Right?

67
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,350
But there are more recent techniques that
suggest that you can really see things

68
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:45,960
that small. You're at least you
can think about them clearly. Okay.

69
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,850
Now the first idea of seeing
them came from this book here.

70
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,350
Actually this book was published a look,
this is a third edition of the book.

71
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,340
The first edition was 19 nine,
and the second was 19, 19.

72
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,240
And this is the, uh, third
edition, which is still in print.

73
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:08,540
You can go on the web and buy this baby,
a cult chemistry,

74
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:13,541
a series of clairvoyant observations on
the chemical elements by Annie Bessant

75
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:14,960
and Charles Leadbeater.

76
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,690
So these are the occult chemists who
started practicing their trade in 1895.

77
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,570
A Bishop Charles Webster or led beater.

78
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,240
He was a bishop of the
church he founded that had,

79
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,890
he was the head bishop there were like,
um,

80
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,280
a hundred bishops and 500
members of the religion. Uh,

81
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,240
this is Annie Bessant who is one of
the most interesting people in all of

82
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,490
history.
Uh,

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,420
they closed the stock exchange in
India when she, the day she died,

84
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,070
for example,
this is her,

85
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,840
the outfit she designed to
lead the boy scouts in, in, uh,

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,330
in India. And she, uh,

87
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,170
she also proposed marriage
to George Bernard Shaw.

88
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,720
There are all sorts of interesting
things about Annie Bessant,

89
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:02,600
but one of the thing we're interested
in is that she could see Adams

90
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,060
and then they're,
they're a helper who became leader of the,

91
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,160
of the operation later on
was Gina Raja Dasa. Okay,

92
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,200
so this is a page from this book,

93
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,800
from the paper that became the book in
1895 which shows what they could see for

94
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:25,670
hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Now
there are a number of levels here.

95
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,530
The very lowest phase is
solid, h, o, n, then liquid,

96
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,820
then gas. So this is what, when
they went into sort of a trance,

97
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:38,510
they could see right that this is the gas,

98
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,160
but then there's a therial for
ethereal three ethereal too,

99
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:47,780
and the theorial one phases as well,
that with higher and higher resolution,

100
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:50,150
you can see these. So these, for example,

101
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:54,050
these little dots that you see
here are what get blown up here.

102
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,050
And the little things inside
this are what get blown up here.

103
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,820
And the things inside
this get blown up here.

104
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,200
And the things inside this are this.
And that's the same for all atoms.

105
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:07,120
That's the fundamental
unit. Okay? So here's,

106
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:10,720
here's hydrogen at the
gas resolution level.

107
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,750
So their wheels in wheels in wheels here.

108
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,070
And here's what oxygen looks like.
It's these little Heela CS,

109
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,763
okay?

110
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,950
And now that's the thing,

111
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:26,930
you finally get to the thing called
[inaudible] and that they actually ripped

112
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:29,870
off from this book,
the principals of color,

113
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,070
which was published in America
in 1878 by Edwin d Babbitt.

114
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,810
And here's his picture of this thing.
And Lo and behold,

115
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:43,220
that's what they saw as the
fundamental constituent of matter.

116
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:47,240
It's fun to look at in detail. You can
look at it that the web if you want to.

117
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,250
They also has pictures of,

118
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,940
of the Angel of innocence here and uh,

119
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,190
the psycho magnetic curves
around in your head, okay?

120
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,200
Okay. Now, Lo and behold,

121
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,800
the real confirmation of this thing was
that if you counted up the anu in the

122
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:14,330
different elements, there were
18, I knew in hydrogen, uh,

123
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:17,630
290 and oxygen and 261 and nitrogen.

124
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,080
And if you divide that by 18,
you get the atomic weights.

125
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,930
Que E d.

126
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,060
Okay?

127
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,260
Okay, so they have pictures in this book
of a bunch of the Adams. This is helium,

128
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,880
which has 72 all new.

129
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,420
This is lithium was 127 on new,
not the bottom part. This is the,

130
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,490
this is a model and this is
the wooden base it sits on.

131
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,710
Here's iron thousand and eight Anu.

132
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,750
Here's neon 360 on new.
Now look at neon.

133
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,913
Yeah.

134
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,980
And that is a four f orbital electron
density calculated by quantum mechanics.

135
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,450
Now the question is why would you believe
me or believe a textbook or believe a

136
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:14,720
quantum mechanicians and not believe them?

137
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,600
Because they said they
saw it too. Okay, well,

138
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,880
it takes time that we've
talked about this before.

139
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:27,620
The basis for scientific belief evidence,
you always cross examine an assertion,

140
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,890
logic and taste,

141
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,580
but taste matures with experience and
at the beginning you don't know which

142
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:36,380
people to believe in which not to believe.

143
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,700
That's a problem in politics too.
Okay?

144
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,320
There's sodium 418 they not
only said they saw Adam's,

145
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:49,980
they also saw molecules.
For example,

146
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,280
here is sodium carbonate.
What do you see in there?

147
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,180
Right? Two sodiums, right? Okay.

148
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,500
In the back are pieces of a carbon atom.
What else do you see?

149
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,181
Ah,

150
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:10,710
there are three oxygen heela sees wrapped
around the sodium and the carbon and

151
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:15,711
they wrote note that this triangular
arrangement of o three has just been

152
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:20,160
deduced by Bragg from his
ex-ray analysis of calcite.

153
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,420
We'll talk about brag and what
he was doing next time, right?

154
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,600
But they have experimental evidence
that supports what they're reporting

155
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,650
independent experimental evidence.
Okay,

156
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,490
here's their model of benzene
and they say about that.

157
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,700
Each of the three valence as of each
carbon are satisfied by hydrogen and the

158
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:45,940
fourth veil and see which some of
postulated as going to the interior of the

159
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:50,170
molecule does actually do so.
In fact,

160
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,090
Annie Bessant was the first woman to get
a degree in chemistry at the University

161
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,680
of London,
but that's another story.

162
00:10:56,681 --> 00:11:01,681
Her teacher was the guy who translated
dust copy towel into English and had a

163
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:06,610
lot other nefarious things that he did.
Uh,

164
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,190
questions six we'll have to do with that.
Okay,

165
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:12,100
so here's benzene and its resonance.

166
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:15,280
These were structures that
were first early proposed.

167
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,750
We'll talk about that later on,

168
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,880
but some people didn't like this idea of
going back and forth between two things

169
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,410
and they thought that you just have the
fourth valence of every carbon going

170
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:30,370
into the middle, right.
All satisfying one another.

171
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,080
So this was, this was what they said,
that their model confirmed that the law,

172
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,720
the fourth valence of every
carbon goes into the middle.

173
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,730
Okay. Uh, needless to say,
most people nowadays think,

174
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,650
don't think too much of a cult chemistry.

175
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:48,690
Even if you can still buy the book online.
Okay.

176
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,650
This portal you came through this morning,

177
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,210
it says a 1921,

178
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,620
but here's the same place in 1923
when the building was dedicated,

179
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:06,400
then you notice those plaques weren't
carved yet. It didn't say erected in 1921,

180
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,680
they were still finished in the building.
At the time,

181
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:13,120
the American Chemical Society had their
national meeting here to celebrate the

182
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:16,090
biggest academic building
for chemistry in the world.

183
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,940
Okay. So the slates, we're clean now.

184
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,030
If you go down into the crowd here,
you'll see some interesting people.

185
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:28,060
For example, there's Jia
and Lewis with his, uh,

186
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,930
with his Philippines cigar in his hand.
He always had his ear.

187
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,850
He smoked 17 cigars a day,

188
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,350
grown.
Okay.

189
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,330
But they were trying to decide how to
decorate all these plaques around the

190
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:47,770
building and they wanted to put the
names of distinguished American chemists.

191
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,700
Had they done that,

192
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,880
it would be pretty much a disaster
because the people who were thought to be

193
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,020
distinguished American chemists in
those days were not so hot actually in

194
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:56,854
retrospect,

195
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,990
but they chose a wonderful group and
the idea came from Joseppe Bruni from

196
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:06,580
Velonia who had came to, who had come
to the meeting to speak and he said,

197
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,990
don't put living chemists
there. Okay. Put dead chemists.

198
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,080
And that's what they did.
In almost all cases they were dead.

199
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,550
And it's a wonderful group as we've
already used Farah Day, remember?

200
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,051
Okay,

201
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:24,620
here's one of them that's over in that
corner of the building and Van Hoff you

202
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,980
have you heard of Anton [inaudible]?

203
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,480
You'll have heard a lot of him by the
end of this semester. And Gibbs. Yeah,

204
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,040
it gives,
we'll talk about him too.

205
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,650
And men delay if you've
turned who've heard of,

206
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,040
but I suspect that crux
is not so familiar to you.

207
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,620
This is Sir William Crookes,

208
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:46,621
who was fellow of the Royal Society
and and fts in 1861 he discovered the

209
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:53,980
element thallium. He also developed a
cathode ray tube, which is holding there,

210
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,330
which you know, became the X-ray tube
and he invented the Crooks radiometer.

211
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,180
I bet every one of you have seen
a crooks radiometer. Do you know

212
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,780
there's a picture of a crux radiometer
to measure the intensity of light by how

213
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,650
fast it spins.

214
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:12,490
You've seen these things you
buy in novelty stores and
sit there and spin in the

215
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:14,260
light.
Okay.

216
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,150
From 1913 to 1916 he was
president of the Royal Society.

217
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,370
The same thing that was
founded back by Boyle.

218
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,430
Remember in Robert Hooks and those guys
in 1898 he was president of the British

219
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,060
Association for the advancement of
science and he was also in that year

220
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,530
president of the Society for
psychical research. Right.

221
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:39,790
And fts is fellow of the
theosophical society,

222
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,160
right? It is. It is a presidential
lecture to the British Association.

223
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:46,600
For the advancement of science.

224
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,260
One of the things he said was telepathic
research does not yet enlist the

225
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:55,190
interest of the majority of
my scientific brethren. Okay.

226
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,730
But he's the guy who supplied the
samples for the four Leadbeater and,

227
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,570
and, uh, Bessant to look at. He supplied
them with lithium, chromium, selenium,

228
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,940
titanium, vanadium, Boron,

229
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:15,050
and beryllium samples so that they could
draw these pictures of what they saw by

230
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:19,190
clairvoyance. So you can read more
on the web if you want to about him.

231
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:22,040
He's an interesting character and
there were a lot of semi, well,

232
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,570
really serious scientists.

233
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:27,560
Oliver Lodge was another one who invented
radio and was head of the physics

234
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,150
department at Bristol,
I think,

235
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,050
who was into communicating with
the dead and stuff like that.

236
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,160
So it wasn't obvious at the beginning
who you should believe and who you

237
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,130
shouldn't believe,
right.

238
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,750
But to get back to the point and
forget clairvoyance for awhile,

239
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,390
which I don't believe
in, uh, the question is,

240
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:52,391
are molecules and observably small
for what Newton called Vulgar eyes?

241
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,780
Is there no way we can see something
and major at that? That's that small?

242
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,430
So consider water.
Uh,

243
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,920
a cubic centimeter of water is
an 18th of a mold since, uh,

244
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,070
the, uh, molecular weight is 18,

245
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,490
that means it's six 18 says times 10
to the 23rd molecules in a cc of water.

246
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,790
Now,
that's a really,

247
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:21,320
really big number and it sounds like
they must be just impossibly small,

248
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,330
hopeless to try to see such a thing.

249
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,460
But the difference is between
the cube and the cube root.

250
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,930
Because when we measure distance,
we made your linear not volume.

251
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,000
So to get something about distances,
you take the cube root of the volume.

252
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,730
So if we take the cube root of that,

253
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,640
it's about three times 10 to the seventh.
Now that's still a very big number.

254
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,070
30 million,
right?

255
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,140
But it's not impossibly
small that it's about three.

256
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:59,030
Onx drums is this dimension the
size of a water molecule. Remember,

257
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,980
we'll talk a lot about a carbon bond,

258
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,850
carbon carbon bond being about
one and a half on streams.

259
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,980
Okay, now think about
10 to the fifth. Okay,

260
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,200
so this lecture room is
about 10 meters wide, okay?

261
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,570
One of my hairs is order of
magnitude 100 microns in diameter.

262
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,880
And that's a ratio of 10 to the fifth,
right?

263
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:29,420
So 10 to the fifth of my hair's
sideways would go across this room.

264
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,090
So that's a lot,
right?

265
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,770
But it's not impossible to think of
lining up pairs to go across the room or

266
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:38,870
putting them side by side to take a while.

267
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,550
But it's not impossible to
think about that. The hair
compared to the room. Right.

268
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,090
But a molecule is about a nano meter and
a small Adam is about a 10th of a nano

269
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:54,000
meter or an onstar. Right. And
that ratio is 10 to the fifth.

270
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,540
So the room to my hair is like my
hair to a molecule or even an atom.

271
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,990
Right? A Big Adam. So it's not
impossibly small, it's just very,

272
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:07,920
very small.

273
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,153
Okay.

274
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,310
In fact, the nucleus is
10 femto meters, right?

275
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,530
Which is another 10 to the fifth
down. So that means if, if the,

276
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,170
the room where the lecture room,
we're an atom,

277
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,330
the nucleus would be the diameter
of a hair. Right. Very small,

278
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,530
but not impossibly small to conceive of.
Okay.

279
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,350
Now Newton in optics,

280
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:39,060
the book we looked at before
in 1717 wrote on page three 69,

281
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,420
the thickness of the plate where it
appears very black is three eighths of the

282
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:47,520
1,000 thousandth part of an inch

283
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,830
is that means he knew the size of it.

284
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,930
Now how big is three eighths of the
1,000 thousandth part of an inch? Well,

285
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,110
1,000 thousand is a million,
right?

286
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,440
Three eighths of a millionth of
an inch is 30 water molecules.

287
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,870
So Somehow Newton was able
to measure something in 1717.

288
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,450
That was the size of 30 water molecules.

289
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,920
Now what tool

290
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,280
could Newton possibly have had in 1717
that allowed him to measure something.

291
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:23,730
So very small.

292
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,383
What?

293
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,970
I can't hear very well.
Glass Springs. Ah Right,

294
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,420
that's right. Okay. So
here it is. Newton's rings,

295
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:41,630
which really should be called hooks
rings because he's the guy that had

296
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:45,200
micrographia that published why?
How they work.

297
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,190
But remember they had different
light theories. So here are two,

298
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,320
two pieces of glass

299
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,370
to glass and I'll change the light.
So we see light through it.

300
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,700
And, uh, now I can't
remember which is which.

301
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,750
But let me guess that if I put this
one over here, having turned it over

302
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,230
that press on it. So let's see.

303
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,140
Okay. Oh, I can see it here.
Can you see? Yeah, you can see,

304
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,940
see those patterns you've seen things like
that with microscopes. Slides, colors.

305
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,470
Okay. So these are two
flats against one another.

306
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:28,670
They get very close to one another.
But if I turned the top one over,

307
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,100
yeah,

308
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,050
you see that it's a little bit, uh,
let me, so that's what we just saw.

309
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,680
But notice that if I turn it over,

310
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,140
there's a little there,

311
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,500
there turns out here at the edge to be
a little bit of a gap because the top,

312
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:51,501
when it's just very slightly curved and
now let me see if I can see something

313
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:56,080
here. Can't see it yet.
Let me just zoom in

314
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,340
and we're going to need to focus on that.

315
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,900
Yeah, I know. Let's
watch. Ah, see that thing,

316
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,883
do that.

317
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,380
I need help. Will you come up and
help me? So you need to zoom in.

318
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,740
Well, I, well I'm trying to
keep that thing in the middle.

319
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,210
It's right. See it says
zoom plus over here. Yes.

320
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,650
Okay. Is there a not it. Okay. There.

321
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,290
Now the, the auto focus is zooming in and
out on this back. We've lost it. Okay.

322
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,550
Uh, let me try something
here. Oh, you see it

323
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,903
there?

324
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,330
Okay. So, so here's what you're seeing

325
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,790
in the middle is what's
called Newton's rings.

326
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,170
They look like that different colors.
Right.

327
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,560
And Newton could measure the thickness
of the air gap that caused different

328
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:11,570
colors.
The colors repeat right in higher orders.

329
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,760
Okay.
Now,

330
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:18,761
how could he know the distance so he
could associate every color with a

331
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:22,640
distance?
How could he know the distance?

332
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,030
Yeah,

333
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,730
because he could measure
the diameter of the rings.

334
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,050
Yeah.

335
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,870
And he said this observation six,

336
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,550
the diameter of the sixth ring, right?
One, two, three, four, five, six.

337
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,930
At the most lucid part of its
orbit was 58 hundredths of an inch.

338
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,970
And the diameter of the sphere on which
the double convex object glass was

339
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:51,420
ground was about 102 feet.
Hence,

340
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:55,500
I gathered the thickness of the air or
aerial interval of the glasses in that

341
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:59,700
ring. So in other words, here's
the air gap is trying to measure,

342
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:02,880
which is the sixth ring out,
right?

343
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,220
He knows the diameter of that ring.

344
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,350
He knows that they touch in the
middle of the two glasses, right?

345
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,730
And he knows that it's a sphere
and it has a radius of 51 feet.

346
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,950
So he can just use trigonometry
to figure out that the air gap,

347
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,320
if he knows that angle there,

348
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,330
the air gap is a 1.8 microns,
right?

349
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,730
So that's a lot bigger than a Adam.

350
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,380
But if you go into the first ring or even
closer, then you can measure it, right?

351
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,740
So all he needed was a spherical
glass with a very large radius,

352
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:43,860
and he could measure these distances,
okay,

353
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:48,861
but here's the simpler of an even
smaller distance about 100 years later.

354
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,470
And here's the guy who did it.
You know who that is?

355
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,900
Benjamin Franklin, of course, we'll
get back to the artists later on.

356
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,840
So he published in the philosophical
transactions of the royal society in 1774.

357
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:13,390
This society is now 100 years,
110 years old,

358
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,740
114 hundred and 14 years old.
Uh,

359
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,730
this article on the stilling
of waves by means of oil.

360
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,480
Can you see what that means?

361
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,040
What's that related to a common saying,

362
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,100
pouring oil on troubled waters,
if you heard of that one.

363
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,080
So the stilling of waves by means of oil
extracted from sundry letters between

364
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:46,540
Franklin and Brownrigg.
Okay,

365
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,960
so he wrote to Brownrigg 1773 I had
when a youth red and smiled at plenty's

366
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:58,141
account of a practice among the semen
of his time to still the waves and the

367
00:24:58,361 --> 00:25:03,361
storm by pouring oil into the c l as well
as the use made of oil by the divers.

368
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,930
Pearl divers would fill their mouth
with oil and when they went down,

369
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,000
if a breeze came up and
ruffled the surface,

370
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:13,000
which made it hard to see because the
light wouldn't come through clearly,

371
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,510
then they'd let oil out of their mouths.
It would float to the surface,

372
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:19,030
stop the ripples and they
could see to get their pearls.

373
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,680
This is what plenty said. Right?
But he said he smiled at that.

374
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,490
But a quaint thing to think,
right. It's like the like the uh,

375
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,620
a cult chemists.
I think that it is been of late,

376
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:37,270
too much the mode to slight
the learning of the ancients,

377
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,790
the learner to are apt to slight too
much the knowledge of the vulgar.

378
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,770
Right in 1757 being at sea and a fleet
of 96 sale bound against Louis Burgoff,

379
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,460
Cape Breton Island,

380
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,980
I observed the wakes of two of the ships
to be remarkably smooth while all the

381
00:25:56,981 --> 00:26:00,310
others were ruffled by the wind,
which blew fresh.

382
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,920
Being puzzled with the
differing appearance.

383
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:06,910
I at last pointed that out to our
captain and asked him the meaning of it.

384
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,650
The cooks said he have,

385
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:12,220
I suppose just been emptying their
greasy water through the scuppers,

386
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,160
which has greased the sides
of those ships a little.

387
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,920
So there's experimental evidence
for what plenty said. Okay.

388
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,940
Recollecting what I had
formerly read in plenty.

389
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,170
I resolve to make some experiments of
the effect of oil on water when I should

390
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:33,460
have the opportunity. And when he had the
opportunity was when he was in London.

391
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,720
So here's London and his experiment in
1762 was in that place on clap on common

392
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:42,610
in south London

393
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,420
at length being a clap them where
there is on the common a large pond,

394
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:52,540
which I observed one day to
be very rough with the wind.

395
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,530
I fetched out a crew at of oil and
dropped a little of it on the water.

396
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,340
I saw it spread itself with
surprising swiftness upon the surface,

397
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,570
but the effect of smooth,
smoothly in the waves was not produced.

398
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,760
So the experiment was a failure.

399
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,683
Okay.

400
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,020
Four I had applied at first on the lured
side of the pond where the waves were

401
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:20,670
greatest and the wind drove
by oil back along the shore.

402
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,030
So it didn't spread on the
surface. Right. So what did he do?

403
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,200
Go to the other side. Right. I then went
to the windward side where they began,

404
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,470
the waves began to form, and there are
the oil though not more than a teaspoon,

405
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:39,960
fall produced an instant
calm over a space,

406
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:41,610
several yards square,

407
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,640
which spread amazingly and extended
itself gradually to let reach the least

408
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:50,070
side,
making all that quarter of the pond,

409
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:53,760
perhaps half an acre as
smooth as a looking glass.

410
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,530
So a teaspoon is five cubic centimeters
and he stilled half an acre,

411
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,650
which is 2000 square meters,

412
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,550
which means that the
thickness of this layer,

413
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:16,810
right to spread that many
cubic centimeters over 2000
square meters would be 25

414
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:19,244
OnX drums,

415
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,880
which is the length of a molecule
of the fat that's in the oil.

416
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,490
So Franklin had in fact measured
the length of an oil molecule

417
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,113
in this way.

418
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,890
Right now he didn't think he had measured
it and didn't claim to have measured

419
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:42,160
it. He said, when I put on the
water, it spreads instantly,

420
00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:47,161
many feet around becoming so thin
as to produce the prismatic colors.

421
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,760
The Newton rings colors,
right,

422
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,070
for a considerable space and beyond them,
so much thinner.

423
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:57,640
It became so thin that you didn't
even get Newton's colors right.

424
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:03,390
So much thinner as to be invisible except
in its effective smoothing the waves

425
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:08,950
at much greater distance. So with the
technique was stilling the water right.

426
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,290
Allows you to measure
how big the area was.

427
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,230
Isn't that cool?
Okay.

428
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,920
It seems as if a mutual repulsion between
the particles took place as soon as it

429
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:23,530
touched the water that is,
they pressed one another apart and moved.

430
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,580
So what he wouldn't have known
was that they stay, they,

431
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,770
they've pushed one another apartment,
they stayed in contact with one another,

432
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,030
right. To become a motto, molecular
thick layer over the water.

433
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,800
So he didn't claim to have majored it,

434
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:37,960
but indeed he did measure
the size of it oil.

435
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,770
So these things are the
size of an oil molecule. So,

436
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,400
so molecules are very, very, very small,

437
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,390
but they're not inconceivably small and
there are ways you can measure them.

438
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,183
Okay,

439
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,770
so we have this question,
are there electron pairs?

440
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,040
So let's try first feeling with
scanning probe microscopy or Spm,

441
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,230
can we feel individual molecules?
Can we feel individual atoms?

442
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,180
Can we see what bonds are by feeling them?
Right?

443
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,240
So a scanning tunneling,

444
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,160
tunneling microscopy was invented
in 1981 by these guys in Zurich,

445
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,960
Garrett Benish and Heinrich's Rohrer.
And here's the first publication.

446
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:25,250
But they,

447
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,880
they worked at IBM and here's the
first publication on the cover of their

448
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,680
journal about a meeting about this new
technique, scanning tunneling microscopy,

449
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,550
and they got the Nobel prize within
five years. Or maybe it was even less.

450
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,600
Very short order in 1986.
Okay.

451
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,890
Now how does, how does that
scanning tunneling microscopy,

452
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:50,160
which is one type of SPM scanning,
probe,

453
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,070
scanning tunneling is one way,
and I'll mention that shortly,

454
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:57,570
but first I'm going to talk
about atomic force microscopy.

455
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,870
And for this you need a little chip
and I'll show you the chip is in here.

456
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,070
Yeah.

457
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,670
In this little a bug box. Uh,
you can't see it here. Well,

458
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,260
there's the chip in the middle, right?
And I'll pass it around so you can look,

459
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,510
look at it.
And if you,

460
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:21,511
if you tilt it so that the light from
the ceiling glints off the off the gold

461
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,530
and you'll see it really shiny, you
may be able to see it. The thin end,

462
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,420
these little V's,

463
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:31,840
right?

464
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,370
You can see here at the bottom, Little
V's, the chip is 1.4 millimeters wide.

465
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,800
It's a gold coated silicon chip.

466
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,610
And if you look at those with
even higher magnification,

467
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:46,600
you see this and there's the size
of a hair you can actually see,

468
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,010
did you see them? They're not easy to
see and maybe you will. Maybe it won't,

469
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,850
but they're there. Okay? So
there's the size of a hair.

470
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,920
And in any given experiment,

471
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,820
you have a choice of five different
canta leavers as they're called,

472
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:04,170
that you can use. Okay? Here's a,

473
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,830
a higher resolution electron micrograph
that shows the tip of one of these V's

474
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,390
and you'll see a little,
um,

475
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,680
a little bulge here at the bottom.

476
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,720
And if you zoom in on that,

477
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:18,960
yeah,

478
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,880
you see this,
it's a little pyramid.

479
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:22,920
Yeah.

480
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,350
And so at the bottom of that pyramid,

481
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,430
the radius of curvature of this
tip is only about 20 nanometers.

482
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:33,570
So about the size of 20 molecules,
right? It's raw, it's round on the tip.

483
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:38,130
It's not truly pointed to come to
nothing, right? It's a little bit rounded.

484
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,320
You can buy that are that are uh,
a third that size.

485
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,650
They're curved radius of curvature.
Okay.

486
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:48,980
And then you have this piece of glass,
I said,

487
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:52,670
do not touch when you came in because
that piece of glass costs $2,000.

488
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,100
Let's see,
you got it back up here.

489
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,380
Okay. So there's this piece of
glass and if I hold it up here,

490
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,760
there's that little, a little chip
on the bottom of the piece of glass.

491
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:12,210
I know what I'm looking for. I don't know
if you can see it or not. But anyhow,

492
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:14,790
it's held into this piece of stuff here.

493
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,110
And those little tips
are pointing up here.

494
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:22,080
But the fact the thing is used
upside down so they point down.

495
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,670
So here's that thing mounted in an
instrument and you see there's a red light

496
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,080
glowing in the glass.

497
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,700
And the reason is it's
being irradiated by there.

498
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,770
So there's a blown up picture of one of
these tips pointing down and laser light

499
00:33:37,831 --> 00:33:42,831
comes and bounces off the shiny gold
on this tip and gets reflected up to a

500
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:47,850
detector. Now, what would happen
if you pushed up on the tip?

501
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,170
It would deviate the reflection,
right? It would go like this.

502
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:56,800
Yeah.

503
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,050
And you have a very precise, uh, uh,

504
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,620
position detector for the laser light
up where you see it, the light glowing.

505
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:11,250
So you can tell the deviation of that
tip moving up and down by a size that's

506
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,300
less than an atom.

507
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,593
That neat.

508
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,590
So now what you do in this is move this
back and forth over the sample and watch

509
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:28,120
the little needle go up and down by the
reflection of the light. So if you had,

510
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:32,110
if the surface was like this
is go click, click, click,
click, click, click up, up, up,

511
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,850
up, up, up, right as you scan across,

512
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,633
right?

513
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,480
And it sensitive, as I say, to less
than one molecule change in height,

514
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,780
although it doesn't feel an individual
molecule because the tip or a member is

515
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:48,700
20 nanometers wide,
right?

516
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:53,590
So the tip is the width of the
tip is like a hundred or so, uh,

517
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:57,670
Adams, right? So it's, it's touching
a bunch of atoms at any one time.

518
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,370
But if you come to a
ledge on like a crystal,

519
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,530
it would be going to the certain height,
touching a bunch,

520
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:05,230
and then it would move up and touch a
bunch more and you'd be able to tell that

521
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:10,060
it went up and down if, if that
distance was only one molecule easy.

522
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:15,160
Here's in fact a picture taken by an
undergraduate. In fact, it's a movie.

523
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,690
So it's AFM traces. So what you do is like
a TV, you know where you go, zoom, zoom,

524
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:23,070
zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,
zoom. And then you go back
to the top, zoom, zoom, zoom,

525
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:26,680
zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom. Say how high
it is at every point along the scan,

526
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,170
and then color coded to show how high.

527
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,430
So the width of this is
about 600 molecules, right?

528
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,990
But the lines you see,

529
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:38,940
which are legends that
go up and those ledge,

530
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,990
each of those legends is one unit cell,
1.7 nanometers,

531
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:47,990
one set of molecules. So
these are, and that the,

532
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,950
the thing of the, the top surface where
it's flat is absolutely flat, right?

533
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:57,330
Except for those little holes there and
those holes were made by taking this tip

534
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:01,440
and pressing down and scratching a little
bit to knock some of the molecules away

535
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,780
so that the larger pit
is five nanometers deep,

536
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:11,781
which means it's four layers of molecules
been knocked off in there and now this

537
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,360
is underwater or underwater and propanol.

538
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,580
So the crystal is dissolving slowly.

539
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,050
So those pits open up
as molecules come away.

540
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,610
So Watch,
right?

541
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,470
Those are at one minute intervals.

542
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:34,190
So we're actually feeling individual
molecular heights with this thing.

543
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,520
There was an interesting point here
that I'm not going to dwell on,

544
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,510
but the smallest one did
not lose any molecules.

545
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,500
If I back up watch the smallest one,

546
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,830
it always stays the same
size as the others dissolve.

547
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:54,240
That's an interesting puzzle. Isn't
it? But at any rate, you can do it.

548
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:55,810
So the,

549
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,940
and you can measure the rate at which
different ledges dissolve some dissolved

550
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:04,770
much faster than others.
Here's a,

551
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,060
uh, a scanning tunneling microscopy.
This is done a different way.

552
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:13,850
It's not that you don't reflect the laser
light. What you do is detect the, uh,

553
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,430
electrical conductivity through a layer.

554
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,870
And if you have an Adam there that
is a good conductor of electricity,

555
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:26,490
you get more lot more current through and
last and so on. So as you scan a real,

556
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,840
now this could be a really,

557
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:32,640
really sharp tip where the tip is
just one atom or a couple Adams.

558
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,690
So now as you go across, you can feel
things that are much smaller laterally.

559
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,510
Okay? So this picture here, that thing
right there, which is as you see,

560
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:47,040
a repeated pattern, that's one of
those molecules with see 12 in it,

561
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:51,540
in a bromine on the end. And here's
a model that shows what the, uh,

562
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,950
what the, what the molecule looks
like. The yellow is, is a bromine.

563
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,750
The brown or the two oxygens and the
green are carbon and the gray are

564
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:02,850
hydrogens.
They don't come colored that way.

565
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:05,910
They come looking like
this as to conductivity.

566
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,450
But you can see individual atoms,
right?

567
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Or one of the more dramatic early
examples in 1993 was that the IBM labs at

568
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:20,961
Almaden and in California where they
worked on iron atoms on the surface of

569
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:22,494
copper,

570
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:27,240
and they use this tip and changing the
voltage to pick up Adams and move them

571
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,850
where they wanted. Then change
the voltage and drop them there.

572
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:32,640
Then go back and get another one
and do it. So they made this thing,

573
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:36,730
they called a quantum corral of whatever,
58 or something.

574
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,570
A iron atoms.
Yeah.

575
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,000
Pardon me. This along the
lines of when they, oh yeah,

576
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,400
they also spelled out IBM.
Right.

577
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,520
They knew which side their
bread was buttered on too,

578
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:56,230
just like the Royal Society did.
Okay. So that's, that's neat.

579
00:38:56,231 --> 00:39:00,790
So clearly you can see individually
or feel individual atoms,

580
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,030
right?
But you don't see the bonds.

581
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,130
The bonds are smaller. It just
looks like a bunch of balls. Right?

582
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,680
You don't see the electron
pairs between them.

583
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,800
Here's Snob.

584
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,120
SNOB stands for scanning near
field optical microscope.

585
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:26,050
So this is in a sense seeing, but
actually it's scanning. It's like,

586
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,280
it's like feeling.

587
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,580
So what you have here is a glass fiber
that's drawn down to a very sharp point

588
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:34,120
and coated with aluminum.

589
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,720
And the hole at the bottom
is just a hundred nanometers.

590
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,500
That's like a hundred molecules,
right? Not, not really,

591
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,900
really tiny like the scanning
tunneling microscope.

592
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,560
So what you do is you have something on
the surface of a slide there that you

593
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:51,880
want to probe with this and
you send light down the thing.

594
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,190
And if there is a molecule where the
light's coming out through this tiny hole,

595
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,340
if there's a molecule there that will
take the blue light and emit red light,

596
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,230
then you know when it's under the tip,

597
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,930
suppose there was just one
molecule on the whole slide,

598
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,680
you scan it around until
suddenly red light comes out.

599
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:16,480
Then you know that tip is pointed
toward that particular molecule. Okay?

600
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:21,130
So red light comes out and you have a
detector that detects it and you scan the

601
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,540
sample back and forth
like a TV, right? And uh,

602
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,790
and you find out where such molecules are.

603
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:32,050
And here's a picture taken in that way.
So this is a scale of microns,

604
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,160
right? Two, two by two microns. In fact,

605
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:40,030
it's a distorted scale as I see here.
Okay?

606
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:45,520
And that's that Arrow double headed
Arrow is the wavelength of red light.

607
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:50,650
So you're seeing things significantly
smaller than the wavelength of the light

608
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,160
having done this way,
you're not really looking with your eye.

609
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,930
You're doing this scanning
trick, right? Okay.

610
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:03,610
So scanning probe microscopy is like
atomic force microscopy, scanning,

611
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:04,031
tunneling,

612
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:08,770
my cross scopy scanning nearfield
optical microscopy are really powerful.

613
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:12,010
And you can see individual Adams,
right?

614
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,720
The sharp points can resolve
individual molecules and even Adams,

615
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,330
but not bonds. So it's not doing
what we need to do for our purposes.

616
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,530
Now that's a, I'm going to
spend the last few minutes, uh,

617
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,500
going over the problem that we
were looking at with a member.

618
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:38,000
You were supposed to draw
all the resonance structures
for Hco n Isomers I think

619
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:41,330
you remember that. Okay,
so let's just look at it.

620
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,360
So what we're going to do is compare
what we see with Lewis theory with things

621
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:51,020
that have been calculated by
reasonably good quantum mechanics.

622
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:54,890
Not the very, very highest
level, but pretty good level.

623
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,670
Uh,
okay.

624
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:03,671
So we want to try to make all the possible
arrangements here so we can put the

625
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:08,600
three atoms OCN with any
one of them in the middle,

626
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,620
and then we can put hydrogen
on either end, right?

627
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:16,280
So then we'll do it with nitrogen in the
middle, then with oxygen in the middle.

628
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:20,810
So we'll have done all possibilities
there. So here are two possibilities.

629
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:25,190
Now are these good structures
is what we have to decide. Okay.

630
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,880
Now it would be possible to shift
electrons here and draw different Lewis

631
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:34,700
structure.
Which of those two do you think is better?

632
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,473
Why?

633
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,770
Okay, there's separation of
charge on the bottom. Okay.

634
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,070
So there's bad charge separation.
Uh,

635
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,900
most the most electronegative atom
oxygen in fact, has a positive charge,

636
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:55,880
not a negative charge. Right? So that's
not only is their charge separation,

637
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,350
it's in the wrong direction,

638
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
but they're all octets that
we've drawn in both structures.

639
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,120
All Adams have octets now let's
try the same trick over here.

640
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,710
We can do it that way. How about
that? Which of those is better?

641
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:11,920
Okay.

642
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,360
In both structures we could go through
and count and see that they're all octets.

643
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,011
Right.

644
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:21,550
That would you like me to do that or
is that something that's become second

645
00:43:21,551 --> 00:43:26,440
nature to you by now? That he may want
me to count them. Okay, you got that,

646
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,380
but now which of those two
structures do you think is better?

647
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,573
Yeah.

648
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,140
And and, okay, so you
say the top ones better,

649
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:42,141
you say because it doesn't have charge
separation now as compared to the case on

650
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:47,070
the left. Which do you think if you
have to have charged separation,

651
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,280
which one is better?
The one on the right,

652
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:55,020
because at least at least you have, you
have the, you have with the right Adam,

653
00:43:55,021 --> 00:43:58,920
the oxygen being negative, you could
have drawn the one on the top two.

654
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,800
Right. And that goes the other way. If I,

655
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,600
if I do notice that I've
introduced something here
that I haven't really talked

656
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:09,240
about enough.
The idea of curved arrows,

657
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:15,420
curved arrows show a shift of electrons,
right?

658
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:16,770
An electron pair.

659
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,820
What would you draw if you wanted
to show just one electron shifting?

660
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,700
If you had to think up the a notation.

661
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,033
Yeah,

662
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,540
dotted curve would be one possibility.

663
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:32,240
Another possibility Sovi Ah,
hell,

664
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,580
I like a fish hook instead
of a double arrow. Right?

665
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:39,480
And that's in fact what's used.
If you want to shift just one electron,

666
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,320
you show a uh, a single Barb. And
if you do a pair of electrons,

667
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:45,510
you show a double barbed curved arrow.

668
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,010
So curved arrows don't show Adam's moving,
they don't show this.

669
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:51,270
Adam goes to there,

670
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:57,000
they show an electron pair moving or
sometimes a single electron moving.

671
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:01,500
And you can use a double or a
single Barb to show which one. Okay,

672
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:06,000
so get that straight because that's
an off often a problem. Okay.

673
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:09,450
So the one on top is much worse
than the one on the bottom. Okay.

674
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:12,750
So there are possibilities
with sea in the middle. Now,

675
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:17,520
how about if you put in in the middle,
here are two structures with octets now,

676
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,830
uh, well, pardon me? They
don't all have our tests.

677
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:23,370
That one on the right has assessed that
right cause the carbons making two bonds.

678
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,730
So it gets three electrons out of
those two buttons at the department.

679
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,210
It gets two electrons out of those
two bonds. One from each bond.

680
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:34,170
That's its share in the
bookkeeping plus an unshared payer.

681
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,010
Right? That's only, well, uh, I mean,

682
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:41,670
what's associated with it
has only three pertinent,

683
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,440
I'm saying the wrong thing here.

684
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,120
It has four electrons that it calls
its own from bookkeeping point of view,

685
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,110
one from each bond and two in the
unshared payer. So it's not charged.

686
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,860
It came in with four electrons.
It's still got four electrons,

687
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,450
but it participates with only three
pairs of electrons. So it's assessed tet.

688
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:01,860
So that's not so good on the right.

689
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,360
The one on the left is not so good
because it's charged, separated.

690
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,090
At least it's on oxygen,
right? The negative charge.

691
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:12,840
We could draw this other one which puts
the negative charge on carbon. That's,

692
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,830
we would say not so good,
right? So that's a bad charge.

693
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,810
Or we could do it that way.
That looks like the best charge.

694
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:25,950
Probably better to put positive
on carbon than on nitrogen.

695
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,043
Okay.

696
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,780
But that carbon has assessed tet.
The others are octet ones.

697
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,990
Okay.
And we can do this other one over here.

698
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,790
Now we've got an octet on the carbon,

699
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,190
but we've got negative
charge on the carbon.

700
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:45,690
That's not such a great charge separation
thing. Or we could do it this way,

701
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:47,340
but again,
we got bad charge.

702
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,813
Okay.

703
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,160
So now if we put oh, in the middle, uh,

704
00:46:55,161 --> 00:46:57,020
we can do these structures,

705
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,120
both of which you notice
have what's bad about them.

706
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:05,500
Yeah.

707
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,850
Says staff there says
out on the right to uh,

708
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,580
there's a plus charge on
oxygen that's not so great.

709
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,170
You can draw curved arrows and
shift the electron pairs around.

710
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,810
You now got an octet on carbon,

711
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:23,740
but you've got to assess Ted
on nitrogen and bad charge,

712
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,570
negative on carbon,
not so great.

713
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,890
And over here you can do
that says stat again, charge.

714
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:33,400
Or you can make the three
heavy atoms into a ring.

715
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,690
And then you could put the hydrogen on
any one of the coming out of any one of

716
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:42,210
them. Uh, now the one on the left, uh,

717
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:45,850
with my computer,
I can't calculate it.

718
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:50,620
I can't find an energy minimum that has
that structure. So that one is very bad,

719
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:55,060
which doesn't surprise anyone.
It's got horrid angles for the bonds,

720
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:58,690
although we haven't really said that
we prefer one angle over another,

721
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:03,580
but it also has bad charge separation.
Okay.

722
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,640
Uh, that one's a bad charge. So, uh,
we could draw this other one here,

723
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:13,930
but still got positive on
oxygen. Assess tete. Uh,

724
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:18,100
what do we have here?
Says Ted on carbon. Uh,

725
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:19,600
okay.

726
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,600
So here are the bunch of isomers
we've just gone through right now.

727
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,120
A couple of years ago when I first talked
about this in the class and when they,

728
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,140
when these things had been accurately
calculate as accurately as people are

729
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:38,920
likely to do to calculate their
true energy and structure,

730
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,570
I,
uh,

731
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:44,620
I tested my colleagues in the department
to ask them if they could rank these

732
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:48,460
things as to what's the lowest than
what's the highest energy. And so on,

733
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,580
and no one succeeded.
In fact,

734
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,370
only a few people get the no,

735
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:58,450
which the lowest one is on the basis
of their familiarity with Lewis theory.

736
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,830
So the point is,
don't be depressed when you went,

737
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:05,080
when you are trying to do this,

738
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:09,580
it takes a lot of lore and even with
all the lore that's that's been gathered

739
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:10,510
over many years,

740
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:14,860
people can't use Lewis theory for this
purpose because it's just not that good,

741
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:17,590
okay?
But in fact,

742
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,710
the way I've drawn them there is their
energy according to these pretty good

743
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,690
calculations,
right?

744
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,910
The very lowest energy is the c in the
middle and I h on the nitrogen and then

745
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:32,920
see in the middle and h on the oxygen.

746
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:37,210
Now you can go back and look at what we
said was good and bad about these things

747
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,980
and convince yourself that now,

748
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,580
now you understand why those are on
the bottom and these are on the top.

749
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,770
But if it had come out differently,

750
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:48,160
you would have convinced
yourself differently. Okay,

751
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,470
so that's enough for today.
Actually there's a, there's a,

752
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,360
there's a reference for
this if you want to see it.

753
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:58,660
It was that the energies were published
in the Journal of Chemical Physics in

754
00:49:58,661 --> 00:49:59,590
2004.
