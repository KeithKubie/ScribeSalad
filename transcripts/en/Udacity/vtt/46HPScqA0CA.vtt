00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're going to make this change to the app we've been working on,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and we've got to do two things.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We need to make a thanks handler.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We need to add the thanks URL,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we need to redirect to the thanks URL.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Okay, let's go ahead and do these.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here we are--we have the functions you're familiar with, our normal form handler.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's go down to the bottom of our file and add a new handler.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I've added the definition for the thanks handler.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This has the same structure as our other handler.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It has a name, and then it inherits from webapp 2 request handler.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We're going to add a get function to it for get requests.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We're going to take this behavior from here and move it down here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Okay, now we have our handler.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's do the redirect here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So instead of printing thanks we're going to redirect.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is how you do redirects in google apps.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You call the function redirect on self in a handler,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it will redirect you to the URL that you provide.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We don't have to say HTTP here because we're redirecting to the same domain.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So we can just specify the path.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We need to do one final thing.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We need to add the thanks URL.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We need to map it this handler; so let's go ahead and do that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Okay, I added another URL down here in our mapping area.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It maps /thanks to the thanks handler.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's go ahead and test this in the browser.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We reload our page, we enter in a valid date, and we click submit.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, remember submit is going to give us a redirect

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
instead of just sending us data in the post.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Here we go.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We are now at /thanks, and our web application is saying thanks.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now we can reload this page as much as we want,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and we don't get any silly resubmit this form thing.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I can share this link with my friends and say look how smart I am.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I know my birthday.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
They will be suitably impressed.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The server won't have to validate our form over and over again.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Okay, that's it for basic forms.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Thanks very much.
