00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
 

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.140
Let's say I have
some function f that

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:11.160
is continuous on an
interval between a and b.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.840
And I have these brackets here,
so it also includes a and b

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.010
in the interval.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.540
So let me graph
this just so we get

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.540
a sense of what
I'm talking about.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.700
So that's my vertical axis.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.310
This is my horizontal axis.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.170
I'm going to label
my horizontal axis

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.610
t so we can save x for later.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.860
I can still make this
y right over there.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.310
And let me graph.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.340
This right over here is the
graph of y is equal to f of t.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.780
Now our lower endpoint is a,
so that's a right over there.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.485
Our upper boundary is b.

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:46.190
 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.209
Let me make that clear.

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:49.750
And actually just to show that
we're including that endpoint,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.690
let me make them bold
lines, filled in lines.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.662
So lower boundary,
a, upper boundary, b.

00:00:54.662 --> 00:00:56.120
We're just saying
and I've drawn it

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.720
this way that f is
continuous on that.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.950
Now let's define
some new function.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.600
Let's define some
new function that's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.050
the area under the curve
between a and some point

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.330
that's in our interval.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.560
Let me pick this
right over here, x.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.180
So let's define
some new function

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.690
to capture the area under
the curve between a and x.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.680
Well, how do we denote
the area under the curve

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.424
between two endpoints?

00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:29.090
Well, we just use our
definite integral.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.290
That's our Riemann integral.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.110
It's really that right
now before we come up

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.624
with the conclusion
of this video,

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:36.040
it really just
represents the area

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.100
under the curve
between two endpoints.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.220
So this right over
here, we can say

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:55.886
is the definite integral
from a to x of f of t dt.

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:59.540
 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.230
Now this right over here is
going to be a function of x--

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.660
and let me make
it clear-- where x

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.740
is in the interval
between a and b.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.260
This thing right
over here is going

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.330
to be another function of x.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.810
This value is going to depend
on what x we actually choose.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.630
So let's define this
as a function of x.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.376
So I'm going to say that this
is equal to uppercase F of x.

00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:29.250
So all fair and good.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.390
Uppercase F of x is a function.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.770
If you give me an x value
that's between a and b,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.910
it'll tell you the
area under lowercase f

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.780
of t between a and x.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.950
Now the cool part, the
fundamental theorem

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.160
of calculus.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.060
The fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.870
tells us-- let me
write this down

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.450
because this is a big deal.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.580
Fundamental theorem-- that's
not an abbreviation-- theorem

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.230
of calculus tells
us that if we were

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.847
to take the derivative
of our capital F,

00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:06.430
so the derivative-- let me make
sure I have enough space here.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.480
So if I were to take the
derivative of capital

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.420
F with respect to x, which
is the same thing as taking

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.070
the derivative of
this with respect

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.840
to x, which is equal to
the derivative of all

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.520
of this business--
let me copy this.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.940
So copy and then paste,
which is the same thing.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.880
I've defined capital
F as this stuff.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.550
So if I'm taking the derivative
of the left hand side,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.930
it's the same thing as
taking the derivative

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.260
of the right hand side.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.320
The fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:44.420
tells us that this is going to
be equal to lowercase f of x.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.470
Now why is this a big deal?

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.130
Why does it get such
an important title

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.920
as the fundamental
theorem of calculus?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.340
Well, it tells us that for
any continuous function

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.130
f, if I define a
function, that is,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.320
the area under the curve
between a and x right over here,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.580
that the derivative of that
function is going to be f.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.580
So let me make it clear.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.370
Every continuous function,
every continuous f,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:26.760
has an antiderivative
capital F of x.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.747
That by itself is a cool thing.

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:30.330
But the other really
cool thing-- or I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.110
guess these are
somewhat related.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.550
Remember, coming into
this, all we did,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.170
we just viewed the
definite integral

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.890
as symbolizing as the area under
the curve between two points.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.060
That's where that Riemann
definition of integration

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.290
comes from.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.032
But now we see a connection
between that and derivatives.

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:50.740
When you're taking
the definite integral,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.448
one way of thinking,
especially if you're

00:04:52.448 --> 00:04:54.350
taking a definite
integral between a lower

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.730
boundary and an x, one way
to think about it is you're

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.970
essentially taking
an antiderivative.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.900
So we now see a
connection-- and this

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.280
is why it is the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.850
It connects
differential calculus

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:14.330
and integral calculus--
connection between derivatives,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.010
or maybe I should say
antiderivatives, derivatives

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.040
and integration.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.160
Which before this video, we
just viewed integration as area

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.710
under curve.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.720
Now we see it has a
connection to derivatives.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.120
Well, how would you actually
use the fundamental theorem

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.760
of calculus?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.520
Well, maybe in the context
of a calculus class.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.740
And we'll do the intuition
for why this happens

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.220
or why this is true and maybe
a proof in later videos.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.310
But how would you actually
apply this right over here?

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.910
Well, let's say someone
told you that they

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.530
want to find the derivative.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.030
Let me do this in
a new color just

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.850
to show this is an example.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.090
Let's say someone wanted to
find the derivative with respect

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.074
to x of the integral
from-- I don't know.

00:05:53.074 --> 00:05:54.490
I'll pick some
random number here.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.900
So pi to x -- I'll put
something crazy here --

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.120
cosine squared of t
over the natural log

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.910
of t minus the
square root of t dt.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.980
So they want you take the
derivative with respect

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.021
to x of this crazy thing.

00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:18.790
Remember, this thing in the
parentheses is a function of x.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.332
Its value, it's going to have
a value that is dependent on x.

00:06:21.332 --> 00:06:22.748
If you give it a
different x, it's

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:24.140
going to have a different value.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.830
So what's the derivative
of this with respect to x?

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.030
Well, the fundamental
theorem of calculus tells us

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.720
it can be very simple.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.310
We essentially-- and you can
even pattern match up here.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.768
And we'll get more
intuition of why

00:06:35.768 --> 00:06:37.065
this is true in future videos.

00:06:37.065 --> 00:06:38.440
But essentially,
everywhere where

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.307
you see this right
over here is an f of t.

00:06:41.307 --> 00:06:43.140
Everywhere you see a
t, replace it with an x

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.490
and it becomes an f of x.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.850
So this is going to be
equal to cosine squared

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.980
of x over the natural log of
x minus the square root of x.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.700
You take the derivative of
the indefinite integral where

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.410
the upper boundary
is x right over here.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.050
It just becomes whatever you
were taking the integral of,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.770
that as a function instead of
t, that is now a function x.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.210
So it can really simplify
sometimes taking a derivative.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.840
And sometimes you'll see on
exams these trick problems

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.320
where you had this really
hairy thing that you

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.910
need to take a definite
integral of and then take

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.285
the derivative,
and you just have

00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:19.290
to remember the fundamental
theorem of calculus,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.790
the thing that ties
it all together,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.740
connects derivatives
and integration,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.350
that you can just simplify it
by realizing that this is just

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.900
going to be instead of a
function lowercase f of t,

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.570
it's going to be
lowercase f of x.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.770
Let me make it clear.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.550
In this example right over
here, this right over here

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.730
was lowercase f of t.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.610
And now it became
lowercase f of x.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.044
This right over here was our a.

00:07:45.044 --> 00:07:46.460
And notice, it
doesn't matter what

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.592
the lower boundary
of a actually is.

00:07:48.592 --> 00:07:50.300
You don't have anything
on the right hand

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.691
side that is in some
way dependent on a.

00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:53.940
Anyway, hope you enjoyed that.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.470
And in the next few videos,
we'll think about the intuition

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.420
and do more examples making
use of the fundamental theorem

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.870
of calculus.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.370
