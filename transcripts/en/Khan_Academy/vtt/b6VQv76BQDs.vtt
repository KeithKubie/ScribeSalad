00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.840
I want to make a quick
correction to the last video.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.550
It doesn't really affect the
learning of the last video.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.490
But I just want to make
sure that you understand

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.410
that I got the math a little
bit wrong in the last video.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.900
I said that you had this
state, 300,000 years.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.000
So we talk about the
Big Bang happening

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.820
13.7 billion years ago.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.710
And then I talk about
this state of affairs

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.550
where we're maybe 30
million light years away

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.630
from the edge of the
observable universe,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.860
the current observable universe.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.230
And I said that this
was about 300,000 years

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.516
after the Big Bang.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.390
That's what I talked
about in the last video.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.181
That was our starting
point when the photon

00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:54.415
started leaving that point.

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:56.450
And obviously, the
universe kept expanding.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.320
The photon, it kind of
traversed more and more.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.240
But still had more
and more to travel

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.840
as the universe expanded,
as all of space expanded.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.100
But this is 300,000
years after the Big Bang.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.470
Now my brain, because I was
kind of not thinking hard enough

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.180
about it, I said, hey, this
was 13.4 billion years ago.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240
That's what I incorrectly
said in the last video.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.589
I said that this is
13.4 billion years ago.

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:26.130
That's what I said
in the last video.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.530
And that is wrong.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.630
Because if this was
13.4 billion years ago,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.190
this would have been 300 million
years after the Big Bang.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.940
We were talking about
only 300,000 years

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.891
after the Big Bang.

00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:39.140
So it wouldn't have taken
that many decimal places off

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.820
of something in the billions.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.930
The correct answer is this
would have been only a little

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.997
less than 13.7 billion years.

00:01:46.997 --> 00:01:49.330
It actually wouldn't have
even made a significant digit.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.242
So this is still approximately
13.7 billion years ago.

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:57.950
So I wanted to just
make that correction.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.190
It was a slight error.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.870
I shouldn't have viewed
this as 0.3 billion years.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.560
This is only 0.3 million years.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.690
It doesn't even basically
change the precision

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.449
on this number right over here.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.150
So I just wanted
to clear that up.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.480
But hopefully, it doesn't affect
your understanding too much.
