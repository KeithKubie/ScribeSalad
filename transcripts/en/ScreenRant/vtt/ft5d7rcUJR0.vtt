00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.580
Movie sets have to be some of the safest places
on earth.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.420
Bound by strict safety regulations, studios
do their darndest to make sure cast and crew

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.180
get through production unscathed.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.189
After all, they wouldn’t want to get sued.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.910
Still, the safest movie set in the world isn’t
immune to everything.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.250
So when accidents happen on set, or when cast
and crew members die under mysterious circumstances,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.130
it’s tempting to wonder if something supernatural
is to blame.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.080
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Creepy Curses
That Haunt Famous Hollywood Movies

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.470
The Dark Knight
Everyone knows the fate of Hollywood heartthrob

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.470
Heath Ledger.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.350
After turning in his iconic turn as The Joker
in Christopher Nolan’s comic book masterpiece

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.750
The Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental
overdose on sleeping pills.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.210
But that wasn’t the only bad thing that
happened to people involved with the film.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.090
While it was still filming, a special effects
expert died on set after a vehicle carrying

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.100
a camera crashed into a tree.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.850
After it came out, Morgan Freeman was involved
in a car accident which landed him in the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.850
hospital.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.630
Nevertheless he returned to film The Dark
Knight Rises.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.930
Presumably, the curse had lifted by that point.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.879
The Curse of Billy Bob Thornton
Speaking of Heath Ledger, the young actor

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.540
co-starred in Monster’s Ball with Billy
Bob Thornton back in 2001.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.079
Nowadays, people know Thornton as the beloved
character actor from such films as Waking

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.280
Up in Reno, Sling Blade, Daddy and Them, and
Bad Santa.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.240
But who were his co-stars in those other movies?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.049
Well, in Waking Up in Reno, Thornton shared
the screen with Patrick Swayze, who died of

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.549
pancreatic cancer at the early age of 57.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.130
Actor JT Walsh died of a heart attack in 1998,
just two years after co-starring in Sling

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.130
Blade.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.759
Daddy and Them is the last film of Ernest-star
Jim Varney, who died of lung cancer at age

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.759
50.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.649
And Bad Santa has two premature deaths associated
with it: John Ritter passed away in 2003 while

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.140
Bernie Mac succumbed to a heart attack in
2008.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.340
This probably doesn’t have anything to do
with Billy Bob, but it’s a creepy coincidence,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.340
nonetheless.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.729
The Conqueror
Sometimes known as the the movie that killed

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.220
John Wayne, The Conqueror is a 1956 epic about
Mongolian leader Ghengis Khan.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.369
In the case of this film, the curse is real.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.009
The Conqueror was filmed in St. George, Utah,
which happened to be downwind of a nuclear

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.909
weapons testing site in neighboring Nevada.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.100
Out of 220 cast and crewmembers, 91 eventually
developed cancer.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.990
John Wayne, the director Dick Powell, and
co-stars Susan Hayword and Agnes Moorehead

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.780
all died of cancer eventually.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.220
Another co-star, Pedro Armendariz, took his
own life after learning that his condition

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.220
was terminal.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.110
Producer Howard Hughes -- yeah, the guy Leonardo
DiCaprio played in The Aviator -- felt so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.860
guilty about this that he purchased every
print of the film and kept it from being screened

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.310
until his death.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.610
The Oscar Love Curse
Here’s another curse that might be real,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.920
the Oscar love curse.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.940
This theory holds that women who win the Oscar
for Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.490
are more likely to see their marriages and
relationships go down in flames.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.180
Stars like Julia Roberts, Reese Witherspoon,
and Sandra Bullock have seen their long-term

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.410
romances come to an end not long after winning
an Academy Award.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.550
Apparently, there might be some truth to this
curse.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.080
In the journal Organization Science, two professors
conducted a study of the so-called curse and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.660
determined that it might be real.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.440
They determined that the upward positive shift
in social status could have a detrimental

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.630
effect on the marriage.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.910
So if you want to stay married, folks, it
might be a good idea to stay away from the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.010
Oscar spotlight.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.680
Psycho
When anyone brings up the classic horror film

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.560
Psycho, only one scene comes to mind: when
Janet Leigh’s character gets murdered in

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.700
the Bates Motel shower.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.200
The rest of the movie may be a masterpiece,
but that scene is terrifying.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.820
What makes it more terrifying is the history
that surrounds it.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.380
Myra Davis, who was Leigh’s stand-in on
the film, was raped and murdered in 1988.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.700
In 2001, a handyman named Kenneth Dean Hunt
was convicted for the crime.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.120
In the book The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock’s
Shower, writer Robert Graysmith describes

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.070
Hunt as a Psycho obsessive who wanted to kill
Leigh’s body double from the shower scene.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.570
Instead, he got the wrong woman.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.060
Davis was Leigh’s stand-in for lighting
checks, but Leigh’s body double was actually

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.750
Marli Renfro, a former Playboy model who is
still alive and well.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.210
The 27 Club
The 27 Club refers to the large number of

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.910
famous young people to have died at the age
of 27 years old.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.040
In 1969, Rolling Stones bassist Brian Jones
drowned in his swimming pool.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.870
Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin both died of
drug-related causes the next year while The

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.150
Doors’ frontman Jim Morrison passed away
mysteriously the year after.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.350
When Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain took his own
life in 1994, music lovers began referring

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.470
to “The 27 Club”.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.540
Amy Winehouse is the latest rock star to “join
the club”, but she’s not the only 27-year-old

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.830
celebrity to die in recent years.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.620
27-year-old Star Trek star Anton Yelchin was
killed by his Jeep Grand Cherokee in a freak

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.470
accident earlier this year.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.250
Atuk
Atuk is the only film on this list that was

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.410
so cursed it never actually got made.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.729
In 1982, John Belushi was in talks to play
the lead character Atuk, a heavy-set Inuit

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.289
man from Alaska who gets lost in New York
City.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.120
After agreeing to take the role, Belushi died
of a drug overdose.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.750
The role eventually went to Sam Kinison, who
actually shot some scenes as the character

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.210
before production halted over creative differences
between Kinison and the producers.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.860
He later died in a car crash.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.760
Then, John Candy expressed interest in playing
the role, but sadly passed away before it

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.760
could get made.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.389
Finally, Chris Farley expressed interest in
the role shortly before his death in 1997.

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.180
Something tells us this movie is never going
to get made.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.710
The Terminator Curse
You could also call this the John Connor curse.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.970
Two of the actors who have played John Connor
over the years have had their lives turned

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.610
upside down by addiction.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.499
Furlong played a young John Connor in Terminator
2: Judgment Day, but he became addicted to

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:04.090
cocaine and heroin as a teenager.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.190
He still pops up from time-to-time in low-budget
B-movies, but Furlong’s career has never

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.190
recovered.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.499
In 2003, Nick Stahl took over the role of
John Connor in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.410
but in 2012 his own addiction troubles came
to light when his estranged wife reported

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.099
him missing for multiple days.

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.810
He works mainly on independent films now.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.530
Thankfully for Christian Bale, who played
Connor in Terminator: Salvation, the curse

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.449
doesn’t seem to have affected him.

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:31.490
James Dean’s “Little Bastard” Curse
In 1955, James Dean tragically died in a car

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.490
crash.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.810
He was driving a customized Porsche 550 Spyder,
which he affectionately referred to as “Little

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.810
Bastard”.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.330
After the crash, however, a string of mysterious
accidents followed the remainder of the car.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.419
Parts of the Little Bastard eventually made
their way to into two separate cars owned

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.120
by Troy McHenry and William Estrid.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.150
They both crashed while racing each other,
killing the former and seriously injuring

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.150
the latter.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.699
While being used for a safety exhibit, the
remainder of the Little Bastard survived a

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.319
fire at a garage and broke someone’s hip
after falling off its display.

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.639
Later, it fell off a truck while being transported
and killed its driver.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.069
This is one Hollywood car we do not want to
drive.

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.080
Superman Curse
The Superman Curse begins with George Reeves,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.900
who portrayed the character in the 1950s TV
series The Adventures of Superman.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.409
After his career was hampered by typecasting,
Reeves was tragically killed by a gunshot

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:16.409
wound in 1959.

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.490
The next actor to don the tights was Christopher
Reeve in Richard Donner’s Superman in 1978.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.139
Reeve played the superhero until 1987’s
Superman IV.

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.469
But in 1995, he was paralyzed from the neck
down in a horse-riding accident.

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:32.330
So far, no horrible life-changing events have
been brought down on Tom Welling or Brandon

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.860
Routh, but there’s no doubt that their careers
haven’t quite taken off in the years since

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.860
they’ve played Superman.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.340
Perhaps Henry Cavill, the latest actor to
take on the Man of Steel, can turn things

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:51.000
around for 
the character.
