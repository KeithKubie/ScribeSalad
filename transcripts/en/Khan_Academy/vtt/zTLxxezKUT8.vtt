00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.820
Let's say that we have
three integers, a, b, and c,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.880
and we know that all of these
integers are greater than 0.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.460
So they're integers, and
they are greater than 0.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.940
And we also know that
the expression a plus b

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.987
over c, that this
is also an integer.

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:25.070
The entire expression, if
you were to evaluate it,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.840
is also an integer.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.080
And then finally, we know
that a is divisible--

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.420
or another way of saying it,
that a is a multiple of c,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.950
so a is divisible by c, which
is another way of saying

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:51.020
is a is a multiple of c.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.510
So this is what we know.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.300
a, b, and c are integers,
all greater than 0.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.690
We know that the
expression a plus b over c

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.900
is also an integer, and
that a is a multiple of c,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.730
or a another way is that c
divides perfectly into a.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.280
So our question for you or
the question for all of us

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.970
to work out right now
is, is b a multiple?

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.590
Does b have to be
a multiple of c?

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.330
Let me write it that way.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.400
Does b-- given all of
these constraints--

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:37.852
does b have to be
a multiple of c?

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:39.560
So let's see how we
can-- and I encourage

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.710
you to pause the video right now
to come up with your own answer

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.250
about whether b has
to be a multiple of c.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.649
So now that you've unpaused
things, let's work it out.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.940
So let's go to our original
expression right over here.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.300
We have a plus b over
c, and really one way

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.122
to tackle this, is to
really just play around

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:01.080
with this expression,
and see if we can come up

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.920
with any conclusions here.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.070
So, one, we could try to
rewrite a plus b over c.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.130
We could rewrite
that as a/c plus b/c,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.090
and this expression is
the exact same thing

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.840
as our first expression.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.300
So we know that
this entire thing

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.130
is going to be an integer.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.220
That whole thing is
going to be an integer.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.280
Now, what do we know
about these parts?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.200
Well a/c, this is
a divided by c.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.160
We know that a is
divisible by c.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.240
We know that a is
a multiple of c.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.330
So divided by c, this is
going to be an integer,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.980
so let me write that.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.170
So, this information
right over here

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.720
tells us that this thing right
over here-- that a divided

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.710
by c-- is going
to be an integer.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.370
This is going to be an integer.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.200
Now, if I have an integer,
and I add something to it,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.920
and the whole thing
is an integer,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.440
well the thing that I'm adding
to it must be an integer.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.590
The only way that I get
an integer plus something

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.710
to be an integer is if
the thing I'm adding it to

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.670
is also an integer.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.830
So this-- there's
no way that I could

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.760
add an integer to a non-integer
and then get an integer,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.735
so this has to be an integer.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.150
And if b/c is an integer,
that means that, yes,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.730
b must be a multiple of c.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.466
So the answer here is yes.
