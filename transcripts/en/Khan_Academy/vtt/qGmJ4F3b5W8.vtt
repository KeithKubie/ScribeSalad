00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.250
Determine whether the
points on this graph

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.390
represent a function.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.820
Now, just as a
refresher, a function

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.860
is really just an association
between members of a set

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.360
that we call the domain
and members of the set

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.760
that we call a range.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.580
So if I take any member of
the domain, let's call that x,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.590
and I give it to the
function, the function

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.830
should tell me what member of
my range is associated with it.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.430
So it should point
to some other value.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.730
This is a function.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.600
It would not be a
function if it says,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.020
well, it could point to y.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.940
Or it could point to z.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.470
Or maybe it could point
to e or whatever else.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.650
This would not be a function.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.040
So this right over
here not a function,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.700
because it's not clear if
you input x what member

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.200
of the range you're
going to get.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.770
In order for it
to be a function,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.800
it has to be very clear.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.527
For any input into
the function, you

00:00:56.527 --> 00:00:58.110
have to be very clear
that you're only

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.650
going to get one output.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.400
Now, with that out of
the way, let's think

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.410
about this function that
is defined graphically.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.190
So the domains,
the valid inputs,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.990
are the x values where
this function is defined.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.320
So for example, it tells us
if x is equal to negative 1--

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.270
if we assume that this
over here is the x-axis

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.480
and this is the
y-axis-- it tells us,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.090
when x is equal to negative
1, we should output.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.280
Or y is going to be equal to 3.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.160
So one way to write
that mapping is you

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.550
could say, if you
take negative 1

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.450
and you input it into
our function-- I'll

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.430
put a little f box right over
there-- you will get the number

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.090
3.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.570
This is our x.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.860
And this is our y.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.400
So that seems reasonable.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.030
Negative 1 very clear
that you get to 3.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.220
Let's see what happens
when we go over here.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.020
If you put 2 into the function,
when x is 2, y is negative 2.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.940
Once again, when x
is 2 the function

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.960
associates 2 for x, which
is a member of the domain.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.570
It's defined for 2.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.720
It's not defined for 1.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.389
We don't know what our
function is equal to at 1.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.472
So it's not defined there.

00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:12.150
So 1 isn't part of the domain.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.700
2 is.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.580
It tells us when
x is 2, then y is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.280
going to be equal to negative 2.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.470
So it maps it or associates
it with negative 2.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.380
That doesn't seem too
troublesome just yet.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.670
Now, let's look over here.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.980
Our function is also
defined at x is equal to 3.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.520
Our function associates or maps
3 to the value y is equal to 2.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.430
That seems pretty
straightforward.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.140
And then we get to x
is equal to 4, where

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.820
it seems like this thing
that could be a function

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.280
is somewhat defined.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.820
It does try to
associate 4 with things.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.220
But what's interesting here
is it tries to associate 4

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.500
with two different things.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.844
All of a sudden in this
thing that we think

00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:56.260
might have been a
function, but it

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.770
looks like it might
not be, we don't know.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.590
Do we associate 4 with 5?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.810
Or do we associate
it with negative 1?

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.590
So this thing right over
here is actually a relation.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.050
You can have one member of
the domain being related

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.140
to multiple members
of the range.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.640
But if you do have
that, then you're

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.890
not dealing with a function.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.800
So once again, because of
this, this is not a function.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.280
It's not clear that when
you input 4 into it,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.560
should you output 5?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.257
Or should you output negative 1?

00:03:29.257 --> 00:03:31.590
And sometimes there's something
called the vertical line

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.790
test that tells you whether
something is a function.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.610
When it's graphically defined
like this, you literally

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.280
say, OK, when x is 4, if
I draw a vertical line,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.230
do I intersect the function
at two places or more?

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.860
It could be two or more places.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.200
And if you do, that means that
there's two or more values that

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.610
are related to that
value in the domain.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.450
There's two or more
outputs for the input 4.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.840
And if there are two or more
outputs for that one input,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.506
then you're not dealing
with a function.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.140
You're just dealing
with a relation.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.760
A function is a special
case of a relation.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.862
Or you could view it as
a well-behaved relation.
