1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,850
The Joe Rogan experience to go see
this one championship event in Bangkok.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,510
Wow. That guy, one of my
friends like pet. Damn, he's a,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,520
he's a a stadium like champion and he's
fighting one championship again and it's

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,700
like, it's, it's just six seaman. Yeah.

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,990
I don't think people understand
how big it is in Asia either. Well,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,810
there's a lot of American fans that are
just really, they're missing it. Yeah.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,380
It's like Asia's version of the UFC.
It's gigantic. Bigger. Yeah. Yeah.

8
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:32,700
The numbers are insane. And they got
some fucking killers over there. Yes.

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,300
They got some legit killers.
Yeah.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,330
That's like that Guy Nasty Ucan who
just knocked out a Eddie Alvarez. Yep.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,540
I try to tiger dude.
That guy's legit. Yeah.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,490
I remember to train with him at
all. No, I would like alongside him.

13
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:51,030
I didn't personally try with them,
but I remember one day we were doing a,

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,810
we were training and he was the
last one on the mat. And, uh,

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,420
our wrestling coach frank was like,
he's like,

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,680
he said something like 10 more sprawls
in like you beat Eddie Alvarez or

17
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:05,310
something and the guy's just grinded
like he's just digging himself into the

18
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:09,360
Maddie. It was, it was cool to watch
him prepare for that fight. But there's,

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,330
there's guys like that that's like,
yeah,

20
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:16,440
he trains there all the time and he beat
Eddie Alvarez. Like that's a big deal.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,020
I think it's a big factor over there too,
that they don't cut weight.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,710
I think that's a bad factor if you're
used to being the bigger fighter all the

23
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,840
time. Yup. And then all of
a sudden now you're not,

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
now no one's cutting any weight. I mean
they, they have some sort of a system.

25
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:32,130
Ben Asked her was explaining it to me.
I don't really remember how it works,

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,040
but there's some sort of a system
where they stop you from cutting. Yeah.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,230
Like the check your hydrated
check your hydration levels,

28
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:41,130
yet you gotta be some other way to do
it. And he's the right, he's correct.

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,020
He's smart.
It's the right way to do it.

30
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,790
We should've done it a
long time ago in the UFC.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,630
I really think that all the
way cut issues, all that
stuff, like ruining cards,

32
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:51,780
all that, it would all be eliminated,
right? Yes. Ruining cards.

33
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,280
And even more importantly,

34
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,490
I think causing fighters to fight
it less than their full potential.

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,790
How many fighters got hit when they
shouldn't have gotten hit because if they

36
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:03,890
were recovered completely,
if they didn't have to, uh,

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,390
not recover completely.
But if they,

38
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,670
they didn't have to recover from
a weight cut. I mean, who knows?

39
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:12,600
Maybe there's shots you ate because that
you wouldn't have eaten. Yeah. Right.

40
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:15,240
Especially if you are some guys
cutting a brutal amount of weight.

41
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,700
It's entirely possible that you could
get hit with something you wouldn't have.

42
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:21,930
You didn't have to cut weight
or author. Yeah. Right.

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,960
We got five more often and the training
would be a lot better too because we

44
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:29,970
wouldn't like a lot of fighters
spending the last three weeks,

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,250
four weeks of their fight or their
cap. China's weight lose weight. It's,

46
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,700
it's the whole way,

47
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:39,900
the approach of learning and building
strength and all that stuff that you could

48
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:42,270
do. So I don't know. I
think it'd be awesome.

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,660
The only argument forward is that the
guys are tough enough to do it and cut a

50
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,494
shitload of weight,

51
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,370
have this massive size advantage and
sometimes it allows them to win and they

52
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,920
think they should be able to do it because
they're tough enough to cut all that

53
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:57,420
weight. Yeah, I get it. I
mean it does. It's hard to do.

54
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,310
You have to be a strong person, but I
just don't think it's good for anybody.

55
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,740
I don't think it's good for the athletes.
I don't think it's good for the sport.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,010
I don't think it's good for anybody.
It's just an old way.

57
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,430
It's just an old thing that people are
doing so they don't have to fight the

58
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,211
bigger people.
You know?

59
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,240
It's crazy because I have to answer that
question a lot for people who don't,

60
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,170
like some of my friends are just
like, oh, like they'll hit me up like,

61
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,110
hey am I can't talk this week.
Like I got to cut weight,

62
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:23,230
like it's not a good time. And
they're like, fuck, how do you,

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,160
how do you lose 20 pounds in a day
and why do you do that? You know?

64
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,230
I'm just like,
I don't know how to explain it.

65
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:32,440
It's just because that's what we
do, you know? There's not really,

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600
it's just what I have to do.

67
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,540
When you see certain fighters get on
the scale though, like Conor Mcgregor,

68
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,910
when he made one 45 crazy,
looked like a,

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,220
like a Zombie man is walking
dead character. Yeah. I was like,

70
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:48,820
Holy Shit Man. He looks like the
ice king. Yeah. What's that? No,

71
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:52,000
the winter king is the, what do you
call them? The night tonight? Yeah.

72
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,740
The night king. He did look like the Nike,
but did you see him when he fought at,

73
00:03:56,741 --> 00:04:01,420
uh, when he fought Nate? Nate at one sone.
Look Great. You look great. Right? Right.

74
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,080
There's a difference. Definitely.
Yeah. I mean there's, wow,

75
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,140
get the difference it saying,
oh my kids are happy right there.

76
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:15,250
He's just like, yeah, I just, yeah, I just
had a burger. I know what to sleep good.

77
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,010
And then what's the math and the
other one? He's like, yeah, dude,

78
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,590
he's on death's door right there.
Really? Only three months apart.

79
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,330
Four months apart. 2015 and
March, 2016 is that right? Yeah.

80
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,330
Wow. Wow. You know what's
crazy too? Sometimes wait,

81
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,830
cutting messes up the mind to cause
you see yourself so shredded, right.

82
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,010
At one point in your life. And then
like, I can get maybe like five pounds.

83
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm like, ah, man, I'm out of shape.
Like I gotta get back in shape. Yeah.

84
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:40,930
You get accustomed to it.
Yeah.
