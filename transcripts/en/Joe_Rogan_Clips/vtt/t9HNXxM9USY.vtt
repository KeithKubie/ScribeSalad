1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.570
The second thing is I believe that there are no,
I say this in my ceremony,

3
00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:11.040
there's no such thing as sacred cow or sacred plants are sacred.

4
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.670
Mountains are sacred people.
If we don't treat life with sacredness,

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.220
but if we recognize that everything is sacred,

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.590
then we infuse life with sacredness and meaning and that's,
anyway,

7
00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:21.630
that's why I do,
it's a lot of fun.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.640
That's very interesting from a guy who specializes essentially in manipulating

9
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.200
life.
Well,

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.830
you know we have manipulated life as humans for a very short on time,

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.910
but that's interesting.
You know the idea of things being sacred,

12
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:40.680
but your specialty is manipulating genetics,
right?
Yeah.

13
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:40.981
Well,

14
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:45.981
so that is this strange moment that we're in because for about for about 3.8

15
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:47.610
billion years,

16
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.560
our species has evolved by this set of principles we call Darwinian evolution,

17
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.020
random mutation and natural selection.
It's brought us here.

18
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.550
We used to be single cell organisms and now look at us and there's been a lot of

19
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.920
magic in that process and there still is,

20
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.220
but we humans are decipher some of that magic.

21
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.340
We are like looking under the hood of what it means to be human.

22
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:12.180
And we are increasingly going to have the ability to manipulate all of life,

23
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:17.130
including our own.
Yeah.
That is very unnerving to a lot of people.
It's,

24
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.450
it's,
it's uncomfortable and scary and yeah,
it is.

25
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.110
They like things the way they are.
We only,
I'd like to stay the way I am.

26
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.880
We always think that there's the,

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.440
we always think that there's a built in conservative conservatism in our brains.

28
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.400
Um,

29
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.400
and yet we live these lives that are entirely dependent on these radical changes

30
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.070
that our ancestors have created.
I mean,

31
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.630
we didn't find this building or agriculture medicine,
uh,
in nature.

32
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.020
We built all those things and then everybody gets a new baseline when you're

33
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:53.880
born and you think,
well,
you know,
I'm,
I want,
you know,
organic corn,

34
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.720
I want whatever.
But all these things are creation.

35
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:02.250
We live in entirely created world and our ability to manipulate and change that

36
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:06.270
world is always growing.
And I think we need to recognize that,

37
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:10.380
but there's being afraid is okay and being excited as okay.

38
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:12.690
And we need to find the right balance between those two emotions.

39
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.870
I think for a lot of people,
they feel like so many changes happen,

40
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.510
particularly when you're talking about genetically modified foods.

41
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.930
So many things happened before they realize they had happened.

42
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.230
So when they're like,
hey man,
I don't want anything to eat any GMO fruit.

43
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.200
Well then you probably shouldn't eat any fruit.
Yup.

44
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.410
Because everything that you buy has been changed.

45
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.310
Like every orange that you buy that.
That's why when an orange,
just to be like,

46
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.830
yeah,
could buy an apple,
Apple's didn't used to be like that.

47
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:40.580
Tomatoes didn't used to be like that.
No,
I know.
That's we,

48
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:43.260
we reset our baseline just from when we're kids.

49
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:47.520
So if you went back 12,000 years ago to the end of the last ice age,

50
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:50.850
and you said,
all right,
find me all these things that we buy at whole foods.

51
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:53.370
Most of them didn't exist.
We,
we've created them.
Sure.

52
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.990
And then in the 1970s we had the ability to do what's recombinant DNA when

53
00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:02.500
people call the genetic modification and people are afraid because it's,
well,

54
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:07.390
that feels unnatural.
We're applying science to,
to food.
Um,

55
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.880
and you know,
that's,
that's the issue and now we're,

56
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:13.840
we're entering the era of genetically modified humans and there's that same

57
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.380
level of uncomfortableness.
But what happened,
the reason why I've written this,

58
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.730
uh,
this book hacking Darwin,

59
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.560
is that if we approached genetically modified humans in the same way that we

60
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.970
approached Niggli modified foods,
which is the scientists say,
Hey,
we've got this,

61
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:32.020
we're going to manage them responsibly.
And it just kind of happens to people.

62
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.030
People are gonna go nuts.
I mean,

63
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:36.940
you imagine how agitated people are about GMO foods.

64
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.170
If they don't have a say in how the genetic,
the experience,

65
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:43.720
the human experience of genetic modification plays out,

66
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.170
people are going to go berserk.
So we have this window of time,

67
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.640
we can start bringing everybody into an inclusive conversation about where we're

68
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:55.120
going because where we are going is just radically different from where we've

69
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:56.080
been.
Yeah.

70
00:03:56.081 --> 00:04:01.081
I think it's an awareness issue and I also think it's a perception issue.

71
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.050
I think that everything people do is natural.
Yeah.
Including cities.

72
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.620
I think cities are natural.
That's why they're all over the world.
Yeah.

73
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.140
I think there was naturals beehives and I think as much as we like to think that

74
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:15.040
technology is not natural,
it's clearly something people naturally make.

75
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.600
Of course they make it in every culture they can.

76
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.300
It's the history of our species and we,

77
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:22.330
we kind of misuse this word natural trunk.
Give me,

78
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:24.340
cause what is natural?

79
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.360
I mean maybe natural was when we used to live and we were just part of,

80
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.660
of nature.
And I always say it's like people say,
oh I love nature.

81
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.760
I love like going out and hiking in the woods.

82
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.330
The reason you love hiking in the woods is the,
we've murdered all the predators.

83
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.260
It's like in the old days,
in the year you stay,
in your case,

84
00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:42.210
if you're not going out and hiking in the woods,
there's,

85
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.720
there's stuff that's going to kill you out there.

86
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.800
I know that was a massive luxury to go wander through the forest with no
weapons.

87
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.510
Yeah.
Nobody did that.
Exactly.
But he goes,
oh,
I want nature.
I want my,
you know,

88
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:57.160
my natural corn.
I want my,
my natural Chihuahua.
Even though,
you know,

89
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:00.780
25,000 years ago there was no chihuahuas.
There's wolves.
Yeah.

90
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.640
And look what we've done to them,
I know will look what we have done to them.

91
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.530
Made them pugs.
Yeah.
If you had natural wheat like,
or natural corn in particular,

92
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.510
natural,
corny,
submit a tiny little thing.
Yeah.
It's just a few weeds.
Yeah.

93
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.520
Weird gross little grain.
Yep.

94
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.610
And then now we made it this big juicy,
sweet,

95
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:22.630
delicious thing that you put butter on,
which is great.
But we create,

96
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.400
we can finish that have glyphosate,
glyphosate,
but we,
we can't,

97
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.930
we can't fetishize that.

98
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:33.340
There's some kind of imaginary world where kind of everybody was wearing

99
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:36.910
Birkenstocks and eating in wholefoods.
That imaginary world sucked for us.

100
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:40.210
That's why we left it.
It's true.
But there's some sort of a balance,
right.

101
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.890
We know,
we do appreciate the nature,
uh,

102
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.970
aspect of our world and eagles and salmon and all these wild things and to be

103
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:50.680
able to see them as very cool.
Yeah.
But yeah,

104
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.210
you don't want to get eaten by those things.

105
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.880
You don't want them everywhere and you,
you,

106
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.590
you want to be able to go out and get your newspaper without being worried about

107
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:57.970
getting attacked by a Jaguar.
