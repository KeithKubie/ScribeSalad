00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:10.830
NARRATOR: November 17, 2015, a
team of researchers from North

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.380
Carolina State University
and Rice University

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.540
unveil the first
motor-driven submersible

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.040
nano-machines ever created.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.040
Molecular nanotechnology is
the idea of building devices,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.580
machines at a molecular scale.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.040
Nano refers to a billionth of
a meter so very, very small.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.580
We're getting down
to atomic scale.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.250
NARRATOR: Measuring
only 244 atoms across,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.080
these miniature
robots are designed

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.210
to deliver specialized
medicines throughout the body

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.040
using the bloodstream.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.080
Scientists have
created biobots

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.540
that are the first of its kind.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.420
These tiny little
biohybrid semi-bots are

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.790
capable of travelling
through viscus

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.580
material through our bodies.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.620
GRAY SCOTT: They take
submersible nano-machines

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.790
that can be controlled
with UV light.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.460
And using the UV light,
they can control where

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.420
these nano-machines
take nutrients

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.790
and take medicines
into the body.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.290
KEVIN WARWICK: As long as we
have a way of controlling them

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.040
from the outside, they can
move around very, very quickly,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.750
perform a function.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.460
If we're looking at operating
on a cancer, then potentially

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.880
they could do that operation
for you from within.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.460
DAVID WILCOCK: This could lead
to huge advances in medicine,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.330
in healing, leading
to nano-machines

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.500
that could actually heal
the wounds in our bodies,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.670
close things up much faster,
repair damaged tissue,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.170
extend our lifespan,
and literally

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.670
bring us into a new
level of human evolution.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.920
NARRATOR: Transhumanists
believe our bodies will soon

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.120
be home to swarms
of nano-machines

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.830
that will both heal and
also warn of disease.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.290
And some propose this technology
is advancing so rapidly that it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.710
will not just be future
generations that will live tens

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.000
or even hundreds of years longer
but people who are alive today.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.540
GREGORY STOCK: The possibility
of reversing human aging,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.040
as opposed to just
slowing it down,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.040
is not a very big stretch.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.040
So if you understand
aging and the fundamentals

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.380
of the processes that
are leading to it,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.830
it would be quite
possible both to slow it,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.960
and it would also be
possible to reverse it.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.120
GRAY SCOTT: An example
of this is a study

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.000
that has gone on at Harvard.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.830
By reversing the
muscle tissue in mice,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.000
we have actually reversed
the age in these mice.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And so if we can do that
in the laboratory setting,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.710
it's only a matter of time
before we're able to reverse

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.830
our own aging process.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.250
NARRATOR: Could millions
of microscopic robots

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.830
soon be swimming in our
bloodstreams, augmenting

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.420
our immune system,
and even reversing

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.040
the aging process entirely
as transhumanists believe?

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.210
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.250
that if such a
transformation does occur,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.080
it may be a sign that we
are evolving to become

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.460
more like our alien ancestors.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.290
As evidence, they point to the
Sumerian King List, a series

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.540
of stone tablets that are
believed to be over 4,000 years

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.210
old and record the reigns of
ancient Mesopotamian kings

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.580
that ruled for upwards
of 43,000 years.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.290
WILLIAM HENRY: The Sumerian
Kings List was handed

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.120
down to humanity by the gods.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.790
What's extraordinary is that
the reigns of these kings

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.120
last into the
thousands of years.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.080
These people weren't
making allegorical

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.420
or metaphorical statements.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.580
These were accurate
historical records.
